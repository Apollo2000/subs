2
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,561
They found us again.

3
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,816
Another one has found us.

4
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,069
We have to go further.

5
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,452
Not yet.

6
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,367
- Mr. Crockett?
- Yes.

7
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,237
My name is Mears. Ben Mears.

8
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,030
I'm looking for a place to rent.

9
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,916
- Hmm. For how long?
- Ah, six months maybe.

10
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,410
- Family?
- No.

11
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,206
- Furnished?
- Yes.

12
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,087
I can't think of any.

13
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,757
- How about that house on the hill?
- Which house?

14
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,839
- The one as you come into town.
- The Marsten House?

15
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,677
- Is that for sale or rent?
- It's sold.

16
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,010
I can't think of anything, not offhand.

17
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,470
You might try Eva Miller's boarding house.

18
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,014
It's real nice.

19
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,639
It's on Railroad Street.

20
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,437
- You go...
- Yeah, I remember.

21
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,856
- You remember?
- Thank you very much.

22
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,700
Funny about the Marsten House.

23
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,327
Vacant over 20 years.

24
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,751
Uh, Cully's going to Portland tomorrow.

25
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,538
Good afternoon, Mr. Crockett.

26
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,086
You sure fixed it up.

27
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,371
You think so?

28
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,581
You like it?

29
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,463
Fine job.

30
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,420
Sure a lot different
from that doctor's office I sold you.

31
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,923
I'd have to agree with you.

32
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,843
Very tasteful. Very tasteful.

33
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,352
Yes?

34
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,430
Thank you.

35
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,941
Mr. Barlow, um...

36
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,602
Will arrive. Soon.

37
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,112
A lot of people have been waiting.

38
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,489
For Mr. Barlow.

39
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,362
You know how it is with a small town.

40
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,402
People don't have that much to do.

41
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,788
Ah, yes, well,
I can assure you that people

42
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,167
will find Mr. Barlow well worth the wait.

43
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,213
Especially you, Mr. Crockett. I've told
him already how helpful you've been.

44
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,501
Getting us the house and the store.

45
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,469
Oh, yes.

46
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,676
Oh, yes.

47
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,982
Are you a writer?

48
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,604
- Yes.
- What do you write?

49
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,614
- Books.
- Have I read any?

50
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,488
- Have you read any books?
- Your books.

51
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,160
I don't know.

52
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,824
How do I get breakfast?

53
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,211
Oh, the kitchen's open to one and all.
Just keep your things stored separate.

54
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,294
- Uh, do you work at night?
- Sometimes.

55
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,964
- Well, you can't work too late, because...
- I won't.

56
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,347
- Well, I hope you like it.
- I'm sure I will.

57
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,728
- How come you came here?
- Real estate man sent me.

58
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,935
Uh, no, I mean to Salem's Lot.

59
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,897
Strangers don't usually come here
this time of year. Not yet.

60
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,023
I'm not a stranger.

61
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,401
That's no way to leave a book.

62
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,408
You know, a book like that,
you're gonna break the binding.

63
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,193
It's you, isn't it?

64
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,081
It is you.

65
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,749
People ought to respect a book.

66
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,376
Even if it isn't especially well written.

67
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,920
- It's well written.
- Do you mind if I sit down?

68
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,423
No, not at all.

69
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,177
Why did you call it Air Dancer?

70
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,676
Did you read the book?

71
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,182
Well, no, not all of it, um...

72
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,064
In fact, I was just getting into it.

73
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,017
- In fact...
- In fact, you got bored.

74
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,694
No, not in fact.

75
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,609
I just, um...

76
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,608
Wanted to finish this first.

77
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,985
- I'm gonna read it.
- Oh, you don't have to.

78
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,787
Wait, what's your name?

79
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,661
Susan Norton.

80
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,036
I teach art at Holly Elementary.

81
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,960
My father's a doctor in town.

82
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,422
You know, the reason that I, um, actually
took your book out of the library

83
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,217
is because I read your other one.

84
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,140
- Title?
- I don't remember.

85
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,722
Do you want to have some dinner?

86
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,150
- No, you got a boyfriend.
- Um...

87
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,269
Well, not exactly.

88
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,990
It says here you're married, no children.

89
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,487
- Still married, still no children?
- Ah...

90
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,240
She died. I got no children.

91
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,038
I got some memories. Some of them good,
some of them not so good.

92
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,037
You didn't answer my question.

93
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,914
- Which one was that?
- Dinner.

94
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,665
I'd love to.

95
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,906
Good evening.

96
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,626
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

97
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,594
And, uh, tomorrow night.

98
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,673
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?

99
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,309
Look, he's got to
make a delivery and a pickup.

100
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,432
Besides, he always calls.

101
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,062
You know that.

102
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,724
Good night, honey.

103
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,206
Weasel.

104
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,794
What are you doing out here, Weasel?

105
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,049
Sitting.

106
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,461
Spying more like, huh?

107
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,130
- Oh, no, Parkins.
- Cully set you to it?

108
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,015
No, no, no.

109
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,894
Better not.

110
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,563
That, uh...

111
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,237
- That writer who moved into Eva's...
- Yeah.

112
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,110
- Right down the hall.
- I heard.

113
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,781
Can you, uh...

114
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,578
Can you keep an eye on him?

115
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,532
Well, what's he done?

116
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,331
Keep your eye on him and your mouth shut.

117
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,792
- You got that?
- What's he done?

118
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,715
Murdered 18 people.

119
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,929
18 people?

120
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,137
Every one of them
an old man who kept asking,

121
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,968
"What's he done?"

122
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,346
Oh...

123
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,735
Keep an eye on him for me, huh?

124
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,149
There, Faithful.

125
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,781
Hi, honey.

126
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,505
What are you watching?

127
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,881
Nothing.

128
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,342
Wanna stay home tonight?

129
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,259
Sure, why not?

130
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,887
Well, don't get drunk.

131
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,892
I want some fun in tonight.

132
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,399
You know what happens
when you drink too much.

133
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,193
I'm gonna get something
out of the freezer.

134
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,990
- Twenty minutes?
- Hey...

135
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,409
Bring me a beer.

136
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,875
Mmm.

137
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,590
Thank you.

138
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,919
So, you're staying at Eva Miller's?

139
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,384
I don't mind telling you,
she was quite a dish.

140
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,015
We kids used to watch her
sashaying down the street.

141
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,721
- Bill.
- Well, we did.

142
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,470
- Men.
- Men.

143
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,732
- Would you like some coffee, Mr. Mears?
- Oh yes, please.

144
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,351
- How do you take it, Ben?
- Black.

145
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,441
- Dad?
- You know what I think of caffeine.

146
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,527
- And you still drink coffee.
- Mornings only, and I don't recommend it.

147
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,323
Yeah, Eva married this fellow
called Weasel Phillips.

148
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,738
And he came up to about here on her.

149
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,165
Thin as a heron's leg.
Smelled like a skunk.

150
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,204
Never made a decent living.
Nobody could figure out why.

151
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,577
They got divorced,
but he's still living over there.

152
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,371
Life in a small town.

153
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,756
What's his book about?

154
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,465
Well, his latest one, it's about, um...

155
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,588
Two men.

156
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,512
Not one of those?

157
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,103
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing, Eva, nothing.

158
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,063
- What's that?
- Just a piece of paper, Eva.

159
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,488
Nothing on it. Just paper.

160
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,944
He got a lot of scribbling here, too.

161
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:02,335
- Something about a boy...
- A boy and a house.

162
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:08,042
"The house was a monument to evil,
sitting there all these years,

163
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,345
"holding the essence of evil
in its smoldering bones."

164
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,382
Monument? Whose monument?

165
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,802
The Marsten House?

166
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,224
I don't know.
He stopped in the middle of a sentence.

167
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:26,563
"Sitting there all these years,
holding the essence of evil."

168
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,317
Writes real good.

169
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,115
- Thank you very much for the dinner.
- Good to meet you, Mr. Mears.

170
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,198
- I'll get you a copy of that book.
- Sorry about the peas. She's done better.

171
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,620
Goodbye, Dad.

172
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,801
Well...

173
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,424
They liked you.

174
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,181
Well, your father, maybe.

175
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,681
My mother doesn't like anyone
except Ned Tebbets.

176
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,685
- And, who's he?
- Oh, someone I've been seeing.

177
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,313
- Have been or had been?
- Mmm, a little of both.

178
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,526
What is he really doing in Salem's Lot?

179
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,487
Writing a book, he says.

180
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,158
- Did he say about what?
- No, he didn't say, and I didn't ask him.

181
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,631
So, uh, tell me about Ned Tibbit.

182
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,131
Tebbets.

183
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,470
- After college?
- New York.

184
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,974
I worked in an ad agency.

185
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,729
I was a junior.
I did layouts mostly, things like that.

186
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,151
- You like it?
- I loved it.

187
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,945
But then, something happened,
the agency lost a big account,

188
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,404
and had to cut back,

189
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,582
and, all of a sudden there I was,
out on the street looking for a job.

190
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,248
It's a cruel city.

191
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,584
- Anyway, finally...
- You had to come home.

192
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,124
Retreat.

193
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,135
Sanctuary. I was all beat up.

194
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,592
I was glad to have a little loving care.

195
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,679
How long since, um, your wife died?

196
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,222
Two years.

197
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,019
- Is that what you're writing about?
- No, I'm...

198
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,523
I'm writing about a house.

199
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,408
A house?

200
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,203
- The Marsten House?
- The Marsten House.

201
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,198
I see.

202
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,581
No, I don't see.

203
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,958
Hey, uh, where are we going?

204
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:58,845
Well, there's the Dell,
the movies in Bangor.

205
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,590
And then there's the lake.

206
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,101
And where do you want to go?

207
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,144
Let's go to the lake.

208
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,371
Are you uncomfortable with me?

209
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,122
Why, should I be?

210
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:34,172
No, I just have a habit
of asking questions.

211
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,299
- Well, I have a habit of evading them.
- Perfect match.

212
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,839
I like you, Ben.

213
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:50,142
Modern, aggressive female,
partially liberated, states her feelings.

214
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,399
- Well...
- Does that make you uncomfortable?

215
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,151
No, it makes me feel good.

216
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,065
How long will you be staying?

217
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,989
Oh, we'll see how the book comes.

218
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,784
- Are you a slow writer?
- I'm medium.

219
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,619
I hope it's a long book.

220
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,151
Crockett Realty.

221
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,982
Oh, yes, sir.

222
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,571
Yes.

223
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,028
Yes, sir, right away.

224
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,837
- I will be right back.
- Okay, honey.

225
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,382
Please don't say that.
Someday you'll forget.

226
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,293
All right, honey.

227
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:31,098
I forgot.

228
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,683
Getting warmer.

229
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,663
That's very good of you
to come over, Mr. Crockett.

230
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,164
I need your help again.

231
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,591
Always glad to be of assistance.

232
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,840
Yes, I appreciate that.

233
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,551
And, as I've told you,
you will be amply rewarded.

234
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:16,473
Now, I'd like you to have your truck
at the Portland docks tonight.

235
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:21,019
7:00 sharp, at the Custom House Wharf.

236
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,558
All arrangements have been made.

237
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,693
7:00, Custom House.

238
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,730
Two movers will be sufficient, I think.

239
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,987
Two men.

240
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,367
I have a very valuable, uh, sideboard,
a Hepplewhite,

241
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,826
that has to be picked up.

242
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,665
It's to be taken to the house.

243
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,200
You understand?

244
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,912
- Sideboard taken to house.
- Yes.

245
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,082
And your movers
will put it down in the cellar.

246
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,172
They can get in
through the outside bulkhead...

247
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,378
Uh, below the kitchen window, as you know.

248
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,092
You won't be there?

249
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,725
No, I must drive into Boston.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

250
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,599
And there's just one other thing.

251
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,099
You will procure four stout padlocks.

252
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,855
- Four?
- Mmm-hmm. Four.

253
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,947
And your men will leave the keys
for all four locks on the basement table.

254
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,072
And when they leave,
they will padlock the bulkhead door,

255
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,654
the front door, the back door
and the shed garage.

256
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,788
You have that?

257
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,286
I have it.

258
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,627
Thank you very much, Mr. Crockett.

259
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,627
I'm extremely pleased
that I can always call on you.

260
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,208
That you can.

261
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,345
And Mr. Barlow?

262
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,345
Oh, I've told you,
you should be meeting him soon.

263
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,928
Very soon, Mr. Crockett, and
I'm sure that he'll find it a pleasure.

264
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,921
1776.

265
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,588
The winds of revolt swept through
the township of Jerusalem's Lot,

266
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,669
soon to be known as Salem's Lot.

267
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,972
Down with the British. Hooray for freedom.

268
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,802
Men took out their long rifles,
kissed their wives and children goodbye,

269
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,512
and marched off to join George Washington.

270
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,855
Daddy, come back safe.

271
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,185
Daddy, let me come with you.
I'm old enough to fight.

272
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,522
I'll be back, but not until
we've won the right to be free men.

273
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,070
The war was long and bitter.

274
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,993
Some men from Salem's Lot
fought at Valley Forge,

275
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,621
suffering through that long, cold winter.

276
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,867
Others helped gain victory at Saratoga
and triumph over Cornwallis.

277
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,335
And when the war ended...

278
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,209
Where is Daddy? Won't he ever come home?

279
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,217
Yes, Salem's Lot had its share
of heroes, living and dead.

280
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,381
But they had fought for
the greatest treasure of all, liberty.

281
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:05,138
O beautiful for spacious skies

282
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,727
Mr. Burke.

283
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,983
Are the kids still running the pageant?

284
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,438
What?

285
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,992
Are the kids still running
the school pageant?

286
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,703
With a little editorial help from me.

287
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,830
Very little, as I remember.

288
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,617
My name is Ben Mears.
You probably don't remember me.

289
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:31,042
Oh, of course I do. I've read your books.

290
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,711
I wouldn't have written them
if it hadn't been for you.

291
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,712
Well, you just said a very large thing.

292
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,843
I'd like you to explain it.

293
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,059
- Can't we talk about it tonight?
- Oh, sure.

294
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:57,444
I don't know how you can work here.

295
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,866
- It'd scare the hell out of me.
- Oh.

296
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,277
It's kind of nice here.

297
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,954
During the day.

298
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,707
It's pretty and it's quiet, you know.

299
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,331
Too quiet, especially at night.

300
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,796
Well, I'm hardly ever here at night.

301
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,673
They are.

302
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,585
What's up?

303
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,300
I need a strong back tonight.

304
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,424
Want to make, uh, 50 bucks?

305
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,845
- Fifty bucks?
- That's for two of you.

306
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,680
You're gonna need another strong back.

307
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,564
- What about you?
- Me?

308
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,486
Yeah, I got something else
planned for tonight.

309
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,455
Hey there, teacher.
Can I carry your books for you?

310
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,413
Oh, uh...

311
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,245
- Sorry. I'll...
- No, that's all right.

312
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,830
Do you have your car with you?

313
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,999
No, I came by to see Jason Burke.

314
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,969
Thought I'd wait around for you.
Take a walk home.

315
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,384
- I won't do that again.
- Hey, come on.

316
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,721
Um, will you wait for me here, please?

317
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,027
- Get in.
- No.

318
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,247
- Susan...
- You have no right to do this.

319
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,832
You said you loved me.

320
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,039
- You'd said it.
- That was 100 years ago.

321
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,381
It has nothing to do with him.

322
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,794
So you were doing something
up at the lake.

323
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,463
Oh, please.

324
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,875
What time do you think
you'll get back home, honey?

325
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,173
Well, with all the junking around,
locking up,

326
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,798
those things take, uh, five, six hours.

327
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,258
Be back midnight or after.

328
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,102
You stay away from her, you hear?

329
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,892
I'll try.

330
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,912
You try real hard.

331
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,942
She's all mine, right, honey?

332
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,862
You big, bad bear, go on.

333
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,755
He was just kidding.

334
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:06,782
Look, if he suspected anything,
would he kid?

335
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,470
Cully.

336
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,890
You know, you shouldn't
leave your truck double-parked like this.

337
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,227
Now, you wouldn't want me
to go all the way to Portland

338
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,147
without saying goodbye to Bonnie,
would you?

339
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,644
What's in Portland?

340
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,107
Gotta make a pickup for him.

341
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,317
Custom Wharf.

342
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,819
You know what it is?

343
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,164
A lot of old junk from Europe, I guess.

344
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,124
Don't know why anybody would
wanna open an antique shop here.

345
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,705
- You?
- I guess they know what they're doing.

346
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,007
Don't leave the truck sitting here
like this, huh?

347
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,462
I might have to ticket you.

348
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,558
I'll be back to get you.

349
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:43,313
Come on now, Faith, just calm down.
I'll be back soon.

350
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,155
Go play with the people.

351
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,661
Wouldn't leave a dog in there.

352
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,785
Oh, he's all right.
He'll go to sleep in a while.

353
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,165
He's a good old dog.

354
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,827
Faithful, come on.

355
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,745
I said I'd be back soon.

356
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,523
- Is that dog gonna whine all night?
- He'll be all right.

357
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,813
- You know where to go, what to do?
- Sure.

358
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,854
Uh...

359
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,198
Leave the truck here when you get back.
I'll pick it up in the morning.

360
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,824
You betcha.

361
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,501
Shut up!

362
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,012
What's this all about anyway?
You got any idea?

363
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,634
He wants Boom-Boom Bonnie
to think he's going to Portland.

364
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,970
As a matter of fact,

365
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,810
Crockett himself set up this trip.

366
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,815
Larry Crockett?

367
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,901
What's he got to do with this?

368
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,865
Larry Crockett and Boom-Boom Bonnie?

369
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,076
- What's he gonna do?
- Well...

370
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,376
What would you do if you had
a 12-gauge sitting in your garage?

371
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,134
Jason.

372
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,262
- Have a drink?
- I don't mind.

373
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,098
Uh, Canadian on the rocks.

374
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,310
- Mmm. Got us a native, huh?
- That's what he is.

375
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,145
Return of the native.

376
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,810
Or is it the prodigal son?

377
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,840
I got it, I got it.

378
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,768
- This way.
- All right, all right.

379
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,777
Oh, what did you say was in this?

380
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,027
- A sideboard.
- Man...

381
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,200
Sideboard.

382
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,781
You know...

383
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:28,538
It's funny, this crate feels very cold.

384
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,084
Well, it's been sitting out here.

385
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,499
I don't like it.

386
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,212
I mean, it's really strange.
It feels cold.

387
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,089
Well, why don't you pry?
You wanna pry it open?

388
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,641
- You wanna pry it open?
- No.

389
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,724
- Let's move it out, fellas.
- All right, we're going.

390
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,306
- Do you want to pry it open?
- No, no.

391
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,816
Let's just get it to the Marsten place.

392
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,195
Get rid of it.

393
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,738
Hell of a way to make 50 bucks.

394
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,093
- It's cold in here.
- Yeah.

395
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,972
It sure is. It shouldn't be.

396
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,399
It's a warm night. Turn on the heater.

397
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,550
Hey, that thing is moving.

398
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,716
Moving?

399
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,565
- Watch the road.
- Stop the truck.

400
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,652
- We should open the thing up.
- We can't do that.

401
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,988
But something's wrong.
It's getting cold in here.

402
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,116
- Let's just get it delivered.
- I want to open it.

403
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,567
Come on!

404
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,075
Man, just let me drive, will you?

405
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,632
Honey, it's safe.

406
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,388
Oh, Tiger, I'm gonna lose respect for you.

407
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,432
No.

408
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,980
Well, I don't wanna go to a motel again.

409
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,281
I want you right here
in my own little bed.

410
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,534
It's more exciting to me that way.

411
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,078
No.

412
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,202
No, I'm not gonna
talk like that on the phone.

413
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,128
You just get over here, and I'll
whisper things in your pearly little ear

414
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,455
that'll make your hair stand up.

415
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,380
You get here, or else...

416
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,644
1951.

417
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,273
A fire started in the old mill.

418
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,654
It spread rapidly
on both sides of Griffin Road

419
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,491
and burned toward the Marsten House
on Pabscuitti Hill.

420
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,161
1951.

421
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,826
A fire started in the old mill.

422
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,500
It spread rapidly
on both sides of Griffin Road

423
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,332
and burned toward the Marsten House
on Pabscuitti Hill.

424
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,669
The wind turned the fire back toward town.

425
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,966
Volunteer fire companies came from all...

426
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,175
Mark?

427
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,682
Whatever are you doing?

428
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,355
Rehearsing for the pageant.

429
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,765
Well, keep it down.

430
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,017
Your father's trying
to figure his quarterly taxes.

431
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,152
All right. Oh, Mother, uh...

432
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,023
Danny and Ralphie Glick are coming over
after they finish their homework.

433
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,232
We're going to rehearse.

434
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,901
Have you finished your homework?

435
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,198
- Oh yes, a long time ago.
- All right.

436
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,907
Just as long as you and the Glick boys
don't disturb your father.

437
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,709
"The Marsten House on Pabscuitti Hill."

438
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,548
The wind turned the fire back toward town.

439
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,144
Volunteer fire companies
came from all over the county

440
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,730
to help fight the threatening flames.

441
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,432
Bright boy, Mark Petrie.

442
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,101
Wrote most of the pageant this year,
just as you did.

443
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,986
- Both talented.
- Another writer, huh?

444
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,445
Very possibly.

445
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,573
I'd certainly be proud
if I'd helped develop two authors.

446
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,909
Make a lifetime of teaching worthwhile.

447
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,696
- Well, you got me started.
- You had the gift.

448
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,325
I wanted the opportunity to continue,
but, you moved away.

449
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,789
- Let's see, you were...
- Eleven.

450
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,203
Mmm.

451
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,540
Tell me, why the Marsten House?

452
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,126
I remember that figured
in your pageant, too.

453
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,347
- Maybe because my aunt worked there.
- Hmm.

454
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,143
Did she ever tell you anything
about what went on inside the house?

455
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,937
No, never.

456
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,269
Or Hubie Marsten?

457
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,354
No, she never talked about him.

458
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,657
But you remember that even then

459
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,994
that house had a reputation
for being a haunted house.

460
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,704
Every town has one.

461
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,286
I went up there once.

462
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,247
On a dare. You know how kids are.

463
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,628
I was sweating scared.

464
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,305
I sneaked around.

465
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,967
Got into the house.

466
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,104
What did you see?

467
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,145
Ghosts.

468
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,685
Everything. Every sound.

469
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,316
Every shadow.

470
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,150
I'm not sure what I saw. I, uh...

471
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,329
I think I saw Hubie Marsten,

472
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,415
hanging by his neck.

473
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,540
His face green, his eyes puffed shut,

474
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,714
his hands livid.

475
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,176
It was ghastly.

476
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,306
And then he opened his eyes,
and he looked at me.

477
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,099
He looked at me.

478
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,470
And I took off. And I ran.
I ran as fast as I could.

479
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,931
I've never forgotten that.

480
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,566
There was something. A feeling of...

481
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,489
Jason, do you believe a thing
can be inherently evil?

482
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,073
I've seen trees
that looked like tortured spirits.

483
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,824
A house?

484
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,077
The Marsten House, for instance?

485
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,461
Can it be evil in its stone foundations,
in its wooden beams,

486
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,594
in the glass of its windows,
in the plaster of its ceilings, evil?

487
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,346
The man who built that house...

488
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,010
Yeah, Joshua Vaughn.

489
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,055
Killed his wife and a servant.

490
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,803
And hanged himself in his bedroom closet.

491
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,773
Hubie Marsten's sister and wife

492
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,976
died mysteriously.

493
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,069
Rumors of poison, never proved.

494
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,114
Then he came here.

495
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,569
And the young boys in the area
started to disappear.

496
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:07,242
Some people suspected Hubie Marsten,
but it was never proved.

497
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,043
Never proved.

498
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,997
And now we have a Mr. Straker.

499
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,880
- And a Mr. Barlow.
- Who no one has ever seen.

500
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,758
- And, you think...
- I think...

501
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,466
That an evil house attracts evil men.

502
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,314
But, if a house attracts evil men...

503
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,566
Why did it attract me?

504
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,045
It is moving.

505
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,463
- Look at it!
- We're almost there. Now, shut up.

506
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,594
Shut up!

507
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,305
What's this one?

508
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,182
It's a ghoul.

509
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,517
Girl?

510
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,145
"Ghoul," like in "school."

511
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,818
We don't have anybody like that
in our school.

512
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,186
Oh, Mr. Peterson.

513
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,981
What is a ghoul?

514
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,818
A ghoul is an evil demon who, uh...

515
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,613
He preys on corpses,
feeds on human beings,

516
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,289
robs graves, things like that.

517
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,163
Why are you so hung up on this stuff?

518
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,915
I don't know, I just am.

519
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,835
- It's weird.
- Let's try this again.

520
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,125
Danny, Ralphie, your mom called.
Wants you home.

521
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,501
Okay, Mr. Petrie.

522
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,469
We know our lines okay, don't we?

523
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:44,763
Most of them.

524
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,680
Well, why don't you come over
to our house tomorrow night, okay?

525
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,180
- Okay, Mr. Petrie?
- Sure.

526
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:50,602
- See you later, Mark.
- Bye-bye.

527
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,601
- Bye, Mr. Petrie.
- Good night, boys.

528
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:56,983
Mark.

529
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,186
When are you gonna outgrow all this?

530
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,609
Soon, I guess.

531
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,324
Well, I... I'd better fix this.

532
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,823
Well? Look.

533
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,987
The road.

534
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,198
The road nothing.

535
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,619
It sure is cold.
Come on, let's get it done.

536
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:06,879
It's freezing!

537
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,768
Look, I'm telling you, it's not natural.
It just ain't natural.

538
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,849
We gotta get it out.

539
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,894
Let's just grab ahold. Let's get it done.

540
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,776
What was that?

541
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,527
It's just an owl.

542
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,655
I never heard one before.

543
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,490
Sure you have,
hundreds of times, millions.

544
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,544
- We shouldn't have gone through the woods.
- It's a shortcut.

545
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,831
Look, you can even see
the lights of Jordan Avenue. See them?

546
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,134
- No.
- Hey, I'm going.

547
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,514
Wait. Danny, wait!

548
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,037
Hey, I want to know.

549
00:51:57,046 --> 00:52:00,872
- Come on. Come on.
- I want to pry it open.

550
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,204
We can't. He'll hear.

551
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,547
- Who?
- Him.

552
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,710
Straker.

553
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,005
Well, I want to do it anyway.

554
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,932
I'll get something from the truck.

555
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:44,958
Listen.

556
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,669
You hear that?

557
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,423
Somebody's up there.

558
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,590
There's somebody up there.

559
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,324
Rats, probably. You heard rats.

560
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,660
It was someone. Let's split.

561
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,420
- Wait, we forgot to padlock the door...
- Throw them down there.

562
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,130
Here are the keys. Throw them down, too.

563
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,133
Close the doors!

564
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,684
Did you happen to notice the time
when the boys left?

565
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,477
Oh, you did?

566
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,022
Well, then they should have
been here half an hour ago.

567
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,530
Ask Mark if the boys said anything to him.
You know how kids are.

568
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,832
Henry!

569
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,675
Danny. Danny, what happened?

570
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,549
- What happened, son?
- Where's Ralphie?

571
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,760
- Ralph...
- Where's your brother?

572
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,262
I don't know.

573
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,230
Get Dr. Norton.

574
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,627
- See you.
- Yeah.

575
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,267
Faithful.

576
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,354
Here, boy.

577
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,362
Faithful?

578
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,146
Kiss me.

579
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,399
Come here.

580
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,519
That's good.

581
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,737
Isn't that better?

582
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,868
That's good.

583
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,953
It's better here, isn't it?

584
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,535
Well, well, well.

585
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,785
- Cully.
- Cully.

586
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,505
I guess I owe Weasel Phillips
a case of beer after all.

587
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,789
Cully, look, this isn't...

588
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,336
- He broke in and he tried to rape me.
- He was?

589
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,426
- He broke in.
- A rapist?

590
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,469
- Is that it?
- Cully. Cully.

591
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,966
I'll take care of him.

592
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,763
- I didn't...
- Shut up, rapist.

593
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,060
- Cully, listen.
- Get up.

594
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,893
Out of the bed. Out. Out of the bed. Out.

595
00:59:20,915 --> 00:59:22,583
Cully!

596
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,108
- Cully.
- Get up.

597
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,773
- Cully.
- Shut up!

598
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,191
Listen, Cully...

599
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,327
Please. Please don't do anything.
You don't want to go to jail, do you?

600
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,703
I'm not going to jail
for killing the man who raped my wife.

601
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,662
That is what he did, isn't it, honey?

602
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,167
- Yes.
- No!

603
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,665
- She invited me, I swear.
- No! Cully. No.

604
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:46,917
- You invited him?
- Yes.

605
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:51,013
No! He called me, and he said
that he had to talk to me, and...

606
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,718
- So, you invited him over?
- No!

607
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,258
Cully, no.

608
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:58,512
Cully, look, you don't want to go to jail
for the rest of your life for what is a lie.

609
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,321
Come here.

610
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,192
Come on. Come on, in the living room.

611
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,324
- We've got to talk this over.
- Right, right. Let's talk it over.

612
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,712
We're gonna go in the living room,
and we're gonna talk it over.

613
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,208
And then I'm coming back, hear me?

614
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,214
Come on, Larry.

615
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,182
In the living room. Man-to-man stuff.

616
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,056
Oh, I like your shorts.

617
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,224
You must, too, keeping them on like that.

618
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,028
- Where did you get them?
- Boston.

619
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,070
Sure look good on you.

620
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,077
Stay right there, puss.

621
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,917
Turn around, Larry.

622
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,294
Look, I know how this must look to you.

623
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:15,760
I can understand how upset you are,
but let me explain what happened.

624
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,804
- You see...
- Now, grab the barrel, Larry.

625
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,515
- Huh?
- Barrel. Grab the barrel.

626
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:21,936
Easy!

627
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,141
Very easy.

628
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:31,776
That's it.

629
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,783
Now, this shotgun's got
a five-pound pull on it,

630
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,951
and I've got about three on it now.

631
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,406
Good boy.

632
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,995
Now hold it up in front of your face.

633
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,338
That's it, right in front.

634
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,466
That's it, right in front.

635
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,682
Careful.

636
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,189
You move that barrel, Larry,
and I'll blow you away.

637
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,649
Good.

638
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,977
Good.

639
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,733
And, now...

640
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,490
Just hold it, Larry.

641
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,030
Hold it steady.

642
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,947
Steady, Larry. Don't move! Don't move!

643
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:24,370
There.

644
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,327
You see how much self-control
you can have?

645
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,666
It's terrific.

646
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:33,046
You're doing fine, Larry, just fine.

647
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,755
Now, close your eyes, Larry.

648
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,675
Close them.

649
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,953
Here I come, puss.

650
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:09,203
Here comes big, bad bear.

651
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,226
I know you're gonna say, um,
"Don't make a big thing out of this."

652
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:34,986
No, I wasn't gonna say that.

653
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,073
Maybe, uh...

654
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:43,241
"Look, I can't make
any commitments right now."

655
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:45,702
I wasn't gonna say that either.

656
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,749
What were you gonna say?

657
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,916
I wasn't gonna say anything.

658
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,250
Okay?

659
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,506
Told you I ask too many questions.

660
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,555
And I don't give enough answers.

661
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,758
Maybe we talk too much.

662
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,972
Maybe we do.

663
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,112
Sounds like a traffic jam.

664
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,537
Maybe they saw our car.

665
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,207
I'm gonna go take a look.

666
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,623
Crockett?

667
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,373
Crockett? Crockett?

668
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,829
You heard another car drive off. Then?

669
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,328
A car or a truck.

670
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:02,996
Which one?

671
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,632
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

672
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,002
Do you?

673
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,171
No.

674
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,057
Where were you people?

675
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,847
We were over there.

676
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,013
Over there?

677
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,100
- Parkins.
- Yeah?

678
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,734
Come here, will you?

679
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,583
Okay, okay, okay.

680
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,789
- You heard two cars.
- Or a car and a truck.

681
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,754
One drove off, huh? And then?

682
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,001
Oh, one more thing.

683
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,846
I think I heard someone
get out of one car.

684
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,052
I'm only supposing that
'cause I didn't see it.

685
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,763
And get in the other car. Or truck.

686
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,886
That's what I think.

687
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,304
That's what you think?

688
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,860
Quite a night, huh?

689
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,368
First a kid disappears, then this.

690
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,205
You're not leaving Salem's Lot, are you?

691
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,415
I'm not leaving.

692
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,122
Don't.

693
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,098
- It's late.
- Where are you going?

694
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,066
To the hospital.
Danny Glick has collapsed.

695
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,060
What?

696
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:55,234
Ralphie Glick, Danny and Larry Crockett,
all in one night?

697
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,780
Quiet little town of Salem's Lot.

698
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,742
Well, it's only all just happened since...

699
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,124
Since I came here.

700
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,172
Well, you didn't have
anything to do with it.

701
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:13,339
I mean, you didn't even
know the Glick boys, or Larry Crockett.

702
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,303
I met Larry Crockett.

703
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,051
I did see the boys
rehearsing a school play.

704
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,675
That's not what I'm thinking.

705
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,599
You remember I came here
to rent the Marsten House?

706
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:24,846
Yeah.

707
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,515
Somehow, I...

708
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,526
I think that my coming here
has acted as a kind of catalyst.

709
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,357
Awakened an evil in this town.

710
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,321
- Oh, that's...
- Nonsense?

711
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,203
How is he?

712
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,160
Um...

713
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,502
Danny's never
had an attack of asthma, has he?

714
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,418
- No.
- His file's with Dr. Goldring.

715
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,343
All right. I'll get the file
from Goldring.

716
01:10:56,627 --> 01:11:00,427
But, for now, um,
any history of rheumatic fever?

717
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,222
Danny? No.

718
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,313
He's a healthy boy. No major problems.

719
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:12,105
Has he had a TB skin patch this year?

720
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,816
TB? Danny's got TB?

721
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,569
No, no. Marjorie,
we're just trying to find out.

722
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,574
He's a healthy boy. He's athletic.
He's a normal boy.

723
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,322
All right, well...

724
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,829
We want to keep him here
for some more tests.

725
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:29,994
What tests?

726
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,456
We just don't know yet.

727
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,586
Faithful?

728
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,300
Royal, you seen my dog?

729
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:42,048
No, I ain't seen him.

730
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,396
Faithful!

731
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,184
Faithful...

732
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:11,081
Nolly, have two men cover this area.

733
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,627
Come on, move it. Let's go.

734
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,469
That's it, that's it.

735
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,846
Don't touch that.

736
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,806
Nolly, get me an envelope!

737
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,326
He always wears a black suit.

738
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,610
Who?

739
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:46,992
Straker.

740
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,381
Inspector.

741
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,055
How nice of you to drop in.

742
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,603
Plain old constable.

743
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,940
I see you're just about ready to open.

744
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,606
Not quite. Just about.

745
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,942
Everything in?

746
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,899
Everything that's important, yes.

747
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,156
Coffee? Tea?

748
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,283
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

749
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,823
No, thanks.

750
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,991
Never drink on duty?

751
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,001
You are on duty?

752
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,621
I'm always on duty.

753
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,967
Hmm, that makes me feel safe and snug.

754
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,889
Mr. Barlow arrived yet?

755
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,217
Mr. Barlow is in New York.

756
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,260
Coming soon?

757
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,389
Hard to tell. He may go to Europe
on a buying trip.

758
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,433
So, you'll be opening without him.

759
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:59,068
If necessary, yes, of course.

760
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,530
What's Mr. Barlow's first name,
by the way?

761
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,197
Official question?

762
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,701
No, just curious.

763
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,574
My partner's full name is Kurt Barlow.

764
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,200
Kurt with a K.

765
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:18,247
We've been working together in London
and Hamburg. This is our retirement.

766
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,043
Modest, comfortable.

767
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:23,217
We're hoping to build
a reputation for ourselves in this area,

768
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,429
perhaps throughout New England.
You think that's possible, Constable?

769
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:27,880
Anything's possible.

770
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:31,267
- How do you like that old house?
- Needs work.

771
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,436
But we have time.

772
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,683
Not bothered by yowens?

773
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,436
Yowens?

774
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,937
Kids. Local word.

775
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,231
You know how kids like to devil new folks.

776
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,113
Oh, no. No children. No.

777
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,950
We seem to have misplaced one.

778
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,576
Is that so?

779
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,162
Yes. Yes, it is so.

780
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,788
The thinking now is that
we may not find him. Not alive.

781
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:00,171
Oh, that's a shame.
Is there anything I can do to help you?

782
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,249
I don't suppose so.

783
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,424
By the way,
what happened to your black suit?

784
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,595
- My black suit?
- The one that I always see you wear.

785
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,516
I have two black suits.
They're up at the house.

786
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,524
- Am I breaking some town ordinance?
- No.

787
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,101
I'd like to see those suits.

788
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,857
Could we go to the house and get them?

789
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:27,486
I'll bring them down tomorrow.
They need cleaning anyway.

790
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,282
Any reason?

791
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,277
Some.

792
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:35,869
Bye.

793
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,492
Ciao, Constable.

794
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,790
- Ciao?
- Ciao.

795
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,547
That's a familiar Italian expression
meaning goodbye.

796
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,294
- I didn't know you were Italian.
- I'm not. The word is.

797
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,296
Well, you learn something new every day.

798
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,718
Mmm-hmm.

799
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,061
No, no. It's not a kidnap.

800
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,025
The boy is missing.

801
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,069
Probable foul play.

802
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:08,155
Yeah, I'd like to
check out a couple of feelers.

803
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:11,234
First is a Benjamin Mears.

804
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,450
Uh, M-E-A-R-S.

805
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,827
Writer.

806
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,326
Yeah, the book's called Air Dance.

807
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,040
And the other one is Conway's Daughter.

808
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,797
What?

809
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,043
No, I haven't read them.
Don't know if many have.

810
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,846
Yeah, the other two
are sort of stapled together.

811
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,307
There's a Richard K. Straker.

812
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,509
No, I don't know what that stands for.

813
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:40,350
And Kurt, with a K, Barlow.

814
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,521
S-T-R-A-K-E-R.

815
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:47,437
And B-A-R-L-O-W.

816
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:49,860
Yeah.

817
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,116
Any, uh, any connection
between Mears and the others?

818
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,824
That's one of the things I wanna find out.

819
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,283
I understand what you're saying, Ben.

820
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,828
I'm not given to unscientific belief,

821
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,038
but I will admit that
there are a great many things

822
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,624
that science hasn't as yet answered.

823
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,083
If ever.

824
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,049
But, I can't, for the life of me,
understand any connection

825
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,262
between Larry Crockett's death
and the Marsten House.

826
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:15,927
He rented the house to them.

827
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,513
- But he died of a heart attack.
- You're sure of that?

828
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,931
Absolutely.

829
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,142
The autopsy left
no doubt whatsoever, none.

830
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,733
It could've happened at the Marsten House
and he was taken to the lake.

831
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,068
Yes, well, it...

832
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:32,191
Let me tell you, the local gossip
leans in a different direction.

833
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,654
All right, what about the Glick boys?

834
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,073
That could be something else.

835
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,079
What is wrong with Danny Glick?

836
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,329
We haven't completed our tests yet.
But, it could be...

837
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,794
And I'm trusting you
to keep this to yourself.

838
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,921
It could be pernicious anemia.

839
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,544
Coming on overnight?

840
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,588
We don't know how sudden it is.

841
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,591
- You don't really believe that?
- Ready?

842
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,257
- Yeah.
- We're going to the movies in Bangor.

843
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:02,345
Uh, Ben, could I say something to you?

844
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,059
- Don't make it too long, Dad, okay?
- Sure.

845
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,111
Now, everybody knows
that you and Susan were up at the lake.

846
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,697
Yeah... Look, I want you to know...

847
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,616
Now, you seem
like a pretty nice fella to me.

848
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,789
And I think you respect Susan,
and I believe she respects herself.

849
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,625
But you could've been
a little more discreet, right?

850
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,536
Yeah.

851
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,866
When may I expect them back?

852
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,415
A couple of days.

853
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,785
No more than that, please.

854
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:19,578
I'll try.

855
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,880
I don't have to do this, you know.

856
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,666
I understand.

857
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,421
Appreciate it.

858
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,925
I'm under some suspicion?

859
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,508
Well, yes.

860
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,771
The disappearance of the boy.

861
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,435
Yes.

862
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,183
Because I'm a stranger.

863
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,361
- Guess so.
- And a little odd.

864
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,407
You know how we are here.

865
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:53,120
Ah, no different from people
in small towns all over the world.

866
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,122
I appreciate your candor.

867
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,163
Am I being charged?

868
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,620
No, but I'd like you to stay around.

869
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,960
I fully intend to.

870
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,505
Now, the suits...

871
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,062
Don't forget.

872
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,635
As soon as, um, crime lab...

873
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,184
FBI. In Bangor.

874
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:17,807
A-ha.

875
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:22,100
And, no damage, please.
I want them back in excellent condition.

876
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,400
And, um, cleaned.

877
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:26,436
I'll see to it.

878
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:30,650
Ciao. That's Italian for...

879
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,155
I remember.

880
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,740
Goodbye, Constable.

881
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,184
- You playing hooky?
- No.

882
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:34,316
This is my hour break
of which exactly 26 minutes is left.

883
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:35,907
Just wanted to say hello.

884
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,321
- Hello.
- Hello.

885
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:39,861
Mmm.

886
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,161
My father asked you to be discreet.

887
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,293
- Well, I didn't tell you that.
- No, he did.

888
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,875
Then he told me to go ahead
and show my feelings.

889
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,960
Yeah, well, the man contradicts himself.

890
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,375
Well, Dad's a New Englander.

891
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,549
He's been taught one thing
and feels another.

892
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,464
Classic conflict.

893
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,594
I have one, too.
I got a phone call this morning.

894
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,469
Ned?

895
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:06,597
Not that easy.

896
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,724
From Boston. Job interview.

897
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,525
They saw my portfolio.

898
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:13,153
- Oh!
- It'll only be for two days.

899
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:14,396
Hmm.

900
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,315
Oh, no, thanks. No, thanks.

901
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,116
So, it's off to Boston?

902
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,948
It's not that far.

903
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:22,654
Uh...

904
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,828
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow, after class.

905
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,205
Can you come with me?

906
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:32,878
Uh, Danny Glick's funeral's tomorrow.
I wanna stay for that.

907
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,383
- Why? You weren't...
- I just need to be there.

908
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:37,928
I wish you weren't going.

909
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,422
Me too.

910
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,506
I have to.

911
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,139
- Where are you staying?
- With a friend. Girlfriend.

912
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,226
- I'll give you the number if you like.
- Yeah, okay.

913
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,525
You know, it's only an interview.

914
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,486
If I got the job, I wouldn't have to start
till the end of June sometime.

915
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:55,729
That's not so bad, is it?

916
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,648
Well, I guess it'll have to do.

917
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,258
Let us pray.

918
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:22,343
"Lord God, through your mercy,

919
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,096
"may those who have lived in faith
find eternal peace.

920
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:28,895
"Bless this grave
and send your angel to watch over it.

921
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,650
"As we bury the body of Danny Glick,
welcome him into your presence

922
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,400
"and with your saints,
let him rejoice in your presence forever.

923
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,024
"We ask it through Christ our Lord. Amen."

924
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,525
Amen.

925
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:45,495
"With faith in Jesus Christ,
"we reverently bring the body of this child

926
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,785
"to be buried in its human imperfection."

927
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,955
"Let us...

928
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:39,685
Have plans for tonight?

929
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:44,106
More or less. Susan's gone to Boston.

930
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:45,614
I heard.

931
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:48,656
Hope she gets it.

932
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:50,866
Do you?

933
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,243
Well, whatever's best.

934
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,188
Should I believe that?

935
01:30:57,159 --> 01:31:00,222
Not entirely,
but that's what I want to feel.

936
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,262
Royal?

937
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,306
Royal?

938
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,133
Everything's all right.

939
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,043
I'm glad I stayed.

940
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,053
How about the job?

941
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,673
Tomorrow?

942
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:59,055
So, uh...

943
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:01,511
So when are you coming home?

944
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,265
Friday.

945
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:08,977
Well, there's really
not much point, is there?

946
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:14,066
No. Tonight, I'm having dinner
with Jason Burke.

947
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,574
No, Jason. Just Jason and me.

948
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,664
Yeah.

949
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,750
I miss you, too.

950
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:27,458
Yeah.

951
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:30,965
Ben.

952
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:34,215
Ned Tebbets was around here today
fixing a toilet,

953
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,300
and threatening to fix you.

954
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:38,590
- Hey...
- I just thought I'd tell you.

955
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,760
You're a nice guy.
I'd hate to see you get all busted up.

956
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:43,846
Thanks.

957
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,715
Do you think it's affected him?

958
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:14,793
Well, you have talks with him.

959
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,961
Yes, but still, you never know.

960
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,130
He doesn't show it much.

961
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:20,973
I wonder why.

962
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:24,476
He's got to be feeling something.

963
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:27,810
I mean, after all, the Glick boys
were on their way home from seeing him.

964
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:30,566
Did you look at him at the funeral?

965
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:32,860
He keeps his feelings in hand.

966
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:39,408
I don't want him
going in the woods anymore.

967
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,078
I'll go up and see him.

968
01:35:51,037 --> 01:35:52,630
How are you, son?

969
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,711
Fine, Dad.

970
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:57,301
Finished your homework?

971
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,337
Long time ago.

972
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,932
Can you get out of these?

973
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,016
Easy. Put them on me.

974
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:13,018
Go ahead.

975
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:20,484
Let's see. Where's the key?

976
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,527
Oh, I don't need it.

977
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,702
- Not too tight?
- I want it tight.

978
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:32,461
Okay?

979
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,214
There.

980
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,583
What do you know?

981
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,170
- Here, want to tie me up?
- No, I don't think so.

982
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:43,306
I can get out of any knot. You can try me.
Hands behind the back.

983
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,807
Some other time, son.

984
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,805
You know, sometimes I wonder,

985
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:55,770
you know, why you're so interested
in monsters and magic and...

986
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,647
Why do you think that is, Mark?

987
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,072
I always have been.

988
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,737
I can't explain it. It's the way I am.

989
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:07,864
Mmm.

990
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:10,875
Like, you were interested in numbers,
so you became an accountant.

991
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:12,578
At least I can earn a living.

992
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,376
I'll earn a living.

993
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:18,834
Okay.

994
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,585
That's it?

995
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,220
Thanks. Hey, wait.

996
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,595
Uh...

997
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:28,894
Hi. Just had FBI Boston on the phone.

998
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:33,557
Rundown on Ben Mears, Straker and Barlow.

999
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:34,975
What'd they say?

1000
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:40,063
Straker is British by birth,

1001
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:41,697
58 years old.

1002
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:44,321
Applied extended visa 18 months ago.

1003
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:46,282
No criminal record at all.

1004
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,121
Barlow?

1005
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:51,290
Born, Germany.
Left in '20s, before Hitler.

1006
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,626
Naturalized British.

1007
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:56,163
Changed his name from Breichen.

1008
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,840
- Anything else?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

1009
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:04,088
Uh, been in the import-export business
with Straker since 1943.

1010
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,093
He travels alone

1011
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,349
but seems to keep to himself.

1012
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:10,301
Straker's the one who stays in front.

1013
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:12,015
- He shown up yet?
- Barlow?

1014
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:13,851
- Yeah.
- No.

1015
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:15,356
What about Mears?

1016
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:16,516
Mmm.

1017
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,148
- Mears.
- Yes.

1018
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,650
He was born here in Salem's Lot.

1019
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:22,985
Left at the age of 10.

1020
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:25,700
His wife died
in an automobile accident two years ago.

1021
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,694
He's a left-winger.

1022
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:29,950
Against nuclear power, stuff like that.

1023
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,660
No record?

1024
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,868
Hmm. Travels a lot. There's no, uh...

1025
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:38,004
No connection between Mears
and the other two?

1026
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:39,709
Wouldn't seem so.

1027
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,504
Then why's he so interested
in the Marsten House?

1028
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,006
And why did they buy it?
There's a connection.

1029
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:46,421
There's a connection, I'm telling you.

1030
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:49,844
- Jason.
- Well...

1031
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:53,136
- Well, how's the book coming?
- Oh, hard.

1032
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:54,853
Tough way to make a living, huh?

1033
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:58,016
Well, it's not much of a living,
but it's the only way I know.

1034
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:00,810
The Marsten House
still center of the story?

1035
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:01,978
Yep.

1036
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:03,271
What about the Glick boys?

1037
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,112
- Thank you.
- You connect them with the house?

1038
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,242
Everything in Salem's Lot
is connected with that house.

1039
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:09,698
You can see it
from every part of the town.

1040
01:39:09,861 --> 01:39:12,034
It's like a beacon
throwing off an energy force.

1041
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,329
Mike.

1042
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,870
Hello, Mr. Burke.

1043
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,044
Mike, are you on something?

1044
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:29,430
- No.
- Drugs?

1045
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:32,850
Sick. I feel sick.

1046
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,267
Since when?

1047
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:39,307
Hmm?

1048
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:42,728
First, I found my dog dead.

1049
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,526
Then there was the funeral yesterday.

1050
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:50,402
I fell asleep on Harmony Hill.
Didn't wake up till morning.

1051
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:52,786
This was after Danny Glick's funeral?

1052
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:54,243
Yeah.

1053
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:59,911
I went back to finish. Royal wasn't there.

1054
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,088
I started to feel

1055
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:08,002
sick. Can I have a drink?

1056
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,676
Miss. Whiskey.

1057
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,512
What do you remember, Mike?

1058
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,348
- Singing.
- Singing?

1059
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,271
Sweet.

1060
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,643
Sweetest singing I ever heard.

1061
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,441
A feeling like drowning.

1062
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:32,281
And eyes.

1063
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:35,405
- Eyes.
- Whose eyes?

1064
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,616
Bright and...

1065
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:40,664
Scary.

1066
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:43,128
- Whose?
- Don't remember.

1067
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,092
I dreamed.

1068
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,262
You slept there all night?

1069
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:53,676
Yeah, all night.

1070
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:55,383
What about last night?

1071
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:58,094
I remember a dream.

1072
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:06,356
Somebody out there.

1073
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:08,863
And I...

1074
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:11,824
I let him in.

1075
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:14,656
Who?

1076
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,366
- I don't know.
- Listen to me, Mike.

1077
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:24,336
Mike. Mike, I want you
to stay at my house tonight.

1078
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,917
Will you do that for me?

1079
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:28,966
We'll arrange to see Dr. Norton tomorrow.

1080
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:31,965
All right. I don't care.

1081
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,545
Open the window.

1082
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,587
Open the window, Mark.

1083
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:56,383
Open the window, Mark. Please.

1084
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:58,552
Let me in.

1085
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,051
It's okay, Mark, I'm your friend.

1086
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,768
He commands it.

1087
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:21,369
No, Mark.

1088
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:42,057
Go away.

1089
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,684
Go away!

1090
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:10,521
Son, are you awake?

1091
01:45:12,264 --> 01:45:13,732
Yeah, kind of.

1092
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:16,398
Did you have a bad dream?

1093
01:45:19,188 --> 01:45:20,565
I... Maybe.

1094
01:45:24,443 --> 01:45:25,490
I don't remember.

1095
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:27,951
You called out in your sleep.

1096
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:32,706
I'm sorry.

1097
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:34,791
Do you want anything?

1098
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:37,623
No.

1099
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,544
Good night then.

1100
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:45,298
Good night, Dad.

1101
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:21,376
Come in.

1102
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,178
I hope these will be all right.

1103
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:30,767
Mike?

1104
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:35,852
Turn your head, Mike.

1105
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:37,312
This way.

1106
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:39,814
Where did you get these marks?

1107
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,196
I don't know.

1108
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,292
Now, call me in the night
if you want anything.

1109
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:05,177
Anything. Even if you have a bad dream.

1110
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:07,839
Will you be sure to do that?

1111
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:09,177
Yes.

1112
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,342
Now, anything. I mean it.

1113
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,893
I'll be right down the hall.

1114
01:47:18,182 --> 01:47:19,479
I will.

1115
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,355
Mr. Mears, telephone.

1116
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:42,350
Telephone.

1117
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:45,649
Oh, oh. Uh, uh...

1118
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:47,688
All right. Just a minute. Just a minute.

1119
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:55,287
What is it, long distance?

1120
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,781
No, it's Jason Burke.

1121
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,583
Oh. What time... what time is it?

1122
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:02,837
It's a little after 4:00,
and Mr. Burke sounds very upset.

1123
01:49:02,995 --> 01:49:04,292
Oh, oh, uh...

1124
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:32,153
Yeah, Jason?

1125
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,536
What's the matter?

1126
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:39,991
Um.

1127
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:42,125
Well, give me about 10 minutes.

1128
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:47,418
Well, hell no. I'm a... I was a Baptist.

1129
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:50,626
Jason.

1130
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:58,467
Do you have, uh, uh,

1131
01:49:59,343 --> 01:50:01,687
a rosary or a crucifix?

1132
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,722
Yeah, in my bedroom.
Mr. Berk asked for it?

1133
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:06,267
- Yes, please.
- Well, he's not Catholic.

1134
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:09,027
- I don't even think he goes to church.
- Please.

1135
01:50:51,395 --> 01:50:52,738
He's all right, Jason. He's sleeping.

1136
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,283
The window's open.
It was closed and locked.

1137
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:59,160
I made sure of it.

1138
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:13,379
Sun's coming up.

1139
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,089
Look.

1140
01:51:23,552 --> 01:51:24,553
It's blood.

1141
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:27,598
A single drop.

1142
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:34,654
Mike. Mike, wake up.

1143
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:47,784
There's no pulse.

1144
01:51:49,286 --> 01:51:50,458
Marks on the neck?

1145
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:08,973
No. Nothing, nothing.

1146
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,312
No marks. Nothing.

1147
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:14,478
- You think I'm crazy?
- No.

1148
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:17,944
- Do you believe me about the marks?
- I guess I'll have to.

1149
01:52:18,523 --> 01:52:20,070
But where does that put us, Jason?

1150
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:23,821
It puts us in the position
where we have to do something.

1151
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:25,831
Could he have died
of a virus or something?

1152
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:29,160
Well, Ben, the window,
the marks on his neck,

1153
01:52:29,326 --> 01:52:31,499
and I heard him invite someone
into the room and...

1154
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,248
Oh, that terrible laughter.

1155
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:36,750
All right.

1156
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:43,173
Do you know what will happen to you

1157
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:46,852
if we whisper a word
of what you've just told me?

1158
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:51,683
Right. "Funny old duck living alone
on Taggot Stream Road.

1159
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:53,691
"How can we trust him
to teach our children?"

1160
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:58,606
I can't help you, Jason.
I saw a body, nothing else.

1161
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:01,825
And I'm an outsider, a writer, a crazy.

1162
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:05,199
But if we do nothing...

1163
01:53:05,946 --> 01:53:09,120
There is something we can do.
We can check this all out.

1164
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:13,378
Call Dr. Norton. Call the constable.

1165
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:16,381
Yeah. Let the machinery take over.

1166
01:53:16,873 --> 01:53:19,376
Don't even tell Dr. Norton he's dead.

1167
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,591
- Not dead?
- Well, how do we know he is?

1168
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:24,552
Let the medical people check it out.

1169
01:53:24,715 --> 01:53:26,809
Let them find the cause of death.

1170
01:53:31,462 --> 01:53:33,732
All the times Mike drove that,

1171
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:37,064
not guessing how soon
he'd be riding in the back.

1172
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:41,323
Mears, I want you to testify
for the coroner's jury.

1173
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:43,484
- I'll be there.
- That's good.

1174
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:46,278
Got to do my paperwork.

1175
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:48,322
Duplicate, triplicate.

1176
01:53:48,739 --> 01:53:50,707
Don't punch, spindle or mutilate.

1177
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:52,459
We all have to do that, don't we?

1178
01:53:52,617 --> 01:53:55,086
Yeah, and they say it's a free country.

1179
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:05,927
Uh, Jason.

1180
01:54:06,381 --> 01:54:07,928
What is it you wanted to tell me?

1181
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:15,107
Have there been any other people
complaining of feeling weak? Uh...

1182
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:19,023
- Well, had bad dreams?
- No.

1183
01:54:19,644 --> 01:54:21,396
There soon will be.

1184
01:54:22,898 --> 01:54:25,993
Bill, do you believe in ghosts?

1185
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:27,778
Ghosts? No.

1186
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:29,821
- Witches? Wizards?
- No.

1187
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:31,535
- Werewolves?
- Of course not.

1188
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:32,950
Vampires?

1189
01:54:34,743 --> 01:54:38,043
Bill, come on inside.
I'm going to tell you something.

1190
01:54:38,205 --> 01:54:40,082
And I'm going to ask your help.

1191
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:44,253
And maybe you'll give it,
if you don't decide I'm absolutely crazy.

1192
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:48,390
Good morning, Eva.

1193
01:54:49,248 --> 01:54:50,921
I heard.

1194
01:54:51,676 --> 01:54:52,848
Awful.

1195
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,077
Poor Mike.

1196
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:00,569
I'm tired.

1197
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:06,404
I'll just have a cup of coffee
and get some sleep.

1198
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:12,244
Why in the world did Mr. Burke
want that crucifix?

1199
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:18,912
Maybe because he thought
Mike Ryerson was Catholic.

1200
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:21,423
He should've known better than that.
He had Mike in school.

1201
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:23,834
All his people were Lutherans.

1202
01:55:26,545 --> 01:55:28,673
Well, it looks like
you're gonna miss the opening.

1203
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:32,472
- What opening?
- Those antique fellas.

1204
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:35,767
- Straker?
- Uh, him and the other fella.

1205
01:55:36,888 --> 01:55:38,731
Did that other fella ever show up?

1206
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:42,861
I don't know about that. All I know
is they're opening the store today.

1207
01:55:57,659 --> 01:55:59,457
Wouldn't Dad like this?

1208
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:01,587
Huh? Uh,

1209
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,502
I guess so.

1210
01:56:07,169 --> 01:56:08,887
Oh, Mr. Straker.

1211
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:12,720
Uh, my husband's birthday
is next week, and I...

1212
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:14,180
Oh, dear.

1213
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,178
It's quite reasonable, you know.

1214
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:18,104
There's no chance that...

1215
01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:20,707
I'm sorry, but...

1216
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:22,935
I understand.

1217
01:56:24,019 --> 01:56:28,616
I could hold it for you till the end
of the week without any obligation.

1218
01:56:29,441 --> 01:56:31,739
Oh, I'd appreciate that. Thank you.

1219
01:56:32,277 --> 01:56:33,403
Done.

1220
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:50,595
An English desk here, 18th century.

1221
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,094
Values continue to escalate.

1222
01:56:53,965 --> 01:56:56,593
Interesting little Welsh cupboard in oak.

1223
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:02,187
And my favorite chair. It was with me
in London in my establishment.

1224
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:13,986
English.

1225
01:57:17,072 --> 01:57:18,415
Georgian.

1226
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:19,912
Oh!

1227
01:57:20,408 --> 01:57:22,410
You have some expertise.

1228
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,667
No, not really.

1229
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:28,333
I just know something about silver.

1230
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,970
My aunt had some Georgian.
We had to sell it when she died.

1231
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:35,508
Oh. What an unfortunate way
to acquire knowledge.

1232
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:39,929
My aunt was housekeeper
at the Marsten House, your house.

1233
01:57:40,136 --> 01:57:41,513
Oh, really? That's interesting.

1234
01:57:42,472 --> 01:57:44,145
I've always been curious about that place.

1235
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:47,311
Perhaps I can satisfy your curiosity.

1236
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:50,234
A lot of peculiar things
have happened in that house.

1237
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,652
Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:54,944
The story goes that the man who built it
murdered his wife and a servant.

1239
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,744
And though it was never proved,

1240
01:57:56,903 --> 01:57:59,372
he was suspected in
the disappearance of several children.

1241
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:02,250
Yes, it was terrible, wasn't it?

1242
01:58:02,576 --> 01:58:03,998
Interesting.

1243
01:58:04,619 --> 01:58:06,212
Remarkable, yes.

1244
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,295
- Mr. Straker.
- Yes?

1245
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,334
Do you believe that

1246
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:15,005
evil can be inherent in a house?

1247
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:20,094
About as much as I believe
that trees have souls.

1248
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:22,099
Well, perhaps they do.

1249
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,186
Oh, you're the writer.

1250
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:29,020
On vacation or vocation?

1251
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:32,606
I am writing about the Marsten House.

1252
01:58:32,814 --> 01:58:34,157
Ah!

1253
01:58:34,316 --> 01:58:36,114
And you'd like to visit.

1254
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:39,325
Well, why not?
Mr. Barlow is on a buying trip,

1255
01:58:39,487 --> 01:58:41,330
but the moment he arrives.

1256
01:58:43,491 --> 01:58:45,334
You'll enjoy Mr. Barlow.

1257
01:58:45,994 --> 01:58:47,416
And he'll enjoy you.

1258
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:18,402
You snake.

1259
01:59:18,568 --> 01:59:19,945
Try to steal my girl.

1260
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:45,061
Pretty good beating you took, fella.

1261
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,188
No fractures, though. Slight concussion.

1262
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:48,974
You understand me?

1263
01:59:50,183 --> 01:59:51,810
- Yes.
- Good.

1264
01:59:52,519 --> 01:59:55,068
We're gonna keep you here overnight
anyway, for observation, all right?

1265
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:57,156
Mmm. Yes.

1266
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:00,489
Your friend Ned, he was arrested.

1267
02:00:00,652 --> 02:00:02,996
He's sitting in the town jail.

1268
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:05,122
I don't think he's gonna be
that foolish again.

1269
02:00:05,782 --> 02:00:07,534
Anyone else sick? Hospital?

1270
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:11,379
Couple of new admissions,
but nothing, uh...

1271
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:17,134
- No.
- What Jason and I told you...

1272
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:21,806
Ben, it's out of the question.
I don't believe it, and no one else will.

1273
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:24,138
You just take it easy, all right?

1274
02:00:25,802 --> 02:00:27,304
I want a crucifix.

1275
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:33,443
All right. If it'll make you feel better,
I suppose we can arrange it.

1276
02:03:12,594 --> 02:03:14,517
Look at me.

1277
02:03:19,434 --> 02:03:22,563
Look at me, teacher.

1278
02:03:25,148 --> 02:03:26,400
Look.

1279
02:03:28,192 --> 02:03:30,661
Look.

1280
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:33,248
Look.

1281
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:36,743
Look.

1282
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:39,879
Look at me.

1283
02:03:41,122 --> 02:03:43,045
Look at me.

1284
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,923
Look.

1285
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:49,339
No.

1286
02:03:53,718 --> 02:03:55,846
Look.

1287
02:03:59,431 --> 02:04:00,934
Look.

1288
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:05,188
No.

1289
02:04:08,232 --> 02:04:09,279
No.

1290
02:04:12,236 --> 02:04:13,408
Get out.

1291
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:16,207
Get out. I revoke my invitation.

1292
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:21,834
You will sleep like the dead, teacher.

1293
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:23,043
No.

1294
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:41,223
Marge?

1295
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:46,850
Marjorie?

1296
02:06:50,228 --> 02:06:51,525
Marjorie?

1297
02:06:58,861 --> 02:07:00,238
Marge.

1298
02:07:01,155 --> 02:07:02,953
Margie? Marjorie?

1299
02:07:04,367 --> 02:07:05,539
Honey?

1300
02:07:06,369 --> 02:07:07,541
Marge.

1301
02:07:08,246 --> 02:07:10,340
Marge. Marge.

1302
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:12,508
What is it? What are you saying?

1303
02:07:12,834 --> 02:07:14,760
- What?
- What?

1304
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:17,509
- Marge, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- No!

1305
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:19,424
- You sure?
- I'm okay.

1306
02:07:19,674 --> 02:07:22,473
- Honey, I want Dr. Norton to see you.
- No.

1307
02:07:22,635 --> 02:07:24,478
- Marge.
- I'm weak.

1308
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,939
- Weak.
- You haven't been sleeping ever since...

1309
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,232
Oh.

1310
02:07:32,728 --> 02:07:36,608
- I've been dreaming about him.
- Sure.

1311
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:40,449
- About Danny.
- That's natural. It's all right.

1312
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:42,239
He comes back,

1313
02:07:42,405 --> 02:07:45,750
and he says, "Mommy, Mommy,
I'm so glad to be home."

1314
02:07:47,535 --> 02:07:49,913
He says he's my baby.

1315
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:52,833
My baby.

1316
02:08:06,304 --> 02:08:07,351
Hi.

1317
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:10,392
Dad called me.

1318
02:08:10,558 --> 02:08:11,775
Oh, oh.

1319
02:08:12,059 --> 02:08:14,187
It was, uh, just a little knock.

1320
02:08:15,354 --> 02:08:17,106
Uh, I know you're okay.

1321
02:08:18,983 --> 02:08:20,075
There's more, Ben.

1322
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:24,114
Ned Tebbets died last night.

1323
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:25,744
What?

1324
02:08:26,407 --> 02:08:28,910
They found him dead
this morning in town jail.

1325
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:31,291
Dad examined him.

1326
02:08:31,454 --> 02:08:33,127
Pernicious anemia.

1327
02:08:34,457 --> 02:08:37,757
- Just like the Glick boy.
- Yes, only Ned had high blood pressure.

1328
02:08:38,127 --> 02:08:40,471
And Danny's mother died this afternoon.

1329
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:42,931
- Same symptoms?
- I think so.

1330
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:45,764
- What did your father say?
- He wants to talk to you.

1331
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:49,014
- And Jason Burke.
- Jason Burke?

1332
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,352
- He's here, Ben.
- Here?

1333
02:08:50,514 --> 02:08:52,767
In the hospital. Intensive care.

1334
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,649
- What?
- Heart attack.

1335
02:08:56,896 --> 02:08:58,318
He's stable.

1336
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:12,332
Susan.

1337
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:15,874
You've got to go back to Boston.

1338
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:19,218
There's a kind of plague in this town,
people are dying.

1339
02:09:19,377 --> 02:09:22,005
Don't you understand what's happening?

1340
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:25,049
- Do you?
- I do.

1341
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,553
It's in the Marsten House.

1342
02:09:28,844 --> 02:09:31,848
It's got to be rooted out.
It's got to be destroyed.

1343
02:10:14,932 --> 02:10:16,605
Do you know the priest at St. Jude's?

1344
02:10:16,767 --> 02:10:19,236
- Father Callahan?
- Father Callahan.

1345
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:22,865
But I am an agent
of the Holy Catholic Church.

1346
02:10:23,024 --> 02:10:25,903
You see, the overall concept of evil
in the Catholic Church

1347
02:10:26,068 --> 02:10:28,321
has undergone
a radical change in this century.

1348
02:10:28,779 --> 02:10:31,202
- Evil with a small "E."
- Satan with a small tail.

1349
02:10:31,365 --> 02:10:34,084
- Witches, incubi?
- Vampires?

1350
02:10:35,536 --> 02:10:37,083
In Salem's Lot.

1351
02:10:37,246 --> 02:10:39,749
Haven't you noticed anything
out of the way, peculiar?

1352
02:10:40,124 --> 02:10:42,172
Well, the Malloys weren't
at Mass this morning.

1353
02:10:42,335 --> 02:10:44,087
Mrs. Malloy never misses.

1354
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:48,265
Mrs. Glick...
But she'd suffered a terrible blow.

1355
02:10:48,924 --> 02:10:50,426
Ned Tebbets.

1356
02:10:50,593 --> 02:10:52,095
Mike Ryerson.

1357
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:13,328
- He's gonna do it.
- Well, at least we'll know then.

1358
02:11:13,491 --> 02:11:16,791
We'll have the medical evidence.
Now, now, listen to me.

1359
02:11:18,037 --> 02:11:20,506
- You have to get some hawthorn.
- Okay.

1360
02:11:20,664 --> 02:11:22,086
Okay, and...

1361
02:11:22,958 --> 02:11:24,631
- And just put it all over the house.
- Okay.

1362
02:11:24,794 --> 02:11:26,922
And the crucifixes from Father Callahan...

1363
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:28,465
- Mother's never going to...
- She has to!

1364
02:11:29,215 --> 02:11:32,970
They're breeding on one another.
The vampires are creating vampires.

1365
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:36,935
It's a geometric progression.
Two times two, times four, times eight.

1366
02:11:37,098 --> 02:11:39,146
- This is just...
- In another couple...

1367
02:11:39,308 --> 02:11:40,400
Ben.

1368
02:11:42,561 --> 02:11:44,313
Ned Tebbets' body
has disappeared from the morgue,

1369
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,653
and a baby that died this morning is gone.

1370
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:48,192
Marjorie Glick?

1371
02:11:48,484 --> 02:11:50,953
She's in the funeral parlor in Cumberland.

1372
02:11:51,612 --> 02:11:53,239
I'll get my car.

1373
02:11:55,616 --> 02:11:56,913
Hawthorn.

1374
02:12:02,206 --> 02:12:04,504
I think a lot of this
comes from Mark's hobby,

1375
02:12:04,667 --> 02:12:08,388
collecting masks, uh,
assembling monsters from kits.

1376
02:12:08,546 --> 02:12:10,514
He's always been preoccupied with them,

1377
02:12:10,673 --> 02:12:11,890
and it's not healthy.

1378
02:12:12,049 --> 02:12:13,596
Let's not make those judgments now.

1379
02:12:14,593 --> 02:12:17,642
Mark, you're sure it wasn't a dream?

1380
02:12:21,183 --> 02:12:23,151
It wasn't a dream.

1381
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:25,862
It was Danny Glick.

1382
02:12:26,355 --> 02:12:28,198
Nightmares seem real.

1383
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:31,744
His subconscious fear
made Danny seem real to him.

1384
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:34,530
And they were very close friends.

1385
02:12:37,491 --> 02:12:38,617
I'll get it.

1386
02:13:49,063 --> 02:13:50,815
Poor little boy.

1387
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:53,451
You can do nothing against the master.

1388
02:13:54,735 --> 02:13:56,032
Stop, holy man.

1389
02:13:57,112 --> 02:13:59,365
Or he'll cut the boy's throat.

1390
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:02,577
Back. Back, holy man. Back, shaman.

1391
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:04,586
Back, priest.

1392
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:09,049
What would you give
for this miserable boy?

1393
02:14:10,292 --> 02:14:11,293
What do you ask?

1394
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:14,138
What would you give
to reprieve him this night,

1395
02:14:14,296 --> 02:14:16,344
to save him for another night?

1396
02:14:17,508 --> 02:14:20,512
- What do you want?
- The master wants you.

1397
02:14:21,095 --> 02:14:24,019
Throw away your cross, face the master.

1398
02:14:24,306 --> 02:14:27,810
Your faith against his faith.
Could you do that?

1399
02:14:28,435 --> 02:14:30,483
Is your faith enough?

1400
02:14:32,314 --> 02:14:33,361
Then do it.

1401
02:14:33,732 --> 02:14:35,780
And trust him to let the boy go?

1402
02:14:38,988 --> 02:14:40,080
Run.

1403
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:46,079
I think they're dead, Father.

1404
02:14:46,245 --> 02:14:47,462
Run.

1405
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:53,635
I'm going to kill you.

1406
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:00,097
Now, your part of the bargain.

1407
02:15:01,552 --> 02:15:04,180
- I'm a priest.
- A priest?

1408
02:15:05,389 --> 02:15:07,232
Throw away the cross.

1409
02:15:07,683 --> 02:15:09,401
Face the master.

1410
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,403
Faith against faith.

1411
02:15:42,718 --> 02:15:44,391
What do you think?

1412
02:15:54,938 --> 02:15:57,157
Her condition is very similar
to Mike Ryerson's.

1413
02:15:57,316 --> 02:16:00,411
There's no surface lividity,
no signs of rigor.

1414
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:12,089
I'm gonna call home,
make sure they're all right.

1415
02:16:12,665 --> 02:16:15,009
They'll be fine
if they follow instructions.

1416
02:16:15,501 --> 02:16:16,844
I'll make sure they do.

1417
02:17:02,881 --> 02:17:04,508
Bless this cross.

1418
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:08,762
In the name of the Father

1419
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:10,807
and the Son

1420
02:17:11,432 --> 02:17:13,150
and the Holy Ghost.

1421
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:18,522
No atheists in foxholes.

1422
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:23,902
The Lord is my shepherd.

1423
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:26,993
I shall not want.

1424
02:17:30,701 --> 02:17:31,873
He maketh me...

1425
02:17:34,329 --> 02:17:37,583
He maketh me to lie down
beside still waters.

1426
02:17:39,835 --> 02:17:41,462
He maketh me to lie down.

1427
02:17:41,628 --> 02:17:42,971
He maketh me...

1428
02:17:43,130 --> 02:17:45,178
He maketh me to lie down in green pasture.

1429
02:17:46,884 --> 02:17:48,727
He restoreth my soul.

1430
02:17:51,555 --> 02:17:52,681
Bill.

1431
02:17:55,017 --> 02:17:59,363
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1432
02:18:01,482 --> 02:18:02,608
Bill!

1433
02:18:03,567 --> 02:18:06,366
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1434
02:18:06,528 --> 02:18:07,575
I will fear no evil.

1435
02:18:09,448 --> 02:18:10,449
Bill!

1436
02:18:16,663 --> 02:18:17,710
I will fear no evil.

1437
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,838
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1438
02:18:23,212 --> 02:18:24,429
Danny.

1439
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:29,052
Where are you, Danny, darling?

1440
02:18:45,442 --> 02:18:48,571
Bill! Bill! Bill!

1441
02:18:59,039 --> 02:19:00,791
- Ben, they're...
- Don't look at her eyes.

1442
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:06,926
Oh, God.

1443
02:19:58,056 --> 02:20:01,060
I called a friend of mine
in San Francisco.

1444
02:20:01,977 --> 02:20:03,729
He's, uh, he's turned on to the occult.

1445
02:20:04,771 --> 02:20:08,651
He says that, uh, we have to
get to Barlow during the day.

1446
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:11,703
Before sunset.

1447
02:20:13,655 --> 02:20:15,453
In his coffin.

1448
02:20:16,158 --> 02:20:17,626
And drive a stake through his heart.

1449
02:20:19,161 --> 02:20:21,004
What about Straker?

1450
02:20:21,163 --> 02:20:23,015
Straker's human. He's mortal. He's...

1451
02:20:23,981 --> 02:20:27,093
He's, uh... He's the watchdog, he...

1452
02:20:27,544 --> 02:20:30,013
He's the thing's bodyguard.
He prepares the way.

1453
02:20:31,173 --> 02:20:32,220
How can he be killed?

1454
02:20:32,382 --> 02:20:35,276
Any way. Any way at all. Gun, knife.

1455
02:20:39,264 --> 02:20:40,311
Any way at all.

1456
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:44,486
- Why did they come here?
- How the hell do I know?

1457
02:20:47,105 --> 02:20:51,201
Because you're somewhat isolated,
you're somewhat inbred. Full-blooded.

1458
02:20:53,862 --> 02:20:56,240
Barlow must have
wandered this planet for centuries,

1459
02:20:56,406 --> 02:20:58,408
looking for new places to victimize.

1460
02:21:01,495 --> 02:21:02,917
It's unbelievable.

1461
02:21:04,539 --> 02:21:06,041
I've seen it.

1462
02:21:09,878 --> 02:21:11,255
Still, Ben,

1463
02:21:14,466 --> 02:21:16,184
it's unbelievable.

1464
02:21:43,203 --> 02:21:44,546
Good girl.

1465
02:21:49,668 --> 02:21:51,090
- Where's your mother?
- She's up in your room.

1466
02:21:51,253 --> 02:21:52,721
- She's all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1467
02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:00,391
What happened?

1468
02:22:08,729 --> 02:22:10,777
Marjorie Glick rose and joined the undead.

1469
02:22:10,939 --> 02:22:12,862
- The undead?
- She's a vampire, too.

1470
02:22:13,025 --> 02:22:15,619
Soon, this whole town of Salem's Lot.

1471
02:22:16,403 --> 02:22:17,950
Susan, you're gonna have to leave town.

1472
02:22:19,364 --> 02:22:20,456
Mother and Dad?

1473
02:22:21,992 --> 02:22:24,791
Your father's gonna stay and help me

1474
02:22:24,953 --> 02:22:26,330
destroy this creature.

1475
02:22:27,998 --> 02:22:31,377
Now, tomorrow before sunset,
you take your mother

1476
02:22:31,543 --> 02:22:34,217
and anyone else
that you can persuade to go,

1477
02:22:34,379 --> 02:22:36,131
and you leave town.

1478
02:23:31,311 --> 02:23:32,358
Where's Gillespie?

1479
02:23:35,482 --> 02:23:37,359
Parkins called in sick.

1480
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:42,735
It's the first day
he's been off the job. Ever.

1481
02:23:45,158 --> 02:23:48,332
Are you... You feeling all right?

1482
02:23:50,413 --> 02:23:52,211
A little tired.

1483
02:23:52,374 --> 02:23:55,344
I didn't sleep much last night.
I was dreaming.

1484
02:23:56,461 --> 02:23:57,508
Funny.

1485
02:23:59,714 --> 02:24:02,388
I dreamed about Ned coming to see me.

1486
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:05,603
It was a funny dream.

1487
02:25:27,969 --> 02:25:29,562
He may have gone into town.

1488
02:25:29,721 --> 02:25:31,018
You look pale. Are you all right?

1489
02:25:32,057 --> 02:25:34,276
Just tired.

1490
02:25:42,234 --> 02:25:44,737
I... I dreamed all night.

1491
02:25:46,196 --> 02:25:47,368
All night.

1492
02:25:52,327 --> 02:25:54,955
Sweet, sweet dreams.

1493
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,252
Weasel.

1494
02:26:02,003 --> 02:26:03,175
Young.

1495
02:26:05,215 --> 02:26:07,013
Just like old times.

1496
02:26:10,095 --> 02:26:11,813
Kissing me on my neck.

1497
02:26:14,641 --> 02:26:15,688
Oh, Weasel.

1498
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:22,240
Maybe you better go lie down.

1499
02:26:28,154 --> 02:26:29,576
Yes, I will.

1500
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:05,522
Mark?

1501
02:31:28,871 --> 02:31:29,997
Mark?

1502
02:31:38,339 --> 02:31:39,431
Mark?

1503
02:33:40,545 --> 02:33:41,717
Susan.

1504
02:33:45,883 --> 02:33:48,978
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you in.

1505
02:33:49,137 --> 02:33:51,014
Let's get out of here.

1506
02:33:51,556 --> 02:33:53,433
He killed my parents.

1507
02:33:53,933 --> 02:33:57,866
You can't do it.
My father and Ben... Listen.

1508
02:34:01,232 --> 02:34:02,700
Please.

1509
02:34:02,859 --> 02:34:04,861
- You go.
- Only if you do.

1510
02:34:05,027 --> 02:34:06,279
I can't.

1511
02:34:06,738 --> 02:34:08,661
We'll come back with my father and Ben.

1512
02:34:08,823 --> 02:34:09,995
They'll help us. We need help.

1513
02:34:11,325 --> 02:34:12,747
What's that?

1514
02:34:23,963 --> 02:34:25,180
He's here.

1515
02:35:07,048 --> 02:35:08,049
Come.

1516
02:35:37,161 --> 02:35:39,584
That will hold you till tonight.

1517
02:35:40,623 --> 02:35:42,421
What will happen tonight?

1518
02:35:44,043 --> 02:35:45,090
Yes.

1519
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:49,223
What have you done with Susan?

1520
02:35:51,217 --> 02:35:52,514
Ah...

1521
02:35:53,553 --> 02:35:54,805
What did you do to her?

1522
02:35:58,391 --> 02:36:00,860
I've taken her to where she wished to go.

1523
02:36:03,437 --> 02:36:06,111
To meet the man she came here to meet.

1524
02:36:40,266 --> 02:36:43,816
- Where are you going?
- South Carolina, visit relatives.

1525
02:36:43,978 --> 02:36:46,322
You can't do that. He's up there.
He's in the house.

1526
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:49,199
- Who?
- Barlow. Barlow!

1527
02:36:49,442 --> 02:36:51,819
He's a vampire. He's got to be destroyed.

1528
02:36:52,862 --> 02:36:54,284
What the hell's so funny?

1529
02:36:54,822 --> 02:36:56,415
You're crazy.
There aren't any such things as vampires.

1530
02:36:56,574 --> 02:36:57,700
Well, then, what do you say
is happening here?

1531
02:36:57,867 --> 02:36:59,863
- Something is happening here.
- I don't know. Some kind of craziness.

1532
02:37:00,013 --> 02:37:01,913
- You're scared.
- Whatever it is, I'm not staying.

1533
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:03,501
- You're the constable here.
- Was.

1534
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:05,632
- Running!
- Running, running!

1535
02:37:05,791 --> 02:37:07,543
And you're staying?

1536
02:37:09,462 --> 02:37:11,009
You're staying.

1537
02:37:11,923 --> 02:37:14,802
All right, since you're staying,
come here.

1538
02:37:17,011 --> 02:37:18,809
Come here, will you?

1539
02:37:20,681 --> 02:37:22,103
Here. Here.

1540
02:37:23,851 --> 02:37:25,353
Maybe this will do you some good.

1541
02:37:25,919 --> 02:37:27,592
Coming!

1542
02:37:41,202 --> 02:37:43,705
This town's falling apart

1543
02:37:43,871 --> 02:37:45,589
and you're running?

1544
02:38:50,104 --> 02:38:51,651
Gillespie is leaving town.

1545
02:38:51,814 --> 02:38:53,612
Have you seen Susan?

1546
02:38:54,775 --> 02:38:56,777
- They should be gone by now.
- No.

1547
02:38:56,944 --> 02:38:58,617
Ann's still waiting for her at home.

1548
02:39:16,714 --> 02:39:19,263
- Father Callahan in there?
- No one's there.

1549
02:39:19,425 --> 02:39:21,803
- Is it blessed?
- It is holy water.

1550
02:40:13,354 --> 02:40:14,446
Ben?

1551
02:40:16,482 --> 02:40:17,734
Ben, Susan's in there!

1552
02:40:24,281 --> 02:40:25,373
Mark.

1553
02:40:27,284 --> 02:40:29,252
- They're in there.
- Where?

1554
02:40:29,411 --> 02:40:30,788
I don't know.

1555
02:40:31,205 --> 02:40:33,549
- You run. You run as fast as you can.
- No.

1556
02:40:33,707 --> 02:40:35,380
- Keep running!
- No.

1557
02:41:25,843 --> 02:41:26,935
Ben.

1558
02:42:50,636 --> 02:42:52,263
I told you to go.

1559
02:42:52,638 --> 02:42:53,685
- No.
- Run!

1560
02:42:53,847 --> 02:42:54,848
No!

1561
02:43:41,228 --> 02:43:42,571
Help me!

1562
02:43:43,605 --> 02:43:45,653
No, please! Ahh!

1563
02:44:13,719 --> 02:44:14,811
Ben.

1564
02:44:58,847 --> 02:44:59,973
Bill.

1565
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:03,227
Bill!

1566
02:45:05,562 --> 02:45:06,609
It's getting dark.

1567
02:45:07,898 --> 02:45:09,320
The cellar.

1568
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:13,821
Wait.

1569
02:45:19,868 --> 02:45:20,869
Mark, wait.

1570
02:45:21,203 --> 02:45:22,750
Mark, wait.

1571
02:45:22,904 --> 02:45:24,306
Mark!

1572
02:45:32,798 --> 02:45:33,890
Mark?

1573
02:45:38,011 --> 02:45:39,137
Mark.

1574
02:45:39,847 --> 02:45:41,645
- I'm all right.
- Easy.

1575
02:45:41,932 --> 02:45:44,685
- It's just the ankle.
- Can you stand?

1576
02:45:44,852 --> 02:45:45,899
Yeah.

1577
02:46:22,723 --> 02:46:23,724
He's here.

1578
02:46:31,815 --> 02:46:33,192
I know he's here somewhere.

1579
02:46:48,457 --> 02:46:49,709
Yeah. Here.

1580
02:47:06,642 --> 02:47:08,440
It's the root cellar.

1581
02:48:48,744 --> 02:48:51,042
We have to get him out of here.

1582
02:48:52,331 --> 02:48:53,423
Must weigh a ton.

1583
02:48:58,920 --> 02:49:01,264
We have to get him out of here.

1584
02:49:27,074 --> 02:49:28,121
Push!

1585
02:50:02,484 --> 02:50:04,282
The sun's gone down.

1586
02:50:30,178 --> 02:50:32,146
- He...
- Don't look at him!

1587
02:52:17,702 --> 02:52:18,794
Mark.

1588
02:52:19,246 --> 02:52:20,543
Get out.

1589
02:52:36,638 --> 02:52:37,639
Susan?

1590
02:53:03,081 --> 02:53:05,083
Sorry, Susan. Forgive me.

1591
02:53:06,209 --> 02:53:07,461
The wind.

1592
02:53:07,919 --> 02:53:09,011
It's blowing towards town.

1593
02:54:07,395 --> 02:54:08,817
Susan.

1594
02:54:15,236 --> 02:54:17,034
The town will burn.

1595
02:54:17,739 --> 02:54:19,912
It will drive them out
of their hiding places.

1596
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:22,077
All of them?

1597
02:54:22,994 --> 02:54:23,995
No.

1598
02:54:25,914 --> 02:54:28,042
It will purify Salem's Lot.

1599
02:54:30,377 --> 02:54:32,095
And the others will be on the run.

1600
02:54:32,545 --> 02:54:34,138
And on the hunt.

1601
02:54:34,923 --> 02:54:35,970
For us?

1602
02:54:37,509 --> 02:54:38,556
For us.

1603
02:56:12,145 --> 02:56:13,897
They found us again.

1604
02:56:18,068 --> 02:56:19,160
Another one has found us.

1605
02:56:22,072 --> 02:56:23,995
We have to go further.

1606
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:26,997
Not yet.

1607
02:58:17,437 --> 02:58:18,438
Ben?

1608
02:58:31,618 --> 02:58:33,086
I found you.

1609
02:58:35,705 --> 02:58:36,752
I know.

1610
02:58:39,709 --> 02:58:40,926
I love you.

1611
02:58:45,924 --> 02:58:46,971
Yes.

1612
02:58:50,762 --> 02:58:53,015
You were so difficult to find.

1613
02:59:03,983 --> 02:59:05,200
I know.

1614
02:59:07,946 --> 02:59:09,869
But we're together now.

1615
02:59:10,907 --> 02:59:12,784
We'll always be together.

1616
02:59:14,827 --> 02:59:16,750
We'll always be young.

1617
02:59:18,790 --> 02:59:20,667
We'll love each other.

1618
02:59:21,876 --> 02:59:25,176
Forever. That is his promise.

1619
02:59:26,589 --> 02:59:27,841
Forever?

02:59:29,509 --> 02:59:30,761
Forever.

1621
02:59:35,932 --> 02:59:37,934
Kiss me, Ben.

02:59:44,148 --> 02:59:45,400
Kiss me.

02:59:50,947 --> 02:59:52,199
Kiss me.

1624
03:00:43,541 --> 03:00:44,588
There'll be others.

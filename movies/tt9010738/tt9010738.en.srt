1
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,786
There she is!

2
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,703
Just shoot, you idiots!

3
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,996
Chase her! Run, run!

4
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,374
- Down that alley!
- Which way did she go?

5
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,453
Down there! Run after her!

6
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,743
Down there! Go!

7
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,912
Hey! Hey!

8
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,657
Hey! Hey!

9
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,118
Hey!

10
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,707
Hey! Hey!

11
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,078
Miss phryne Fisher.

12
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,208
You know, I do have
a front door.

13
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,832
- Just thought I'd drop in.
- Hmm.

14
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,118
Damn. One laddered stocking.

15
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,748
Not bad considering
I had to elude

16
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:32,283
the entire palestinian
police force to pay you a visit.

17
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,280
And what the devil brings you
back here to Jerusalem, hmm?

18
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,039
I'm looking for
a missing person.

19
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,996
Oh, damn you.
Still the lady detective.

20
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,123
I had rather hoped
you'd come to pick up

21
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,829
the tiny pieces
of my broken heart.

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,365
Oh!

23
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,033
Still beating, as far
as I can tell, professor.

24
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,780
I'm looking for a young woman
called shirin abbas.

25
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,539
Apparently she's
in some kind of trouble

26
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,198
with the authorities.

27
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,036
Never heard of her.

28
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,121
I'm sure that your hearing is
just as healthy as your heart.

29
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,533
I trust you don't think
you can just come in here

30
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,244
and milk me for information

31
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:15,207
with your wit and your charm
and your...

32
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,990
Canaanite scarab?

33
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,204
From Jericho.
A little gift I found for you.

34
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,491
- To butter me up?
- Like a crumpet.

35
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,203
Hmm.

36
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,911
It's real.

37
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,073
I heard a rumour miss abbas

38
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,707
was dispensing
anti-British propaganda...

39
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,866
Professor linnaeus!
This is the police.

40
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,657
They locked her up, poor girl.

41
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:41,283
You have no right
to force your way in here!

42
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,789
We have orders from sir montague

43
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,539
to bring in your guest
for questioning.

44
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,414
This is preposterous. What for?

45
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,744
Inciting unrest
and inflammatory behaviour.

46
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,533
Oh, good heavens, man.
That's what she always does!

47
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,588
We're in the middle of
something very important.

48
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,700
But since you ask
so charmingly...

49
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,411
Miss Fisher's gun,
sir montague.

50
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,835
According
to your arrival documentation,

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,116
miss Fisher,
your reason for travel was...

52
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,623
Sightseeing.

53
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,312
The dome of qubbat al-sakhrah
at sunset

54
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,200
is one of the most sublime
spectacles in the world.

55
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,434
Then how do you
explain your other activities?

56
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,244
Trespassing on
administrative offices

57
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,998
to steal official documents?

58
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,283
Dancing in the streets after 9pm

59
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,915
in open defiance of
the military curfew?

60
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,290
Or blatantly associating
with undesirables

61
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,948
of the black hand organisation?

62
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,582
Oh, actually, I was dancing
with the undesirables,

63
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,116
and I found several of them
to be quite desirable.

64
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:05,705
I know exactly
why you're here, miss Fisher.

65
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,582
To find shirin abbas.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,082
Her uncle sheikh kahlil
is a business associate

67
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,865
of my friend lord lofthouse.

68
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,579
You know, lofty helped overthrow
the ottomans during the war.

69
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,866
From what I saw,
lofty and his cohorts

70
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,875
did most of their overthrowing
from the officers' lounge.

71
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,873
Oh, so you know him?

72
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,578
Tell my old friend sheikh kahlil

73
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,617
we'll do everything possible
to help him find his niece.

74
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,955
But if she is a serious
agitator, it may be too late.

75
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,956
She's a young woman
with a voice.

76
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,116
And you're
a troublemaker, miss Fisher.

77
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,351
You may have acquired the
trappings of British wealth,

78
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,740
but you were born in Australia,

79
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,124
the filthiest gutter
of the realm,

80
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,658
and I intend to send you
back there.

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,036
Come in!

82
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,740
Captain:
Miss Fisher's luggage, sir.

83
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,532
Her train departs at 1600 hours.

84
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,619
Watch her.

85
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,490
Yes, watch very closely...

86
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,534
While you tell me where
you're keeping shirin abbas.

87
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,324
The gun isn't loaded,
miss Fisher.

88
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,956
Count your bullets.

89
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,703
Yes, my suspicions were correct.

90
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,957
Miss Fisher won't be causing us
any more trouble.

91
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,490
Oh!

92
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,532
Where the bloody hell
has she gone?!

93
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,789
Shirin abbas?

94
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,619
Who are you?

95
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,829
My name is phryne Fisher.
Your uncle sent me to fetch you.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,582
Someone's coming.

97
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,035
Bismillah.

98
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,788
Come on, gorgeous.
You know you want it.

99
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,448
Come on.

100
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,287
Come on. That's it.

101
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,244
Come on. Good boy.

102
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:59,953
Come on.

103
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,703
One more, big step.

104
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,116
That's it. Pick up speed.

105
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,658
Come on!

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,240
Quickly.

107
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,998
I can't leave Palestine.

108
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,624
My family were murdered
and I want justice.

109
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:36,907
Murdered?

110
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,290
No-one believes me,
but I know what I saw.

111
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,621
Shirin, you won't get justice
if they hang you. Come on.

112
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,074
This is your only chance.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,365
Go!

114
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,036
Ma'a salama!

115
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,158
Excuse us!

116
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,915
Whoa!

117
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,164
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

118
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,184
I'll get you a new one.

119
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,539
Come on!

120
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,660
Quick, shirin!

121
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,618
Oh!

122
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,494
Listen. Right on schedule.

123
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,410
- Get ready.
- What?

124
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,618
Go!

125
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,079
Don't look down! Follow me.

126
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,539
I'll help you get down!

127
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,040
No, no! I can't do it!

128
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,621
Shirin, getting out of here
is your only hope for justice.

129
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,407
I will help you, I promise!

130
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,370
I'll find out
who murdered your family!

131
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,914
I've got you!

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,536
That's it.

133
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,703
Hold tight!

134
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,615
Hurry, shirin!

135
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,907
Go!

136
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,369
Miss Fisher!

137
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,957
Dottie? What is it?
What's wrong?

138
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,207
It's miss Fisher.

139
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,073
Sir?

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,991
There, there. It's alright.

141
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,865
Shh.

142
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,703
Our condolences,
inspector.

143
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,867
There's a memorial service
in London in six weeks' time.

144
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,869
- I need to be there.
- It's too far.

145
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,922
- Come on.
- No, I have to, Hugh.

146
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,740
Miss Fisher saved me
from the streets

147
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,374
and from illegal abortionists
and Latvian anarchists

148
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,624
and factory machines
and Christmas murderers,

149
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,865
and if it wasn't for her...
I never would have met you.

150
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,828
Dottie, I'm sorry,
but you can't,

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,661
not in your state.

152
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,074
Oh, the baby.

153
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,582
She'll never meet the baby.

154
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,116
Oh, I'm sorry.

155
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,499
Oh, poor inspector Robinson.

156
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,158
When she went away,
she broke his heart.

157
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,664
Inspector Robinson,

158
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,905
I'm so pleased
you could make it.

159
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,039
We wanted an intimate affair

160
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,790
before all the palaver
of westminster.

161
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,707
You meant so much to phryne.

162
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,329
Lady lofthouse and I
remember phryne,

163
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,333
as I'm sure you all do,

164
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,788
as an unpredictable whirlwind
of a woman

165
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,916
who never failed
to brighten our lives.

166
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,698
And now,

167
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,947
along with teaching me
how to ride a motorcycle,

168
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,867
as well as helping
my younger brother Jonathon

169
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,784
learn how to dance
the black bottom,

170
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,248
miss Fisher has taught us all
that life is but fleeting.

171
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:16,865
And so, dearest phryne,
we will honour you now

172
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,911
by living our lives
as richly and as fearlessly

173
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,664
as you once did.

174
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,700
I knew her luck
would run out one day.

175
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,241
She would never listen!

176
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,164
The honourable...

177
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,411
Miss phryne...

178
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,414
Fisher...

179
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,623
Oh!

180
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,908
What on earth is...?

181
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,369
Wh... “What's that?

182
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,658
"Relocate the..." Isthata t?

183
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,323
Here.

184
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,331
"The tea trolley"?

185
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,373
Move the tea trolley!

186
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,241
I hope you wanted
the cypresses pruned!

187
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,499
- Phryne!
- Ha-ha!

188
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,328
My dear girl!

189
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,706
We knew it would take more

190
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,740
than a steam train
to finish you off!

191
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,157
Oh-ho!

192
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,073
Lofty! _ohh!

193
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,615
Jonathon!

194
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:54,031
My god! Do you know
what a fuss you've caused?!

195
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,790
We've been beside ourselves.

196
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,244
And you nearly murdered me
with that spanner!

197
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,373
Darling aunt p!

198
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:04,476
I would have planned your
murder much better than that.

199
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,290
Oh! You impossible,
impossible girl!

200
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,540
Miss Fisher, we thought
you were a ghost.

201
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,073
No, shirin,

202
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,083
despite the mandated
authority's best efforts.

203
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,206
Hamdellah al-salama,
miss Fisher.

204
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,990
I'm so humbly grateful to you

205
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,953
for returning my niece
to my care,

206
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,322
and overjoyed
by your safe return.

207
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,458
Thank you, sheikh kahlil.

208
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,498
Jack.

209
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,749
What are you doing here?

210
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,324
I came to pay my respects...

211
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,706
At your memorial service.

212
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,947
The newspapers
reported you were dead.

213
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,744
Mmm.

214
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,748
Oh.

215
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,665
Crippins, forget the tea.

216
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,119
Let's crack open the champagne!

217
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:00,248
- Ha-ha!
- Eleanor!

218
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,991
- Uh, Jack knows.
- Knows what?

219
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,579
About the maharajah.

220
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,164
Is that a new hat?

221
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,741
Is that all you've got
to say to me?

222
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,708
Do you have any idea
what it was like for me?

223
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,310
Reading that you'd died
a horrible death

224
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,782
in a foreign country?

225
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,869
Why are you so angry?

226
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,956
I wrote a eulogy for you.

227
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,707
My apologies for
the wasted effort.

228
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,623
Oh, don't worry.
It won't be wasted.

229
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,286
I'll save it for
the appropriate day.

230
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,865
W ait!

231
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,283
What are you gonna do now that
you've come all this way

232
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,244
only to have me disappoint you?

233
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,123
I only had one plan.

234
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,953
To farewell you.

235
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,448
Farewell.

236
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,456
"Farewell"?

237
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,866
Wait! What did it say?

238
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,623
What did what say?

239
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,328
My eulogy.

240
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,448
It said I'm done with you.

241
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,052
Phryne,
no-one should look so divine

242
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,498
after what you've been through.

243
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,827
Oh, darling.

244
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,706
Except phryne
always looks divine.

245
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,873
I hear you had a rendezvous
in Jerusalem

246
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,828
with sir Vincent montague.

247
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,786
Ugh! Yes.

248
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,914
Lofty's very fond of him.

249
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,826
Monty and I were just drinking
chums in Palestine, that's all.

250
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,913
Pleasant company. I wouldn't
call it a rendezvous.

251
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,573
Is it just me
or is lord lofthouse

252
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,286
giving us a disapproving look?

253
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,416
Oh, it's not us. It's me
he always disapproved of.

254
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,289
Stand somewhere else.

255
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,120
But at least you were your
beautiful mother's favourite.

256
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,458
Sheikh kahlil, shirin,
do come in.

257
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,537
Phryne, has aunt prudence
told you?

258
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,664
We're hosting a ball
in shirin's honour.

259
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,825
Oh, excellent! Back from
the grave just in time.

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Sheikh kahlil
has important business

261
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,365
here with lofty,

262
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,453
so I have agreed
to sponsor shirin

263
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,536
for her debut
in civilised society.

264
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,998
Phryne!

265
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,079
Oh, I'm sure
some pressure was exerted.

266
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,990
We do have some civilisation
in Palestine,

267
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,249
you know, mrs Stanley.

268
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,329
But given the choice
between attending a ball

269
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,115
or going back to jail
to be hanged

270
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,623
for asking too many questions...

271
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,364
Jail?! Who's going to be hanged?

272
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,284
My niece is
exaggerating, mrs Stanley.

273
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,530
And it is all unimportant now
that you're back safe with us.

274
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,976
Yes, shirin needs to
forget all that unpleasantness.

275
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,161
But she is right about
one thing, dear prudence -

276
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,530
the near east is the cradle
of western civilisation.

277
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,790
Ah! How I miss my travels there.

278
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,199
Those velvety,
star-filled nights

279
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,161
from my rooftop in Jerusalem.

280
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,664
Pity about the war.

281
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,934
Yes, well, it's not my fault
father couldn't prevent you

282
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,638
from ending up on
the front line, Jonathon.

283
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,870
While you were draining the bar
in the officers' mess?

284
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,453
Let's not dwell on the past,
shall we?

285
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,081
Perhaps another round
of cribbage?

286
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,740
Forget cribbage!

287
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,539
I believe you owe me
a rematch, phryne.

288
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:52,078
Shirin said
she couldn't leave Palestine

289
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,601
because she needed to find out
what happened to her village.

290
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,240
We heard there was
nothing left of it,

291
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,124
that it had been completely
buried under a giant sandstorm.

292
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,783
Yes. She was
the only survivor too.

293
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,745
Poor lamb. Must have been
terrifying for her.

294
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,078
And then shirin turned up
at British headquarters

295
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,083
a few days later, and the army
delivered her to the sheikh.

296
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,083
Yes, and he's been indebted
to the British ever since,

297
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,289
which, may I say,
has proven most convenient!

298
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,369
Arggh! Bastard!

299
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,331
Sir.

300
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,990
Allow me.

301
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,203
Prét? Allez!

302
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,369
Aha!

303
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,828
If shirin's village was
destroyed by a sandstorm,

304
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,366
why does she think
they were murdered?

305
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,248
Massacred is what she implied.

306
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,827
I have no idea.

307
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,120
The high commission thoroughly
investigated the matter

308
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,823
at the time
and they found nothing.

309
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,118
Onl

310
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,243
ha!

311
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,164
_ah!

312
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,914
Oleél

313
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:07,122
bravo, phryne. You always were
my greatest defender.

314
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,032
She has no respect
for the rules!

315
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,494
That's because they tend
to be written by men.

316
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:32,079
Crippins? More wine, please.

317
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,786
Thank you so much.

318
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,911
This came for me.

319
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,823
I don't know what to do.

320
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,706
Who is "mu'aqqibi"?

321
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,708
My guardian angel.
He saved me from the storm.

322
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,240
He left no name,

323
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:24,204
but I believe he was sent
by Allah to walk with me.

324
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,115
He led me to Jerusalem.

325
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,999
"Time is running out
to put things right."

326
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,907
"There is but one chance."

327
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,371
- He wants to meet, tonight.
- At all saints church.

328
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,624
Can't tell my uncle.

329
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,661
This seal has been steamed open.

330
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,494
Who would do that?

331
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,123
I'm not sure.

332
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:50,659
And he says tell no-one.
But I have to meet with him.

333
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,323
No, shirin.

334
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,866
I made a promise to you
that I would help you.

335
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,657
I will go in your stead.

336
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,073
Miss Fisher?

337
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:07,948
Sheikh kahlil.

338
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:15,030
I hope my niece is not
making demands of you.

339
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,914
No.

340
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,699
Shirin is still grieving
for everything that she's lost.

341
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,411
Of course.

342
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:24,655
But you must understand
she was only a child.

343
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,666
She imagines things.

344
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,036
She has false hopes.

345
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:36,744
The future of our family
lies here, miss Fisher,

346
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:40,409
not beneath the sands
of a barren desert.

347
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,374
Tusbih ealaa khayr, miss Fisher.

348
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:49,079
Tusbih ealaa khayr,
sheikh kahlil.

349
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,289
Will you require anything else

350
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,699
before I retire
for the evening, miss?

351
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:18,038
Yes, thank you, crippins.
The keys to lofty's motorcar.

352
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,533
Shut up, will you?!
I'm trying to sleep!

353
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:13,415
Jack?

354
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,536
Jack, are you awake?

355
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,953
No.

356
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,081
I need you,

357
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,831
for a midnight meeting
with a stranger

358
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,661
at all saints church in soho.

359
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:33,164
How the hell did you find me?

360
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,449
He could be deranged
and dangerous.

361
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,536
That'll make two of you.

362
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,199
You have to come!

363
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,786
Imagine...

364
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:48,701
A secret oasis somewhere
in the vast negev desert

365
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,661
where a bedouin tribe
has flourished

366
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:54,621
for hundreds...
Thousands of years...

367
00:28:55,875 --> 00:29:00,289
Until one day
the entire tribe is murdered.

368
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,331
An apocalyptic
sandstorm descends

369
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,990
to bury all the evidence

370
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:08,284
and only a young girl
survives to tell the tale...

371
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,908
Till over a decade later,

372
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,995
when she decides she can no
longer live with the injustice

373
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:19,410
and is prepared to risk
her own life to find the truth.

374
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,532
But if you're not interested...

375
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,373
Dammit, Jack!

376
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,703
How could you come all this way
to commemorate me

377
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,740
and then refuse to speak to me?

378
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:58,782
Hello?

379
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,956
I'm a friend of shirin abbas.

380
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,990
Where's the girl?

381
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,828
She sent me.

382
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,581
My name is phryne Fisher.

383
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,290
She told me you were
her guardian angel.

384
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,780
I'm not her angel.
I'm her demon!

385
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,448
Get away!

386
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,286
- Please...
- Stay back!

387
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,073
I just want to talk with you.

388
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,660
No!

389
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,953
I mean you no harm.

390
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,703
Phryne? “Who's that?!

391
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,365
Jack!

392
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,914
Stay back.

393
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,948
- This is a trap!
- No.

394
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,491
It's not, I... promise you!

395
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,703
Here, take this.

396
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,249
Oh, oh.

397
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,536
Tell shirin I'm sorry.

398
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,244
Tell her to forgive me.

399
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,748
Why?

400
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,540
We're all... we're all cursed.

401
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,869
I lost him.

402
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,164
What's that?

403
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:57,287
Something we need
to keep from the police.

404
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,164
"We"?

405
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,870
Police! Put down that weapon!

406
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,324
So a lady detective
and a senior police officer

407
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,913
just happened
to meet up with each other

408
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,039
12,000 miles away from home

409
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,790
at the scene of a murder
of a complete stranger?

410
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:32,040
Not unusual
in my experience, sir,

411
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,290
apart from
the distance involved.

412
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,540
And you expect me to believe
that neither of you

413
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,950
had ever heard of
sergeant Wilson before?

414
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,411
Even though he'd been wanted
by the military police

415
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,948
for over 10 years?

416
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,786
- Wanted for what?
- Sir?

417
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,495
The coroner's report on the
bullet found in the deceased.

418
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,037
Round-nosed Mark I,
if I'm not mistaken.

419
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,073
From a .303 rifle.

420
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,119
Wilson was wanted for desertion.

421
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,783
"Farrier sergeant
George Hercules Wilson,

422
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:11,621
"in the company of captain
Harry gardiner Templeton,"

423
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,657
"walked off
from London regiment,"

424
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,576
"north of Jerusalem,
9 April 1918."

425
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,866
Harry Templeton?

426
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,579
I thought you had
no interest in Wilson.

427
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,537
Oh, just naturally curious.

428
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,198
Hmph.

429
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,534
Neither of you
are leaving London

430
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,915
until this case is solved.

431
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,786
My passage back to Australia
is booked for two days' time.

432
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,494
I'll have to forfeit my ticket!

433
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,703
Oh. What a shame.

434
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,157
Crippins!

435
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:54,245
Lady lofthouse sent me
to fetch the motorcar, miss.

436
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,123
The police said
it was impounded.

437
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,749
Ah, yes. Please pass on
my apologies to Eleanor.

438
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,828
Tell her I'll make
my own way home.

439
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,081
Jack, wait.

440
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:18,415
You have no authority, Forsythe!

441
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,655
Sir montague, you're
a long way from Jerusalem.

442
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,290
That woman has
more lives than an alley cat!

443
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,074
I have critical negotiations
underway in London

444
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,707
and her interfering
could completely sabotage

445
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:32,036
British-palestinian relations!

446
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:34,870
What does she know about Wilson?

447
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,322
'Daily express'!
Get your 'daily express' here!

448
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,333
'Daily express' for you!
'Daily express', love?

449
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,240
Jack!
Where are you going?

450
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,907
Back to my guesthouse.

451
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,893
Well, you're heading
in the wrong direction.

452
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,123
I don't care!

453
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:55,704
Alright, is all this because
I married the maharajah?

454
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,728
You said you weren't
the marrying kind.

455
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,498
- And I'm not.
- And I respected that.

456
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,587
So why don't you respect
that I had other reasons

457
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,494
for marrying
the maharajah of alvar?

458
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,407
What kind of blind faith
is that?

459
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,039
The kind that I thought we had.

460
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,164
You can't stop me
doing what I need to do.

461
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,933
The maharajah needed
my help at the time,

462
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,365
just as shirin does now.

463
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,302
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure
that one lifetime

464
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,328
will be enough for you
to save the whole world.

465
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,162
Well, I'm sorry too,
if that's the case.

466
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,166
And I'm very sorry
that I'm not dead!

467
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,074
You know the quickest way
to escape me?

468
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,704
Tie you up,
dump you in that river?

469
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,366
Or you could help me
with this case.

470
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,832
Look at this stone.

471
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,581
It could be glass.

472
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,082
No, it's far more
precious than that.

473
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,241
Look in the light.

474
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,739
See how the reflections
flash pure green?

475
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,828
And it's cool to the touch.

476
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,203
Can you feel that?

477
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,706
No.

478
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,706
No... no.

479
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,410
No.

480
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,286
You know,
I haven't forgiven you.

481
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,119
Really? Mind your step.

482
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:27,032
Eugh!

483
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,995
What kind of professor
did you say he was?

484
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,624
The kind that
you need to be nice to.

485
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,750
- An old friend.
- Another one?

486
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,829
He was kicked out of Jerusalem
because of me.

487
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,911
"Cultural liberation
and repatriation"

488
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,823
"of ancient looted artefacts."

489
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,575
You bring me
the loveliest things.

490
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,911
Apart from yourself, of course.

491
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,077
Looks like the British museum

492
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,913
can kiss their sichuan
Jade bird goodbye.

493
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:23,372
I ship her off home tomorrow
on a slow boat to Shanghai.

494
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,909
You remember our slow boat,
don't you, phryne?

495
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:37,831
Oh, the saturation in
this emerald is just glorious.

496
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,787
I'd say mined in Egypt.

497
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,914
Well, Wilson served
in the middle east.

498
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,871
But the silver casting
is more graeco-Roman.

499
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,802
Ah, well, that would explain
the inscription.

500
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,448
There's an inscription?

501
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:54,163
Yes, here, on the other side.
It's a form of doric Greek.

502
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,200
Um, tombus dac...

503
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,742
Tombus dacryrone.

504
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,454
The crypt of tears.

505
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:08,241
- Oh, my dear god.
- What is it?

506
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:10,703
It's the myth
of Alexander the great.

507
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,036
I have a transcript
from a Clay tablet

508
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:16,245
describing Alexander's last
campaign through Palestine,

509
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,705
where he suffered
a mysterious bereavement.

510
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,615
It's said that he wept so much,

511
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,705
his tears created
a desert spring.

512
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,831
So it's an actual tomb?

513
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,742
That he protected
with a huge emerald

514
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:33,499
called the all-seeing eye

515
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:37,205
and... a powerful curse.

516
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,449
This pendant means
the crypt has been disturbed.

517
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:45,830
So... Wilson was a grave-robber.

518
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,993
And maybe Harry Templeton,
whom Wilson deserted with.

519
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,532
But don't you see?

520
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,949
If the all-seeing eye
is removed,

521
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,490
then the curse is released

522
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,283
and everyone involved
in this is in danger.

523
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,915
You need to take that away.
You need to get rid of it.

524
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,244
No, no, no. We need
to find out more about it.

525
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,783
That transcript,
do you still have it?

526
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,698
Well, uh, somewhere, but...

527
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,957
Wait here.

528
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,905
You seriously believe
that thing comes from a crypt

529
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,165
that was cursed 2,000 years ago

530
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,370
by a man who thought
he was the son of Zeus?

531
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:30,033
What about
king tutankhamen's tomb?

532
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,164
Lord carnarvon is dead,

533
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,994
along with two of his brothers

534
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:36,032
and half a dozen others
who helped open it.

535
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,951
There are strange things
in heaven and earth.

536
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,290
Ah!

537
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,994
Hold this.

538
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,453
I'll go check on the professor.

539
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,448
Professor?

540
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,032
Professor?

541
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,698
Professor?

542
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,706
Professor?

543
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,160
Professor?

544
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,540
It's around here somewhere.

545
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,077
Jack?

546
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,282
Jack!

547
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,368
The pendant!

548
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,118
Oj!

549
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,580
Oh!

550
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,081
Oi! “Woman: Oh!

551
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,161
Stop or I'll shoot!

552
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:45,952
Who are you?!

553
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,033
Tell me or I'll
pull this trigger!

554
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,621
Oh! My treasures!

555
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,032
Phryne!

556
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:13,914
He just...

557
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,825
He disappeared!
He just evaporated!

558
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,956
He didn't get what he came for.

559
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:23,239
Oh! Thank god!

560
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,248
Or you could thank me.

561
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,782
I put out the fire!

562
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,914
Well done, professor.

563
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:47,907
Well done.

564
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,822
Miss Fisher?
It's almost eight.

565
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:16,163
Mmm... good morning, shirin.

566
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,206
Shirin, do you know
if your uncle

567
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,536
was in London last night,
by any chance?

568
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,199
I'm not sure.
I know he had an appointment.

569
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,411
Did you meet with mu'aqqibi?

570
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,831
I'm curious, shirin.

571
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,911
Why was your uncle
living in Jerusalem

572
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:40,280
and not with you in the village
when it was attacked?

573
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:43,291
Because he accepted work
from the British.

574
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:47,040
He was considered a traitor
and he was banished.

575
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,240
A traitor?

576
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,407
I have something for you.

577
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,248
Where did you get that?

578
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,369
From the man who saved you
from the storm.

579
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:08,123
Mu'aqqibi?

580
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,783
He was a British soldier
and his name was Wilson.

581
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:14,282
He wanted you to have it.

582
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,289
This was my mother's.

583
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,700
She said one day
it would be mine.

584
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:10,365
Shirin...

585
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:14,329
Have you ever heard
of the crypt of tears?

586
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:29,573
Mrs Templeton?

587
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,331
Hello?

588
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:40,123
Who are you?

589
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,704
My name is detective inspector
Jack Robinson.

590
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,160
Please.

591
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,369
The war office
gave me your address.

592
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:51,410
I believe farrier sergeant
Wilson knew your husband?

593
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,414
I'm sorry to tell you,

594
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,370
but George Wilson
died two nights ago.

595
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:04,453
That's Lucinda.

596
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,203
Arrived too early.

597
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,953
But a perfect little thing.

598
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,039
I am so sorry.

599
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,119
I blame the war for it all.

600
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,744
Harry went away a good man.

601
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:27,615
But then they...
Shot him like a mad dog.

602
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:33,699
Your husband and Wilson
deserted their regiment

603
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,490
on the same day.

604
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:39,454
Wilson worked for Harry
in the mines before the war.

605
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,581
He sent me a letter,

606
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,119
wanted to meet with me last
night, but he never turned up,

607
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,157
said we were in danger.

608
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,370
He and Harry did something
we heeded to fix.

609
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,992
This is what Wilson was after.

610
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,367
Sheikh kahlil? Are you resting?

611
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:18,450
Sale of
the British Palestine railways?

612
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,912
To lord lofthouse
and sheikh kahlil.

613
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:29,655
Authorised by
sir Vincent montague.

614
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:32,789
Shirin?

615
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,574
I need to speak to you, at once.

616
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:42,785
I'd prefer
if you keep our affairs

617
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:44,619
private from miss Fisher.

618
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:46,282
She seems to be
the kind of person

619
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:50,076
who would see...
Intrigue everywhere.

620
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,866
But I... can prove what I saw
with my own eyes.

621
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,373
My mu'aqqibi...

622
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:55,902
Would you please stop
this nonsense

623
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:58,499
about your mu"aqqibi
and ancient curses?!

624
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,828
This is all not real, shirin!

625
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,990
Darling...

626
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,492
This ball tonight is real.

627
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,539
- Sir.
- Thank you, crippins.

628
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,198
Madam.

629
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:30,280
Habibti, your acceptance
in London society

630
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,414
is not just an honour.

631
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:36,451
It's essential for your safety.
Do you understand that?

632
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,494
I know you mean well.

633
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,407
But look.

634
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,119
What?

635
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,740
Where did you get this?

636
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:01,038
This belonged to hajija.
It belonged to your mother.

637
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:05,656
My mu'aqqibi,
he wasn't my guardian angel.

638
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:08,199
He was a British soldier.

639
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:10,707
They lied to us, uncle.

640
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,661
What I saw must be true.

641
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:15,244
What?

642
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,415
Tell me. Tell me
the whole story again.

643
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:27,914
It was my job

644
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,540
to collect the honey
from the mountains.

645
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,075
My mother said one day
she would tell me its secrels.

646
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,039
Mama?

647
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:23,911
Mama?!

648
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,160
Mama!

649
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,324
I never found my mother.

650
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:01,538
And all I wanted was
for the storm to take me.

651
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,949
But mu'aqqibi found me.

652
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,490
Habibti...

653
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:13,989
Please, tell no-one else
about this.

654
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,657
No-one.

655
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:18,657
I'll get to the bottom of this.

656
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,991
Thank you, uncle kahlil.

657
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:24,078
Habibti...

658
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,415
- Thank you, James.
- Pleasure, ma'am.

659
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,286
Jack!

660
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,365
For me?

661
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:55,239
Oh, just some old thing
I... picked up.

662
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:57,658
An astrolabe!

663
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,032
For reading the heavens.

664
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,581
Picture of you
and the nice lady, sir?

665
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,162
Oh, lovely. Yes, sir.
My best side, please.

666
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,115
- Yes.
- Cheers.

667
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,533
I thought this was
an investigation.

668
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,699
What's dancing
got to do with it?

669
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,991
We need to find out
what this deal is all about.

670
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:28,285
I'll take lofty and monty,
you follow the sheikh.

671
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,119
- Sir Lloyd.
- Sir montague. Evening.

672
00:57:35,292 --> 00:57:37,533
The sheikh was about to fund
the entire purchase.

673
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,074
- Now he's refusing to sign!
- Sir?

674
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,411
Well, then we'll find
another partner.

675
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:43,868
Or borrow the money

676
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,722
if the railways are
such a lucrative asset.

677
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,192
Yes, but no-one
in this damn country

678
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:48,698
will loan me a penny, Eleanor.

679
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,241
- We're up to our necks in debt.
- Shh.

680
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:53,658
I have guests to attend to.

681
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:58,704
- Eleanor?
- I'm fine.

682
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:07,408
Don't speak.
Just... smile and nod.

683
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,665
I'll do my best.

684
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,414
I must believe my niece.

685
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:16,121
But it's nonsense.
It's been investigated.

686
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,250
I'm sorry, sir montague.
I'm very sorry.

687
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:21,829
Your niece has stirred up
trouble from nothing.

688
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,865
It's not nothing.

689
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:28,035
I will not sign this contract
until this matter is settled.

690
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,448
I suspect that's a decision

691
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,206
you're going to
come to regret, kahlil.

692
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,741
It's sheikh kahlil.

693
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,616
- Friendly crowd.
- Mmm.

694
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,698
Lofty!
Family portrait. Over here.

695
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,411
- Oh!
- Come on.

696
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,574
Oh, my dear Jonathon!

697
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,615
Brothers in arms, eh?
Jolly good!

698
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:57,373
Mwah!

699
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,036
Perhaps you should
slow down a bit.

700
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,449
Perhaps my wife should
be a little more careful

701
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,490
with her affections.

702
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:11,496
Having fun, you two?

703
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:13,623
Sir montague is a go-between.

704
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:15,498
He's trying to offload
palestinian railways

705
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,032
for the British administration

706
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:19,164
and no doubt make
a tidy commission out of it

707
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,664
and earn himself a promotion.

708
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,539
Is this your idea
of sweet nothings?

709
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:24,323
I thought they were
out of the question.

710
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,831
They are.

711
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,490
Continue.

712
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,999
With the deal still
up in the air, it's no wonder

713
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,374
monty's desperate to try
and keep a lid on anything

714
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:34,282
that might erupt
into an all-out war

715
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,123
like a scandal involving

716
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:40,749
the murder and looting
of a bedouin tribe.

717
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,373
Exactly.

718
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:46,114
You, er, seem to be enjoying
my hospitality, kahlil.

719
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:47,998
Very much, lord lofthouse.

720
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,498
Very much.

721
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,658
Lofty? Yes?

722
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:54,996
Have you met... er, cosie widrig?

723
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,704
He's just returned
from an American mission

724
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,365
to the Belgian Congo.

725
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:00,873
Oh, not now, prudence.

726
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,482
Enchanté, monsieur.

727
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,373
- Enchante.
- Lofty!

728
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:07,079
I knew I should never have
trusted you, kahlil.

729
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,990
- Lofty!
- I mean, we... we had a...

730
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:11,032
We had a gentlemen's agreement.

731
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,948
I thought we were both
men of honour.

732
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,786
Seems I was mistaken.

733
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,199
There's no need for this,
lord lofthouse.

734
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:20,412
In the end, kahlil,
you and your people,

735
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,699
you're nothing but
a bunch of barbarians!

736
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,206
Oh! Gosh!

737
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:25,851
Lofty,
the sheikh's your guest!

738
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,706
Pull yourself together,
lord lofthouse!

739
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,240
No!

740
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,914
What are you all looking at?

741
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,664
I need some air!

742
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,744
Shirin?

743
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:44,499
Come upstairs and pack,
immediately.

744
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,536
I sacrificed everything!

745
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:54,915
Everything for the British
in Palestine.

746
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,740
In good faith.

747
01:00:57,917 --> 01:00:59,532
My mistake.

748
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,448
Uh, everyone...

749
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,286
Keep dancing.

750
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,993
I can't believe kahlil
has betrayed me like this.

751
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:22,909
The bastard!

752
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,706
Miss Fisher.

753
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:31,114
I've come a long way
to finish our conversation.

754
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:35,114
Well, I certainly hope my
repartee is worth the journey.

755
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,873
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,

756
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:38,682
you will appear before me
at Scotland yard

757
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,241
to explain why you shouldn't
be charged with the crime

758
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:42,748
of releasing shirin abbas

759
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,374
from his majesty's prison
in Jerusalem.

760
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,874
10am sharp.

761
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:49,657
Goodnight, miss Fisher.

762
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,240
Excuse me, sir.

763
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,453
Your brother thought
you might like coffee

764
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,741
served in the drawing room.

765
01:01:58,917 --> 01:02:01,659
Tell Jonathon I'm wretched
enough where I am,

766
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,573
thank you, crippins.

767
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,200
Dinner and a show.
You've outdone yourself.

768
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,039
It's not over yet.

769
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:18,823
Miss Fisher, quickly!

770
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,619
Sheikh kahlil!

771
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:33,453
- I can't see him.
- Get back.

772
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,448
Sheikh kahlil!

773
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:45,993
Too late.

774
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:48,203
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no, no. Stay back.

775
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,740
- Stay back.
- No!

776
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:51,248
Oh, my...!

777
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,661
Shirin, darling, my child.

778
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,494
Come outside.

779
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,323
Jack.

780
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,412
A clear line of sight
to the sheikh's room.

781
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:47,030
Wherever you go, miss Fisher,
trouble follows.

782
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,620
I'd prefer to think
of it as the other way around.

783
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,123
Good evening, superintendent.

784
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:53,999
Sir. German-manufactured.

785
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:57,034
But turkish issue. 1896-'97.

786
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,573
Hmph.

787
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:14,748
You seem to be missing a button

788
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,657
from your waistcoat,
lord lofthouse.

789
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:20,496
And it seems at least 100 people
witnessed a heated argument

790
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,828
between yourself
and the deceased.

791
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,958
Well, it was a business meeting.
What do you expect?

792
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,787
Where did you go when
you left the ballroom tonight?

793
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,789
I went outside.

794
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,115
- For some air.
- That's right.

795
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:36,873
He was with me.

796
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:39,533
And when you heard the gunshot,

797
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,824
was he with you then?

798
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:46,780
Excuse me, sir, I think you were
in the kitchen at the time,

799
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,415
asking cook
to hurry along the coffee.

800
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,698
Yes.

801
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:55,615
That's right, yes.

802
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,934
When I looked
through the keyhole,

803
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:52,324
there was no key in the lock,
but why wouldn't there be

804
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,100
if the sheikh had simply
locked the door?

805
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,492
But if someone had locked
the door from the outside

806
01:05:57,667 --> 01:05:59,498
and posted the key...

807
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:13,955
The sheikh was shot
in the heart.

808
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,831
But the bloodstain
is much nearer

809
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,740
to where his feet were
when we found him.

810
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,407
As if the body
had been spun around

811
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,789
by someone inside the room.

812
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,448
Who threw the gun
out of the window.

813
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:23,865
Locked the door, posted the key

814
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,393
and descended via
the service stairs...

815
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:26,873
“Huh!

816
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,790
I didn't notice that before.

817
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,203
Some religions associate
the eye of the peacock feather

818
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,331
with the eyes of the stars...

819
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,240
Or the guardians of royalty.

820
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:55,282
Or...

821
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:05,874
The all-seeing eye of god.

822
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:13,947
Jack... there's an inscription.

823
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,582
No. No, take it away!

824
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,206
I'm just an innocent
archaeologist.

825
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,706
I'm not a detective.

826
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,285
I've been kicked
out of Palestine.

827
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,119
I've been set alight.
And now this!

828
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,532
No, I...

829
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,494
I'm sorry about the fire,
professor.

830
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,999
But shirin's uncle
has been murdered.

831
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:34,408
I can't help you
if you shoot me dead.

832
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,369
No.

833
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:41,157
But you don't need
your left foot.

834
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:46,041
"If this treasure is
removed from its sacred place,

835
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:50,372
"may the desert sands rise
and engulf the land,

836
01:07:50,542 --> 01:07:54,160
"and may all the people
of the inhabited world..."

837
01:07:55,292 --> 01:07:57,658
"Perish entombed"

838
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:02,122
"when day turns to night
seven times."

839
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,286
We also have this, professor.

840
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,498
An astrolabe.

841
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,623
- Take a look at this.
- Ah.

842
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,328
The star of argeadai.

843
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,788
Symbol of the argead dynasty
of macedon.

844
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,449
The royal lineage
of Alexander the great.

845
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:25,822
- This must point the way.
- Well, to the oasis at least.

846
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,743
You must hurry back
to the negev. End this curse.

847
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:31,407
End the curse?

848
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:33,619
That's what you do
with curses, Jack.

849
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,494
Too many people
have died already.

850
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,532
We have to return
the emerald to the crypt

851
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:40,790
before day turns to night

852
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:44,155
and Alexander's curse
becomes unstoppable.

853
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,948
"Day turns to night..."

854
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,740
"To night..."

855
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,742
"Day turns to night
seven times."

856
01:08:57,292 --> 01:08:59,203
It has to be a solar eclipse.

857
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,286
How long do we have
to find the crypt, professor?

858
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:05,165
How many solar eclipses
have there been since 1918?

859
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,411
Eclipses...

860
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:19,825
Two, four, six...

861
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,365
Oh, dear.

862
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:23,157
I wouldn't dawdle if I were you.

863
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,948
Thank you, professor.

864
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:27,081
You know I wouldn't
really shoot you.

865
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,115
With you, I can never be sure.

866
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:40,172
Eleanor,
what happened to Scotland yard?

867
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:43,245
Well, they left, but they
refused to listen to reason.

868
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:44,827
Jonathon, how's lofty?

869
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,581
Not good, now that
he's sobered up.

870
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,115
They haven't charged him yet,

871
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:49,768
but the police
are convinced he's guilty.

872
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:51,351
Don't worry.
They'll come to their senses.

873
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:52,706
Shirin, we leave
in half an hour.

874
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,490
Pack light and wrap up warm.

875
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:57,659
What? You're not going
to Palestine without me.

876
01:09:57,833 --> 01:10:00,666
Not after all of this.
What if you don't come back?

877
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:07,498
I only have a two-seater plane.

878
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,018
Well, there's always
lofty's tiger moth.

879
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:11,373
I haven't flown for a while,

880
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,282
but I could do with
a change of scenery.

881
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:15,119
We could fly in tandem.

882
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:16,828
Perfect.

883
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:23,200
I just hope she doesn't
fly like she drives.

884
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:24,990
I heard that!

885
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,581
Come in.

886
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,615
Urgent delivery, sir.

887
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:45,907
If that woman doesn't show,

888
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:48,870
we'll have a diplomatic
disaster on our hands,

889
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:51,408
with my reputation on the line.

890
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,449
I'm not sure
what I can do about that.

891
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,415
The railway deal is ruined.

892
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,744
Point the finger at someone.

893
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:02,623
You said you had the evidence.

894
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:04,703
Charge lord lofthouse
and be done with it.

895
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:07,241
Lord lofthouse's
waistcoat button

896
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:10,284
was already missing before
the sheikh was murdered.

897
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:14,283
He was framed.

898
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:18,908
That damned woman!

899
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:50,989
Yalla. Yalla, fatimah!

900
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,078
She's very well-behaved.

901
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:56,328
Of course.

902
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,365
She's a woman.

903
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:00,624
She cannot resist me.

904
01:12:25,667 --> 01:12:27,157
Hunting.

905
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,907
Did either of you gentlemen

906
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,870
happen to pay our cameleer
in British pounds?

907
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:46,248
No.

908
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:49,375
Why would we?
The job's not done.

909
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,698
Jack.

910
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:17,539
Huh?

911
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:27,074
- The game's up, Abdul.
- Throw down your sword.

912
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:36,539
Who gave you this?

913
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:38,619
Please. Spare my life.

914
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:40,623
I have children, wife.

915
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,328
Repeat the question, Jack.

916
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,582
An englishman!

917
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,615
He sent money, but we never met.

918
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,623
He told me to delay you
until he came.

919
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:50,202
Sounds like your friend monty.

920
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,536
Please. Keep the money.

921
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,869
You'll never see me.
I give my word.

922
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:57,624
No, you can keep the money.

923
01:14:57,792 --> 01:15:00,033
Take your camel and go. Quickly.

924
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,388
You could've
told me that you planned

925
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,910
to get rid of our only guide.

926
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:12,414
I didn't see the need.

927
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,583
So I should have
blind faith whatever you do?

928
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,039
Marrying maharajahs?

929
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,168
Meeting military deserters
in the middle of night?

930
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,623
I invited you to that.

931
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:21,157
Seducing cameleers!

932
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,851
I didn't plan
to seduce Abdullah.

933
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,206
You're missing the point.

934
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:26,036
If you'd let me know
what's going on,

935
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,290
then maybe I could help.

936
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,540
Or maybe I'll be absolutely fine

937
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:32,118
without having to explain myself

938
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:33,702
to you or any other man.

939
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:36,082
And if I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

940
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,367
I won't hold my breath.

941
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,700
- Jack?
- Don't worry about it!

942
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:59,538
I need your help!
It's quicksand!

943
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,206
Keep still. Grab my hand.

944
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:04,831
No, stay back! You're sinking!

945
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,532
I'm not losing you like this.

946
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:11,370
Not after all the other stupid
ways I've nearly lost you.

947
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:12,952
What stupid ways?!

948
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,081
Grab this!

949
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,414
Hold on!

950
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:41,576
The reason that I married
the maharajah of alvar

951
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:45,663
was because his true love
is the prince of patna

952
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:48,666
and if his bachelorhood had
been confirmed by his enemies,

953
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,370
then not only would he
have lost his throne,

954
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,703
but he would have been
stoned to death.

955
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,703
You saved his life.

956
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,577
Well...

957
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,207
I'm not sure how I could have
helped with that one.

958
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:06,079
But thank you
for the explanation.

959
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:09,036
What is it?

960
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:10,869
See something?

961
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,157
No. It's nothing.

962
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:19,831
Just the heat playing tricks.

963
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:25,119
We have to get there
before the eclipse.

964
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,740
Jabal alfarah.

965
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:18,405
No. This well was
once overflowing.

966
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:22,790
We used to play here
in the shade.

967
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:32,365
What's that?

968
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:39,788
That was the marker
that points to the goat star,

969
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:42,165
the brightest star
in the night sky.

970
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:53,198
Look, Jack.

971
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,085
My ancient Greek's not a patch
on the professor's,

972
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:01,619
but even I recognise
this word, dias, as Zeus.

973
01:21:01,792 --> 01:21:03,407
God of thunder.

974
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,661
Shirin, your tattoo.

975
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,245
It's a map. Look, here.

976
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:14,124
At the tip of the triangle,
towards the star

977
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:17,204
is the lightning bolt of Zeus,
marking the obelisk.

978
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,287
And here, this Mark
is the water of the well.

979
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,749
Then this third Mark,
like teardrops,

980
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:25,248
it must be the crypt of tears.

981
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:26,623
It's a perfect triangle.

982
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:28,999
So we need to find
the third point in the triangle

983
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,783
between the well
and the obelisk.

984
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:44,914
Here.

985
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,573
It's a rock.

986
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,373
We don't have long.

987
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:59,205
Alexander the great's
secret desert bride.

988
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:04,828
It looks like honey.

989
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,911
To preserve her body.

990
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:22,453
There's someone else.

991
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:26,198
Oh...

992
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:34,456
What is it?

993
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:38,909
A knife.
With the lofthouse crest.

994
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,664
And initials.

995
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:47,077
Your initials, Jonathon.

996
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,786
I just want to put things right.

997
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:06,415
You were here
with Templeton and Wilson.

998
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:17,203
We knew about the jewels.

999
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,615
Where are the jewels?!

1000
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:20,268
- Mama!
- Tell me where they are!

1001
01:25:20,292 --> 01:25:22,573
- Let go! Let go!
- I'll shoot you all one by one!

1002
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:30,161
Templeton stood guard

1003
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,370
and she led us here
to the crypt.

1004
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:38,198
The war...

1005
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,457
It had taken its toll
on all of us, but...

1006
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:44,365
Templeton was...

1007
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,244
We should never have
left him alone up there.

1008
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:57,244
Ohh!

1009
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:10,037
It was... an accident.

1010
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:26,373
Mama...

1011
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,998
From that moment on,
we were all cursed.

1012
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:58,579
You planted that emerald.

1013
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:01,873
You wanted me to find it.

1014
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,240
I thought if anyone could
help me get back here

1015
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:07,907
and find this place,
it would be you

1016
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:10,620
so I could put the emerald back
and end the curse.

1017
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:14,205
But Wilson didn't die because
he was cursed, Jonathon.

1018
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,365
Someone murdered him.

1019
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,615
And then they murdered
the sheikh.

1020
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:27,280
Someone who didn't want
your crime to be revealed.

1021
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:31,495
And who wanted to ruin lofty
for your sake.

1022
01:27:32,542 --> 01:27:34,282
Someone very close to you,

1023
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:38,656
who was always there,
who saw everything.

1024
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,116
Your father.

1025
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:51,498
Your real father.

1026
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:53,123
Crippins:
That's enough, miss Fisher.

1027
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:55,657
Drop the weapon.

1028
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,661
It was you. You killed them.

1029
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:02,119
They were gonna dig up
the past. I had to stop them.

1030
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:04,203
You murdered them.
You framed lofty.

1031
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:06,331
Lofty is a drunkard
determined to fritter away

1032
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,990
your mother's estate!

1033
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:09,998
She wanted you
to have your share.

1034
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:13,705
The emerald is all you have.
Give it to me.

1035
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,949
No, this isn't right. I have
to pay for what I've done.

1036
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:21,572
How will that help?
It will destroy you.

1037
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:24,807
We have to put the emerald back.

1038
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,495
- We have to end the curse!
- Move! Arggh!

1039
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,788
Phryne, get out now.

1040
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:37,655
- You don't have to do this.
- I do. I'm cursed.

1041
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:40,495
I've been cursed
since the day I was born.

1042
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:42,407
- Get out, all of you!
- Go!

1043
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,698
Come on, phryne!

1044
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,615
Put it back.

1045
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:52,124
You know I can't.

1046
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:57,119
Ah!

1047
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,415
Phryne! Come on, phryne!

1048
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,369
Oh! Ugh!

1049
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:14,248
Keep moving!

1050
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,490
It's stopped.

1051
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:38,623
Jonathon!

1052
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,832
I passed on your request
to the high commissioner.

1053
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,865
But unfortunately
it's impossible

1054
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:45,907
to retrieve your brother's body.

1055
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:01,578
How did you know, phryne?

1056
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,115
About crippins?

1057
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,869
I'd wondered before,

1058
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:09,873
about the small things.

1059
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,572
The way Jonathon always
looked out for crippins and...

1060
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,868
The way crippins hated you
whenever you taunted Jonathon.

1061
01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:21,499
I thought he was
playing favourites.

1062
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,248
He was.

1063
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:26,909
But it was when he spoke up
for Jonathon against you...

1064
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:29,914
To protect Jonathon
from the suspicion

1065
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,119
over the sheikh's murder.

1066
01:31:32,292 --> 01:31:34,283
Of course.

1067
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,490
That's when I knew.

1068
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,874
He hid the truth
from you, lofty.

1069
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:44,244
But he was still my brother.

1070
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,411
He was.

1071
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:08,245
This land will always be
full of ghosts, miss Fisher.

1072
01:32:08,417 --> 01:32:10,999
But thanks to you,
it may live again.

1073
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:18,159
- Ma'a salama, shirin.
- Ma'a salama, miss Fisher.

1074
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,036
Miss Fisher?!

1075
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:46,284
There was an enormous tarantula!

1076
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:50,530
You, uh... you shot a spider?

1077
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:52,619
No. I missed.

1078
01:32:52,792 --> 01:32:54,282
It went that way!

1079
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:11,573
Got it.

1080
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,874
It's my only fear, Jack.

1081
01:33:26,292 --> 01:33:27,932
Apart from spending
a long-distance flight

1082
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,331
with aunt prudence.

1083
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,240
I don't think that's true.

1084
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:33,782
No?

1085
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:36,998
What else am I afraid of?

1086
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:40,823
Me.

1087
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:45,993
You're afraid
if you fall in love with me,

1088
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:48,829
I'll turn you into
a policeman's wife and...

1089
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,911
Try to stop you
from saving the world.

1090
01:33:54,667 --> 01:33:56,453
Well, that can't happen.

1091
01:33:58,375 --> 01:34:00,286
I'm already a married woman.

1092
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,365
And I don't need to marry you.

1093
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:10,198
I just need your heart.

1094
01:34:12,167 --> 01:34:14,579
Because god knows
you've got mine.

1095
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:21,328
Jack...

1096
01:34:24,042 --> 01:34:26,499
I gave you that a long time ago.

1097
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,116
For a detective,
you don't notice much.

1098
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,494
By the way...

1099
01:34:56,917 --> 01:34:59,033
There wasn't really a tarantula.

1100
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:02,698
Good.

1101
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:05,581
I didn't really shoot one.

1102
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,493
Miss Fisher!

1103
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:46,703
Miss phryne Fisher? Yes?

1104
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,365
This is for you.

1105
01:35:56,375 --> 01:35:59,367
Jack, it's from
my mother-in-law.

1106
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:02,329
The maharajah of alvar
has been murdered!

1107
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:06,829
Yalla, fatimah! Yalla!

1108
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:20,742
J you gave me a glimpse
of your love before

1109
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:23,374
j a few months later,
a little bit more

1110
01:36:23,542 --> 01:36:27,364
j so now I want all of you

1111
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,745
j on the table, on the floor,
up against the wall

1112
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:34,704
j in the kitchen, by the door,
halfway down the hall

1113
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:39,073
j right now,
I want all of you...

1114
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:39,658
J you gave me a chase
down in old bengal

1115
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:42,415
j in Singapore,
there was no love at all

1116
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:45,120
j in London, it looked
like hell, I'm damned

1117
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,204
j but the desert
was our promised land

1118
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,240
j I want to fall back
into your arms

1119
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:53,580
j and then fall right back
into them again

1120
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:58,449
j right now, I want all of you

1121
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,207
j in the kitchen, by the door,
halfway down the hall

1122
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:04,866
j on the table, on the floor,
up against the wall

1123
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:09,411
j right now,
I want all of you...

1124
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:27,575
J on the table, on the floor,
up against the wall

1125
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,537
j in the kitchen, by the door,
halfway down the hall

1126
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:34,496
j right now, I want all of you

1127
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:38,790
j you gave me a chase

01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:57,825
j of you. J

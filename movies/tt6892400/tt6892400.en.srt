1
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:47,167
THE GIRL IN THE FOG

2
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,792
Yes?

3
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,542
When?

4
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,917
Okay, I'll be right there.

5
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:45,209
- Thanks for coming.
- How is he?

6
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:48,834
The EMTs say
his general condition is fair.

7
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,834
- Unhurt?
- Unhurt.

8
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:53,459
He can't recall what happened
before the accident.

9
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,084
Did he hit his head?
Does he have a concussion?

10
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,792
No.

11
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,834
So why is this urgent?

12
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,917
You'll see.

13
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,501
Good evening.

14
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,251
Rough night, huh?

15
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,251
Been here long?

16
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,542
- And you?
- 40 years!

17
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,834
But I retire in two months.

18
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,751
My wife and I have seen you
on TV tons of times.

19
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:44,584
When I tell Sara I met you,
she'll never believe me.

20
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,209
I'm Flores, I'm a psychiatrist.

21
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:54,376
What shall I call you?
Detective or Mr. Vogel?

22
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,417
As you wish.

23
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,042
I saw the accident.
You were lucky.

24
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,792
The fog.
The fog is to blame.

25
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:10,709
I didn't expect to see you here,
did you come alone?

26
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,542
Yes.

27
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:19,667
May I ask why
you've come back to Avechot?

28
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:23,667
Still looking into that girl
who disappeared?

29
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,459
Why am I being kept here?

30
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,792
What does the Police want from me?

31
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,376
Why do I have to speak
to a psychiatrist?

32
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,209
Mr. Vogel,
you got into an accident tonight.

33
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,042
I know that!

34
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:43,042
You were driving alone,
there was no injury.

35
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,542
I'm fine,
how many times must I tell you?

36
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:51,501
So whose blood is that
on your clothes?

37
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,417
You're right.

38
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,709
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

39
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,334
I wasn't even going to open up today.

40
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:37,584
I thought, who on earth
would come here on Christmas?

41
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:44,042
A few years ago it was different:
families, kids...

42
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:48,709
Then no one set foot up here anymore.

43
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:55,792
This is the last hotel left in Avechot.

44
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,584
Here about the girl?

45
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,417
- Know her?
- I know her parents.

46
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:14,834
The Kastners are lovely people.

47
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,709
They didn't deserve
what happened to them.

48
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,792
May God forgive us.

49
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,667
I should shut this place down
for good...

50
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,667
If I were you I wouldn't.

51
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:43,667
Soon...
people will be flocking here.

52
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,167
Detective Vogel?

53
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:03,459
Sir, everyone is here,
it's all set as requested.

54
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,751
Where does this road lead?

55
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,334
Nowhere. The valley is a dead end.

56
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:16,376
You mean this is the only way
in and out of town?

57
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,251
Basically, yes.

58
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,834
Sir, the briefing starts in 20 minutes.

59
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:33,001
They can wait.
Take me to the Kastners.

60
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,959
Anna Lou was always so responsible,
even as a kid.

61
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:46,209
She helps out at home,
looks after her siblings,

62
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,501
all her teachers sing her praises.

63
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,667
She recently became a catechist
in our confraternity.

64
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,792
They say it's normal
for kids her age to rebel.

65
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,667
My daughter didn't.

66
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,209
We're very close, she's a lot like me.

67
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:34,542
She made this for me,
she gave it to me a week ago.

68
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:43,376
Did you notice any recent changes,
even minor, in Anna Lou?

69
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,542
Meaning?

70
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,376
Did she eat and sleep?
Was she aloof, grumpy, more cheerful?

71
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:56,084
No, she was the same old Anna Lou.

72
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,667
Did your daughter
meet anyone recently?

73
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,126
A new friend?

74
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,917
She would've told me.
Anna Lou confided in me.

75
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:13,501
Did Anna Lou have a cell phone?
Did she use social media?

76
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,251
The confraternity
looked down on the Internet.

77
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,584
It's full of perils,
especially for youngsters.

78
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,251
Ever been threatened?

79
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,709
Is there anyone,
a relative or acquaintance,

80
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,334
with whom you have bad blood?

81
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,584
No.

82
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,167
All the better.

83
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,834
You'll have to make a public appeal.

84
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:02,876
Feel up to it?

85
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,042
Borghi, wait in the car.

86
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,876
Let me be frank with you,

87
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:23,709
the media got wind of this story,
they'll be flocking here.

88
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:28,959
At times reporters are better
than cops in digging up clues,

89
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:33,709
and investigation details
aren't the only thing they televise.

90
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,042
Not knowing where to look,
they'll look at you.

91
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:47,751
So, if you have something to tell me,
anything, now's the time.

92
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:57,167
Tonight at the confraternity church,

93
00:11:57,376 --> 00:12:00,376
we'll be asking the Lord
to bring back Anna Lou.

94
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:11,459
We'll include your name
in our prayers, Detective Vogel.

95
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,709
Reassure them that nobody
will have to work on Christmas.

96
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:25,042
Welcome, I'm Amanda Mayer.

97
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,251
Do we actually need
a space this big?

98
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,834
We can discuss that later.

99
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:42,084
Someone took her.

100
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:48,334
Let's stop tiptoeing around it
and call a spade a spade,

101
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:52,209
or we'll waste time
and that time belongs to Anna Lou.

102
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:55,459
It's December 23rd, 5:00 PM...

103
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,959
Anna Lou leaves to go to
the confraternity church.

104
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,584
She never arrives.

105
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,084
She's not the type to run away,

106
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,792
as we're told by townsfolk
and as we see by her lifestyle.

107
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,167
She only had six numbers on her phone:

108
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:17,417
mom, dad, home, grandparents' home,
confraternity, best friend.

109
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:21,834
Anna Lou's cell phone was shut off
7 minutes after she left home

110
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,792
and never turned on again.

111
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:26,042
Teens who run away from home

112
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:30,584
usually only last 24 hours
with their phones off,

113
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:33,167
so we can usually track them down.

114
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:37,792
The answers lie
in these 300 meters.

115
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:42,209
None of the neighbors
saw or heard anything.

116
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:45,209
Her kidnapper was familiar
with the neighbors' routines.

117
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,251
He knew how to go unnoticed.

118
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:53,542
The gas station's CCTV
monitors the only road into town.

119
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,209
- Is it functioning?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:00,876
- We have the footage.
- Who came in and out of Avechot?

121
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:05,834
Focus on those with a violent past
and former sex offenders.

122
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:09,667
Will we be paid overtime?

123
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:13,917
Dunno...
We'll be working on Christmas...

124
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,667
Our culprit isn't a duffer,
he's shrewd and clever.

125
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:24,834
When this is over, agent Borghi
and I will go back to the city.

126
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,834
But you'll be stuck here,

127
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:32,209
you'll have to look Anna Lou's parents
in the eye every time you see them.

128
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:52,084
Show us the way
and light our journey.

129
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:55,834
Anna Lou is 1.60 meters tall,

130
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,501
she has long red hair.

131
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,126
She was wearing
a light colored duffel coat,

132
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,167
a green scarf,

133
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:09,209
a track suit and sneakers.

134
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,042
She had a pink backpack on.

135
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,709
Our daughter is a kind girl,

136
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,834
everyone knows she has a big heart.

137
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:24,792
Anna Lou likes cats
and she trusts people.

138
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:29,001
That's why we're here
appealing to those who never met her

139
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:33,334
in the first 16 years of her life.

140
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,126
If you've seen her
or know where she is,

141
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:40,167
help us bring her home.

142
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:50,334
Anna Lou...
mom, dad, and your siblings love you!

143
00:16:55,751 --> 00:17:01,459
Wherever you may be,
hope our voice and love reach you.

144
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,834
And when you come home,

145
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:11,751
we'll get you the cat
you've always wanted.

146
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,834
Promise.

147
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:23,542
May the Lord protect you, darling.

148
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,251
Thank you.

149
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,251
Tell me about the confraternity
the Kastners belong to.

150
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,251
Is it a religious sect?

151
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:40,584
It's a self-managed group
with very strict rules:

152
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,709
creationists, pro-life, anti-gay,

153
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,792
and against pre-marital sex, of course.

154
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,042
Fucking fanatics.

155
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:02,167
They've been tailing us
since yesterday, even at the Kastners.

156
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,959
They're waiting for a photo
they can sell of the monster.

157
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,542
- Shall I do something?
- Like what?

158
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,876
We barely have enough cops
and they're inexperienced,

159
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:16,751
our control room is a pool,
and my office is in the locker room.

160
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,834
- We can ask for...
- Quit dreaming, Borghi.

161
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,709
They won't send back-up,
nobody will help us.

162
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,917
Unless we convince them to come here.

163
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,251
Detective Vogel wants you
to wear these and go to the river.

164
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:40,167
Painting coveralls?
What'll we be painting?

165
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,167
<i>Anna Lou Kastner, age 16.</i>

166
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:46,834
<i>Until this morning,
it was assumed she'd run away.</i>

167
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,709
<i>But that changed when Forensics
arrived in Avechot</i>

168
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,251
<i>to assist local police in the search.</i>

169
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:56,667
<i>The specialists inspected the area
along the river.</i>

170
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,834
<i>We don't know what they were looking for
or if they found anything.</i>

171
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,084
<i>Heading the case is Detective Vogel,</i>

172
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:06,209
<i>who, in the past, handled sensational
cases like the "mutilator" case.</i>

173
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,667
Sir...

174
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:38,042
the Alpine rescue squad
scoured the northern crevices.

175
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,334
Good, have them check
the eastern ones too.

176
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:46,042
- Where's the helicopter we requested?
- It's coming soon.

177
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:50,584
Hang up and keep hounding them
till you get an exact time.

178
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,792
How's it going?

179
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,792
I managed to get 10 more agents

180
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:14,417
and 30 Alpine guides to help
with the volunteer search team.

181
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:17,917
- It worked!
- Our TV ratings are up.

182
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,667
News shows will be opening
with our case. Where's the helicopter?

183
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:24,501
It'll arrive this afternoon.
I'll send it east.

184
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:30,042
Good... let it hover over the town,
I want everyone to see it.

185
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,709
Sir, he's been waiting for two hours.

186
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:42,251
Come in...
we can talk in private here.

187
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,667
Sorry to bother you.

188
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:52,042
I heard what they said on TV.

189
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,167
You think someone took my daughter?
Is that it?

190
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,917
Are you looking for him?

191
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,417
- Can you tell me that?
- Yes.

192
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:14,292
This morning my wife found this

193
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:17,459
while she was cleaning
Anna Lou's room.

194
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,792
Her diary?

195
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,667
Why her?

196
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,417
There's never a why.

197
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:47,001
I've done something I'm ashamed of.

198
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,209
The other girl in the picture...

199
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,667
is Priscilla.

200
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:59,042
She's Anna Lou's best friend.

201
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,542
One day I got her number
from my daughter's phone

202
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:07,126
and started calling her.

203
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,251
As soon as she answered, I hung up.

204
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,042
I don't know why I did it.

205
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,084
Mr. Kastner, why don't you go home now

206
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:25,459
and we'll forget about this story?

207
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:30,959
Borghi, drive him home please.

208
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,251
What am I doing here?

209
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:01,917
Even TV reception sucks here.
And it doesn't match my shoes.

210
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:06,042
Stella, I'm pleased
you've decided to join us.

211
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,084
Where's your girl-thief, Vogel?
I don't see him.

212
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:13,584
Just think, Anna Lou Kastner
never left this place.

213
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,667
Carry on.

214
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,084
A valley, how can I put this?

215
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,667
That was once charming,

216
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:25,042
then all of the tourists vanished.

217
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:28,834
A town in the middle of nowhere
where nothing happens

218
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:32,542
and everyone knows
everyone's business, or not...

219
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:48,084
February 23rd. I went with my friend
Priscilla to take her cat to the vet.

220
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,334
September 9th.

221
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:57,584
Me and the confraternity kids
are staging a show on Jesus' childhood.

222
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:03,209
November 23rd.
I learned how to make bead bracelets.

223
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,876
Jesus, cats, and bracelets?

224
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,417
Expecting something different?

225
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:12,251
Her mom read her diary.
Anna Lou knew it so she had two.

226
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,042
That's fake, where's the real one?

227
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:18,751
I knew I was right.
Religious family, upright daughter.

228
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,209
Are we sure that's the truth?

229
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:27,251
16-year-olds have secrets. Maybe
a boyfriend who is older, who's an adult!

230
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,292
Viewers love shady situations.

231
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,667
Rule one: sanctify the victim.

232
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,542
Monsters seem less monstrous
if people think:

233
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:38,084
"She was asking for it".
Don't you agree?

234
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:43,459
I thought you were still upset
about the mutilator case.

235
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,084
No, I'm not one to hold grudges.

236
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:51,042
I'll give you a 25 minute head start
on your competitors.

237
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:52,913
25 minutes is nothing!

238
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:56,584
Actually, it's an
eternity and you know it.

239
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,042
And what do you want from me?

240
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,001
Do your job well.

241
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:17,084
Someone left a white cat stuffed animal
in front of the Kastner home.

242
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:21,709
As of then, a silent and spontaneous
pilgrimage began.

243
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:24,834
Dozens of people come here,

244
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:28,792
stop, leave a gift, say a prayer,

245
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,459
a strong sign of hope
that Anna Lou Kastner

246
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:36,334
will soon be reunited,
safe and sound, with her loved ones.

247
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:44,126
Keep an eye on males
who have come here alone.

248
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:48,792
Everything's under control here.

249
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:52,459
He could be here tonight...

250
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,334
and he knows we are here too.

251
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:01,751
But he's aching
to stroll about undisturbed

252
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:04,709
amongst the people hunting for him.

253
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:08,334
If we're lucky,

254
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:11,334
he'll want to take home a souvenir.

255
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,542
My husband and I want to thank you.

256
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,751
It's a trying moment,

257
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:38,334
our faith comforts us
but so does your affection.

258
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,834
Anna Lou would be honored
by all of this.

259
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,667
The Lord is watching over our girl.

260
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:52,334
Yes...
Jesus is looking after her.

261
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:53,959
Amen.

262
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,209
The Lord is great.

263
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:59,042
The Lord is merciful.

264
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:03,167
The Lord watches over
the souls of the righteous.

265
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:08,667
His Word belongs
to his chosen children.

266
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:13,542
His prayer protects
the pure of heart.

267
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:17,959
The Lord has the power of compassion,

268
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:21,042
the force of mercy.

269
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,667
To my right,
the boy with the sweatshirt,

270
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:46,501
with the hoodie, took something.

271
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,667
- I see him.
<i>- Shall I stop him?</i>

272
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,001
- No.
<i>- Why not?</i>

273
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,959
He took a souvenir like you said.

274
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,679
Sir...

275
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:02,209
Imagine what would happen
if the reporters saw it.

276
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:05,959
He's just a kid,
he won't be going anywhere.

277
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,834
Shit!

278
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,542
<i>You think the people
of Avechot are hiding something?</i>

279
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,084
<i>I'm saying
someone isn't telling the truth.</i>

280
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:19,751
<i>Why aren't the police
searching house by house?</i>

281
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:24,084
<i>- Let's take another call.
- I agree with the other caller.</i>

282
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:27,126
<i>The townsfolk
are protecting the monster.</i>

283
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:34,667
What the fuck?
You think this is a spectacle?

284
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:39,959
You come here, convince us there's
a monster, and treat us like suspects!

285
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,709
Have you ever tried to see it
from another perspective?

286
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,959
I've known these people forever,

287
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:49,709
I can vouch for everyone's innocence.

288
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:53,209
- I see, I'm just wasting time.
- You're an asshole.

289
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,959
Not one scream.

290
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,876
Anna Lou didn't scream when she was
taken, or the neighbors would've heard.

291
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:12,251
Merely clapping my hands
caused them all to look outside.

292
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,542
You're saying she willingly
went with someone?

293
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:19,001
She trusted him.

294
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:23,876
Then she must've known him...

295
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,251
If she knew him...

296
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:29,042
Then Anna Lou is already dead.

297
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:34,792
They'll never forgive us.
You realize this, right?

298
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:39,001
People won't understand,
they'll blame us.

299
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:44,792
Before a body shows up,
we need a culprit.

300
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:51,334
<i>So, attorney,
you don't believe there is a monster?</i>

301
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:56,376
<i>We've forgotten the lesson
we learned from the mutilator case.</i>

302
00:29:56,584 --> 00:30:01,417
<i>I think about Mr. Romeo
and what he was unjustly subjected to.</i>

303
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:05,251
<i>- That man was innocent.
- Indeed, he was.</i>

304
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,084
<i>I think it's time to say enough.</i>

305
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:12,001
<i>We're tired of Detective Vogel's
magic tricks,</i>

306
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:16,722
<i>their only aim is to distract viewers
and the media from the facts,</i>

307
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:18,667
<i>since the rest is hot air.</i>

308
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:22,584
<i>Someone always falls for it
and someone always pays the price.</i>

309
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:27,792
<i>Attorney Levi, you defended Romeo,
did you ever have doubts...</i>

310
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:29,096
Hello?

311
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,292
<i>The boy's name is Mattia.</i>

312
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,001
He lives alone with his mom.

313
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,917
<i>They moved here last year.
Listen to this.</i>

314
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:40,834
In the past, Mattia was caught
filming lovers together.

315
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,042
He takes psychotropics

316
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:46,417
and sees a psychiatrist
in Avechot named Flores.

317
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:52,209
<i>Furthermore,
doubt is a moral duty.</i>

318
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:55,459
<i>But also an inviolable right
for the suspect.</i>

319
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,167
<i>Innocent until proved guilty.</i>

320
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,251
<i>Proved, not suspected.</i>

321
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:04,917
<i>Proved. That's all.</i>

322
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,012
<i>Thank you.</i>

323
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,376
Something might happen tonight.

324
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:12,167
25 minutes before
your competitors, as promised.

325
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,334
Stella...
happy new year!

326
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,667
Mattia?

327
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,042
Mattia!

328
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:38,084
I'm not going to hurt you.

329
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:42,334
Actually, I want to offer you
a possibility.

330
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,542
I'll make you famous.

331
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:58,042
Viewers are crazy about this.

332
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,417
You'll have all the attention
you deserve.

333
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:08,917
We just have to get out of here.
Take me to where Anna Lou is.

334
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:14,834
How about this?
We'll go there together with a TV crew?

335
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:18,667
What do you think?

336
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:35,792
You know who it is?

337
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:43,251
Oncorhynchus mykiss, better known
as redband trout or rainbow trout.

338
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:46,917
Native to North America.

339
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:51,709
Year ago, someone
brought them to Europe as well.

340
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,917
They require cold,
well oxygenated water.

341
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:59,292
They can be found in mountain lakes.

342
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:02,042
Interesting.

343
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:12,459
Tell me about Mattia...
he was brought to Avechot too,

344
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,292
but never settled in,
like the rainbow trout.

345
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:19,251
He came here every Tuesday.

346
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:23,417
His father beat him and his mom,
so they ran away.

347
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:28,667
The camera he always had with him
was like his shield,

348
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:34,251
a way to secretly observe
an unknown and hostile world.

349
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,042
Mattia...

350
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:43,959
His videos showed us
who was following Anna Lou.

351
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,709
In a way,
it's good his father beat him.

352
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:53,667
It's all connected, doctor.
It all is. It all has meaning.

353
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,501
Even bad things.

354
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,542
That's a bit cynical.

355
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:04,834
Want to hear something cynical?

356
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:09,126
Anna Lou probably died quickly:
hostages are messy.

357
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:12,376
She knew her kidnapper,
that's why she went with him.

358
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:16,542
Why did the girl keep a fake diary
for her mom? Why?

359
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:23,042
Why are we still talking about her?
What's the point?

360
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:28,042
Why not tell me about the blood
on your clothes?

361
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:31,667
What happened tonight
before the accident?

362
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:35,084
There's one word that sums it up.

363
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:40,959
Sortilege.

364
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,417
You thought you were safe
in these mountains.

365
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:50,834
You weren't ready to face uncertainty.

366
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:54,292
You were sure the monster
came from outside.

367
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,376
But deep down in your hearts...

368
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,292
brewed the suspicion that evil
had always been amongst you,

369
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,792
lurking in silence, protected.

370
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:10,709
And this terrified you
more than anything else.

371
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:24,709
Crows get lost in the night fog.

372
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:28,584
In the morning there are dozens

373
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:31,334
dead in the grass.

374
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:42,584
I know what you think about me,
doctor.

375
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:46,001
I was just doing my job.

376
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:48,417
- What would that be?
- It's obvious.

377
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:51,709
Making viewers happy.

378
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:56,376
Because evil is
the real driving force in a story.

379
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:01,917
Nobody cares for a videogame or story
where everything ends well.

380
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,917
Right?

381
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:10,126
The bad guy makes the story go.
Remember that. The bad guy...

382
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,667
If you think about it...

383
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:17,667
Calm down... I'm not assigning homework,
since you won't do it during break.

384
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,834
But I want you to find the time

385
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,792
after smashing windows
and robbing banks,

386
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:26,042
to read at least one book
on this list, all right?

387
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:29,667
Merry Christmas!
Try not to be too slothful.

388
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:31,584
Merry Christmas!

389
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:36,459
Teach?
I'll be on TV tomorrow.

390
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,167
I'm drawing the numbers
for the charity lottery.

391
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:42,792
It's just a local channel
but we all have to start somewhere.

392
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:46,459
- I'll end up on the big screen.
- Does your mom know?

393
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:50,042
- She's against the idea.
- Because she's worried about you.

394
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:54,042
Since she joined the confraternity,
she criticizes me a lot.

395
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:57,751
But she wanted to be a model,
so it's not fair!

396
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:02,084
Take real acting classes,
then maybe you'd convince her.

397
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:06,667
Why? You don't think my looks alone
will make me famous?

398
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:10,751
I took acting classes in college.

399
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,542
- Then you can teach me.
- No way.

400
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,417
Please, yes, please, yes!

401
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,251
But you have to take it seriously,
don't waste my time.

402
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:25,167
I promise, you won't regret it.

403
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,792
Here.

404
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:31,709
That's my number.
There's no excuse now.

405
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:34,501
- Merry Christmas, Teach.
- Merry Christmas.

406
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,876
Hi.

407
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:09,042
How long have you been there?

408
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:12,376
A while.

409
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,209
I feel asleep without realizing it.

410
00:42:18,084 --> 00:42:22,459
- Why didn't you wake me?
- You looked so lovely.

411
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:25,167
What's this?

412
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,334
- Mining law.
- Mining law?

413
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:31,667
I doubt they need more lawyers here

414
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:34,876
but it's best to stay up to date.

415
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:45,876
It was my choice to come here.
So stop it!

416
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,792
We're a family.

417
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:57,292
I was thinking about going for a hike
tomorrow, want to come?

418
00:42:57,459 --> 00:43:00,501
- Tomorrow's the 23rd.
- Yes, vacation!

419
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:07,126
- No, I have an interview.
- Oh right, silly me, I forgot.

420
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:12,084
You said you'd fix the gazebo
during Christmas break.

421
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:16,584
Right, I'll stay home.

422
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,501
No, go.

423
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,959
The neighbors invited us
to lunch on Christmas.

424
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,584
What'd Monica say?

425
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:34,959
She's convinced we made her
move to hell. So it doesn't matter to her.

426
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:37,542
Who do you think she takes after?

427
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:39,876
Her father.

428
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:55,126
- Where are you off to now?
- To the east slope.

429
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:57,334
So we'll see you at lunch on the 25th!

430
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:02,876
- Yes, Clea told me. We'll be there, thanks.
- Bye!

431
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:30,292
- I'm back.
- I tried calling you.

432
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,417
Really?

433
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:36,417
Sorry, my battery is dead.

434
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:39,792
A girl went missing.

435
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,292
- Where?
- Here.

436
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:44,126
Who told you?

437
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:49,542
A lady at the supermarket,
everyone's talking about it. Nothing on TV.

438
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:53,542
She must've run away,
maybe she fought with her parents...

439
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:56,334
She goes to your school,
Anna Lou Kastner.

440
00:44:57,084 --> 00:45:00,834
I don't know her,
she's not my student.

441
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:04,876
- She's our daughter's age.
- Stop worrying about everyone.

442
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:11,917
Once she's out of money,
she'll go right back home.

443
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:14,959
What happened to your hand?

444
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:20,001
Nothing, I slipped
and grabbed on to a branch.

445
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,792
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

446
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,917
Just a scrape, I'll clean
and bandage it.

447
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:28,584
- Monica?
- Downstairs.

448
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:31,292
Bad day?

449
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,167
Go shower.

450
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,584
Dinner will be ready soon.

451
00:45:57,167 --> 00:46:01,209
- I'll go bawl her out.
- Don't, she'll come up.

452
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:04,167
We've been waiting for 20 minutes.

453
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:07,292
- She has no respect.
- It's just a phase.

454
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:10,876
I was worse at her age.

455
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:14,542
Here she is! Hi, honey.

456
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:23,792
- What did you do today?
- Same old...

457
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:28,042
I went hiking on the east slope,
you should come, it's amazing.

458
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:31,376
We could get some mountain bikes,
sound good?

459
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:39,251
You can't sit in your room
until school starts up again.

460
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:45,542
Do some activity.
Go skating or learn to play guitar.

461
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:49,126
Who'll pay for my lessons?

462
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:54,001
- We'll find a way, right, Loris?
- Of course.

463
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,667
Of course.

464
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:58,722
You can't be alone all the time.

465
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:01,709
I can go to the
confraternity, that's free.

466
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:08,292
We moved here 6 months ago, and you
haven't found the time to make friends!

467
00:47:09,376 --> 00:47:11,459
I had friends!

468
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:15,292
But I had to leave them all behind.

469
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:20,751
- You could make new ones if you tried.
- I want to go back home.

470
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:24,126
Like or not, this is your home now,
got it?

471
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:27,825
It's all your fault.
I hate it here, so does she.

472
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:30,126
She won't say it because she pities you.

473
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:32,917
Stop it, enough!

474
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,251
Well? Find it?

475
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:37,334
She'll be thrilled
when she opens it tomorrow.

476
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:41,292
What do you want for a gift?

477
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:46,459
- No need, thanks.
- Come on, what do you want?

478
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:49,834
We can't afford gifts
right now, can we?

479
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:57,501
Monica! Open up!

480
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,834
Come on, Monica!

481
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:05,042
She's been in there for an hour.

482
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:07,834
She was invited to a new year's party.

483
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:09,368
- Really?
- Yes.

484
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:12,042
Great, then get dolled up.

485
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:14,792
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

486
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:19,001
We'll order pizza and drink,
we can at least afford that!

487
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:03,501
I'll never practice law again...

488
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,917
I'm sure of it.

489
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:15,167
Maybe I should look for another job.

490
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:21,876
As what, a salesgirl?

491
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:25,959
We can get by on my salary.

492
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:31,834
Monica is growing up,
she has certain necessities.

493
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:37,084
- Her schoolmates have everything.
- It would've been different with him.

494
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:46,626
Why did you stay with me?

495
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:53,834
Because you're a good man.

496
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:59,042
How do you know?

497
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:03,292
If he were you,
he wouldn't have forgiven me.

498
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:22,126
Okay, honey,
text me when you get back home.

499
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:25,417
Monica, don't forget.

500
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:27,417
Bye.

501
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:31,917
- Well?
- Her friend's driving her home.

502
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:33,376
Good.

503
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:41,751
- Remember it?
- Of course!

504
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:46,334
It was playing when you told me
you were pregnant with Monica.

505
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,584
I thought my mother would kill me.

506
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,959
- You were so young.
- I still am!

507
00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:55,159
True.

508
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,792
You should shave your beard.

509
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:09,917
You're the one
who wanted me to grow it out.

510
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:13,042
I like you better without it.

511
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:19,084
Okay.

512
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:24,126
I'll stop and get gas.

513
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:29,209
Thanks, bye.

514
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,584
- Hello.
- Hello.

515
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:36,001
You're from around here, right?

516
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:40,334
That obvious?

517
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:45,459
People are coming and going
from Avechot, nonstop.

518
00:53:46,334 --> 00:53:49,417
But my boss is thrilled
about this invasion.

519
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,792
It's the media's fault.

520
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:55,834
They'll be gone soon.

521
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,876
Hope so...

522
00:53:58,376 --> 00:54:00,501
How much?

523
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:27,126
It's him! It's him!

524
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:44,251
- What's going on?
- Go inside.

525
00:54:44,292 --> 00:54:46,792
Go to Monica,
we'll discuss it later.

526
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:59,959
<i>The footage the Police
are looking at...</i>

527
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:03,251
<i>was filmed by chance
by an amateur camera user...</i>

528
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:05,792
That's our jeep.

529
00:55:07,209 --> 00:55:08,917
It's ours.

530
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:10,876
I don't understand.

531
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:15,042
Do something, call them,
tell them you didn't do anything.

532
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,126
Yes...

533
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,584
<i>We're waiting for an update...</i>

534
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:23,459
<i>to find out
where the investigation stands...</i>

535
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:26,751
<i>We've been told
we'll be given an update soon.</i>

536
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:29,334
<i>Avechot Police.</i>

537
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:35,126
Hello, I'm Loris Martini, I own the jeep
that's being shown on the news.

538
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:38,376
- I wanted to ask...
<i>- Hold on, I'll transfer you.</i>

539
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:44,834
<i>Agent Borghi, who's this?</i>

540
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:48,667
I'm Loris Martini, the white jeep
you're looking for is mine.

541
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:52,167
<i>We're aware of that, Mr. Martini.</i>

542
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:58,584
Then you know the reporters
are making a mistake, why not intervene?

543
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:02,584
<i>I'm sorry, there's been
an unauthorized news leak.</i>

544
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:06,834
A news leak?

545
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:10,667
<i>That's all I can say.</i>

546
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:13,501
Find yourself a lawyer...

547
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:16,084
<i>and please don't call here again.</i>

548
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:19,417
Goodbye.

549
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,334
What'd they say?

550
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:52,584
It must be a mistake.

551
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:56,042
Where were you
the day she disappeared?

552
00:56:56,084 --> 00:56:58,459
- It's a mistake.
- Loris, look at me.

553
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:01,667
You have to recall every detail,
it's crucial.

554
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:05,001
Where were you
the day that girl disappeared?

555
00:57:06,584 --> 00:57:09,667
I was hiking in the mountains.

556
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:12,459
- Remember?
- Yes.

557
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:20,584
You were gone all day,
you came home at night...

558
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:38,209
You're right,
it has to be a mistake.

559
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:05,584
There he is!

560
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:08,292
Where were you on December 23rd?

561
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:12,167
Wherever the girl was, your car was...
why?

562
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,709
Why did you move here?

563
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,167
Coward, shame on you!

564
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:24,001
Martini! Martini!

565
00:58:26,709 --> 00:58:28,751
Answer us, sir!

566
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:35,417
Are you hurt?

567
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:39,334
- No. Who are you?
- Attorney Giorgio Levi.

568
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:41,667
What do those lunatics want?

569
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:45,126
They just want give fear a face.

570
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:48,167
- Clean yourself up.
- Thanks.

571
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:53,876
On TV they said I'd been following
Anna Lou for a month, it's insane.

572
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:57,667
Not you, your jeep was following her!

573
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:01,501
You need to watch your words
from now on.

574
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:04,959
The footage only shows your jeep,
that's it.

575
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,334
Where were you going now?

576
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:11,251
To explain to the Police
that I'm innocent.

577
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:14,167
You're free to do that
but it's useless.

578
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:17,876
If the footage were proof,
you'd already be in jail.

579
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:20,376
But your real problem is

580
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:24,292
the detective who is after you
is Vogel.

581
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:28,834
He's not interested in things like
forensic findings and DNA.

582
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:32,751
He likes to use the media
to reach his aim.

583
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:36,751
He must've given the TV reporters
that footage.

584
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:41,042
I don't understand,
what does Vogel want from me?

585
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:43,417
To stress you out...

586
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:47,167
to make you mess up or give
yourself away so he can arrest you.

587
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,042
Isn't he afraid I'll run away
in the meantime?

588
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,334
- Run away?
- Yes.

589
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:55,209
Where to?

590
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:58,709
Your case
is on every news show nationwide.

591
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:02,042
The whole country knows your face now.

592
01:00:06,334 --> 01:00:08,126
I see.

593
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:11,792
Professor, I'll be frank:
yours is a highly publicized case

594
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:17,167
so you can imagine there's no way
to estimate the cost right now.

595
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:23,501
- I'll have to discuss it with my wife.
- I'm at your complete disposal.

596
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,917
Professor?

597
01:00:38,876 --> 01:00:41,959
Use this to contact me.

598
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:44,501
- Really?
- Let's not take any risks.

599
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:46,667
What's there to be afraid of?

600
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:51,959
You don't get it,
this is just the start,

601
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,709
the storm has yet to come.

602
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:15,792
Let me make it clear:
we will ensure that Professor Martini

603
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:18,001
is granted every legal guarantee.

604
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,751
Is that why you haven't arrested him?

605
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:27,042
Or is it because, footage aside,
you have no concrete evidence against him?

606
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:32,917
You're right. The only certainty is Anna
Lou attends the school Martini teaches at.

607
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:37,542
Detective Vogel, will this end up
like the mutilator case?

608
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:43,167
What you reporters call
"the mutilator case"...

609
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:45,751
was an excellent
investigative undertaking.

610
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:48,417
But a court ruled against you.

611
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:51,042
Excuse me, Ms. Honer...

612
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,584
till yesterday Anna Lou was the focus,

613
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:56,209
now she's vanished
from your crosshairs

614
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:58,584
and you're focusing on Prof. Martini.

615
01:02:00,376 --> 01:02:04,001
I've come to Avechot
to find a girl who disappeared.

616
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,292
What have you come here for?

617
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,501
I'll give the floor to Chief Mayer.

618
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:19,084
- I thought Honer was on your side?
- That bitch is on nobody's side.

619
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:23,542
I want to reassure you that we are
committed to solving this case

620
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:25,917
and we're doing it as a team.

621
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,792
<i>- He's odd.
- In what way?</i>

622
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:33,292
<i>Evasive... unpleasant.</i>

623
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:35,292
Bastard!

624
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,834
Well?

625
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:49,167
We need that lawyer.

626
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,792
Maybe you could defend me.

627
01:02:54,822 --> 01:02:55,945
- Me?
- Yes.

628
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:59,292
I know nothing about criminal law.

629
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:06,459
We'll stop paying rent for a while

630
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:11,459
and I'll ask my parents to help us out.

631
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:34,126
Good evening.

632
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:39,167
- We have a search and seizure warrant.
- What's this?

633
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:42,417
We also need to take your prints
and DNA samples.

634
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:46,084
Can we do this here
or shall we take you to the lab?

635
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,542
Mr. Martini, did you hear me?

636
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:54,001
Can we do this here
or shall we take you to the lab?

637
01:03:55,459 --> 01:03:58,292
Fine, we can do it here.

638
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:32,751
Open your mouth, please.

639
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,209
Thanks.

640
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:56,251
The jeep was recently cleaned,
but only inside.

641
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:59,751
- Interesting.
- It's normal for mountain dwellers.

642
01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:00,920
Find any blood?

643
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,292
You really thought we'd find blood,
Ms. Mayer?

644
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:08,751
Some DNA, how else will we know
if Anna Lou was in this car?

645
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:10,792
There's some DNA.

646
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:13,917
Of a cat, or rather cat hairs.

647
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:16,709
A red and brown calico cat.

648
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:19,001
There was lots on the seat and rugs.

649
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,542
There's a problem.

650
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:34,459
Get rid of them!

651
01:05:35,251 --> 01:05:36,751
Stop, leave!

652
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,167
Mrs. Kastner!

653
01:05:41,334 --> 01:05:43,376
Remember me?

654
01:05:45,126 --> 01:05:48,001
It's cold, why don't we go inside?

655
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:51,959
- I need to tidy up here.
- Let's go chat inside.

656
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:57,959
That man? That professor?

657
01:05:58,376 --> 01:06:01,167
Do you really think he did it?

658
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:05,876
He doesn't seem bad.
I think he's innocent.

659
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:10,209
Or you'd already know
where he's holding her prisoner.

660
01:06:10,376 --> 01:06:12,417
We're watching him.

661
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:15,084
But time is ticking...

662
01:06:15,584 --> 01:06:18,084
and Anna Lou might be hungry!

663
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:23,709
And if you're watching him,
who'll bring her food?

664
01:06:26,334 --> 01:06:28,501
Let me.

665
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:32,751
Take her home.

666
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,792
Thanks.

667
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:41,501
Dr. Flores had warned us,

668
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:44,167
it's the sleeping pills she's taking.

669
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:02,001
"He's innocent."

670
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,792
What's happened so far
doesn't surprise me.

671
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,417
I'd say it's rather predictable.

672
01:07:15,584 --> 01:07:17,917
You mean, this persecution?

673
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:21,167
It's like they've already decided
my husband's guilty.

674
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:24,792
Why haven't they called me in
for questioning, attorney?

675
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,459
I can to talk to Vogel and explain.

676
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,917
Because he doesn't need that.

677
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:36,209
He just wants to feed the media
and viewers gossip to buy time.

678
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:41,167
So he can wait until they find
something concrete against you.

679
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,792
What if they find nothing?

680
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:50,876
Professor, do me a favor,
do yourself a favor...

681
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:54,459
forget that you're innocent.

682
01:07:57,584 --> 01:08:00,417
Remember the mutilator case?

683
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:07,209
For years the Police
were after a unabomber.

684
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,001
He hid small bombs
in supermarket products.

685
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,959
A jar of mayonnaise,
a box of cereal...

686
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:18,209
filled with explosives
and placed on the shelves.

687
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:22,876
Those devices wounded
and mutilated several customers,

688
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:24,834
but never killed anyone.

689
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:26,459
Before anyone did die,

690
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:31,876
Vogel finds a harmless bookkeeper
with a passion for model building,

691
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:33,959
Mr. Romeo.

692
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:37,834
Again there was no proof
but lots of clues.

693
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:42,209
Vogel managed to stage
quite the show for TV channels.

694
01:08:42,376 --> 01:08:45,834
He somehow managed to convince
a judge to indict him.

695
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:50,167
Moral of the story:
Mr. Romeo was fully acquitted.

696
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:54,667
So Vogel is a phony
and I'll be let off.

697
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:58,334
Yes, but at what price?

698
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:02,834
Mr. Romeo spent 4 years in jail

699
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:06,417
waiting for the trial against him
to come to an end.

700
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:11,417
He was handsomely compensated,
one million to be exact...

701
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:15,209
but in the meantime he had a stroke,

702
01:09:15,376 --> 01:09:19,417
lost his family, friends, wife...

703
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:24,501
every element of his former life
was destroyed.

704
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:28,417
Eradicated.

705
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:31,167
<i>Priscilla, tell us what happened.</i>

706
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,084
<i>I was downtown with friends,</i>

707
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:38,334
<i>the day before Christmas.</i>

708
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:42,959
<i>I suddenly noticed
I got a text message.</i>

709
01:09:43,959 --> 01:09:46,209
<i>From Professor Martini.</i>

710
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:49,834
<i>Why did this surprise you?</i>

711
01:09:51,376 --> 01:09:53,126
<i>Well...</i>

712
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:56,459
<i>I trusted Professor Martini,</i>

713
01:09:57,334 --> 01:09:59,959
<i>he seemed like a good person.</i>

714
01:10:01,084 --> 01:10:04,042
<i>But after what happened...</i>

715
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:08,667
<i>Can I ask what the message said?</i>

716
01:10:17,042 --> 01:10:20,376
<i>"Want to come
to my place this afternoon?"</i>

717
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:24,834
<i>We reporters are often accused
of only presenting certain things</i>

718
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:27,667
<i>in order to manipulate
the opinion of viewers.</i>

719
01:10:27,834 --> 01:10:30,834
<i>But this is not media fabrication,</i>

720
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:33,834
<i>this truly did happen.</i>

721
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:35,459
Clea.

722
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:39,251
The girl is just doing this
to be on TV, don't you get it?

723
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:41,709
Well that girl cost you your job.

724
01:10:41,876 --> 01:10:44,876
- Now what will we do?
- Listen, I know Priscilla!

725
01:10:45,376 --> 01:10:47,792
Those clothes and modest air
are an act.

726
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:49,834
We're deep in debt!

727
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:53,334
And you flirt with
a student, a little girl?!

728
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:57,084
She had asked me
to give her acting lessons.

729
01:10:57,209 --> 01:11:00,334
If I wanted to take advantage of her,
I wouldn't bring her here!

730
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:05,459
I've known you all my life, so I know
you're a good man but maybe not innocent.

731
01:11:05,834 --> 01:11:08,876
<i>You're smart enough to know
the difference between the two.</i>

732
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:11,542
<i>Even good people make mistakes.</i>

733
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:15,251
<i>I'm met with hostile stares
all around town.</i>

734
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:17,834
<i>I'm afraid someone may hurt us.</i>

735
01:11:17,876 --> 01:11:21,417
<i>Monica won't go out,
she lost the few friends she had.</i>

736
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:26,126
<i>I promised to stand by you and I will,
but she shouldn't suffer the consequences.</i>

737
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:28,626
<i>I'm taking her away from here.</i>

738
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:01,209
Hello?

739
01:12:01,376 --> 01:12:03,167
<i>At the cemetery in 30 minutes.</i>

740
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:07,459
<i>Go out the back door
and make sure nobody sees you.</i>

741
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,459
What do you want?

742
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:33,167
Months ago you found out
your wife was having an affair.

743
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:37,459
You moved to Avechot
to make a fresh start.

744
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:40,667
I know she left with your daughter now.

745
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:44,167
When this is all settled,
our life will go back to normal.

746
01:12:46,001 --> 01:12:49,667
- You really think so?
- I'm innocent.

747
01:12:49,959 --> 01:12:53,667
Nobody gives a shit
if you're innocent, don't you see?

748
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:58,167
People have made up their minds
and the cops won't back down.

749
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:02,209
They're spending a fortune
to solve the Kastner case.

750
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:06,292
They can't afford another investigation
and certainly not another suspect.

751
01:13:06,334 --> 01:13:08,501
That's how it goes.

752
01:13:11,001 --> 01:13:13,876
If I'm doomed,
then why would I need you?

753
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:19,584
To capitalize on this story
as much as possible.

754
01:13:21,126 --> 01:13:25,292
An interview with you is like gold,
and I want to buy it.

755
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:31,001
The offer stands only while you're free,
once you're in jail you'll be worthless.

756
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:34,667
Is that why Attorney Levi
made me come here?

757
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:39,917
What'll become of your family
when you're in jail?

758
01:13:40,084 --> 01:13:42,626
How'll they make ends meet?

759
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,542
Sorry, this is all so strange.

760
01:13:47,584 --> 01:13:51,459
Everyone considers me the monster
without a shred of proof.

761
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:54,792
Even my wife doubts me.
Isn't that insane?

762
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:04,376
But I know who I am.

763
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:10,542
So it's out of the question, I will not
exploit the suffering of a family.

764
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:15,501
You can tell my attorney that too.

765
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:29,459
"He's innocent."

766
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,459
<i>Why are you calling so late?</i>

767
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:45,126
I hear you're into lawyers
now too.

768
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:48,334
<i>I don't recall ever getting
a marriage proposal from you, Vogel.</i>

769
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:52,292
Your little pal has his greasy
hands on my case already,

770
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:55,042
you used to be better
at picking sides.

771
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:58,251
<i>I pick facts,
that's how I sell my product.</i>

772
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:02,542
<i>Find proof to nail the professor,
you'd do us all a favor.</i>

773
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:05,751
Is that why you texted me
from an anonymous number?

774
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:08,334
<i>I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.</i>

775
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:11,667
Want to face off with me again,
like on the mutilator case?

776
01:15:11,834 --> 01:15:15,126
<i>Fuck off, Vogel.
You and your silly paranoia.</i>

777
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:19,417
<i>Before running your mouth,
try calling that anonymous number.</i>

778
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:03,042
Hello?

779
01:16:05,084 --> 01:16:07,542
I know where that is.

780
01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:11,834
At 11:00? Okay.

781
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,334
Tell him I'll be there.

782
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:45,376
Why did you want to meet me here?

783
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:48,667
For once, no microphones
or cameras,

784
01:18:48,834 --> 01:18:51,751
no pesky newshounds,
just me and you.

785
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:57,959
I want to give you the chance
to convince me I'm wrong,

786
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:04,251
that your involvement in this story
is a big misunderstanding.

787
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:14,834
Where shall we start?

788
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:21,376
You have no alibi for that day
and you wounded your hand.

789
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:24,084
I see the wound hasn't healed yet.

790
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:30,959
It was an accident, I slipped
and grabbed on to a branch to not fall.

791
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:38,126
We examined the inside
of your jeep,

792
01:19:38,459 --> 01:19:41,084
we found no DNA from Anna Lou,

793
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:47,209
but oddly enough, we found cat hairs.

794
01:19:50,959 --> 01:19:53,334
We don't have a cat.

795
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:59,876
What would you say if,
thanks to that animal,

796
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:05,167
I were able to place you
at the scene of the crime?

797
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:17,084
Anna Lou had a sort of guardian angel...

798
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:19,751
a boy named Mattia.

799
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,167
- Mattia?
- Yes.

800
01:20:22,209 --> 01:20:27,084
He followed her everywhere
and filmed her, he's probably in love.

801
01:20:27,251 --> 01:20:31,376
Thanks to his video,
we were able to spot your jeep.

802
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:38,334
Upon further examination,
we found other details too.

803
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,042
Days before her disappearance,

804
01:20:41,084 --> 01:20:43,959
a cat was wandering
near the Kastner home,

805
01:20:45,126 --> 01:20:47,501
a stray cat...

806
01:20:48,584 --> 01:20:50,792
See what's on his neck?

807
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:59,917
Anna Lou put that on him.

808
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:05,626
The kidnapper used the cat as bait.

809
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:10,834
He left it there a few days before,
let it wander the neighborhood freely,

810
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:16,126
knowing that Anna Lou,
who loved cats but couldn't have one,

811
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:18,501
would've spotted him.

812
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:22,751
So, professor Martini,
I will stop persecuting you.

813
01:21:23,876 --> 01:21:27,126
If I manage to find that cat,

814
01:21:28,334 --> 01:21:30,126
it's done.

815
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:12,167
Someone once said
the devil's dumbest sin is vanity.

816
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:04,376
During our last class,
I explained that all authors

817
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:08,042
are inspired by something
someone wrote before them.

818
01:26:08,959 --> 01:26:12,417
The first rule for a great novelist
is to copy.

819
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:25,292
I also told you that evil
is the driving force of a story.

820
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:29,751
We must find a sacrificial victim,

821
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:33,667
preferably someone who's innocent.

822
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:39,126
The leading character must be evasive,
everyone should suspect him.

823
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:42,751
In literature people kill for hate,

824
01:26:43,667 --> 01:26:47,042
but in real life,
the motive is usually money.

825
01:26:56,417 --> 01:26:58,667
Nice words.

826
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,334
We found Anna Lou's backpack.

827
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:18,667
Not her body though,
but we don't need it...

828
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:22,334
because your blood
was on her backpack, professor.

829
01:27:28,334 --> 01:27:31,542
Now we really must be going.

830
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:37,917
Tell me, what's a psychiatrist
doing in a quiet place like Avechot?

831
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:42,459
Suicides. Overly quiet places kill,
didn't you know?

832
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:45,209
It wipes out the fear of dying.

833
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:48,042
You're not afraid to die?

834
01:27:48,209 --> 01:27:50,667
Every day, for 30 years.

835
01:27:50,834 --> 01:27:54,001
Three bypasses, a sudden heart attack.

836
01:27:54,334 --> 01:27:58,334
I was already a husband and father,
I was young.

837
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:01,667
You don't expect it at that age.

838
01:28:01,834 --> 01:28:04,209
But I survived.

839
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:10,251
It seems to me
that you're not afraid of death.

840
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:16,251
Those surrounded by others' deaths
don't think about their own.

841
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:19,459
Is that why
you don't feel bad about Romeo?

842
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:25,209
You don't feel responsible
for the stroke he had in jail?

843
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:30,251
A court decided
that Mr. Romeo was innocent,

844
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:35,459
he was generously compensated

845
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:38,042
for the injustice he endured.

846
01:28:38,209 --> 01:28:42,459
An amount of money
that you and I will never see.

847
01:28:45,459 --> 01:28:48,209
Fine, I'm willing to admit it.

848
01:28:48,834 --> 01:28:50,542
It's my fault.

849
01:28:51,334 --> 01:28:57,334
But tell me this, why did the mutilator's
bombings stop after he was arrested?

850
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:01,876
No more explosives, no more victims.

851
01:29:04,417 --> 01:29:07,001
You did it, didn't you?

852
01:29:07,251 --> 01:29:11,501
Someone once said
the devil's dumbest sin is vanity.

853
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:23,167
You tampered with the evidence
to nail Martini.

854
01:29:25,876 --> 01:29:28,334
Justice doesn't boost ratings.

855
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:31,334
Nobody cares about justice.

856
01:29:34,584 --> 01:29:38,292
<i>Even if Anna Lou Kastner's body
hasn't been found,</i>

857
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:42,751
<i>the magistracy is charging
Loris Martini with homicide.</i>

858
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,251
<i>The professor
was put in solitary confinement</i>

859
01:29:45,417 --> 01:29:47,792
<i>due to death threats received
from other inmates,</i>

860
01:29:47,959 --> 01:29:50,917
<i>who abide by
the so-called "code of honor",</i>

861
01:29:51,084 --> 01:29:54,542
<i>hence will not tolerate
someone who killed a minor.</i>

862
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:04,959
<i>- Took you long enough.</i>
- Who are you, what do you want?

863
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:07,959
I'm Beatrice Leman, a reporter.

864
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:12,126
- How'd you get my number?
- This'll only take a minute.

865
01:30:13,251 --> 01:30:17,042
<i>Martini is innocent and I have proof.</i>

866
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:21,917
Listen, I don't have time to waste.

867
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:24,001
Is there a computer nearby?

868
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:44,667
Look up "The fog man".

869
01:30:56,042 --> 01:30:58,251
<i>Still there?</i>

870
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:00,334
Who's the girl?

871
01:31:01,084 --> 01:31:05,292
Katya Hilmann,
she disappeared 30 years ago.

872
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:08,417
<i>There's something I need to show you.</i>

873
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:11,042
Fine, let's meet.

874
01:31:11,084 --> 01:31:13,251
<i>- You come to me.</i>
- Why?

875
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,584
You'll see.

876
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:20,667
Newshounds deal with hundreds of cases
in their careers,

877
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:25,459
but there's always one
that sticks with you.

878
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:29,209
Maybe the same is true for you cops.

879
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,376
At times.

880
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:36,167
Well, the case that still keeps
me awake at night...

881
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:40,292
ended with the disappearance
of Katya Hilmann.

882
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:47,792
Katya was the last of a series.

883
01:31:53,876 --> 01:31:57,126
There were five before her.

884
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:24,084
The disappearances occurred
over a wide area

885
01:32:24,917 --> 01:32:27,584
at a fairly steady pace.

886
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:34,876
The Police always preferred
to believe they willingly left.

887
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:40,876
But you put all the cases together,

888
01:32:41,876 --> 01:32:44,917
hypothesizing obsessive behavior.

889
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:50,334
Age, between 14 and 16,
red hair, freckles,

890
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:53,792
are the elements
of his obsession, clearly.

891
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,084
But nobody believed you.

892
01:32:58,584 --> 01:33:01,251
The fog man kidnapped them!

893
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:05,292
I am certain this is all of his doing.

894
01:33:05,876 --> 01:33:10,876
It can't be the professor,
he lived elsewhere then...

895
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:13,834
and more importantly,
was just a kid.

896
01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:18,292
So you think this fog man

897
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:21,584
waited 30 years
to resume his activity?

898
01:33:22,917 --> 01:33:24,959
Why now?

899
01:33:25,126 --> 01:33:29,876
All this time,
I thought he had moved or had died

900
01:33:31,459 --> 01:33:34,542
but as I mentioned on the phone,

901
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:37,417
I have something to show you.

902
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:48,959
It was sent on the day
Anna Lou Kastner disappeared.

903
01:33:50,126 --> 01:33:53,167
Your name is on the envelope too.

904
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:58,167
I opened it, sorry.

905
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:27,959
What do you want for this?

906
01:34:28,417 --> 01:34:30,584
Money? A scoop?

907
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,251
The truth!

908
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:39,501
For 30 years they considered me
a delusional nutcase.

909
01:34:39,667 --> 01:34:45,167
The time has come for them...
to at least apologize.

910
01:34:46,251 --> 01:34:47,667
Right?

911
01:35:15,834 --> 01:35:17,751
<i>"July 19th.</i>

912
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:20,667
<i>I met a cute boy at the beach.</i>

913
01:35:22,251 --> 01:35:24,792
<i>We only spoke a few times,</i>

914
01:35:24,959 --> 01:35:29,167
<i>I think he wanted to kiss me.
But he didn't.</i>

915
01:35:29,292 --> 01:35:32,167
<i>Wonder if I'll see him again next year.</i>

916
01:35:32,292 --> 01:35:35,376
<i>His name is Oliver, what a nice name.</i>

917
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:41,542
<i>I've decided to pen his initial
on my left arm, the side of the heart.</i>

918
01:35:42,334 --> 01:35:44,334
<i>It'll be my secret."</i>

919
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:33,167
"Private"

920
01:39:10,417 --> 01:39:12,959
"Area sealed off"

921
01:41:12,959 --> 01:41:15,292
Detective, what are you doing here?

922
01:41:15,334 --> 01:41:17,626
Destroying that VHS? Is it evidence?

923
01:41:17,667 --> 01:41:20,001
What do you want?
Leave me alone!

924
01:41:20,167 --> 01:41:23,126
Does it have to do with
Anna Lou Kastner?

925
01:41:25,834 --> 01:41:29,167
Your fish all look alike, doctor.

926
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:34,584
Oncorhynchus mykiss, as I said
are redband trout or rainbow trout.

927
01:41:35,334 --> 01:41:38,834
- That's all you collect?
- It's odd, I know.

928
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,959
Why do you do it?

929
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:45,167
I could say I think
they're a fascinating species,

930
01:41:45,334 --> 01:41:48,792
hard to catch,
but that wouldn't be the truth.

931
01:41:48,959 --> 01:41:52,001
I already told you
about my heart attack.

932
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:55,751
I was at a mountain lake
when I had my heart attack.

933
01:41:55,917 --> 01:41:58,376
Something had just taken the bait

934
01:41:58,417 --> 01:42:01,959
and I was pulling it up
with all my might.

935
01:42:02,376 --> 01:42:06,167
I thought the pain in my left arm
was just a cramp.

936
01:42:06,334 --> 01:42:08,667
Then I fell backwards.

937
01:42:08,792 --> 01:42:12,501
While I was passing out,
I recall that next to me

938
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:15,542
was an enormous fish staring at me.

939
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:18,084
We were both about to die.

940
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:21,834
Strange, right?

941
01:42:21,876 --> 01:42:25,751
- What's the moral of the story?
- There is none.

942
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:30,126
But every time I catch
a rainbow trout,

943
01:42:30,292 --> 01:42:33,834
it ends up on these walls.

944
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:43,417
I'm now that bitch's rainbow trout.

945
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:48,751
I shouldn't have believed that gimp.

946
01:42:48,917 --> 01:42:52,501
She sold me to Stella Honer
to redeem herself.

947
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:58,834
Her scoop wasn't the unlikely
comeback of the fog man, it was me.

948
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:01,501
I became her trophy.

949
01:43:01,792 --> 01:43:05,417
It's so unlike you
to be duped that way.

950
01:43:07,501 --> 01:43:09,167
- Oliver.
- Who?

951
01:43:09,209 --> 01:43:11,667
The boy Anna Lou mentions in her diary.

952
01:43:12,209 --> 01:43:14,959
The one she met in the summer.

953
01:43:15,542 --> 01:43:17,876
In secret...

954
01:43:17,917 --> 01:43:21,667
with a pen she wrote his initial

955
01:43:22,667 --> 01:43:25,001
on her left arm,
the side of the heart.

956
01:43:27,209 --> 01:43:31,001
I often thought about that little "O".

957
01:43:32,001 --> 01:43:35,334
And it's the first time in my life
that I felt...

958
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:39,001
compassion.

959
01:43:39,334 --> 01:43:43,417
Your presence in Avechot
tonight is not happenstance,

960
01:43:43,876 --> 01:43:46,917
but your accident was.

961
01:43:47,084 --> 01:43:50,917
When you drove off the road,
you were running away.

962
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:55,751
It's not true that you are in shock
or lost your memory.

963
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:58,667
You remember every single thing.

964
01:43:59,334 --> 01:44:01,417
Correct?

965
01:44:02,834 --> 01:44:05,792
How would you feel if...

966
01:44:05,959 --> 01:44:08,376
I tell you I know who did it?

967
01:44:11,667 --> 01:44:15,084
Because I killed the monster tonight.

968
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:18,834
There he is!

969
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:20,334
Professor?

970
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:27,792
- What do you have to say?
- Please.

971
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:30,959
Give us a statement.

972
01:44:31,001 --> 01:44:34,292
How does it feel
to be done with this nightmare?

973
01:44:34,751 --> 01:44:38,084
Are you nursing a grudge against
your accuser?

974
01:44:38,292 --> 01:44:43,542
We'll hold a press conference soon

975
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:46,001
to answer all of your questions.

976
01:44:46,167 --> 01:44:49,584
Now the professor needs to rest,
please.

977
01:45:11,042 --> 01:45:13,667
- Dad, want something to eat?
- No.

978
01:45:13,834 --> 01:45:15,876
- A drink?
- No, thanks.

979
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:17,650
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

980
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:21,001
- Attorney, some coffee?
- Some water, please.

981
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:27,376
We need to talk about something.

982
01:45:28,376 --> 01:45:33,209
The Police will compensate you
for every day you spent in jail.

983
01:45:33,376 --> 01:45:37,334
Plus, the media slung mud
at you for weeks.

984
01:45:39,251 --> 01:45:41,376
What am I supposed to do?

985
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:43,917
- Sue them.
- Sue them?

986
01:45:44,042 --> 01:45:49,334
Yes. They know that,
that's why they want to interview you.

987
01:45:50,084 --> 01:45:54,209
They'd pay you hefty sums
and you could repair your reputation.

988
01:45:54,876 --> 01:45:58,084
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

989
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:04,917
Professor,
I know how you feel about this,

990
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:08,292
but you wouldn't be exploiting
the girl's disappearance.

991
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:15,501
What do you think?
I'm not sure...

992
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:21,959
A publishing house called.

993
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:25,001
They want a book about your story.

994
01:46:25,126 --> 01:46:28,084
You could talk about it on TV,
it's a good idea.

995
01:46:29,292 --> 01:46:33,001
People would understand,
everyone should know, Loris!

996
01:46:39,917 --> 01:46:42,709
As of now,
a new investigation is underway.

997
01:46:42,876 --> 01:46:45,542
Will you be looking for "the fog man"?

998
01:46:45,709 --> 01:46:49,792
We're examining the disappearance
of the six Avechot girls.

999
01:46:49,959 --> 01:46:52,167
Despite the fact
that it's been 30 years,

1000
01:46:52,209 --> 01:46:55,792
thanks to Anna Lou,
maybe they too will see justice.

1001
01:47:01,417 --> 01:47:03,667
You can't be here!

1002
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:07,292
An investigation is underway,
you can't take anything.

1003
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:09,792
I saw you on TV.

1004
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:13,917
Good job dodging the reporters' traps,
you learn quick.

1005
01:47:15,709 --> 01:47:18,126
Hand me what you took
from that cabinet.

1006
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:21,292
- It's private.
- Don't make me ask again.

1007
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,751
Now please leave the premises.

1008
01:47:50,417 --> 01:47:52,584
I heard about your promotion.

1009
01:47:53,917 --> 01:47:58,667
Kudos, you have your own show.
No, I don't want to fight.

1010
01:47:59,209 --> 01:48:01,167
Remember our deal?

1011
01:48:02,084 --> 01:48:05,209
25 minute head start
on your competitors.

1012
01:48:08,292 --> 01:48:11,917
You'll have to sign a form
swearing the diary is authentic

1013
01:48:12,042 --> 01:48:14,334
and relieving us
of legal responsibility.

1014
01:48:14,542 --> 01:48:16,626
Have you found Oliver?

1015
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:20,376
He didn't want to be on TV,
but he'll be calling in.

1016
01:48:20,584 --> 01:48:23,001
Are you sure the professor will come?

1017
01:48:23,126 --> 01:48:27,542
I did my duty,
and it wasn't easy to convince Martini.

1018
01:48:27,709 --> 01:48:30,001
I heard that thanks to this mishap

1019
01:48:30,167 --> 01:48:33,542
he'll have enough money for a lifetime.

1020
01:48:34,251 --> 01:48:37,917
That topic isn't part of the interview,
don't you dare bring it up.

1021
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:41,209
What's wrong,
don't you trust me anymore?

1022
01:48:41,709 --> 01:48:43,792
I never did!

1023
01:48:46,542 --> 01:48:48,001
Ready.

1024
01:49:56,834 --> 01:49:59,667
<i>Mr. Romeo,
tell us how your life changed</i>

1025
01:49:59,792 --> 01:50:03,251
<i>when someone declared you
a "monster"?</i>

1026
01:50:03,417 --> 01:50:06,917
<i>What hurts more than
a horrible accusation like that</i>

1027
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:12,001
<i>is the fear of not being believed,
that fear stays with you.</i>

1028
01:50:12,167 --> 01:50:16,292
<i>For years someone put
explosives in supermarket products</i>

1029
01:50:17,126 --> 01:50:20,917
<i>and many people got hurt,
including a little boy.</i>

1030
01:50:21,042 --> 01:50:24,709
<i>That's why you lived through
such trauma:</i>

1031
01:50:24,876 --> 01:50:29,667
<i>you went to jail, stood trial,
and were acquitted in the end.</i>

1032
01:50:29,709 --> 01:50:32,251
<i>In the end I got my family back.</i>

1033
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:36,167
<i>Due to this miscarriage of justice
you'll be compensated one million.</i>

1034
01:50:37,334 --> 01:50:40,501
<i>How does this make you feel?</i>

1035
01:50:42,292 --> 01:50:45,251
During our last class,
I explained that all authors

1036
01:50:45,417 --> 01:50:49,709
are inspired by something
someone wrote before them.

1037
01:50:52,084 --> 01:50:56,667
The first rule for a great novelist
is to copy.

1038
01:50:56,834 --> 01:50:59,709
<i>The fog man kidnapped them!</i>

1039
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:04,959
<i>I also told you that evil
is the driving force of a story.</i>

1040
01:51:06,001 --> 01:51:09,126
<i>We must find a sacrificial victim,</i>

1041
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:14,042
<i>preferably someone who's innocent.</i>

1042
01:51:20,584 --> 01:51:26,167
<i>Anna Lou had a sort of guardian angel,
a boy named Mattia.</i>

1043
01:51:28,334 --> 01:51:31,417
<i>The leading character must be evasive,</i>

1044
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:34,209
<i>everyone should suspect him.</i>

1045
01:51:34,834 --> 01:51:40,834
In literature people kill for hate,
but in real life, the motive is usually...

1046
01:51:42,334 --> 01:51:44,209
money.

1047
01:52:39,167 --> 01:52:40,751
Hi.

1048
01:52:42,042 --> 01:52:45,334
Did you happen to see a calico cat
around here?

1049
01:52:45,542 --> 01:52:48,042
Yes, I did.

1050
01:52:48,542 --> 01:52:52,251
Good, can you help me find him?

1051
01:52:52,834 --> 01:52:56,959
I can't,
I have to go to the confraternity.

1052
01:52:57,959 --> 01:53:00,876
Please, it's my daughter's cat,
she's crushed.

1053
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:03,334
We've been looking for days.

1054
01:53:03,709 --> 01:53:06,209
I know you,
you teach at my school.

1055
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,126
Yes.

1056
01:53:11,042 --> 01:53:12,751
All right.

1057
01:53:13,001 --> 01:53:15,251
Thanks.

1058
01:53:16,084 --> 01:53:18,584
Here's the kibble and milk.

1059
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:21,751
- I'll go look over there.
- What's the cat's name?

1060
01:53:23,917 --> 01:53:25,876
Romeo.

1061
01:53:26,042 --> 01:53:27,251
Okay.

1062
01:53:31,959 --> 01:53:33,834
Romeo?

1063
01:53:37,459 --> 01:53:38,959
Romeo?

1064
01:53:39,459 --> 01:53:41,084
Romeo?

1065
01:57:35,001 --> 01:57:39,542
The text message
sent to the girl to fuel suspicion,

1066
01:57:41,876 --> 01:57:46,792
the blood left intentionally
on the table so I'd use it.

1067
01:57:52,959 --> 01:57:55,084
In the end,

1068
01:57:55,251 --> 01:57:59,501
I don't think he picked Anna Lou,
no... he picked me,

1069
01:58:01,084 --> 01:58:04,959
and I find that somewhat flattering.

1070
01:58:07,042 --> 01:58:11,501
But it was all planned so that
the fog man would seem guilty.

1071
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:13,917
Who knows if he ever existed...

1072
01:58:15,084 --> 01:58:19,376
or was just a figment of
the imagination of a crazy reporter.

1073
01:58:21,834 --> 01:58:26,167
The mechanism revolved around
a simple idea.

1074
01:58:27,917 --> 01:58:32,959
Nobody was ever to find
the body of Anna Lou.

1075
01:58:33,667 --> 01:58:34,867
Never.

1076
01:58:36,334 --> 01:58:37,959
That was the trick.

1077
01:58:39,001 --> 01:58:42,334
No body, no proof.
That's why he got away with it.

1078
01:58:43,876 --> 01:58:46,126
And the initial on the arm?

1079
01:58:46,501 --> 01:58:50,042
Why run the risk of getting caught?

1080
01:58:50,834 --> 01:58:55,959
A killer normally commits
twenty errors,

1081
01:58:56,751 --> 01:58:59,876
but is only aware of a third of them.

1082
01:59:00,334 --> 01:59:04,667
Most of them are due to
carelessness or inexperience.

1083
01:59:06,209 --> 01:59:09,834
But there's one type of error

1084
01:59:09,959 --> 01:59:14,126
that we can consider deliberate.

1085
01:59:16,001 --> 01:59:18,501
It's a sort of signature.

1086
01:59:20,459 --> 01:59:24,376
"The devil's dumbest sin is vanity."

1087
01:59:28,834 --> 01:59:32,084
But where's the fun
in being the devil

1088
01:59:33,084 --> 01:59:35,542
if you can't let anyone else know?

1089
01:59:42,959 --> 01:59:48,251
After the show, you followed
Martini all the way to Avechot...

1090
01:59:50,792 --> 01:59:52,876
and killed him.

1091
02:00:02,292 --> 02:00:06,001
Yes, we're done, you can come in now.

1092
02:00:57,792 --> 02:01:01,251
A fisherman who only catches
one kind of fish.

1093
02:01:04,792 --> 02:01:07,834
It was a real pleasure talking to you,
Dr. Flores.

1094
02:01:09,864 --> 02:01:23,864

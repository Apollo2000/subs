So it's done then?

6
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,610
We were fooling ourselves...

7
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,279
It was a mistake.

8
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,315
Don't say that.

9
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,785
Don't call it a mistake.

10
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,757
We've already been through it.

11
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,126
There's really nothing more
to say.

12
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,861
I tried though.

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,099
You at least know
that much, don't you?

14
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,134
I know, David.

15
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,136
I know.

16
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,205
And what about this place?

17
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,040
We got it for the season.

18
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,378
You're the one who wanted to come
out here, for Christ's sake.

19
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,081
Picked up most of it on my way.

20
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,983
This should last you a while.

21
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,255
Thanks for coming by.
I know it's a long way.

22
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,723
Ah, it's nothing.

23
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,558
I was glad you called.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
Anyway, I like the drive.

25
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,195
The city can get
a bit overwhelming.

26
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,365
It's quiet out here.

27
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,802
There's some other houses,
but...

28
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,071
I haven't seen
anyone else around.

29
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,642
It's what draws people out here
in the first place.

30
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,911
The isolation.

31
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,249
I personally never understood
the appeal of it...

32
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,452
It's there... for some.

33
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,725
Another thing I'm having
a hard time with

34
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,326
is all this light.

35
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,096
It never seems to get dark
out here.

36
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,897
Can't get used to it.

37
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,699
I actually quite like it.

38
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,502
It's easier to get work done.

39
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,073
Yeah, but there's no sense
of time.

40
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,777
And it's much harder to sleep.

41
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,915
It's a shame about Eva,

42
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,484
really it is.
But...

43
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,887
Well, you know
how these things go by now.

44
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,923
It'll take some time.
Always does.

45
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,494
The shitty thing is...

46
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,498
it's a routine I'm getting
a little too used to.

47
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,836
I don't have a fucking clue
what happened.

48
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,907
You know when we first
started off...

49
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,144
everything was perfect.

50
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,215
Then when she left yesterday...

51
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,152
I knew there was nothing I
could do to change her mind.

52
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,555
It's like she was just
stuck on it.

53
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,991
Yeah but you can't
dwell on all that.

54
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:31,096
Replaying all these
conversations in your head...

55
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,964
wondering...

56
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,767
it'll drive you crazy.

57
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,136
You remember how it was
with me and Alma?

58
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,539
It took me almost a year
to get back to normal.

59
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,609
Yeah but that whole thing was
fucked from the start.

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,417
Yeah, probably.

61
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,988
So what're you gonna do
with this place?

62
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,092
Well, I spoke to the owner
this morning.

63
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:03,929
I'll stay the weekend and see if he
can find someone else to rent it.

64
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,297
Why not stick around for a bit?

65
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,599
You still have
the photo assignment.

66
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,302
I'd rather stay in town,
commute from there.

67
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,938
Just make a few day trips
and get the photos that way.

68
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,507
It would be much easier
to do it just from here.

69
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,744
I don't know...

70
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,914
I wouldn't really
be able to concentrate.

71
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,685
Bad memories, I guess.

Not many people out here.

77
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,721
Who knows how long
it would've been

78
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,957
until someone else came by.

79
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,292
Does anyone know
anything about her?

80
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,129
Did she leave a note?

81
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,266
Most of her family
resides in Sweden.

82
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,169
But she hadn't been in touch
with them for quite some time.

83
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,642
As for the note, I can't really
disclose that information.

84
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,310
I'm sure you understand.

85
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,083
Beautiful girl, wasn't she?

86
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,922
Such a shame.

87
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,898
I wonder what she was doing
out here...

88
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,700
all alone...

89
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,005
You mind if I keep this?

90
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,212
Sure... I've got copies
at the station.

91
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,852
Um, look...

92
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,522
I know we've already
kept you here a week, but...

93
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,592
I'm afraid I'll have to ask
one more thing of you.

94
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,060
What's that?

95
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,297
I was wondering
if you can extend your stay

96
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,333
until the investigation
is concluded.

97
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,535
Still a few things
we have to clear up.

98
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,237
Investigation?

99
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,506
Thought you said
it was a suicide.

100
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,542
Yeah, well there are procedures
we have to follow.

101
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,879
Still have to wait
for the toxicology report

102
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,381
to determine the final
cause of death.

103
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,918
How much longer
will I have to stay for?

104
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,788
These things can take time
out here.

105
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,391
But, uh, shouldn't be more
than a week.

106
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,964
I guess I don't really
have a choice.

107
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,632
I'm afraid not.

111

You do seem a bit off.

112
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,596
Maybe we should go somewhere.

113
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,964
Take a trip.

114

A trip...

115
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,868
I'd like that.

116
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,672

It must've been a shock for you.

121
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,559
Yeah...

122
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,794
absolutely.

123
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,300
I mean, I was there
in the water...

124
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,335
grabbing ahold of her...

125
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,104
bringing her to shore.

126
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,143
You should've seen her.

127
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,813
She was all bloated up...

128
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,050
her skin was pale white.

129
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,518
My god.

130
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,021
The strange thing is...

131
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,158
there's barely anyone
around here.

132
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,462
The detective wouldn't really
let on about anything either.

133
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,631
Well, there's not much
to wonder.

134
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,067
She must've been depressed.

135
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,835
Why else would anyone do it?

136
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,738
I don't know.

It's tragic... is what it is.

139
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,716
How much longer do they
want you to stay?

140
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,151
A few days.

141
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,153
At least that's what he said.

142
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,456
That's good,

143
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,424
because the office is
sending me out to the states.

144
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,893
I'll be in New York.

145
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:15,927
You're being transferred?

146
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,262
No, it's nothing permanent.

147
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,298
Just for a couple weeks to help
them get the new branch in order.

148
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,400
Just last minute thing.

149
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,103
You know, I was thinking...

150
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,674
The world must be trying to tell
me something with this trip.

151
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,945
First Eva...

152
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,381
now this.

153
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,749
Well look at it this way,

154
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,984
at least it can't get any worse.

155
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,459
Marie?

156
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,237
Marie, are you up there?

157
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,727
No.

158
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,771
Can I have one of those?

159
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,684
Who's this composer?

160
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,953
Von Fleischer.

161
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,794
You're quite fond of him
anymore.

162
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,629
Always playing this music.

163
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,134
I guess I've always had
a fondness for the bavarians.

164
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,670
My great-grandfather was one,
you know.

165
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,171
Now I do.

166
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,313

I heard you on the phone.

Even though I don't understand a
word of what you said, you seemed...

Then maybe I'll have to
teach you Italian.

You're sure everything is okay?

Let's not start with this
again, please.

You know I don't mean to pry...

I just...

Well I had
a bad experience recently,

figured I should check.

Uh, no, no. I was...

I was just wandering around

189
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:35,306
and I couldn't sleep last night
so I stopped the car.

No.

Well I've gotta be honest,

194
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,368
my Italian isn't
all that great either.

So are you staying around here
as well?

Yeah, I've got a cabin
just down the path.

Oh, then I'm surprised
we haven't run into you yet.

198
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,814
We really live just up the way.

199
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,983
How long are you staying for?

200
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,885
I'm not actually sure yet.

201
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,021
And is it just you,
or you're here with friends?

I'm, uh, I'm alone actually.

I'm glad I ran into you.

204
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,495
Not many people around here.

00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,897
I know.

206
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,933
I'm always looking for excuses
to go back to the city.

207

I imagine it takes a while
to get used to.

208
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,940
You know, a few friends

209
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,476
are coming in
from Reykjavik tonight.

210
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,912
You should come by

Yeah...

Hi. Nice to meet you.

I had at home.

I've been telling Jóhann
all about you.

220
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,273
I think it's made him jealous.

It's a strange place to settle
for the season.

230
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,005
It must get so lonely out here.

231
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,044
To be completely honest,
I didn't come out here alone.

232
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,112
- Oh, no.
- It's not the best situation.

I'm trying to make
the most of it.

234
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,549
But I did come out here
for a work assignment,

235
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,351
so that'll keep me busy.

236
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,919
Work assignment?

237

You'll be taking photos?

238
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,856
Have you ever heard
of Andrew Franke?

239
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,459
He's an American author. He
used to write here in Iceland.

240
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,395
I'm taking some pictures for
a new project he's working on.

241
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,065
So you'll be here
for a while, then?

242
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,299
I don't know.

243
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,470
It depends on a few
different things actually.

244
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,139
It's no the worst place
to end up.

245
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,941
How're you enjoying yourself,
David?

246
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,811
- He's bored sick.
- No, no. This is great.

247
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,879
I'm glad I decided
to go shooting today.

248
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,681
Otherwise I wouldn't
have met Marie.

249
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,450
Well, that makes the both of us.

250
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,019
Why don't I show you around?

251
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,594
Marie is always the one in charge
of these little house parties,

252
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,130
if you couldn't guess
by the crowd out there.

253
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,807
I always feel so out of place
with her friends.

254
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,510
It's not that I mind their age,
but...

255
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,946
they can be
a fucking superficial lot.

256
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,882
Though I must say,

257
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,284
I saw a bit of a kindred spirit
in you.

258
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,186
"Kindred spirits?"

259
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,788
Is that sort of like
love at first sight?

260
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,692
Marie tells me
that you're a photographer.

261
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:18,429
Yeah, well it's created a lot
of great opportunities for me.

262
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,998
Is that how you ended up
in Iceland?

263
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,101
Well partly.
I do most of my work in Europe.

264
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,270
I do a bit
of photography myself.

265
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,341
I started when I was in college.

266
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,812
It was a particularly
happy time in my life

267
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:38,816
so I became obsessed
with documenting it all.

268
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,829
These are actually really good.

269
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,599
It's just a few of my favorites
of my own work.

270
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,370
I've collected
thousands of prints.

271
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,505
Each marked off by category.

272
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,579
That's from when we met.

273
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,249
She's beautiful.

274
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,488
That's what makes her
so unreachable.

275
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,824
What do you mean?

276
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,560
Marie, like most
beautiful women,

277
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,262
is very self-aware.

278
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,333
Women like her, they have
the power to dominate.

279
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:33,838
Each whim answered.
Each affection celebrated.

280
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,040
I've known women like that.

281
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,144
I do love her.

282
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,746
Deeply.

283
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,417
That's the worst part
of it all, I think.

284
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,624
You know, there was a drowning
here last week.

285
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,493
Though from what I'm hearing,
it seems...

286
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,461
more like it was a suicide.

287
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,130
I was there...

288
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,332
What?

289
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,900
Well, not when it happened.

290
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,702
I'm the one who found her.

291
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:05,769
Christ.

292
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:09,840
- I didn't really want to mention it out there.
- No, of course.

293
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,109
That's a terrible thing
to have to go through.

294
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,978
Did you know the woman who died?

295
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,580
Elisa?

296
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,550
No, not in any real way.

297
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,585
I had met her a few times.

298
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,787
Tragic woman, really.

299
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,592
That much I could sense
even before she died.

300
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,394
Well it was a suicide.

301
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,399
The police have asked me to stay
until they finish the investigation.

302
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,167
Or at least that's
what they told me.

303
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,003
It makes sense.

304
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,504
I wouldn't stress about it.

305
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,807
So what are you doing
after the season?

306
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,109
Going back to Reykjavik?

307
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:48,879
No, I'll probably go
for a holiday soon.

308
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,016
You're always off somewhere.
Don't you get sick of it?

309
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,717
Oh god, no, no.

310
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,119
And anyway, I promised my sister

311
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,421
to go back to Rome
for a few weeks.

312
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:01,392
And Jóhann can take
that much time off?

313
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,561
Jóhann won't be joining me.

314
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,330
We need a little break from
each other every now and then.

315
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,666
It's the only way it works
with us.

316
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,714
Hey, where did you disappear to?

317
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,416
Jóhann was just
showing me around.

318
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:26,750
You've got a beautiful home.

319
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,687
I'm really glad he likes you.

320
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,189
He typically doesn't like
any of my friends.

321
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,757
What about me?

322
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,326
Oh, he loves you.

323
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,661
But then, so does everybody.

324
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,131
Isn't she such a beauty?

325
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,702
You know, it's sort of
a strange phenomenon, actually.

326
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,804
- In what sense?
- Well think about it.

327
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,473
Most relationships, outside
of family, are transient.

328
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,775
Oh, I don't believe that.

329
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,812
How many actual relationships have
you maintained throughout your life?

330
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:58,315
And I'm not just talking about people
you email with every now and then.

331
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:02,119
But I don't get this notion
of relationships.

332
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,354
When you're friends
with someone,

333
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,189
you don't have to be in
constant contact with them.

334
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,258
It's more just knowing they're
out there when you need them.

335
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
But then what does
that friendship amount to?

336
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,729
It's so trivial.

337
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:15,833
David, I think you're a bit
too attached to people.

338
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,268
Maybe you expect too much.

339
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,770
You're probably right.

340
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,973
I do tend to think
about other people too much.

341
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,343
And what about them?
Are they thinking about you?

342
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,178
The woman on the news.

343
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,181
The one they found on the beach.

344
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,717
Did you two happen to know her?

345
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,485
Must've seen her around.

346
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,034
Excuse me.

347
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,208
Horrible way to go.

348
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,576
Yeah.

349
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,125
You all right?

350
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:57,034
When you called I was a bit
confused, to be honest.

351
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,071
Confused about what?

352
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,408
I've heard stories, you know...

353
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,977
back in Reykjavik.

354
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,714
What stories?

355
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,185
Don't play dumb.

356
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,191
Okay...

357
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,627
you heard stories.

358
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,266
I'm sorry about that...

359
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,568
but I don't really know
what you expect from me.

360
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,742
Nothing...

361
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,579
Nothing...

362
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,056
You know, it took us
almost two hours to get here.

363
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:56,226
That's a long way to come.
Don't you think?

365
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,561
It's been a burden, I'm sure,

00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,297
but we appreciated
your cooperation.

367

I mean, I completely understand.

368
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,071
I'm just sad it ever happened.

We're a frail species.

You can say it's a disease or...

an accident or a heart
attack, or what have you,

373
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,523
but really...

374
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,160
they die because
they can't go on living.

375
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,298
That's a strange view
for a police officer to have.

376
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,735
It's what makes me suited

377
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,540
So then,

378
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,543

is it back to America?

how nice to see you.

I'd call Marie down

She hasn't been feeling well.

finding Elisa like that.

It's almost like I keep expecting
bad things to happen...

every time I go out.

Most people would've just
quit the job.

396
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,727
I have this portrait of her.

397
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,995
A portrait?

398
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,397
Yes.

399
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,499
They found it in her house.

400
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:27,103
It's this beautiful
black and white photo...

401
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,475
and I can't seem to get the
image out of my mind, you know?

402
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,910
It's normal.

403
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,017
Have the police gotten
back in touch with you?

404
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,453
No. Not yet.

405
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,789
I think I'll have to
stay for a bit longer.

406
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,891
At least until
the investigation is over.

407
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:48,893
Well...

408
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,395
they're not the most
competent police force.

409
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,838
I wanted to ask you...

410
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,441
did you get a chance to speak
to Marie much at the party?

411
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,976
Yeah... I mean, for a bit.

412
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:10,814
She... she was busy
playing host.

413
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,382
Why?

414
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,684
She hasn't been herself lately.

415
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,186
What do you mean?

416
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,755
It's been tough on her,

417
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,790
being away from Rome.

418
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,626
When we're in the city,
she's not as restless,

419
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:26,763
but out here she doesn't seem
to be handling it very well.

420
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:29,332
It's gotta be hard,
living as a foreigner out here.

421
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,702
Not everyone's suited
for the quiet.

422
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,671
Part of the reason we spend
so much time out here

423
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,874
is because of all
the distractions in Reykjavik.

424
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,943
It's a decent compromise,
I think.

425
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,246
Especially given the amount
of freedom I give her.

426
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:47,517
But now, she spends large parts
of the day on the phone...

427
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,853
speaking in Italian.

428
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:53,289
And you know... I don't ask.

429
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,791
Ever.

430
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:55,925
You don't ask.

431
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,963
It gets to a point when you
ask yourself, which is worse.

432
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:03,466
Not knowing, or the alternative?

433
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,238
Maybe that's
part of the problem.

434
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,108
We must seem so strange to you.

435

No.

00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,311
I'm not one to judge.

437
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,083
I had things fall apart with Eva
the week after we got out here.

438
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,985
And you were with her a while?

439
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,887
No...

440
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,357
and that's the fucking sad part.

441
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,325
I get my hopes up too easily.

442
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,594
Well...

443
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,730
at least you're not
too sentimental about it.

444
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,432
Or you don't seem to be.

445

At times, maybe.

446
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,938
You get hit
with so many disappointments...

447
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,107
after a while
it makes you wonder...

448
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:47,310
You want to know something
I learned a long time ago?

449
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,778
What's that?

450

The only things we can depend on

are ourselves
and our unhappiness.

00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,416
No, no, it's just...

490
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,453
Look at the way
she was at the party.

491
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:59,288
They barely even spoke.

492
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,191
That's how she is.

493
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,428
Jóhann's always there
to give her attention.

494
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,197
Why not get it from others
when they're around?

495
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,234
That seems selfish.

496
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,603
That's because it is.

497
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:22,311
Marie has a hard time seeing things
from other people's perspective.

498
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,914
I'm sure it's tough on Jóhann.

499
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,449
It would be for anyone.

500
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,019
And that doesn't affect
your view on her at all?

501
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:33,523
She's my friend and I really
don't wish to judge.

502
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:35,758
I find that so boring.

503
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,994
Well I guess there
is something about her...

504
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,164
draws you in...

505
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,000
If you're so curious
about Marie,

506
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,335
then why don't you
go over there?

507
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,906
She's probably still awake.

508
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,776
Don't do that.

509
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,779
What?

510
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,952
So quick to assume trouble.

511
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,687
So quick...

512
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,791
Blame it on bad experiences,
I guess.

513
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,062
And the fact that I can
never say what I'm thinking.

514
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,697
That's a problem.

515
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,834
Maybe you should talk
to someone about that.

516
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,237
Isn't that what we're doing now?

517
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,425
You know I really do love
how quiet it is out here.

518
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,295
So much more peaceful
than the city.

519
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,069
I'd like to have
a place like this.

520
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,941
You'd still have to hold
on to your place in the city.

521
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,946
Why's that?

522
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,216
Because you'd get lonely.

523
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,357
You seem to be doing all right.

524
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,393
For now...

525
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,645
I have to go away for a while.

526
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,949
I got a call form Vienna.

527
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,152
Paul's in the hospital.

528
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,321
The hospital?

529
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,527
He's gotten worse.

530
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,729
They're not sure...

531
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,073
It's just best
that I go see him.

532
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,642
I fly out tomorrow.

533
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,544
He's been a good friend to you.

534
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,315
It'll be good for you
to see him.

535
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,253
How long will you be gone for?

536
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:19,689
A few days... maybe a week.

537
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,060
I was thinking that
you'd come with me...

538
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,937
Wouldn't it be better
if you went alone?

539
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,574
I don't see why it would.

540
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,577
Unless you'd rather stay.

541
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,179
Jóhann...

542
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,916
I really think it would be
better if you went alone.

543
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,253
You know I don't do well
with sickness.

544
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:03,132
And you'll be fine...
Staying here alone?

545
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:04,834
Don't worry about me.

546
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,570
I'll be okay.

547
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,644
You don't make it easy, do you?

548
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,115
My sweet Marie...

549
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,254
No.

550
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,299
♪

551
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,768
So he just called you?

552
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,270
What's so bad about that?

553
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,173
He didn't play any games.

554
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:33,609
He just said what he wanted
out front.

555
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:38,514
And I must say,
he can be quite charming.

556
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:40,082
Charming?

557
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:43,085
Or maybe not charming, but
there's something about him.

558
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,521
Of course. He's American.

559
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,923
No, it's not just that.

560
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,727
You can just tell there's
more to him than he lets on.

561
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:53,729
I find that attractive.

562
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,832
So many guys are just concerned
about themselves,

563
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:59,101
even when they're fucking.

564
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,569
Was he a good fuck?

565
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,175
You know what the best way is to
tell if a guy will be good in bed?

566
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:07,610
What?

567
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,479
Just see what makes him laugh.

568
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,121
What's that?

569
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,492
I don't know.

570
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,862
It's different for us.

571
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,733
You have so much
to look forward to

572
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:33,002
for once you finish university.

573
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:37,306
It's not gonna be so easy
for me, you know.

574
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:39,008
Still...

575
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,978
I wouldn't mind to struggle if I
knew it was leading somewhere.

576
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,352
I didn't try hard enough
when I was younger.

577
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,689
I was too distracted...

578
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,492
always jumping to new things.

579
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,063
But... just think about
how happy you are

580
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,798
compared to other people.

581
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:08,203
You can work hard
and try to do everything right,

582
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:11,674
and things will still
not work out.

583
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:14,310
But that's such a sad outlook
to have.

584
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,782
I don't want to think like that.

585
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,243
Liv.

586
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,379
Liv, are you awake?

587
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,715
Yes.

588
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,817
I was thinking.

589
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:33,088
When I come back from Rome,
we should go somewhere.

590
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,192
- What?
- Just us.

591
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,895
Maybe to America.
Maybe somewhere else.

592
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,697
I don't know.

593
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:42,965
What for?

594
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:45,367
So we can
have holidays together.

595
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,806
I can't just take
a holiday from work, Marie.

596
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,441
Why not?

597
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,877
Because they don't allow it.

598
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,087
You mean you wouldn't take
a holiday with me?

599
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,525
Of course I would, I just can't.

600
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:11,226
Not now.

601
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,262
But why?

602
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,563
I just told you.

603
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,335
There's nothing for me here.

604
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:26,675
I can't bear the thought
of being here forever.

605
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,777
But it won't be forever.

606
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,749
You'll go back to Reykjavik
at the end of the season.

607
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,951
I don't mean this house.
I mean...

608
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,859
I wish you wouldn't leave.

609
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,729
I can't bear this house alone.

610
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,765
Talk to Jóhann.

611
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,800
Tell him how you feel.

612
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:57,539
I don't understand why you stay
with him if you're unhappy.

613
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,842
The problem is not with Jóhann.

614
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,745
The problem is with me.

615
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,851
Even if it was someone else...

616
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,588
I would still be like this.

617
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,629
Let's just go away for a while.

618
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,032
Marie...

619
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,903
I can't.
- But why?

620
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:34,776
Because...

621
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,417
we're not children anymore.

622
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,998
I don't know if he told you,

623
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,767
but Johann's out of town
for the week

624
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,271
and I'm bored to tears
back home.

625
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,545
Oh, I didn't tell you.

626
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,547
Liv came over last night.

627
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,250
I had a feeling that'd come up.

628
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,419
I just figured that you...
- it's okay.

629
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:20,822
You made a good impression.
And she's hard to please.

630
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:24,860
Finally...

631
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:28,730
someone has something nice
to say about me for a change.

632
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,670
I was on holiday in Santorini
with my family.

633
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:36,204
I was still only twenty,

634
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:40,175
and he was this handsome,
successful guy.

635
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,744
And charming, so charming.

636
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,515
That was the thing with Jóhann,

637
00:59:46,517 --> 00:59:51,887
he would make you feel like you were the
most interesting person in the room.

638
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,221
So you've been with him
since then?

639
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:54,890
No, no.

640
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,758
We didn't end up
seeing each other

641
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,828
for a few years after that.

642
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,331
And at first,
I was so heartbroken.

643
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,935
You know, when I thought of him,
I would have tears in my eyes.

644
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,506
And I never felt like that
with any other guy.

645
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:18,180
But then a year ago,
he was in Rome and we knew.

646
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:21,450
So six months later
we were married.

647
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:23,885
That's quick.

648
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,587
You think so?

649
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,524
I never understood
waiting so long.

650
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:30,692
Once you know, you know.

651
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:35,764
The reason you have to give it
time is because things change.

652
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,299
People change.

653
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,083
Why didn't we do this sooner?

654
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,585
What do you mean?

655
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,454
This. Dinner.

656
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:01,890
But you were over
for the party, no?

657
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,493
Yeah, but I barely
got to speak to you.

658
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,396
You seemed...

659
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,831
preoccupied.

660
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,771
That was a strange night...

661
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,941
Jóhann and I were a bit off
that day.

662
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,750
That's all it was?

663
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,189
I'm not sure what
you're referring to, David.

664
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,162
Go ahead.

665
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,838
When I mentioned Liv earlier...

666
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,108
did you feel embarrassed?

667
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,411
Why would I feel embarrassed?

668
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,019
Just...

669
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,355
well, with me coming to see you.

670
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:10,459
Maybe you thought that might
change my opinion of you.

671

I'm not sure what
you're referring to, Marie.

This wine
is putting me to sleep.

673
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,222
Do you mind if I just nap
for a bit?

674
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,524
Sure. You can take the bed
if you want.

675
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:45,193
Oh, no, no, no.
The couch is okay.

676
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,865
Are you sure I'm not disturbing?

677
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:51,133

That's the word for it.

699

There was a boy, Francois...

700
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,022
This was when I was 15.

701
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:23,758
He was a bit older, 19 or so.

702
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,861
But we were so in love.

703
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,999
When I met him,
I thought I would marry him.

704
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,768
Have a family with him.

705
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,671
And all this, I felt so quickly.

706
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,007
When I was young,
I would always be like this.

707
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:41,476
Getting attached so easily.

708
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,112
But with Francois...

709
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,649
I really thought
he was the one for me.

710
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:49,150
So what happened?

711
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,287
Right when we started dating,

712
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,855
we fucked...

713
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,457
and I didn't like it.

714
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,893
It wasn't good for me.

715
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,331
And so after that,
I stopped talking to him.

716
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:09,003
And he would call and call...

717
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:11,172
but for weeks I wouldn't answer.

718
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:18,079
But then after that, I felt bad, so
I met him at his friend's house.

719
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,115
I told him the truth,
and he couldn't believe it.

720
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,954
My god...

721
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,824
I still remember
the look on his face.

722
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,663
He was so in love with me...

723
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,936
he asked me for a second chance,

724
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,805
but I didn't want to.

725
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:46,174
After the first time, I knew.

726
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:49,077
I think you should've have
given him a second chance.

727
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,712
But I didn't want him anymore.

728
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,416
I just would've hurt him even
more if we stayed together.

729
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,553
You said you've made
a lot of mistakes with guys.

730
01:10:58,555 --> 01:11:00,121
So many...

731
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,690
When those happened...

732
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:06,794
did you ever think
about the guys you said no to?

733
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:08,096
The guys like Francois?

734
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,899
I mean...

735
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:15,303
you break the guy's heart,
reject him,

736
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:18,840
and then you go slumming it
with some random guy.

737
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,108
That's a bit cruel, isn't it?

738
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,087
Not shocking...

739
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,691
Maybe a bit disappointing.

740
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:38,559
Why is it the same?

741
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,430
Every guy is the fucking same.

742
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:45,133
You find out who I am
and all you can do is judge.

743
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,901
I'm not judging.

744
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:48,970
I just don't think you should just
put out to every guy who asks.

745
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,805
I'm not like that, David,

746
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,007
so don't fucking say it.

747
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,542
Is that right?

748
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,755
Don't.

749
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:11,826
What, you're afraid I'll show
the pictures to Jóhann?

750
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,497
Oh, so maybe you do
have a conscience.

751
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:19,000
If you keep acting like this,
I'm going to go, David,

752
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:21,269
and I won't come back.
I promise you that.

753
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,642
You have a short temper, Marie.

754
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:29,744
Has anyone ever told you that?

755
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,851
Jóhann is coming back tomorrow.

756
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,455
It's going to be harder
to see you.

757
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,192
I know.

758
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,695
How much longer
are you staying for?

759
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,532
A week...

760
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,370
Maybe a bit longer.

761
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,606
So we've still got time.

762
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:06,381
I know you won't believe me,
but...

763
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,451
I will be sad to see you go.

764
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,188
The past few days
have been really great.

765
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,704
Never.

766
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:35,576
Then let's just enjoy the time
we have left.

767
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,175
<i>Amore mio.</i>

768
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,877
I've missed you so much.

769
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,725
Marie.

770
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,168
Paul was in such bad shape.

771
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:36,838
When I went to see him

772
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,841
he had all these tubes
hooked into him.

773
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:43,377
Apparatuses allowing him
to breath.

774
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:45,279
Did he know you were there?

775
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,783
Yes, yes.

776
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:54,088
They woke him up eventually
and we spoke.

777
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,790
What did he say?

778
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,525
Nothing meaningful.

779
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:01,362
I don't think he knew
who I was, to be honest.

780
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,300
But that wasn't
the upsetting part.

781
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:09,470
That night,
when I got back to the hotel,

782
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,405
I kept thinking about him.

783
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,941
All the people we knew.

784
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:16,143
The time we spent together.

785
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,915
He didn't remember any of it.

786
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,185
It was like it never happened.

787
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,857
And I started to weep.

788
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:32,660
Like some child.

789
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:36,631
I didn't know why.

790
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,879
So strange isn't it?

791
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,749
There I was,

792
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:58,753
filled with
this unbearable sadness.

793
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,124
Don't dwell on it, my love.

794
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,149
I wish you'd come by more.

795
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:35,289
I haven't seen you
since he came back.

796
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,425
I told you
it would be difficult.

797
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,163
I know, it's just...

798
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,568
I think about how it was...

799
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,071
things you said.

800
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,774
That was only a week ago, Marie.

801
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,480
Has it really changed that much?

802
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:02,617
I wish you wouldn't
be like this...

803
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,521
You know what my situation is,
and...

804
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,324
And, I never
promised you anything.

805
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:19,166
You should try taking responsibility
for yourself some time.

806
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,737
You say things...

807
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,574
maybe you mean them...

808
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,076

809
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,282
Why not just be clear about it?

810
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,621
What's so hard about that?

811
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,741
That's funny, coming from you.

812

816
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,874
Everything's been going well.

817
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:37,511
Finished up the assignment,
so that'll keep my agent happy.

818
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:39,714
For now, at least.

819
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:42,383
And you've been keeping
yourself entertained...

820
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,051
otherwise?

821
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:47,121
Look...

822
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,759
I know I don't come out
looking too great here.

823
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,427
I know you and Marie are close.

824
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:55,663
Of course,
that doesn't bother her.

825
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:56,997
It never has.

826
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,734
She's not totally at fault here.

827
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:02,870
At fault for what?

828
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,940
David...

829
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:10,344
you're acting like you
did something wrong.

830
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:13,314
I could see it being an issue
if we were teenagers.

831
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:17,752
But we're not.

832
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,624
I took it out this morning,

833
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:25,392
going through old photos.

834
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,564
Did you see Marie much
while I was gone?

835
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,067
Marie?

836
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:35,970
No, not really.

837
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:38,072
I was busy
finishing up the photos.

838
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,443
I've noticed a huge change
in her.

839
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,280
She seems to be coming to life.

840
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,083
I'm glad to hear that.

841
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,893
You took this.

842
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:02,396
That's how I knew her.

843
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:05,032
I photographed her
about a year ago.

844
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:07,935
I thought...

845
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,842
You know I... got this photo
from the police.

846
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:16,744
They said she had it
in her house.

847
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:18,412
That's right...

848
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:21,582
I remember you mentioning
something about a portrait.

849
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:23,517
I didn't make the connection.

850
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,156
Such a sad thing she was.

851
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:39,667
One of those kind of nights,
hey?

852
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,202
What?

853
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:43,337
You know David, I was thinking
about what you said

854
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,172
the other day, you know,

855
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,107
and I think
it's quite interesting

856
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:50,444
about how you put it,
relationships being transient,

857
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:54,748
and when I came home, I started
thinking about my response,

858
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,084
and I realized, David, I wasn't
quite honest with myself...

859
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:58,919
Sorry, I'll be right back.

860
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,624
Can I talk to you for a second?

861
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:06,493
Sure, but Alex was just
telling me about this hotel

862
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:09,597
he's working on in Berlin
and it really sounds amazing.

863
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:11,398
Well, it's still a while off

864
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,267
but we've got high hopes for it.

865
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:15,102
Can we go,
maybe have a cigarette?

866
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:20,441
Can it wait 'til after dinner? I just
didn't get a chance to talk to everybody.

867
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:23,244
Sure, okay, that's fine.

868
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,658
Hey, man.

869
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,301
I'm stuffed.

870
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,603
I always love a cigarette
after dinner.

871
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,571
Cleans the palette.

872
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,812
So Liv was telling me
she came out to see you.

873
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,183
Yeah? She told you?

874
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,851
I'm impressed.

875
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:40,988
About what?

876
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,757
It's nothing, it's just...

877
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:46,760
I tried to get in her pants
a couple of times.

878
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:48,329
She's a tough one.

879
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:50,898
Not like Marie.

880
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,204
Jóhann really is clueless.

881
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:01,909
Marie does what she wants,
with whoever she wants.

882
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,481
So you fucked her then?

883
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,652
That's what you're saying,
right?

884
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,457
That you fucked her.
- Hey, man.

885
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:19,860
- Go on, say it!
- Hey man, what the fuck is your problem?

886
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:22,062
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell is going on?

887
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:24,064
- This guy's fucking drunk!
- Fuck you.

888
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:25,332
Okay, okay.
Enough guys.

889
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,768
No one inside
has heard anything but...

890
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,937
David, David!

891
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:37,871
Sorry... I was just getting up.

892
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:42,643
You don't look so well.

893
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,112
Look...

894
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,081
about last night...

895
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:50,017
I'm sorry I went off like that.

896
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:52,619
I never cared much for Alex...

897
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:54,088
and anyways...

898
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,757
he probably had it coming.

899
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:01,061
But that's not why I'm here.

900
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,166
I came by because...

901
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:09,937
there's somewhere
I've been meaning to show you.

902
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,611
When I was growing up...

903
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,482
I would go hunting
with my father.

904
01:25:21,484 --> 01:25:23,517
My grandfather too, sometimes.

905
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:28,956
But now... it's illegal
to hunt the wildlife out here.

906
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:33,827
So instead... I set up targets.

907
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,699
For me, it was never
about killing the animal.

908
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:43,437
I was a bit timid
when it came to that, anyway.

909
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:49,443
I was more interested in just...
Being in the wilderness.

910
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:55,549
It was one of the few occasions I
would get to be alone with my father,

911
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:59,453
so I would spend my time
just paying attention to him.

912
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,924
Seeing how he would act.

913
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,829
My whole life,

914
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,964
that man was a stranger to me.

915
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:16,637
Most of what I know of him comes
from just observing him out here.

916
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,705
It's a shame, really.

917
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,852
I wasn't sure
about you and Marie, at first.

918
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,756
I had my suspicions, of course.

919
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,826
But it wasn't until last night
that I was certain.

920
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:43,397
The way you lashed out
at Alex...

921
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:47,401
I don't know
what you think you know...

922
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:50,437
Please, David.
Don't insult me.

923
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,540
What was it?

924
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:58,645
Did she tell you
that you were special?

925
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,516
That you're the only one
she can talk to?

926
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:04,017
Be open with?

927
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,354
You see...

928
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:11,024
I know the kind
of girl Marie is.

929
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:12,859
I've always known it.

930
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:16,897
I'm not so vain
to think I could change her.

931
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:25,339
But that doesn't mean
I love her any less.

932
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,507
I didn't mean for it to happen
this way.

933
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:32,079
It wasn't something I planned.

934
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,153
I am sorry, Jóhann.

935
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:43,690
If that means anything.

936
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,532
I lied to you.

937
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,237
What?

938
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:00,707
Or, at least I didn't tell you
the whole truth.

939
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,579
I was seeing Elisa, on and off,

940
01:28:05,581 --> 01:28:08,215
for the last two seasons
I've been out here.

941
01:28:08,217 --> 01:28:10,851
She had notions
of how things were...

942
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:13,754
her place in my life...

943
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,458
I knew that she was struggling
with depression.

944
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,396
I even had a feeling that
something might happen to her,

945
01:28:22,398 --> 01:28:24,131
yet...

946
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,267
yet I did nothing.

947
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,504
I felt a bit guilty at first...

948
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:32,906
but then I realized...

949
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,243
if I was being honest
with myself...

950
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,746
I know that she never
meant anything to me.

951
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,951
Just like you don't
mean anything to Marie.

952
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,414
I just got everything packed in.

953
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:50,484
So where are you headed to next?

954
01:29:50,486 --> 01:29:52,452
I have to go see the publisher
in London,

955
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:54,421
then it's probably New York.

956
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:56,089
I'm jealous.

957
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,330
Look, David...

958
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:07,300
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

959
01:30:07,302 --> 01:30:09,102
About what?

960
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:10,771
The other night...

961
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:13,240
It's just...

962
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:16,676
with everything
that happened last week...

963
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:19,446
I wasn't being myself.

964
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:22,716
And it wasn't fair to you,
I know.

965
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,452
So those few days we had...

966
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:29,189
it was nothing?

967
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:36,563
You should just forget about me.

968
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,900
Do you really want that?

969
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,973
This whole thing...

970
01:30:46,975 --> 01:30:48,942
you and Jóhann, out here...

971
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,147
I don't understand it.

972
01:31:00,655 --> 01:31:02,689
But what's there to say, right?

973
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,494
It never makes sense
from the outside.

974
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,301
If I asked you to get in
this car with me right now...

975
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:16,102
what would you say to that?

976
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:18,939
Things would be better.

977
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,044
You know that's not true...

978
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,415
We know each other now.

979
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,851
We have to stop for the moment,

980
01:31:30,853 --> 01:31:33,286
but that doesn't mean
we can't try again.

981
01:31:33,288 --> 01:31:35,755
You're only a plane ride away...

982
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:39,226
Come and go as you please,
right?

983
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:47,234
I've never met anyone
as selfish as you.

984
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,507
That's the problem.

985
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:57,310
You don't know.

986
01:31:59,881 --> 01:32:02,315
I can't really speak
to the future.

987
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,485
But when I make a choice...

988
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,788
I usually stick to it.

989
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:16,897
I think this'll be the last
time we see each other, Marie.

Von Fleischer?

992
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:55,168
I've booked us two tickets
to Madrid, for next week.

993
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:59,706
I'm getting a bit sick
of Iceland for the moment.

994
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,209
You read my mind.

995
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,215
David left today.

996
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:12,385
Is that right?

997
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:16,823
I saw him this morning.
Said goodbye.

998
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:19,659
You know, I quite liked him.

999
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,298
Interesting guy.

1000
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,541
We've weathered some storms,
you and I.

1001
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,477
But we always make it through,
don't we?

1002
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:44,150
Why is that?

1003
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:47,854
You know why.

1004
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,024
I know...

1005
01:33:51,026 --> 01:33:52,959
but I like hearing you say it.

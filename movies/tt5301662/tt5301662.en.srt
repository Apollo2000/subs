2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,241
A confession?

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,202
Is that what they call it?

4
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,205
Billy Lyons was thrown in jail
for three days without cause.

5
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,203
<i>In the case of Inez Washington vs
the C. R.& L. Bus Company,</i>

6
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,568
gentlemen, I have reviewed all the
papers and briefs in my chambers

7
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,642
and I am prepared to rule.

8
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,484
The court finds that
the service of the complaint

9
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,040
was in fact made at
the wrong address,

10
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,407
as Attorney Friedman has argued.

11
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,769
Therefore, the defendant's
Motion to Dismiss is granted.

12
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,320
Thank you, Your Honor.

13
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,209
Great work, Friedman.

14
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,402
Now, to get their confession,
Special Agent Cheatwood,

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,490
sent by the Governor himself,
took this club,

16
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,927
his "nigger-beater", he called it,

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,006
he tied Billy Lyons to a chair

18
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,321
and he pounded Billy Lyons
in the head with it.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,770
And still Billy Lyons insisted

20
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,649
he had not committed
these murders.

21
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,281
We had this one pegged as a loser.

22
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,966
You've got a real knack
for spotting technicalities.

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,441
Thank you, Mr. Sprague.

24
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,047
I'll be sending some more files
your way, if you've got the time.

25
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,204
I will make the time.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,926
Good.

27
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,449
They forced him into their car
and hauled him off

28
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,971
to the murder scene.

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,882
The bodies had been burned,
and were decomposing.

30
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,528
They took some of the bones
of these dead bodies,

31
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,045
put them in a pan

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,282
and placed them
in Billy Lyons' hands.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,044
They admitted this.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,600
Delirious with exhaustion and pain,

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,730
Billy Lyons confessed to a
crime he did not commit.

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,371
And it is based upon
that confession alone

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,569
that they now seek to hang Billy Lyons

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,689
by the neck until he is dead.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,850
<i>You'll get them
the next time, baby.</i>

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
There may not be a next time.

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,608
We needed this one.
All right.

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,647
<i>When you coming home?</i>

43
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,125
I'll be on the next train to Knoxville.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,363
I should be home
by mid-day Wednesday.

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,720
<i>Okay-</i>

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,450
<i>Be safe. I love you.</i>

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,761
Love you, too. See you soon.
<i>Bye, baby.</i>

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,761
Hey,boy!

49
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,687
Boy! What do you think
you're doing here?

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,520
What you gonna do,
nigger?

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,446
All aboard.

52
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,841
I'll see you boys
another time.

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,371
That son of a bitch!

54
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,811
Let's go scare him.

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,526
<i>Show.</i>

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,963
NAACP. Please hold.

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,003
Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
Good morning.

58
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,886
Welcome back.

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,325
Thank you.

60
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,846
Thurgood,
you're going to Bridgeport.

61
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,569
What, now?
No, I swore to Buster...

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,927
How many Thurgoods
are there? Five or ten?

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,367
There's only one, and that
one is gonna get his ass

64
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,930
on the train tomorrow.

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,441
Why?

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,524
Why? "Nightmare in Greenwich,"
that's why, Thurgood.

67
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,161
"Wife Attacked By Negro
Driver," that's why, Thurgood.

68
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,288
How about,
"Fear Grips Connecticut."

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,521
What's the reaction?

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,251
Fear. Getting calls from
all over the country.

71
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,685
Negroes getting fired.

72
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,802
White families afraid to
have us in their homes.

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,609
Well, if we can't work
as domestics,

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,370
Negro families
are going to starve.

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,205
And this is a hell of a time
to lose half of our staff.

76
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,004
It's got everything,
doesn't it?

77
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,488
"Eleanor Strubing, a fair-haired
Greenwich socialite,

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,530
"was the victim of a beastly
attack in her own bedroom..."

79
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,647
Yes.

80
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,926
And the boy
that they're holding

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,765
is straight out of
<i>Native</i> Son.

82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,330
Look at that.

83
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,167
Wow.

84
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,049
"Joseph Spell.

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,010
"Uneducated Negro servant
with a criminal past."

86
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,401
A fable that
the New York City press

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,448
is gonna feed on,
to the last morsel.

88
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,090
Yeah. They're starving
for this one.

89
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,286
So are we.

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,044
We win this thing,

91
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,202
our big donors are coming
right back, Thurgood.

92
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,484
There's only thirteen million
Negroes depending on you.

93
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,808
Irwin said I would
find you here.

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,125
What?
Your brother.

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,204
He said I'd find you here.
You know, swimming.

96
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,291
Nice swimsuit.

97
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,806
Who the hell are you?

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,043
Tad Lancaster.
Bridgeport High, remember?

99
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,607
Trombone?

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,291
Yeah. Still blowin' it,
too, man.

101
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,725
What are you
doing here, Tad?

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,485
Lam working with
the Bridgeport NAACP.

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,042
Actually, lam the Bridgeport
NAACP and I need a little favor.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,009
Do you know
that Spell case?

105
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,326
The guy who attacked
the girl from Greenwich?

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
Yeah.

107
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,803
Now national is sending a lawyer
from the city to handle his defense,

108
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,724
and we need a local guy
to get him admitted.

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,803
Sorry, no.
I'm not gonna do that.

110
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,365
Well, there's
nothing else required.

111
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,403
I'm not interested. Well, think
about the publicity, Sam.

112
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,050
No, that's exactly
what I'm thinking of.

113
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,406
Well now, your brother
seems to think...

114
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,766
My brother is
an absolute idiot.

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,162
Listen, Tad, thank you so
much for thinking of me.

116
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,322
Honestly, I'm grateful.

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,528
But I don't handle
criminal cases, okay?

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Find someone who wants
that kind of attention.

119
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,001
Irwin already filed
the papers with the court.

120
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,929
He did what?

121
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,570
A paper. please.

122
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,203
Thurgood Marshall.

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,726
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,088
Sam Friedman.
Um, Friedman and Friedman.

125
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,891
Good to meet you, Sam. Give me
a hand with these, would you?

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,530
Sure.

127
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,364
What've you got
in here, cement?

128
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,885
Guns.

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,690
Books, Mr. Friedman.

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,602
My law library.
It goes where I go.

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,082
Look, I told Tad Lancaster I'll
get you admitted, as a favor,

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,049
but I can't get involved
in a case like this.

133
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,406
Yeah? Why not?

134
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,405
Well, I do insurance defense.
You know, accident cases.

135
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,403
I've got a reputation
to think of.

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,086
That must be difficult.
What?

137
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,528
Having a reputation
to think of.

138
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,401
You meet
our client yet?

139
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,925
Your client.
And no, I was waiting...

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,651
Well, come on then,
let's get to it.

141
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,281
Got another one coming in. Okay.

142
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,681
University of
Maryland Law School.

143
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,603
Was walking distance
from home,

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,966
but they didn't
accept colored,

145
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,168
so I had to go to Howard.

146
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,527
An hour and a half
each way by bus,

147
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,762
and well known
as a school for failures.

148
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,530
That's too bad.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,571
No, no. It was best
thing that ever happened to me.

150
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,129
They'd just brought in a new
Dean, Charles Hamilton Houston,

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,443
he turned that place around and
taught me everything I know.

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,171
Including how to sue
the University of Maryland.

153
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,966
You sued them?

154
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,804
You bet your ass I did.

155
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,048
Soon as I passed the bar.

156
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,641
And?

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,931
Supreme Court ordered the
bastards to integrate.

158
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,607
You argued in the
United States Supreme Court?

159
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,290
What? No,
the Maryland Supreme Court.

160
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,290
I didn't argue in front of the U.S.
Supreme Court until last year.

161
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,925
Your boy's ready for you.

162
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,049
Spell, lawyer's here
to see you.

163
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,729
Mr. Spell, I'm Thurgood
Marshall, with the NAACP.

164
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,881
You heard of us?

165
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,686
You a lawyer?
I am.

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,206
This is Sam Friedman,
he's a lawyer, too.

167
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,682
You can go.
I got no money for lawyers.

168
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,762
Anybody ask you
for money?

169
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,084
Did you rape
that woman, Joseph?

170
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,207
No.

171
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,566
Why does she say
you did?

172
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,130
I don't know why
she's saying that.

173
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,248
She says you raped her
and tried to kill her.

174
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,209
She lying!

175
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,044
I was up in White Plains,
at a club.

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,964
Come on, Joseph.
All night long?

177
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,725
No, not all night.

178
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,280
I was at the house,
but couldn't sleep.

179
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,524
So I went to play cards.
Got back maybe 6:00, 6:30.

180
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,524
Anybody see you
at the club?

181
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,649
Yeah, but I don't know
their names or nothin'.

182
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
For an alibi defense
you need witnesses, Joseph.

183
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,561
Otherwise, it's her word
against yours,

184
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,244
and who do you think
they're going to believe?

185
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,207
There was a cop.

186
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,247
<i>MARSHALL'. A cop'?</i>

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,721
Stopped me in Port
Chester on the way to the club.

188
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,410
Looked at my license
then let me go.

189
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,766
What time was that?

190
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,083
I don't know.
Maybe 3:00 in the morning.

191
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,763
I'm telling you this
up front.

192
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,281
The NAACP, we're not like
most lawyers.

193
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,249
We only represent
innocent people,

194
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,129
people accused
because of their race.

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,044
That's our mission.
You understand?

196
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,891
So I need to know this...
Look at me now.

197
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,208
Did you do
what they said you did?

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,162
I never touched that woman.

199
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,085
Okay, Joseph.
You got lawyers now.

200
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,970
Go ahead,
change the station.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,202
What do you know
about the prosecutor?

202
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,409
Loren Willis. Graduated
Yale the day he was born.

203
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,290
Unless you came over on the
Mayflower, you're nothing to him.

204
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,291
They're grooming him
to be Senator, I hear.

205
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,325
What do you know
about the judge?

206
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,526
Judge Foster?

207
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,406
Former law partner
of Willis' father.

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,926
I'll move your admission Monday
morning, and then I've got...

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,403
Back to fighting off those insurance claims.
Yeah, I know.

210
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,200
So you like
Langston Hughes?

211
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,520
Of course.
Don't you?

212
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,406
I don't give a damn
about no poetry.

213
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,684
Come on.

214
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,889
I actually went to school
with Langston.

215
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,486
I just wish he'd do something
more worthwhile with his time.

216
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,602
- Another bourbon, Mr. Marshall?
- Sure.

217
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,124
You know, Tad's got a law
degree, too, from Fordham.

218
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,802
You told me
you were a driver.

219
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,881
Yep-

220
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,568
The state of Connecticut decided to not
allow me a license to practice law.

221
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,361
They were generous enough to give
me a driver's license, however.

222
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,166
I see.

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,406
And what about you, Irene? What are
you gonna be when you grow up?

224
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,766
A nurse
like your mother?

225
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,046
No.

226
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,242
A lawyer, then?
No.

227
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,561
A fighter pilot.

228
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,084
A fighter pilot?

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,482
Well, I feel a whole lot more
safe knowing that, then.

230
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,641
All right, say good night
to Mr. Marshall, Renie.

231
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,891
Good night!

232
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,365
You got kids?

233
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,690
Buster and I have been
trying for a while.

234
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,649
Buster is my wife.

235
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,848
Sometimes people think
I'm talking about my dog.

236
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,922
You should get a dog
and name it "Mrs. Marshall."

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,690
So, you think
this boy did it?

238
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,850
Hey, whose side you on?

239
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,848
Women don't just go around lying
about being raped, Mr. Marshall.

240
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,605
You're going to have to figure
out why she'd do such a thing.

241
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,011
Burden of proof
is on the State.

242
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,320
Is it now?

243
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,204
Hey, there.
Hey.

244
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,445
So what can you tell me about
this Friedman guy, anyway?

245
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,842
Sam and me played trombone
together in the high school band.

246
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,402
You trust him?
Sam? Yeah.

247
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,451
If you dropped a nickel while
kicking him in the balls,

248
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,601
he'd return it to you.

249
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,327
Couldn't play trombone
for shit, though.

250
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,646
Gentlemen. Gentlemen,
can I have a minute, please?

251
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,721
Just a minute.

252
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,961
Who's this,
a relative of Spell?

253
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,486
I'm Mr. Spell's attorney,
Thurgood Marshall.

254
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,324
I thought you were Spell's
lawyer, Mr. Freeman.

255
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,327
It's Friedman. Sam Friedman.
Of Friedman and Friedman.

256
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,765
Local counsel. That is all.

257
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,841
The defense team?

258
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,331
Is your boy innocent,
Friedman?

259
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,401
He is not my...

260
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,041
Let me state this to you all
clearly and unequivocally.

261
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,841
Our client, Joseph Spell,
is an innocent man.

262
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,331
Well, let's get
a picture of you two.

263
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,090
All rise.

264
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,328
Superior Court
is now in session,

265
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,165
the Honorable
Carl Foster presiding.

266
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,281
You may be seated.

267
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,204
<i>The State of Connecticut
v. Joseph Spell.</i>

268
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,850
Are the parties ready
to proceed?

269
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,164
The State is ready,
Your Honor.

270
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,047
Mr. Willis,
good morning.

271
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,801
How's your father doing?

272
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,804
He's better, thank you.
That's kind of you to ask.

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,001
Um...

274
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,248
The defense is ready
as well, Your Honor.

275
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,641
Well then,
let's get on with it.

276
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,120
Mr... Mr. Friedman.

277
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,329
You filed an application to
admit an out-of-state attorney?

278
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,006
Yes, Your Honor.

279
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,128
Attorney Thurgood Marshall,
of the Maryland Bar.

280
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,363
I have the application in
front of me, Mr. Friedman.

281
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,761
Why do we need to admit
this lawyer, Mr. Friedman?

282
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,320
Does he have a long-standing
relationship with the defendant?

283
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,445
No, Your Honor, but...

284
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,965
How long
has he known him?

285
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,451
Not long,
Your Honor, but...

286
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,409
Exactly how long?

287
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,291
Well, he met him for the
first time a few days ago.

288
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,283
However...

289
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,365
A few days ago!

290
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,286
Well then, what possible reason
could there be to admit him?

291
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,160
You're a perfectly capable attorney,
are you not, Mr. Friedman?

292
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,481
You have tried cases before,
haven't you?

293
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,968
Only civil cases, Your Honor, but
Mr. Marshall is with the NAACP,

294
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,442
and they are concerned that their
defendant receive a fair trial.

295
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,845
So are we all, Attorney
Friedman, so are we all.

296
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,888
But he is not a member
of our bar, is he?

297
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,327
No, he's not.

298
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,529
However, Your Honor, Mr. Marshall
is a respected attorney.

299
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,887
He argued in the
United States Supreme Court.

300
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,803
That has no bearing
on this case.

301
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,723
Your Honor,
may I be heard?

302
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,041
No. You may not.

303
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,288
The court has heard enough
and will rule.

304
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,402
The court sees
no legal requirement

305
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,642
to admit out-of-state
counsel in this case.

306
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,651
- But, Your Honor...
- However,

307
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,849
the court not only wishes to
be fair to all of the parties,

308
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,322
but to maintain the appearance
of fairness as well.

309
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,449
Therefore, the court
will allow Mr. Marshall

310
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,329
to enter his appearance
for the defense...

311
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,925
Respectfully...

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,128
His written appearance,
Mr. Willis.

313
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,122
Mr. Marshall may sit at counsel table.
However, he may not speak.

314
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,046
Your Honor, I must speak for the client!
He may not speak,

315
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,283
argue, or examine witnesses!

316
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,729
If he violates this ruling, he
will be held in contempt of court.

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,128
And you as well,
Mr. Friedman.

318
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,488
You will conduct this case.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,525
- Me?
- Yes, you.

320
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,128
The trial will begin a month
from today at 10:00 a.m.

321
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,485
Court adjourned.

322
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,120
All rise.

323
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,969
What the... What the
hell just happened?

324
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,365
What the hell
just happened here?

325
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,044
Shut up and be quiet.
Let me think!

326
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,049
I can't do this. You know that, right?
Shut up.

327
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,531
Excuse me?

328
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,323
That son of a bitch.

329
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,042
I've tried cases
before judges who were

330
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,963
Grand Dragons of
the Ku Klux Klan,

331
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,884
who forced me to enter
through the back door.

332
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,327
But this horseshit
is a first.

333
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,084
I cannot get involved
in a case like this.

334
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,164
Are you listening to me?
It would destroy my practice!

335
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,730
This is not my problem.

336
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,484
The hell it isn't!

337
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,171
No. You heard the judge.

338
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,006
Until we can find somebody
better, it's you and me.

339
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,486
It's our problem now.

340
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,043
According to
Eleanor Strubing's account,

341
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,964
Spell rapes her at home,
ties and gags her,

342
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,963
then drives up here.

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,965
He stops approximately 60 feet
onto the bridge, like so.

344
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,808
<i>Takes her
out of the car.</i>

345
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,124
Then pushes her
over the guardrail

346
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,521
into the reservoir
right about here.

347
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,328
He throws rocks at her,
then drives away.

348
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,085
<i>Somehow she gets to shore.</i>

349
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,202
<i>Dripping wet.</i>

350
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,962
<i>Then climbs up to the road.</i>

351
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,081
Awfully scary
down there, though.

352
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,091
Go take a look
where she climbed out.

353
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,241
Me? These are
my best shoes.

354
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,289
Please try to
make yourself useful.

355
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,881
Stop.

356
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,246
Stop!

357
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,245
Stop.

358
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,247
This is where
the truck driver found her.

359
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,291
What do you want
with those?

360
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,371
It's an old
Negro superstition.

361
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,448
Always take a little piece
of the Earth with you.

362
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,525
Really?

363
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,842
Mr. Friedman, your picture is on
the front page with Mr. Marshall.

364
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,764
Not a bad picture.

365
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,610
Of me, anyway.

366
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,364
Also,
your wife called.

367
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,647
Sam, perfect!
Where you been?

368
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,848
Out getting the cutlery
I need to castrate you.

369
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,331
You must be Irwin.

370
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,051
I am. Mr. Marshall,
pleasure to meet you.

371
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,447
Pleasure. Sam, listen,
I've great news.

372
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,887
I made some calls. Harry
Gruber, he wants the case.

373
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,290
Harry Gruber?
The Communist?

374
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,803
Sam, at least he handles
criminal defense.

375
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,165
Could you get Gruber
on the line, Ruthie?

376
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,805
Sure thing.
Thank you.

377
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,247
This is not
a cut-and-dry case.

378
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,368
I mean, you should really
consider whether or not

379
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,807
this is something you want to
commit to, as far as I'm concerned.

380
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,087
You want the Communist
Party taking over?

381
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,322
They'll martyr Spell
for their own cause.

382
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,283
Not my problem.

383
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,010
You think he did it?

384
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,445
That's for a jury
to decide.

385
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,521
What do you think?

386
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,090
You think he raped
this woman,

387
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,128
then drove her up to the
reservoir to kill her?

388
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,522
People have done stranger things.
That's right.

389
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,082
People do all sorts of strange
things, horrible things.

390
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,242
But throw a woman over the
bridge into the water,

391
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,765
not check to see
if she's dead,

392
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,251
then drive back
to her house...

393
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,405
I mean, you've got to have
a pretty dim view of Negroes,

394
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,007
to think any one of us would do
anything so goddamned stupid.

395
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,849
The papers say he was dishonorably
discharged from the Army.

396
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,445
This isn't
a court martial.

397
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,641
He was fired from his
last job for stealing.

398
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,846
No charges were brought.

399
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,931
He left behind a wife and two
kids in Louisiana, Thurgood.

400
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,490
Yes,
he's got baggage.

401
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,324
Criminal defendants
usually do.

402
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,688
They're not perfect citizens,
like you and me,

403
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,206
but none of that makes him
guilty of this crime.

404
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,884
Sam, we've got
Gruber on the phone.

405
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,405
What do you want me
to tell him?

406
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,485
I don't know.
Tell him he's a schmuck.

407
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,280
Sam, come on...
Irwin, shoyn genug!

408
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,086
Why me?

409
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,368
I need someone
who will do as I say.

410
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,125
What makes you think
I will do as you say?

411
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,960
You have no choice. You don't
know what you're doing.

412
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,484
You're quite a salesman.

413
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,326
There's no time for that.

414
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
You want me to try
this case?

415
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,287
No. I need you
to try this case.

416
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,451
And the Lord commanded Moses
to enlist his brother's help.

417
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,681
"He shall speak for you
to the people."

418
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,125
"He shall be your mouth,

419
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,522
"and you shall be
as God to him."

420
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,368
Tell Gruber
to go fuck himself.

421
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,001
All right.

422
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,050
And find the cop who stopped Spell.
We need a witness.

423
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,490
Okay, I'm on it.

424
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,364
What is this?

425
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,842
You say you've never tried a
criminal case before, right?

426
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,689
Yeah. That's right.

427
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,925
You better
start reading, then.

428
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,407
You've got one month.

429
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,689
Hey, look who's back.
You coming tonight?

430
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,683
No. Not tonight.

431
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,887
All right, you need to
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

432
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,885
I'm the one who's been sick every
morning for the past month.

433
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,324
What? You'd better not
be lying.

434
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,845
Look at the bump.

435
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,440
I see it.

436
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,204
You see it?

437
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,002
I'm not going
anywhere after this.

438
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,524
What? You don't believe me?

439
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,602
No, I don't.

440
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,001
I swear.

441
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,081
You swear?

442
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,446
I swear, I swear.

443
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,410
Nowhere. Nowhere. I swear.

444
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,007
<i>Trouble in mind
Guess I'm blue</i>

445
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,646
<i>But I won't be blue always</i>

446
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,045
<i>The sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day</i>

447
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,087
Langston, he swore
on his mother's life

448
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,766
that he wouldn't be going
anywhere, anytime soon.

449
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,043
My mother's name was never mentioned.

450
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,005
Well, this case is all anybody
in the city is talking about.

451
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,850
Which only means
that the inevitable loss

452
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,490
will be
that much more devastating.

453
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,921
Don't bet against me.

454
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,570
No, you're not even
trying the case, baby.

455
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,404
Every single word
that man utters

456
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,766
in that courtroom
will be mine.

457
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,810
I'm just making the point that a
Negro charged with ravishment

458
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,450
by the Greenwich gentility

459
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,205
should probably save himself the
time and unpleasantness of a trial.

460
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,650
Langston, maybe you should just go
back to Spain, or back to Russia,

461
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,529
write your little poems.

462
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,046
Explore big ideas
with your comrades.

463
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,566
I was fighting Fascists
in Spain.

464
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,887
Well, you were
writing about

465
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,207
fighting Fascists in Spain.

466
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,087
Listen, by the time
the baby comes,

467
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,924
Thurgood's gonna be
out of a job.

468
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,047
Do none of you have
any confidence in me?

469
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,090
I'd say you have enough
confidence for us all,

470
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,162
misplaced as it may be.

471
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,045
God,
here comes Zora.

472
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,242
Probably leaving dinner
with Charles Lindbergh.

473
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,288
Don't you dare.
Zora!

474
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,646
Sit down!

475
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,361
Come on over here,
Zora Neale Hurston.

476
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,091
Hi! How y'all doing?

477
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,685
Langston Hughes.

478
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,881
Zora.

479
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,001
And who is this?

480
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,765
I'm August. I've heard
so much about you.

481
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,128
That's funny, because I haven't
heard a thing about you.

482
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,725
Langston?

483
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,249
<i>Trouble in my mind, yeah</i>

484
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,161
Okay, guys.
Are we ready to go?

485
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,171
You're still
not talking to me?

486
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,528
It's not my fault.

487
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,769
You have no idea how
persuasive this guy can be.

488
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,562
Stella, what
on Earth is Sam thinking?

489
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,722
With all that's going on
in the world today?

490
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,121
We don't need this kind of
attention focused on us.

491
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,964
Well, he wasn't
looking for it, Rose.

492
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,451
Irwin got him involved.

493
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,207
Well, you tell him
that everybody is terrified

494
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,930
by what this man did.

495
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,321
Sophie Gittelson
fired her girl today.

496
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,281
She's been with them
for 11 years.

497
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,284
They fired Gladys?
Why? She's lovely.

498
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,649
Yeah, she is lovely.

499
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,291
But what if one of her
relatives comes to visit?

500
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,925
They have their daughter
to think of.

501
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,128
I would've done
the same thing.

502
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,407
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Friedlansky.

503
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,720
Mr. Weisman.

504
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,646
Dora and I couldn't remember,
were you born here or in Minsk?

505
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,889
We came over
when I was one.

506
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,849
That's what I thought.

507
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,729
So you feel like a real big shot,
I bet, defending that shvartze.

508
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,130
What do you think
your father would say?

509
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,009
I could not tell you.

510
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,171
I think he'd say
he was proud.

511
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,402
For the defense.

512
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,728
Don't mention it...
To anyone.

513
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,285
DICKYI EW!

514
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,887
Jury selection,
gentlemen.

515
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,129
Clerk, call the first
venireperson.

516
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,243
Lester Gilman of Norwalk.

517
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,725
Mr. Gilman.

518
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,289
Mr. Gilman, um,

519
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,121
in this case, a colored man is
accused of raping a white woman.

520
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,044
Could you be fair
in deciding such a case?

521
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,810
I think so.

522
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,689
No further questions.

523
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,970
Accepted by the defense.

524
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,049
To tell you the truth, I don't
know much about them, the colored.

525
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,691
We don't have too many
in Stratford.

526
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,084
Excused.

527
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,804
I'll be honest with you.
I don't like the colored.

528
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,770
Seems to me they're always getting
into some sort of trouble.

529
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,849
I don't think much
of Hebrews, either.

530
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,685
Excuse me?

531
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,322
Well, you're one of them,
I figured.

532
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,006
Thank you for your candor,
Mr. Wright.

533
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,049
No further questions.

534
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,325
Excuse for cause.

535
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,966
Counselor?

536
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,246
Your Honor, we move to have
Mr. Wright excused for cause.

537
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,970
On what grounds?

538
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,371
Bias...
I know.

539
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,329
He just admitted
he's biased.

540
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,365
Mr. Wright, you're a law-abiding
citizen, wouldn't you say?

541
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,441
That's right,
Your Honor.

542
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,091
If I instructed you
that the law requires

543
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,448
that you set aside
your bias,

544
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,885
would you obey
my instruction?

545
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,041
I guess I'd have to.

546
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,643
The challenge for cause
is overruled.

547
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,051
You may use
a peremptory challenge.

548
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,161
Your Honor,
with all due respect...

549
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,083
I've made my ruling!

550
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,244
Excused.

551
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,209
Mr. Ellis,
you agree, do you not,

552
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,930
that as a colored man
you could not

553
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,367
fairly pass judgment
on Mr. Spell?

554
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,286
No, sir.

555
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,523
You agree
you could not be fair?

556
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,049
No, what I mean is, yes, if he's
guilty I'd have to convict him.

557
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,611
I'll use a challenge.

558
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,451
Object.

559
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,284
On what basis?
Just do it.

560
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,211
Your Honor, I object.

561
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,721
Grounds?

562
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,450
He can't use the
challenge to discriminate...

563
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,641
He can't use the challenge
to discriminate...

564
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,643
I heard that, Mr. Marshall!

565
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,771
It's a peremptory challenge,
Mr. Friedman.

566
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,127
The State may use it
for whatever reason it wants.

567
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,885
Mr. Willis, you have four
left, the defense has one.

568
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,849
What was the point
of that?

569
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,402
Every single time they discriminate,
we're going to object.

570
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,687
Recognize it. Now.

571
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,328
Mrs. Richmond,
you reside in Greenwich?

572
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,448
Yes, Mr. Willis,
I do now.

573
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,925
And if the State proves its case
you could convict the defendant?

574
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,289
Yes, of course I could.

575
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,402
Thank you, Mrs. Richmond.
That's all I wanted to know.

576
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,610
Mrs. Richmond, I notice
you have an accent.

577
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,920
Really?

578
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,129
Here I thought you were the one
with the accent, Mr. Friedman.

579
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,446
Fair enough.

580
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,207
Mrs. Richmond, where did you
live before moving here?

581
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,009
Raleigh, North Carolina.

582
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,281
But now you live
in Greenwich?

583
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,521
Yes. That's right.

584
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,646
Well, if you live
in Greenwich,

585
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,085
you must have heard
about this case.

586
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,762
It's all anybody talks about.

587
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,041
I assume, then, that you've
come to some sort of conclusion

588
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,202
regarding the defendant's
guilt or innocence.

589
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,362
You assume incorrectly.

590
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,283
I don't have all the
evidence, now do I?

591
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,009
Have you met Mrs. Strubing?

592
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,762
In passing, at parties
and community events.

593
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,968
I believe we belong
to the same club.

594
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,926
Do you really think then,
Mrs. Richmond,

595
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,809
that with all of
these connections,

596
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,882
the club, the parties,

597
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,406
that you could really just
set all of that aside?

598
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,889
I don't see why not.

599
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,366
Thank you.
No further questions.

600
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,081
The State accepts
Mrs. Richmond.

601
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,331
Your Honor...

602
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,927
No. Absolutely not.
Mr. Friedman?

603
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,240
Your Honor,

604
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,243
may we have
five minutes, please?

605
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,171
Fine with me,
Your Honor.

606
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,369
The court will recess
for exactly five minutes.

607
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,881
But we're not going to make a
habit of this, are we, Counselor?

608
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,487
No. No, of course not.
Thank you, Your Honor.

609
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,683
We have one challenge left.
It was made for this woman.

610
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,966
Just trust me on this.

611
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,088
She's a Southerner,
lives in the same town.

612
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,123
Take her. I'm not your
goddamned puppet!

613
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,531
I'm getting rid of her.

614
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,409
She's smart,
she's confident.

615
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,925
She resists authority.

616
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,082
Did you see the way
she talked back to you?

617
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,605
The other jurors
will listen to her.

618
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,330
Which is exactly
the problem.

619
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,324
She knows Mrs. Strubing, they run
in the same social circles...

620
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,289
And she doesn't put her
on a pedestal.

621
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,045
Maybe Mrs. Strubing
is a drinker.

622
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,647
Maybe she has a boyfriend in town.
This woman may know things.

623
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,567
You are stabbing
in the dark.

624
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,405
Maybe, but this
I do know.

625
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,451
The one thing Southerners like
her hate more than the colored?

626
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,568
Arrogant Yankee pricks
like Willis.

627
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,529
Were you watching her?

628
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,403
She folded her arms and sat
back when Willis spoke.

629
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,331
When you began,
she opened up,

630
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,007
leaned forward,
removed her glasses.

631
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,044
These are signs.

632
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,610
Signs of what?

633
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,205
She likes you.

634
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,685
My glasses...
I need my glasses.

635
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,442
It's about time.
I know.

636
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,931
Mr. Friedman?

637
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,807
The defendant accepts
Mrs. Richmond.

638
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,646
Am I missing something?

639
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,647
Mrs. Richmond, you have been
accepted by both of the parties

640
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,963
and will serve
as our 12th and final juror.

641
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,129
The evidence will begin tomorrow
morning at 10:00.

642
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,727
Hey, Mr. Friedman.

643
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,246
What do you have to say about
today's comments by the NAACP?

644
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,321
What comments?

645
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,290
The press release
by Walter White.

646
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,204
He says that, "The Spell case will
show the world that a colored man

647
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,601
"cannot get a fair trial in the
United States of America."

648
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,761
Do you agree,
Mr. Friedman?

649
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,921
I have nothing to say
about that.

650
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,570
What about you,
Mr. Marshall?

651
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,966
Hasn't it been proven
in this courtroom already?

652
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,685
How can a man
have a fair trial

653
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,922
when he is denied
counsel of his choice?

654
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,567
When the members of his race are
eliminated from service on his jury?

655
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,007
When fear and bias
against his race

656
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,321
are the central points of
the case against him?

657
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,848
In Europe right now the forces
of tyranny have mobilized

658
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,970
behind the vision of a
so-called "Master Race."

659
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,169
But here in America, our differences
aren't supposed to matter.

660
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,448
Here we're promised equal
protection under the law,

661
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,921
nothing complicated
about that.

662
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,368
But that promise has not been
realized, not even close.

663
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,602
Not in Birmingham, Alabama,

664
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,762
nor in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma,

665
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,208
and certainly not here
in Bridgeport, Connecticut,

666
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,570
where your bigotry is simply
colored by a northern accent.

667
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,123
But a fair jury can always
render a just verdict.

668
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,448
That is what we are
striving for here today.

669
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,808
The Constitution was not
written for us, we know that,

670
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,201
but no matter what, we're
gonna make it work for us.

671
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,205
From now on,
we claim it as our own.

672
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,201
Go back to the South!

673
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,691
What's bothering you?
Sam.

674
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,091
Not now.

675
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,321
What's bothering me?

676
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,528
You insulting the judge
on the courthouse steps,

677
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,090
that's what's bothering me.

678
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,051
Just relax.

679
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,084
Excuse me?

680
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,686
I have to live in this city
after you're gone, understand?

681
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,730
No more public statements until
this trial is over, or I'm gone.

682
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,086
Let me make this clear.

683
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,844
My people will decide
what to say

684
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,206
to the newspapers
and when to say it...

685
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,203
The newspapers should have
no place in this trial!

686
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,806
They already do! People are losing
their jobs because of these stories...

687
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,006
Those people
are not my clients!

688
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,161
Well, they are mine!

689
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,045
My jury isn't just the 12
people in that jury box,

690
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,009
it's the whole
goddamn nation.

691
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,128
You just focus on this case,

692
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,202
try your best
not to screw it up,

693
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,282
and leave the big picture
to me.

694
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,603
- Sam...
- What is it, Irwin?

695
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,001
Don't you have
something to do?

696
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,002
There's someone waiting
for you in my office.

697
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,282
Yes? And who is
this someone?

698
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,246
Officer McCoy.

699
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,001
And who the hell
is Officer McCoy?

700
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,284
The cop who pulled Spell over
that night.

701
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,641
I just did what you said.

702
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,726
I drove around Port Chester pulling
over police cars and I found him.

703
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,802
Atta boy, Irwin.
Atta boy.

704
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,486
What time did you
pull over Mr. Spell?

705
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,444
Did you hear the question?

706
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,009
3:37 a.m.,
according to my notes.

707
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,245
Why'd you stop him?

708
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,005
It didn't look like a man like
that would drive that car.

709
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,003
Was anyone with him
in the car?

710
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,844
No, he was alone.

711
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,207
Are you willing to
testify to that in court?

712
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,570
If I have to.

713
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,921
Irwin, get a sworn statement
from Officer McCoy,

714
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,126
then escort him out.

715
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,726
Officer.

716
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,761
Wow.

717
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,887
An honest policeman.

718
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,961
See what your publicity
stirs up?

719
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,725
It just brings them out
where you can see them.

720
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,321
Give us justice!

721
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,971
That doesn't look
anything like me.

722
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,040
Does it?

723
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,085
<i>The State of Connecticut
v. Joseph Spell.</i>

724
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,003
Are counsel ready
to proceed?

725
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,164
Ready for the State.

726
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,401
We are, Your Honor.

727
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,162
Mr. Willis, you may call
your first witness.

728
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,961
The State calls Greenwich Police
Captain Burke to the stand.

729
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,251
Would you identify
these photos, Captain Burke?

730
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,085
Yes, sir,
that's the Kensico Reservoir.

731
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,370
Did you find any evidence at the
scene that pertains to this case?

732
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,524
Yes, sir, we did.

733
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,443
We found Mrs. Strubing's
sealskin coat

734
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,568
floating in the reservoir
under the bridge, about here.

735
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,762
Then about here,
on the guardrail,

736
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,763
we found
some strands of fabric.

737
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,320
I believe they were stuck
to some bird droppings.

738
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,286
Were you able to
identify the fabric?

739
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,364
Yes, sir.
It matched the fabric

740
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,442
from Mrs. Strubing's
sealskin coat.

741
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,882
Thank you.
Nothing further.

742
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,962
Your witness,
Mr. Friedman.

743
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,005
Bird droppings?

744
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,041
Sorry?

745
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,965
"Bird droppings,"
Captain Burke?

746
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,724
Yes, that's right.

747
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,040
Were you able to
identify the bird?

748
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,961
May I?

749
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,890
Thank you.

750
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,164
Now,
on one side of the bridge

751
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,322
is a reservoir,
placid as a lake.

752
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,407
On the other side there's a 30-foot
drop onto a jagged rock bed.

753
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,482
Is that correct?
You could say that.

754
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,002
And the fabric that you found
was on the lake side

755
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,449
right about here, around
60 feet onto the bridge?

756
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,921
Sixty-seven feet,
four inches.

757
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,081
Okay-

758
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,607
Did you conclude, then, that Mrs. Strubing
fell or jumped off the bridge?

759
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,330
I concluded
that she was pushed.

760
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,209
Pushed?

761
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,805
To murder her.

762
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,211
That's right.

763
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,686
As a trained crime investigator,
Captain, did you ever ask yourself,

764
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,525
if someone wanted
Mrs. Strubing dead,

765
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,968
why not push her onto the
sharp jagged rock bed

766
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,451
rather than the still
lake water?

767
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,285
Object.
Asking for speculation.

768
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,887
Sustained. The jury will
disregard the question.

769
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,125
Now, Mrs. Strubing told you that
after pushing her into the water,

770
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,329
Joseph threw rocks at her from
the bridge, is that correct?

771
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,481
Yes.

772
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,650
Were there
any rocks on the bridge?

773
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,642
I don't know.
There may have been.

774
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,644
But there were rocks in the area
around the bridge, is that correct?

775
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,085
Yes, there were.

776
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,128
About how big were they?

777
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,969
I really couldn't say.

778
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,089
Were they any bigger
than this, Captain?

779
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,289
I can't say they were.

780
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,003
This... This is a pebble,
isn't it, Captain?

781
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,091
You could call it that.

782
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,930
Well, what would you
call it?

783
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,601
A pebble.

784
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,606
A pebble.

785
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,610
So, in summary, Captain,

786
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,530
it's your belief
that this man

787
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,611
threw Mrs. Strubing
into a placid lake,

788
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,082
then gathered pebbles
to toss at her

789
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,128
while she waited patiently
under the bridge?

790
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,045
Object.

791
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,884
Withdrawn.

792
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,689
No further questions,
Your Honor.

793
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,121
Captain Burke,
you are excused.

794
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,045
Court is adjourned.

795
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,810
All rise.

796
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,644
Mr. Friedman,
well done.

797
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,848
Well done.
Let's go.

798
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,764
Why are you smiling?

799
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,771
Well, I think we scored
some points there.

800
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,607
This isn't a sporting event.
A man's life is on the line.

801
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,569
A word with you, Friedman.

802
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,924
Yes, of course.

803
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,331
Alone.

804
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,451
To you both then.

805
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,448
The doctor who examined Ellie
is testifying tomorrow.

806
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,445
It's rather personal, of course.
These are private people...

807
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,761
Please get
to the point.

808
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,205
Excuse me?

809
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,330
Well, I've spoken
with John Strubing

810
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,845
and he's willing
to consider a plea.

811
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,291
It's my decision,
of course,

812
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,443
but plead your boy and I'll
recommend a sentence of 20 years.

813
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,601
Otherwise, he gets life.

814
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,411
No. No deals.

815
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,326
Mr. Friedman?

816
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,323
Not my call.

817
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,687
Of course, you'll have
to speak to your client.

818
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,922
l expect a different
answer in the morning.

819
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,445
Even with
good behavior,

820
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,761
you'd be locked up
at least 14 years.

821
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,768
I could maybe do that.

822
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,323
They don't know
we found the cop, Joseph.

823
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,368
We don't even know
if Strubing will show up.

824
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,805
You could walk out
of here a free man.

825
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,651
But if she does,
if you're wrong...

826
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,643
Listen, the decision
is yours.

827
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,328
Sam, I need to talk
to Joseph.

828
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,845
Are you asking me
to leave?

829
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,764
Of course not.
He's your client.

830
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,842
I'm asking you
to listen.

831
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,842
When we first met,

832
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,888
I told you I'd only defend
you if you were innocent.

833
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,089
And you told me you were innocent.
You remember?

834
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,370
I remember.

835
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,521
Did you lie to me?

836
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,284
No, I didn't lie.

837
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,841
So I'm gonna ask you again.

838
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,410
Did you commit this crime?

839
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,441
No.

840
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,610
But you're willing to say
you did?

841
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,727
If I got to.

842
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,001
For the deal.

843
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,930
If you "got to"?

844
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,805
My great-granddaddy
was a slave.

845
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,645
Were your people slaves,
Joseph?

846
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,166
When we were slaves, we had
to do what the master said.

847
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,849
But we're not
slaves now, are we?

848
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,248
No, we ain't slaves.

849
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,731
You say that
like it's nothin'.

850
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,768
We ain't slaves
because we rose up

851
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,444
and we fought and we
fought and we fought

852
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,091
till we got our freedom.

853
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,810
Isn't that right?

854
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,486
My granddaddy escaped
when he was 15.

855
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,043
Fought off four men and an
attack dog, my mama said.

856
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,283
Okay, then,
you tell me this.

857
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,931
After what your granddaddy
did to get his freedom,

858
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,207
you're just going to
give it right back?

859
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,770
For nothing?

860
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,683
For something
you didn't even do?

861
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,446
Understand this.

862
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,090
If you want your freedom,

863
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,686
you're going to have to
fight for it.

864
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,285
But you don't
have to fight alone.

865
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,850
That's why I'm here.

866
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,841
We've got
weapons now, Joseph.

867
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,369
Our people do.

868
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,681
Weapons we didn't
have before.

869
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,204
We've got the law.

870
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,603
And you've got Sam.

871
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,042
One of the finest young trial lawyers
in this country on your side.

872
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,208
You really think
we can win?

873
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,451
I wouldn't be here

874
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,324
if I didn't think
we could win.

875
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,202
Dr. Sayer, please tell the
jury your field of specialty.

876
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,563
I specialize in the field of
gynecology and I deliver babies.

877
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,681
Aw.

878
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,406
On the morning she was
discovered in the reservoir,

879
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,007
did you have occasion to
examine Mrs. Eleanor Strubing?

880
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,361
Yes.

881
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,887
She was brought to my home
by the police at...

882
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,402
Let's see...

883
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,050
6:30 in the morning.

884
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,809
Did she tell you
what had happened?

885
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,088
Objection! Hearsay.

886
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,645
Overruled.

887
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,081
Doctor?

888
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,810
I've forgotten the question.

889
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,642
What did Mrs. Strubing
tell you?

890
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,046
She told me that
she had been raped

891
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,441
by a colored man
who worked for her.

892
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,844
What was her mental state
during all of this?

893
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,651
She was
severely distraught, weeping.

894
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,566
She kept repeating, "Am I pregnant?
Am I pregnant?"

895
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,651
Did you then examine her?
Yes.

896
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,443
My wife assisted by removing her clothing.
It was torn, wet, and muddy.

897
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,047
I noted bruises
on her arms and legs

898
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,363
and numerous abrasions and
contusions on both extremities.

899
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,601
I then performed
an internal exam.

900
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,889
Do you have an opinion, based upon
reasonable medical certainty,

901
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,531
as to whether or not
she had been raped?

902
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,244
Beyond question, Mr. Willis.

903
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,642
It was all consistent
with rape.

904
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,329
Thank you.

905
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,370
Your witness.

906
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,010
Get the records.

907
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,451
The medical records.
Get them.

908
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,171
Your Honor, may we please see the
medical records of Dr. Sayer?

909
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,527
Object, these are personal.

910
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,411
Overruled.

911
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,689
I'm sorry, Mr. Willis, but the
witness referred to them.

912
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,331
They must be turned over.
Thank you, Your Honor.

913
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,761
May <i>w.</i>

914
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,283
"Abrasions and contusions."

915
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,330
Those are scrapes and cuts,
aren't they, Doctor?

916
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,604
Yes, scrapes,
scratches, bruises...

917
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,806
Right.

918
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,167
Well, the fall from the bridge and
the climb through the pine forest

919
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,050
could be responsible for cuts
and bruises, could it not?

920
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,370
It's possible.

921
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,970
You did an internal exam,
and you found,

922
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,647
"Edema, swelling,
and traces of blood"?

923
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,926
Yes.

924
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,925
And it was based
on this that

925
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,844
you determined
that she was raped?

926
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,565
Indeed.

927
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,645
But those same findings
are equally consistent

928
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,131
with a woman who took a lover

929
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,884
and engaged in vigorous
sexual intercourse

930
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,041
over the course
of an evening...

931
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,567
Objection! How dare you? There
is no evidence of any lover.

932
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,005
Sustained.

933
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,687
There's no place for that in
my courtroom, Mr. Friedman.

934
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,563
Um, of course, Your Honor.

935
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,931
I'm sorry.

936
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,566
Hello?

937
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,688
Hey, baby.

938
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,001
No, they just pulled me
out of proceedings.

939
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,122
<i>The baby</i>

940
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,289
didn't make it.

941
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,606
And it was so much worse this time.
The bleeding. Just...

942
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,406
<i>It wouldn't stop.</i>

943
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,847
I'm so sorry.

944
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,124
<i>I should be there.</i>

945
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,326
Buster?

946
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,524
Buster, are you there?

947
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,045
Yeah, I'm here.

948
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,165
Where are you?

949
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,330
Do you have any further
questions, Mr. Friedman?

950
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,767
Mrs. Strubing told you that
she resisted her assailant?

951
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,251
Yes, she did.

952
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,641
And you looked under her
fingernails, too, didn't you?

953
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,609
To see if you could find
any traces of skin?

954
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,250
I did.

955
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,044
What did you find?

956
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,081
Splinters, dirt in some...

957
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,850
Any skin, Doctor?

958
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,846
Yes, I was just
about to get to that.

959
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,850
Excuse me?

960
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,044
There was skin.

961
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,284
Where...

962
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,806
Where in these records
does it say anything

963
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,689
about finding traces
of skin?

964
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,362
It's not in the records.

965
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,930
My wife took the notes.

966
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,049
She did not write down
that bit of information.

967
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,050
Why not, Doctor?
Why would she not record that?

968
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,409
Out of respect for the patient's
privacy, Mr. Friedman.

969
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,087
It was the skin
of a colored man.

970
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,327
No further questions.

971
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,811
It wasn't in the records.

972
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,326
They got a doctor
to lie under oath.

973
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,811
How do we fight
against that?

974
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,326
You asked the exact question
Willis wanted you to ask.

975
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,481
What were you thinking?

976
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,246
Where the hell were you? Getting
instructions from Walter White?

977
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,049
See what happens when I
don't hold your hand?

978
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,770
You panicked up there,
like an amateur.

979
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,842
You should have
let him take the deal.

980
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,888
God damn it, would you
shut up about the deal?

981
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,928
We have an alibi witness,
remember?

982
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,085
What don't you get? They will
have McCoy change his testimony.

983
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,241
Just watch.

984
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,526
Let them.

985
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,682
We'll take his sworn statement
and shove it up his ass.

986
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,922
No, tomorrow morning, I am
walking into Willie's office

987
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,923
and I am asking him if the
offer is still on the table.

988
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,401
The NAACP isn't taking
any deals.

989
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,811
The NAACP isn't the one

990
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,120
with its life
on the line here!

991
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,441
Yes it is, God damn it.

992
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,724
You're using him.

993
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,802
That's all this is.

994
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,769
Just like you said
the Communists would.

995
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,681
We're giving him the best possible
defense, under the circumstances.

996
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,370
Yeah.

997
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,249
I'm sure he'll feel
really lucky

998
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,288
as he sits in prison
for the rest of his life.

999
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,089
Let's not act like
it's Joseph Spell

1000
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,844
you're concerned
for all of a sudden.

1001
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,691
What is that supposed
to mean?

1002
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,489
From the moment
you got involved in this,

1003
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,210
you've been looking
for a way out.

1004
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,290
Play nice with the D.A.,
earn yourself a favor,

1005
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,170
maybe they'll let you in their
neighborhood or their club one day.

1006
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,322
Well, get this
through your head.

1007
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,722
The only way to get through a
bigot's door is to break it down.

1008
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,010
Must be easy
for you to say?

1009
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,924
You see, it is my life
that is on the line here.

1010
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,810
My family,
my practice, my future.

1011
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,370
What do you have?

1012
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,565
You have nothing to lose.

1013
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,808
No, you just
sweep through town

1014
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,531
stirring up
all kinds of ugliness,

1015
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,329
then move right on.

1016
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,885
No one will ever
even remember you were here.

1017
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,004
Fuck you, Sam.

1018
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,409
Fuck you.

1019
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,681
Hey. You two okay?

1020
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,446
Please take
the stand, Mrs. Strubing.

1021
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,131
Mrs. Strubing,
you reside in Greenwich?

1022
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,481
Yes.

1023
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:02,283
My husband John and I moved from
Philadelphia about a year ago.

1024
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,330
Is your husband here
in the courtroom today?

1025
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,802
Of course.
He's sitting in the front.

1026
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,243
Mrs. Strubing, do you
remember the night you were attacked?

1027
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,449
Mr. Willis, I assure you,
I will never forget it.

1028
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,922
Please, tell the jury
what happened.

1029
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,365
My husband was away
on business,

1030
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,081
as he is often,
I'm afraid.

1031
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,290
I had dinner with friends.
The Moores.

1032
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,284
And I arrived home
around 10:00

1033
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,486
and then I decided
to shower before bed.

1034
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,924
<i>And I was fixing my hair...</i>

1035
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:55,089
<i>And he came in the room. He came
after me and started chasing me.</i>

1036
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,210
He had a knife.

1037
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,483
<i>The knife was pointed
at my throat and</i> I...

1038
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,329
<i>I thought of screaming,
but I couldn't.</i>

1039
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,361
<i>He penetrated me.</i>

1040
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,082
I couldn't make him stop.

1041
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,410
His body was crushing me.

1042
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,800
What happened next,
Mrs. Strubing?

1043
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,046
He said he wasn't
finished with me.

1044
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,488
And then he did it again.

1045
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,963
Did what?

1046
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,843
Raped me, Mr. Willis.

1047
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,883
And then
what happened?

1048
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,566
When it was over, he said,

1049
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,041
"We're going for a ride,
Mrs. Strubing."

1050
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:52,206
After all that, he still called me "Mrs.
Strubing."

1051
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,811
<i>Then he tore my dress with
his hands and gagged me.</i>

1052
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,001
I show you Exhibit H.

1053
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,366
Is this the dress?

1054
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,531
Yes. That's it.

1055
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,441
And is this Exhibit I,
taken from that dress,

1056
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,921
similar to the gag
he used on you?

1057
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,286
Identical.

1058
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,691
Then what happened?

1059
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,250
We started driving.

1060
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,801
<i>I had to lay down on the
floor so that I wasn't seen.</i>

1061
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,009
<i>He came around,
pulled me out of the car.</i>

1062
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,368
<i>And I remember
feeling weightless.</i>

1063
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:38,567
<i>Suddenly I was freezing, and
rocks were hitting around me.</i>

1064
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,962
Mrs. Strubing, do you see
the man who raped you

1065
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,246
in this courtroom today?

1066
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,127
Yes.

1067
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,004
He's right over there.

1068
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,004
The colored man.

1069
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,528
For the record,
Mrs. Strubing,

1070
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,761
which colored man?

1071
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,042
The one
in the brown suit.

1072
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,971
Thank you.

1073
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,847
One more question,
Mrs. Strubing.

1074
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,400
Did you encounter
anybody else

1075
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,608
during your time
with Mr. Spell?

1076
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,282
Yes. As we were driving
toward the reservoir,

1077
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,408
the car suddenly filled
with red light.

1078
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,527
It was the police.

1079
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,921
I thought,
at last, I was saved.

1080
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,048
<i>And then Joseph said
to get down back there</i>

1081
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,727
<i>and if I made a sound,
that he would cut my throat.</i>

1082
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,768
<i>Then I heard the policeman.</i>

1083
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,969
<i>And I thought...
Please, please just look.</i>

1084
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,241
<i>But he didn't. He spoke with
Joseph and then he left.</i>

1085
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,969
I'm so sorry.
I did not want to cry.

1086
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,765
I'm so sorry.

1087
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,726
You've been very strong,
Mrs. Strubing.

1088
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,041
She certainly has,
Your Honor.

1089
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,324
No more questions.

1090
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,568
Hi there, um...

1091
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,926
Name, sir?

1092
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,764
Sam. Freidman.
Sam Friedman.

1093
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,650
Friedman... I don't seem to
have your name here, sir.

1094
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,724
Actually,
I'm a friend of...

1095
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,165
Hold onto this
for me.

1096
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,368
Sir, you can't go
back there!

1097
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,645
Gentlemen,
you must leave, now!

1098
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,326
Marshall, this is not the kind of
place you want to make a scene.

1099
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,562
I know. I used to work in
a place just like this.

1100
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,290
That's exactly
what my father said.

1101
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,284
If we just let the Reds
and the Nazis fight it out,

1102
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,124
they'll take care of
each other beautifully.

1103
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,611
This club is for
members only, boy.

1104
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:07,050
Loren, it appears that you
have some rather unique admirers.

1105
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,970
This is a private club.

1106
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,561
She wasn't in the car, Loren.
Excuse me?

1107
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,968
You had her lie
on the stand today.

1108
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,728
Are you accusing me
of a crime?

1109
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,969
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm doing.

1110
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,640
Who do you think you are?

1111
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,644
We have a sworn statement
from an Officer McCoy

1112
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,006
that Spell was alone
that night.

1113
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,323
I don't care
what you have.

1114
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,528
Ellie Strubing told the
Greenwich police everything

1115
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,847
when she first
recounted the crime.

1116
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,684
If she wasn't in the car,
how could she have known

1117
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,921
the car
had been stopped?

1118
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,126
Here.

1119
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,051
Read it.

1120
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,531
What is this?

1121
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,204
Another sworn statement.

1122
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,163
This from Ellie Strubing
the morning they found her.

1123
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,763
Dated, timed, notarized. Everything
she told the Greenwich police.

1124
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,085
This is fraudulent.

1125
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,285
Get out of my club.

1126
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,841
I've had better.

1127
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,364
Are you okay, sweetie?

1128
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,803
You look blue.

1129
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,764
And a man
as good-looking as you

1130
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,729
has no cause to be blue.

1131
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,642
Where is he?

1132
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,684
Attorney Friedman!

1133
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,802
I'm not much of
a conversationalist tonight.

1134
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,602
It's okay. I am.

1135
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,681
I'm Jen.

1136
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,446
Thurgood.

1137
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,681
Pleasure.

1138
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,727
I've never
seen you here before...

1139
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,521
<i>Attorney Friedman!</i>

1140
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,206
Attorney Friedman,
hold on a minute.

1141
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,490
What do you want?

1142
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,609
We're just eager to
introduce ourselves.

1143
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,161
To you
and the nigger lawyer.

1144
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,567
You don't want to have anything
to do with this man, miss.

1145
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,245
Excuse me.

1146
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,491
You gentlemen are making
a big mistake.

1147
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,928
There's no mistake.
We know who you are.

1148
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,211
Bet you wish you had your
nigger lawyer friend now.

1149
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,683
Hey!
Get out of here.

1150
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,603
- Let him go!
- Hold him up!

1151
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,684
Let him go!
Hold on.

1152
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,770
You liking this? You kike!

1153
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,565
Let him go! Let him go!

1154
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,441
Let him go!

1155
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,485
Go! Go!
Kike bastard!

1156
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,130
Sam!

1157
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,446
This here
is Mr. Thurgood Marshall.

1158
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,890
This man is an attorney.

1159
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:25,888
You'll be showing Mr. Marshall all
the respect he deserves, understand?

1160
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,851
Sit down and finish
your bourbon.

1161
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,410
Say something!

1162
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,650
You're late.

1163
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,845
What happened?

1164
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,408
I didn't mean
to start trouble.

1165
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,330
It's not your fault.

1166
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,049
Here. It's okay.

1167
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,010
Listen, men are men.

1168
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,682
And women are women.

1169
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,960
Right?

1170
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,284
Right.

1171
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,649
The Nazi masters of Germany

1172
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,963
<i>have made it clear
that they intend</i>

1173
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,527
<i>not only to dominate all life and thought...</i>

1174
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,648
<i>...in their own country,</i>

1175
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,530
<i>but also to enslave
the whole of Europe...</i>

1176
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,251
There's Flanken.

1177
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,930
Why are you so...

1178
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,690
My God, Sam,
what happened to you?

1179
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,284
I could use some ice.

1180
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,330
What is it? What's wrong?

1181
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,402
I got in the first punch.

1182
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,523
What's wrong? What is this?
You've been crying.

1183
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,050
Not now. Let's...

1184
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,246
Tell me.

1185
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,291
My cousin Anna, in Krakow.

1186
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,766
They took her?

1187
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,522
Who is that?
I don't know.

1188
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,163
Stand back.

1189
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,045
Who is it?

1190
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,363
It's me. Thurgood.

1191
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,244
Your co-counsel. Open up!

1192
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,283
What happened to you?

1193
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,244
Did I come at a bad time?

1194
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,845
What do you want, Thurgood?

1195
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,530
I have thoughts about tomorrow.

1196
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,568
Tomorrow? Get out
of my house.

1197
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,247
No. Not until I tell you
why I'm here.

1198
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,365
Hear me out.

1199
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,325
You were right.

1200
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,924
I had it all wrong all along.

1201
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,651
Spell was with her
all night.

1202
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,085
Spell lied.

1203
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,644
This is
your big epiphany?

1204
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,446
Eleanor Strubing lied, too.

1205
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,000
Neither of them have been
telling us the truth.

1206
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,085
Whoa...

1207
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,609
Thurgood, you've just broken
this case wide open.

1208
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,685
My God, you really
are a legal genius.

1209
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,681
Men are men
and women are women.

1210
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,722
Men are men
and women are women, Sam.

1211
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,489
You think it was consensual.

1212
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,404
It's the only explanation
that makes sense.

1213
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,127
How can we be certain?

1214
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,851
We need to talk.

1215
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,490
Talk about what?

1216
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,722
Listen to me carefully, now.

1217
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,050
Did you have sexual intercourse
with Eleanor Strubing?

1218
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,046
No. Why you keep
asking me that?

1219
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,600
I've never
asked you that before.

1220
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,170
Did you have sex with her?

1221
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,000
Speak, God damn it!

1222
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,525
I told you I didn't!

1223
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,126
She says she was in that car
when it got stopped.

1224
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,690
Did you hear her
say that in court?

1225
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,489
I heard, but she's lying.

1226
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,168
No, she's not lying.

1227
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,241
You're lying.

1228
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,291
Why're you taking her side?
The cop...

1229
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,687
The cop never searched
the car.

1230
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,529
She was in the back seat,
wasn't she?

1231
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,250
No. I'm telling you...

1232
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,685
Get this through your head.

1233
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,411
She gave a statement to the
police early that morning.

1234
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,801
She knew then
the car had been stopped.

1235
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,406
Okay-

1236
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,649
Okay, she was there.

1237
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,286
And did you have sex

1238
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,725
with her that night?

1239
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,529
Answer me. Answer me, now!

1240
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,801
Yes.

1241
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,690
How many times?

1242
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,891
Two times.

1243
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,129
So, you're guilty.

1244
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,411
You've been lying all along.

1245
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,289
No! Look, it wasn't rape.

1246
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,570
What about the skin under her nails?
ls the doctor lying, too?

1247
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,246
When we got to the reservoir,
I parked the car.

1248
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,607
But she starts screaming,
opens the door to run out.

1249
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,480
So I grabbed her, just to keep her there.
That's when she scratches me.

1250
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,971
You lying to me again?

1251
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,087
No.

1252
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,650
It's the truth.

1253
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,081
Why didn't you tell me the
truth in the first place?

1254
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,242
Because I was confused.

1255
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,890
Not good enough, Joseph!

1256
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,281
Willis is going to ask you why you
lied, sure as you're standing here.

1257
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,930
He's gonna ask you
in front of everyone.

1258
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,367
The jury's going to be
studying you with all 24 eyes.

1259
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,811
And you're just going to say
you were confused?

1260
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,086
I couldn't think straight!

1261
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,366
That's not gonna swing it!

1262
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,766
You lied
in a sworn statement.

1263
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,683
Why would you do that?

1264
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,721
Because I was scared,
all right?

1265
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,683
I was scared what they was gonna
do to me if they find out.

1266
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,888
My father
told me once,

1267
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:31,843
"if anybody calls you nigger, you not
only got my permission to fight him,

1268
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,366
"you got my orders
to fight him."

1269
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,891
Your father say anything
about being called a kike?

1270
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,565
No.

1271
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,202
Not to me, anyway.

1272
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,611
You look like
a real fighter now, Sam.

1273
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,442
Like a Jewish Joe Louis.

1274
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,250
Nah.

1275
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,209
Barney Ross is my guy.

1276
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,284
Barney Ross it is.

1277
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,601
Good morning.

1278
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,929
Good morning, Mr. Friedman.

1279
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,490
Mrs. Strubing,

1280
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,449
you're originally from
Philadelphia, is that correct?

1281
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,201
Yes.

1282
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,930
College grad?

1283
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,328
Bryan Mawr, Mr. Friedman.

1284
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,967
And you were an athlete,
I understand?

1285
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,120
Yes, I was on the swim team.

1286
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,086
You and your husband moved
to your estate in Greenwich

1287
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,650
last spring,
is that correct?

1288
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,166
I don't know
if I'd call it an estate.

1289
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,368
Sorry. A mansion?

1290
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,481
John and I moved here, to
Greenwich, rather, last May.

1291
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,731
But your husband was away on
the night of this incident,

1292
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,961
is that right?

1293
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,168
Yes, as I said, on business.

1294
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,925
You've testified that you went
out on the evening in question.

1295
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,323
That is correct,
to the Moores'.

1296
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:16,162
Did you, um... Did you
drink at the Moores' home?

1297
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,082
As I recall,
I drank some wine.

1298
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,527
How many glasses,
would you say?

1299
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,682
I don't remember.

1300
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,125
But it was more than one.

1301
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,770
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't remember.

1302
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,491
When you drove home,
were you tipsy?

1303
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,881
I never drink enough
to get tipsy.

1304
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:39,967
Okay-

1305
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,602
So you went straight up to your
room to shower, is that correct?

1306
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,806
Yes.

1307
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,360
And when you came out
of the shower,

1308
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,809
you say Joseph
was waiting for you.

1309
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,882
I didn't see him
at first.

1310
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,284
I had no reason to believe
that I wasn't alone.

1311
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,725
But then...

1312
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,206
He was there.

1313
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,647
You were attracted to Joseph,
weren't you, Mrs. Strubing?

1314
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,688
What? Objection! That's
an absurd accusation!

1315
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,524
Sustained! You invited
him into your bed, didn't you?

1316
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,329
Your Honor!
He attacked me!

1317
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,528
Strike the question
and answer from the record.

1318
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,321
Mr. Friedman, no more of
this, do you understand me?

1319
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,641
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

1320
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,928
Now your bedroom is just below
the room where the maid slept?

1321
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,490
Yes.

1322
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,005
Did you scream for help?

1323
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,928
I couldn't.
He had a knife.

1324
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,845
Did he hold the knife
as he removed his clothing?

1325
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,601
He must have.

1326
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:47,005
So, he removed his pants, belt,
zipper, whatever, with one hand?

1327
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,084
Apparently so.

1328
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,526
You told Mr. Willis
that you fought him,

1329
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,204
but he overpowered you,
is that right?

1330
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,681
Yes.

1331
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,446
There was a phone
right next to your bed.

1332
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,760
Did you attempt to use it?

1333
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,168
No, I was terrified.

1334
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,530
Afraid to use the phone or scream for
help, but not afraid to fight back?

1335
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,490
You have no idea what it
feels like to be so afraid.

1336
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,682
But at no point, at no point,
during the hours and hours

1337
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,364
that the two of you
were together

1338
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,363
did you ever attempt
to make any calls,

1339
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,249
to escape, to raise
your voice for help?

1340
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,651
I object, this is argument.

1341
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,881
I was scared for my life!

1342
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,440
Sustained, the jury will
disregard the question.

1343
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,564
You knew you had been
unfaithful to your husband,

1344
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,688
you were terrified of what he
would do to you if he found out,

1345
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,761
and you wanted
to get away.

1346
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,080
Your Honor,
he is badgering the witness!

1347
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,248
That is not true! I was
forced to leave the house.

1348
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,006
He bound me! He gagged me!
And he dragged me to the car.

1349
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,282
The police stopped the car?

1350
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,886
Yes.
But still you did not scream?

1351
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,650
He had a knife.

1352
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,246
Right. Right, the knife...

1353
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,084
As you testified,
you were afraid

1354
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,810
that he was going to
slash your throat,

1355
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,201
from the front seat
of the car, was it?

1356
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,850
I couldn't make a sound.

1357
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,601
Because of the gag?

1358
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,005
Yes.

1359
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:06,250
Mrs. Strubing, this Exhibit-I is
identical to the gag that he used?

1360
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,401
Yes.

1361
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,081
Let's just show the jury what
he did then, Mrs. Strubing.

1362
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:16,370
Please, please instruct
Mr. Marshall, if you would.

1363
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,850
The gag was between your lips,
is that correct, Mrs. Strubing?

1364
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,529
Yes.
That's correct.

1365
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,769
Is this about right?

1366
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,766
No, it was a bit
tighter than that.

1367
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,086
How about this, ma'am?

1368
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,723
Yes, that's about it.

1369
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,927
Now, you could have
done that, Mrs. Strubing.

1370
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,645
He would have killed me.

1371
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,803
Who would have killed you?
Your husband?

1372
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,004
Objection!
Quiet, Mr. Marshall!

1373
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,241
How dare you
speak to me that way.

1374
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,482
There was a policeman standing
not three feet away from you

1375
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,164
and still you did not
call out for help?

1376
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,571
Instead, Joseph drove on
to the reservoir...

1377
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,966
I'm warning you!
No speaking!

1378
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,326
...where you bolted
from the car

1379
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,686
because you were ashamed
of what you'd done

1380
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,205
with another man,
with a colored man!

1381
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,362
Objection!
One more word out of you

1382
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,249
and I will hold you
in contempt!

1383
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,326
You were afraid of
what your husband

1384
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,521
would do to you
if he found out.

1385
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,887
Afraid that you were pregnant
with a colored child!

1386
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,166
Objection! This is argument!

1387
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,004
Sustained!
Jury will disregard!

1388
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,686
You jumped into that water.
You wanted to end it all.

1389
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,649
Jumped? I was thrown.

1390
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,484
I was thrown.
My hands were tied.

1391
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,369
He tried to kill me!

1392
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,727
Your hands were not tied,
Mrs. Strubing.

1393
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,046
You were able to
remove your coat,

1394
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,361
and let it float in the water
as you swam to shore.

1395
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,965
That's not true,
that's a lie.

1396
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,050
He gagged me. He tied me.

1397
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,326
Raped me.

1398
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:10,281
I am so, so sorry for your
unhappiness, Mrs. Strubing.

1399
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,250
No more questions.

1400
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,291
Mr. Willis?

1401
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,124
I have no questions.

1402
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,444
How can we put Spell on the
stand with all this baggage?

1403
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,284
The jury needs to
hear him deny it.

1404
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,091
And you bring out
all the bad stuff yourself.

1405
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,208
Don't leave anything
for Willis.

1406
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,806
What happens to the
organization if we lose?

1407
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,969
I don't even want
to think about it.

1408
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,961
You could blame me.

1409
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:50,250
You're one of us now, Sam.
Haven't you noticed?

1410
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,606
In the papers, they write,

1411
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:55,480
"Sam Friedman and Thurgood
Marshall of the NAACP."

1412
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,688
Joseph, please tell the
jury where you were raised.

1413
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,691
Louisiana.

1414
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,402
You have a wife
and two children, right?

1415
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,405
Even though you have a wife,

1416
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,484
you have another woman
in White Plains, is it?

1417
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,971
Yes.
What's he doing?

1418
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,610
Ever served
in the Army, Joseph?

1419
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,411
Yes, sir. Fort Benning,
Georgia, six years.

1420
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,686
Discharged.

1421
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,481
That was
a dishonorable discharge?

1422
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,965
JOSEPH; Yes.

1423
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,691
Then you moved north?
That's right.

1424
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,649
Before working for
the Strubings,

1425
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,484
you worked for another
family in Greenwich?

1426
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,686
Yes, sir.

1427
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,047
They accused you of
stealing and fired you.

1428
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,321
Yes, sir.

1429
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,323
And when you worked
for the Strubings,

1430
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,925
did you run into
any other difficulties?

1431
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,606
No, sir.

1432
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,641
Did the Strubings
treat you well, Joseph?

1433
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,122
She was always
real nice to me.

1434
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,602
What about Mr. Strubing?

1435
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,446
Was he mean to you?

1436
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,249
He was mean to everybody.

1437
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,001
It is what you did.
Don't lie to me!

1438
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,043
You watch where
you're standing.

1439
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,406
Yes, sir.

1440
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,567
Just a second, Joseph.
I'm sorry.

1441
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,047
That's quite all right,
ma'am.

1442
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,206
On the night
of this incident,

1443
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,567
why did you go into
Mrs. Strubing's room?

1444
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,370
To ask her for money.

1445
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,807
I had to pay a man
I'd been playing cards with.

1446
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,843
What happened
when you got to the room?

1447
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,809
I knocked on the door.

1448
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,526
Come in.

1449
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,441
<i>JOSEPH'. I could tell she'd been sad.
She was crying.</i>

1450
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,806
Are you okay, ma'am?

1451
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,761
What do you want, Joseph?

1452
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,729
It can wait,
Mrs. Strubing.

1453
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,087
<i>But she told me to
stay, and ask my question.</i>

1454
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,960
I told her I needed some money.
She asked what for.

1455
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,609
There's a man I owe.

1456
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,607
<i>So she went
to the bureau.</i>

1457
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,764
<i>She said, "Is this enough
for you,Joseph?"</i>

1458
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,649
<i>I said, "Yes, ma'am.
Thank you."</i>

1459
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,768
<i>But she didn't give it to me.
Then she asked</i> me...

1460
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,004
I'm not awful like him,
am I, Joseph?

1461
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,971
No, ma'am.

1462
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,724
Joseph“.

1463
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,170
<i>She asked me not to
leave her alone that night.</i>

1464
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,127
<i>And, I didn't.</i>

1465
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,123
Then what happened?

1466
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,964
Well, we went down
to the living room.

1467
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,769
Me and her,
we had a drink together.

1468
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,124
What did the two of you
talk about?

1469
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,449
She told me he beats her.

1470
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,610
Who beats her?

1471
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,721
Who did that?

1472
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,609
My husband.

1473
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,761
Did she ever
resist you, Joseph?

1474
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,881
No, she didn't. Not at all.

1475
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,204
What happened next?

1476
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,961
We were lying on the sofa.

1477
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,928
<i>And she heard
some dogs barking.</i>

1478
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,245
<i>She was convinced
that somebody was</i>

1479
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,527
<i>gonna come to the house
and find us together.</i>

1480
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,762
Get up! Get up!

1481
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,406
<i>JOSEPH". She started panicking.</i>

1482
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,608
<i>I told her there's no one coming.
Everything's fine.</i>

1483
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,364
<i>But she was insisting on it.</i>

1484
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,521
<i>"We gotta
get out of here.</i>

1485
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,443
<i>"We gotta get out
of here right now."</i>

1486
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,010
<i>So we left the house.</i>

1487
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,162
We go down to the car
and we drive around for a bit.

1488
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,609
She sat in the back,
so it don't look wrong.

1489
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:15,241
Then the cop car
come on up from behind.

1490
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,927
She gets real scared,
she say...

1491
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,889
I cannot be seen
with a colored man, Joseph!

1492
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,850
<i>I say, "You lie down
and keep quiet, then."</i>

1493
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:24,927
Don't move.

1494
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,889
Where'd
you get this car, boy?

1495
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,086
I'm a chauffeur, sir.

1496
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,680
Belongs to John Strubing.
Greenwich, Connecticut.

1497
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,888
- Identification.
- Yes, sir.

1498
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,889
Drive slower, boy.
Yes, sir.

1499
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,611
Get your ass out
of Port Chester.

1500
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,324
On my way right now, sir.
Thank you.

1501
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,050
<i>SAM". What happened next?</i>

1502
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:04,046
We get to the reservoir,
and she screams at me.

1503
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,081
Joseph,
stop the car.

1504
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,851
Stop the car, Joseph!
Stop the car!

1505
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,206
What's the matter?

1506
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,486
<i>She keeps shaking her head</i>

1507
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,688
<i>and saying,
"What have I done?"</i>

1508
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,765
Everything's gonna be fine, Mrs. Strubing.
Just take a deep breath, okay?

1509
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,889
No, you don't understand.

1510
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,442
Maybe we should just go back
to the house?

1511
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,329
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

1512
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,289
<i>She keeps saying,
"I'm gonna get pregnant."</i>

1513
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,404
<i>"No, you ain't," I say.</i>

1514
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,561
You're not gonna
get pregnant.

1515
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,965
I can't have a colored child.
I was real careful.

1516
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,850
You not gonna have
no babies at all, okay?

1517
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,207
<i>And I say,
"Just let me take you home."</i>

1518
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,441
What have I done...

1519
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,010
<i>And she screamed at me.</i>

1520
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,445
Let me out of the car!

1521
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,688
I'm gonna tell
everyone you raped me!

1522
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,324
She goes to open the door
and I grabbed her...

1523
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,487
Let me out!

1524
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,167
<i>...just to keep her there. That's
when she scratches my arm.</i>

1525
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,925
Mrs. Strubing! Hey! Hey!

1526
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,962
No, wait...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1527
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:02,010
Mrs. Strubing. Mrs. Strubing,
what you doing up there?

1528
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,645
<i>JOSEPH'. I yell at her
to come back, but...</i>

1529
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,525
Come on down right now. Let's
get in the car and go home.

1530
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,762
<i>She just turned away.</i>

1531
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:30,487
Joseph, did you rape
Mrs. Strubing?

1532
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,761
No. I did not.

1533
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,604
Thank you, Joseph.

1534
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,366
Your witness.

1535
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,601
<i>Not bad.</i>

1536
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,569
You wouldn't lie to
the jury, would you, Joseph?

1537
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,687
Not bad at all.

1538
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,761
No, sir, l wouldn't.

1539
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,561
But the fact is,
you are a liar, aren't you?

1540
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,563
Objection! Argumentative.

1541
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,129
Overruled.
It's cross-examination.

1542
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,765
He's okay. When you married
your first wife, Hattie,

1543
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,207
you swore to God you'd be
faithful to her, did you not?

1544
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,366
Yes, sir.

1545
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,646
But you weren't.
It was a lie.

1546
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,006
You could say.

1547
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,084
And you told her you'd take care
of your children, didn't you?

1548
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,400
Yes, sir.

1549
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,209
But you haven't,
have you?

1550
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,362
Not so much
as I should.

1551
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,846
And then you
were in the service

1552
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,251
and you swore to
honor your country.

1553
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,488
- But that was a lie, too.
- No.

1554
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:35,042
And then you came north and you
stole from your first employer.

1555
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,446
And when
the police picked you up

1556
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,490
you lied to them about your whereabouts
the night before, didn't you?

1557
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,001
Yes, I did.

1558
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,606
You gave
a statement under oath

1559
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,210
that you were in
a bar all night.

1560
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,041
Yes.

1561
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,246
So you lied to your wife,

1562
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,244
you lied to the State of
Louisiana, you lied to the police.

1563
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,526
You lied to God!

1564
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,841
Why should anyone
believe you now?

1565
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,242
I don't know why they should,
except it's the truth.

1566
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,441
The truth?

1567
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,922
If it's the truth, why not
tell it from the beginning?

1568
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,683
If you're
an innocent man, why lie?

1569
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,563
Why lie, Mr. Spell? Answer the question.
Tell him, Joseph.

1570
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:18,085
If you were an innocent man,
why would you lie?

1571
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,888
I tell the police I was with her?
It was what she wanted?

1572
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,367
If it's the truth.

1573
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,727
In Louisiana, you know
what they do to me

1574
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,848
for being with
a white woman like that?

1575
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,685
If they don't kill me
right then and there,

1576
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,129
soon enough, the others come,
they drag me off, they tie me up,

1577
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,328
they cut off my manhood.

1578
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,009
And then I'd be swingin' off
the branch of some tree.

1579
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,290
So Why'd I lie,
Mr. Willis?

1580
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,966
Because the truth
gets me killed.

1581
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,125
That's why.

1582
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,609
I move the answer
be stricken.

1583
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,963
The answer will stand.

1584
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,131
Mr. Willis?

1585
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,648
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

1586
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,690
You know what?

1587
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,843
It finally looks like a
respectable law office in here.

1588
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,006
Come in.

1589
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,842
There's someone here
to see you, Mr. Marshall.

1590
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,525
Walter?

1591
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,810
What are you
doing here?

1592
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,166
Can we talk?

1593
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,965
I'll just move
to Irwin's office.

1594
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,922
Come on, Walter.
What is this?

1595
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,130
14-year-old boy in
Mississippi, they say he killed a cop.

1596
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,043
He needs a lawyer.

1597
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,888
And I have to leave tonight?

1598
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,968
He ready
with the summation?

1599
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,486
Sam? He will be.

1600
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,847
Then there's no
reason for you to stay.

1601
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,331
I'll take care
of everything.

1602
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,964
You get the picture
Renie left you?

1603
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,125
Yes!

1604
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,802
Now, what kind
of plane is this?

1605
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,770
She said it's
supposed to be you.

1606
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,486
Those are ears, not wings.

1607
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,363
She's quite a talent.

1608
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,490
You were right,
you know.

1609
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,046
About what?

1610
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,249
"Why would she lie?"

1611
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,880
That is the question
we needed to answer.

1612
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:24,122
Well, I'm thankful
Renie got to see

1613
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,009
there's men like
you in the world.

1614
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,050
I don't understand how you can
leave before closing arguments.

1615
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,841
It doesn't do anyone any good having
me sit around waiting on a verdict.

1616
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,968
What if something
comes up?

1617
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,481
The case is in, Sam.

1618
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,805
Walter will
represent the NAACP.

1619
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,570
And you'll be there
for Spell.

1620
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,761
Sam, did you know I
only have one testicle?

1621
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,484
Um, no.

1622
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,091
Yeah.

1623
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:05,848
Yeah, in my college years, I found
myself running from a gang of bigots

1624
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,402
in a part of town they didn't
believe I should be in.

1625
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,403
My buddies, they're
ahead of me in a truck.

1626
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,687
I jump for the back
and I'm pulling myself up,

1627
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,207
but there's a jagged
spike of metal I don't see.

1628
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,483
It slashes right
through my sack.

1629
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,326
Yeah.

1630
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,408
Why am I
telling you this?

1631
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,609
Well, I want
you to know

1632
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,480
that even sitting in the back of
that pickup, my scrotum torn,

1633
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,404
every bump sending
shocks of pain down my leg,

1634
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:40,405
even that wasn't as excruciating
as sitting there watching you

1635
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,165
argue this case
these past few weeks.

1636
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,405
But I did
learn something.

1637
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,603
I need an army of
lawyers just like you, Sam.

1638
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,882
Lawyers who don't even know
they want to make a difference,

1639
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:05,046
who with just a little bit of training
can be just as capable as me.

1640
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,287
Well, almost as capable.

1641
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,931
And until then, what?

1642
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,844
You just travel around the
country on this crusade?

1643
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:26,485
Putting out fires in Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Bridgeport?

1644
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:30,485
It's not really
fires I'm after, Sam.

1645
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,882
It's fire itself.

1646
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,803
Get out your pen now.

1647
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:43,523
Here's the closing argument
you're going to give.

1648
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,965
<i>Who is
telling the truth?</i>

1649
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:50,691
A woman from a fine family with
an unblemished background,

1650
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,842
or a depraved man,

1651
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,321
a repeat criminal
with no morals,

1652
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,883
a man whose whole life has been
composed of a series of lies?

1653
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,966
Did this decent, church-going,
intelligent woman,

1654
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,690
the graduate
of a top college,

1655
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:10,845
engage in voluntary sexual
relations with her Negro servant,

1656
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,922
and then jump into the water,
for what?

1657
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,527
For pleasure, as the defense
would have you believe?

1658
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,090
Of course not.

1659
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,361
Joseph Spell raped
Eleanor Strubing.

1660
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,249
Then he hurled
her over the bridge

1661
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,129
to kill the only
witness to his crime.

1662
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:30,365
Acquit him and you will set a
wild panther loose in our midst

1663
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,124
to stalk more victims,

1664
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,807
to threaten the safety and
security of each and every woman

1665
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,564
in the State
of Connecticut.

1666
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,124
As a jury,
you have been exposed

1667
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,124
to the darkness of
a sinister man's soul.

1668
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,411
But you are also in a
position of great privilege.

1669
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,891
Because you...

1670
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:59,127
You have the power to do justice
on behalf of all of us.

1671
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,407
Bullshit.

1672
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,720
Thank you.

1673
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,730
And God bless.

1674
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:14,880
Mr. Friedman.

1675
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:22,486
Why would a woman like
Eleanor Strubing consent“

1676
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:28,920
No, encourage sexual relations
with a man like Joseph Spell?

1677
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,161
Let me tell you why.

1678
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,845
Eleanor Strubing's story
is nothing less than tragic.

1679
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,369
She is a respectable woman
from a fine family,

1680
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,805
she attended
the best schools.

1681
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:44,009
She went to church
each and every Sunday.

1682
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,846
As the Good Book says, she was
"spotless as the lamb of God."

1683
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,606
She is spotless
as the lamb of God.

1684
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,524
She and her husband John
move to Greenwich.

1685
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,082
He travels frequently,
leaving her alone,

1686
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:02,006
in a new town, away from
her friends and family,

1687
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,120
in a vast empty house.

1688
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,124
The pangs of
loneliness hit hard.

1689
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,406
She has some drinks...

1690
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,169
A knock at the door.

1691
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,487
Joseph.

1692
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,962
She was
not expecting this.

1693
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,850
A young man,
a handsome man.

1694
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,127
In a moment
of weakness,

1695
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,005
her judgment impaired by the
alcohol of the evening...

1696
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:32,170
...consumed by loneliness, she
invites him to share her bed,

1697
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,163
to ease her pain.

1698
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,208
<i>As the evening goes on,</i>

1699
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,045
<i>she becomes panicked
that they will be discovered.</i>

1700
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:43,045
She must leave the house,
must escape her sin.

1701
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,321
What if she is pregnant...

1702
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,890
...with a colored child?

1703
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,407
What if her husband were to find
out, what would he do to her?

1704
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,166
She cannot live with the fear.
The shame...

1705
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:57,687
So then there they are,
at the reservoir.

1706
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,368
An opportunity to escape
her life, her despair.

1707
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,171
<i>Joseph tries to hold her
back, but she wrangles free,</i>

1708
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,725
<i>runs from the car...</i>

1709
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,043
<i>...and she
plummets into the water.</i>

1710
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,721
Only, as soon as
she hits the surface,

1711
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,121
her years of
training take over.

1712
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:21,367
<i>See, she is a swimmer.
And she simply cannot drown.</i>

1713
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,920
With the zeal to
end her life gone,

1714
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,527
<i>her only escape,
she must accuse him.</i>

1715
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,444
And so a story
is created.

1716
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:35,885
A web of desperate lies

1717
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:42,491
filled with inconsistencies,
absurdities.

1718
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,050
Reasonable doubts.

1719
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:47,920
The State must prove its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1720
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,241
it must be a clear case.

1721
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,484
No scream for help
all night long.

1722
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,646
Doubt

1723
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,166
No call on
the four family phones.

1724
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,206
Doubt

1725
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,129
No cry to the officer
just a few feet away.

1726
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,486
Doubt

1727
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,251
No rocks on the bridge.

1728
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,481
Doubt

1729
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,723
Doubt, doubt, doubt.

1730
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:18,801
The doubt,
my friends, is overwhelming.

1731
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:24,364
And this is why you must find
Joseph Spell not guilty.

1732
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,886
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1733
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,008
you've heard
the arguments of counsel.

1734
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:33,130
You may now retire to the jury
room to begin your deliberations.

1735
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,644
Court is in recess.

1736
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,360
Who is it?

1737
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,008
It's me.

1738
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,963
You're supposed
to be on a train.

1739
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,883
I have a little time.

1740
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,721
I heard you were
looking for me.

1741
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,804
Well, Friedman, it seems
you have beginner's luck.

1742
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,167
John Strubing
just called me.

1743
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:24,164
This whole thing has been a terrible
strain on Ellie, as you can imagine.

1744
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,049
They want it over, now.

1745
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,571
I'm prepared to
offer one final deal.

1746
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,766
What is it?

1747
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:31,887
Five years.

1748
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,724
He'll have to enter
a guilty plea right away

1749
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,131
and admit he
lied on the stand.

1750
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,524
I'll speak with him.
Do it now.

1751
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,440
If the jury comes
back in, the deal is off.

1752
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:50,882
You'd be out after three
years with good behavior,

1753
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,689
possibly sooner.

1754
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:55,206
You think
I should take it?

1755
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,648
I don't know what the jury will do.
It's a good deal.

1756
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:02,406
And if they
convict me?

1757
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,689
Most likely you'll spend the rest
of your life in a prison cell.

1758
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,007
And I got to
decide right away?

1759
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,329
What do I got to
do for the deal?

1760
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,645
Admit that you raped her, and that
you lied on the witness stand.

1761
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,882
Can I talk
to Mr. Marshall?

1762
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:27,442
He's on a train probably
somewhere in Tennessee by now.

1763
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,921
I would never be able
to reach him in time.

1764
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,726
And what do you
think he would say?

1765
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,241
Ha!

1766
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,289
So? Give me
good news.

1767
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,287
No deal.

1768
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:58,007
You did advise
him to accept?

1769
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,368
I told him it
was a good offer.

1770
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,771
I told him what
the alternative is.

1771
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,925
I told him if it was me,
I would take it.

1772
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,767
And I told him that
no man should ever

1773
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,161
confess to a crime
he did not commit.

1774
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,131
Here I thought Jews
were supposed to be smart.

1775
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,601
But you sound
just like the Negro.

1776
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,287
Why, thank you, Loren.

1777
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,887
That's possibly the greatest
compliment you could've given me.

1778
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,970
There's a verdict.

1779
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,449
Would
the foreman please rise?

1780
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,161
I'm the forewoman,
Your Honor.

1781
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:17,571
Very well. Have you
reached a verdict?

1782
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:20,249
We have, Your Honor.

1783
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,726
Mr. Spell,
rise and face the jury.

1784
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,165
It's time.

1785
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:33,481
Madame Forewoman,
what is your verdict?

1786
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,289
We, the jury,
find on the charge of rape

1787
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,601
that the defendant,
Joseph Spell,

1788
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,966
is not guilty.

1789
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:55,966
Order.

1790
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,602
Is this your verdict,
so say you all?

1791
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,803
We do, Your Honor.

1792
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,201
That's it, Joseph.
We did it.

1793
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:10,205
Mr. Spell, the jury
has found you not guilty.

1794
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,850
You are released
from custody.

1795
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,403
Jury is dismissed.

1796
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,720
Court is adjourned.

1797
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,211
All rise.

1798
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,486
Congratulations, Mr. White.
Thank you.

1799
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,248
Mr. Spell.

1800
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,322
I am Tad Lancaster.

1801
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,802
Mr. Marshall thought you might
need a place to sleep tonight.

1802
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,082
Mr. Marshall.

1803
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,210
Hello?
Hello?

1804
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,762
Sam? Sam,
I can barely hear you.

1805
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,051
Is there a verdict yet?

1806
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:16,521
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

1807
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,523
<i>Sam, are you there?
Yeah.</i>

1808
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,284
Yes, can you hear me?

1809
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,441
Sam?

1810
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:22,567
Not guilty!

1811
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,008
<i>We did it!</i>

1812
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,684
What?
Not guilty!

1813
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,842
Not guilty!

1814
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,202
<i>Not guilty!
Not guilty!</i>

1815
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,520
Sam!

1816
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,726
<i>Yes!</i>

1817
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:35,971
<i>Yes. We won!</i>

1818
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,961
Sam, I told you! I told you! I told you
you could bring it home, I told you!

1819
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,883
Yeah! Yes, we did it!

1820
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,967
Thurgood, I'm having
trouble hearing you.

1821
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,401
Sam, are you there?
Are you there?

1822
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,244
Thurgood...

1823
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,490
- Looby.
- Marshall!

1824
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:58,800
Your wife still putting up with you?

1825
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,406
Look at me, she dressed
me from head to toe.

1826
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,642
Got me looking
as sharp as you.

1827
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:07,046
God bless you.
We really need your help.

1828
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,566
I promise you I'll do everything
in my power to help him.

1829
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,165
Thank you for coming, Mr. Marshall.

1830
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,401
We really need
you in Mississippi.

1831
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,209
My pleasure.
Let's get going.

1832
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,966
Are you hungry?

1833
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:22,728
You know, I very nearly ate
my briefcase on that train.

1834
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,923
Well, when we get to the house,
I'll fix you a nice supper.

1835
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,480
That'll be nice, and
you can fill me in on

1836
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,483
everything that's
going on down here.

1837
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,484
Can you slow down a little?
I got my good Sunday shoes on.

1838
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,364
<i>You know,
there's so many people,</i>

1839
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,364
<i>indeed, my own
sons at times,</i>

1840
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:03,207
<i>look at me with an expression on
their face that they don't believe</i>

1841
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:06,329
<i>what happened in the past.</i>

1842
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:12,604
<i>There are movements by the different
branches of this government</i>

1843
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:16,526
<i>that are set to push back.</i>

1844
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:21,808
<i>Now it's being done,
you know, cleverly.</i>

1845
01:57:22,305 --> 01:58:22,486

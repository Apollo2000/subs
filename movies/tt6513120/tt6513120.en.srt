- Come on! Give it here!

20
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:11,439
Zak! What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

21
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:12,803
If you really wanna
choke her out,

22
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,004
interlock the fingers.

23
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:15,506
- Yeah.
- Now pull it tight.

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:16,805
Oh, yeah!

25
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:18,205
Now she's in trouble.
You feel it?

26
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,939
- You feel it cut...
- What is going on?

27
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,672
He's choking me!

28
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,105
What're you gonna do about it?

29
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,472
Well, hello. Whoa!

30
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:27,638
- Yeah, yeah, nice.
- That's my girl.

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,438
Hey, Saraya.

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,172
You don't have to look
pretty today, princess.

33
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,970
Yeah, but she's not just
pretty on the outside, is she?

34
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:36,004
In there is a heart of gold.
Do anything for anyone.

35
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:37,971
What are you two
dickheads after?

36
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,205
Babe, I am a girl down

37
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:40,805
- for the under-18s match.
- No.

38
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,039
I don't wanna be a wrestler.

39
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,837
You would love
the buzz, darling.

40
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,970
It's like coke, crack,
heroin combined.

41
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,438
Have you done coke,
crack, and heroin?

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,604
Not combined.

43
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:51,539
Darling, if I have
to give refunds,

44
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,471
I am buggered
six ways to Sunday.

45
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:55,204
I need you to do this
for your family.

46
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:56,305
Do you understand that?

47
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:58,638
No, Dad, I can't wrestle
some random girl.

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,807
- I'll screw it up.
- What if you're wrestling me?

49
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:07,173
Let's go!

50
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,037
I can't do this, Zak.

51
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,375
It's like a dance,
just follow me.

52
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:19,338
Okay.

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,841
Come on!

54
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:31,674
Yeah!

55
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:33,672
Come on, princess!

56
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:34,675
Come on, darling.

57
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,491
Come on, girl!
You can do it!

58
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:15,254
- Come on!
- Come on!

59
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,923
Come on, you muppets!

60
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,188
Shut up! Sit down!

61
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,589
Hey.

62
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,021
Quick, her hair!

63
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,222
Shut up!

64
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,221
Hey, don't you come in!
Don't you come in!

65
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:49,689
- I'm coming in!
- I'll disqualify you!

66
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,755
Get off her throat!
Get off her throat now!

67
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:55,422
Come on!

68

Britani! Britani!

72
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,157

74
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,422

75
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:36,522
Zak attack!

76

No! No!

77
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,255
Anything but this!

78
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:45,755
One!

79
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,021

81
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:50,524
Come on!

00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:55,788
The winners,
Zak Zodiac and Britani!

83
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,289
That's disgusting, Zak!

84
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,154
- It's Dad's, it's not mine!
- Oh, for God's sake!

85
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,525
I'm gonna pound on you,
I swear to God!

Norwich.

95
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:48,855
It's the mustard capital
of England.

96
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,754
You've heard of England,
innit ya?

97
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:52,820
You hit Greenland
and take a right.

98
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:56,021
<i>What's this regarding, sir?</i>

99
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,154
I sent Mr. Morgan
a tape of my kids...

100
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:00,154

00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:02,754
and out of the ring,
I'm Saraya.

103
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:04,189
That's 'cause in the ring,
I'm Saraya.

104
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,258
You might've heard of me,
Sweet Saraya Knight?

105
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,020

<i>Thanks for calling WWE.</i>

108
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,358
Do you know
if he watched the tape?

109
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:18,822
- She hung up!
- I don't know.

110
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,291
What a dick!

111
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:28,289
- Wrestling!
- Wrestling?

112
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,522
You wanna come to wrestling?

113
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:31,188
Wrestling tonight!

114
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,454
Hey! I'm wrestling tonight.

115
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,921
Do you wanna come
to wrestling tonight?

116
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,422
No.

117
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:37,489
Wrestling? No? Okay.

118
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,021
Excuse me. Do you wanna see
the wrestling? Live wrestling?

119
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,423
I'm fighting tonight.
Do you wanna come watch?

120
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:43,587
Live wrestling?

121
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,921
Excuse me!
Live wrestling?

122
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:54,753
Come on!

123
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,657
Shit!

124
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,455
I ain't got nothing!

125
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:27,821
Why'd you run, then?

126
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,024
You said I needed
to do more cardio.

127
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,155
That's not mine.

128
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:35,021
What's the plan, Ez, huh?

129
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,457
You wanna deal?
Or do you wanna wrestle?

130
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,821
I wanna wrestle.

131
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,421
Then cut this
crap out, mate,

132
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:43,023
or I'm done with you.
Okay?

133
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:47,587
Oh, don't throw that!

134
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:50,157
That's the same shit
Rihanna smokes.

135
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,954
Wrestling? Live wrestling?

136
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,355
Live wrestling!

137
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:00,522
Excuse me.

138
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,421
Have you ever been
to see live wrestling?

139
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,920
No.

140
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,987
Well, can I ask why not?

141
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,753
Because I'm not a child.
Or a moron.

142
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,787
You should come.

143
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,255
Yeah, you should see her.
She's really good.

144
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:16,187
But she's a girl.

145
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,589
Oh, God, is she not?

146
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,321
No, I am.

147
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:21,321
Is this, like, your costume?

148
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:23,021
No, this is me.

149
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,790
Wow.

150
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,787
Oh, wait, I know you.

151
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,754
You're from that weird family,
aren't you?

152
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:30,988
We're not weird.

153
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,987
Yeah, her brother
was on the news.

154
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,587
Didn't he do something mental?

155
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,688
Isn't he in jail?

156
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,421
You should come tonight.
It'll be really fun.

157
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,854
We don't like wrestling.

158
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,755
How do you know
if you've never been?

159
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,322
I've never had
rectal bleeding before,

160
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,954
but I'm pretty sure
I'm not a fan of that.

161
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:47,955
How about I shove her head

162
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,524
up your arse, and then
we can find out?

163
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,653
Freak!

164
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,623
Doors open at 7:00!

165
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,888
Hey, Zak.

166
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,321
<i>Bring your
daughter to the slaughter</i>

167
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,487
<i>Let her go
Let her go</i>

168
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:23,454
<i>Let her go</i>

169
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:32,224
Let's go, Cal! Come on!

170
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,789
All right, just
follow the music.

171
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,888
Here, come here.

172
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:45,687
Thing of beauty.
Right, Sunny, let's go.

173
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,322
Lock up.

174
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,955
Full nelson. Break.

175
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,021
Snapmare. Lovely stuff.

176
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,854
Okay. Mitchie.

177
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,854
Lock up. Full nelson.

178
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:59,321
Break. Snapmare.

179
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:00,688
Nice, mate, nice!

180
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,355
Right, Ez, come on,
let's do this.

181
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:03,989
Lock up.

182
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:05,454
Full Nelson.

183
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:06,920
Break.

184
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:09,022
Ez, have you got a stiffy?

185
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,820
It's not my fault!

186
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,222
It does what it wants!

187
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:13,454
Yeah, well, tell it not to.

188
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:14,754
- Just pretend it's not there.
- No!

189
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:17,154
All right, Ez,
50 press-ups now, mate.

190
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:18,522
What, for having a stiffy?

191
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:19,887
No, for getting turned on
by my sister.

192
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,188
- How desperate are you, mate?
- Oh, shut up!

193
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,055
Come on, let's go, let's go!

194
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,487
One, two...

195
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,520
- Till it's gone!
- Three, four, five, six...

196
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,954
- Another stiffy?
- Yeah!

197
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:32,955
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

198
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,420
Hello, love.
All right.

199
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:35,621
All right, J.

200
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,621
Understood.
Let me ask him, mate. Hang on.

201
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:43,022
Listen, Glen wants to know
if you'll take one of these...

202
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,291
in the face.

203
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,288
I don't know. What's it like?

204
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,688
Fine.

205
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,187
Yeah? Stings, innit?

206
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,321
All right.

207
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,154
Glen? Hello, mate.
Yeah, he'll do it.

208
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,156
What?

209
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,254
Seriously?

210
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:08,822
Hang on, Glen.

211
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:11,521
Glen wants to know if, uh...

212
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,790
If you'll do one of these...

213
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,655
In the willy.

214
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:18,921
Ricky, you kidding me, mate?

215
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,355
- Breathe in.
- All right.

216
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:21,521
When you release it,

217
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:22,622
- I'll pop it in.
- All right.

218
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:23,788
- Ready?
- All right.

219
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,087
On three.

220
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,255
One.

221
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,820
It's a unique sensation.

222
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,088
You all right?

223
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,190
- Don't touch me.
- All right.

224
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:37,790
Hang on, Glen.

225
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,557
- Go on. Yeah.
- Yeah?

226
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,289
Glen? Yeah,

227
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,124
he'll take a bowling ball
in the bollocks.

228
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:47,487
Ah! Sixty quid?

229
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,988
Glen, mate, you're killing me.

230
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,453
It's not gonna be worth him
making the trip for that.

231
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:56,321
I don't wanna see that, right?
I don't wanna see that.

232
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:57,554
Just a nice clean headlock,

233
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,288
straight into position.
Understood?

234
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,389
- Yes, Coach!
- Great, okay!

235
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,420
All right, Cal.
You getting in then, mate?

236
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:07,587
Oh, no, thanks! I just
come here for the smells.

237
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:08,988
You're a teenager
and you're blind.

238
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,487
What else are you gonna
do today? Listen to porn?

239
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,355
Calum!

240
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,821
Calum! Calum! Calum!

241
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,654
- There we go!
- Yes, Calum!

242
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,354
All right, seriously,
how's he gonna wrestle?

243
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:23,724
No idea.

244
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:26,623
What did we do
last night, babe?

245
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,155
Four hundred.

246
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,788
Bloody hell.

247
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,987
If things don't pick up soon,

248
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:34,187
I'm gonna have to go
back to thieving.

249
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,788
I don't care how
desperate things get,

250
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,154
you're not going
back to thieving.

251
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,322
You're not.

252
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:40,188
Zak can do it.

253
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,790
Raya can go on the game.

254
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:45,487
We're gonna be all right.

255
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:47,421
- One, two...
- Yeah.

256
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,487
...three and turn.

257
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:54,089
One, two, three and turn.

258
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:56,355
Oh, can me and Courtney
have a word?

259
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,487
- Yeah. Sure.
- Great.

260
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,822
I'm not asking us to bow
and scrape or nothing.

261
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:10,287
I'm just saying...

262
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,921
Courtney's parents
are a bit...

263
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:14,688
- You know, what's the word?
- Posh?

264
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,154
Classy!

265
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,487
Her dad's teetotal.

266
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,788
So am I.

267
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,488
Yeah, but he's teetotal
out of choice, Dad.

268
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,955
Not 'cause he's an alcoholic.

269
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,320
La-di-da.

270
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:24,654
You want us to make
a good impression.

271
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,055
- Yes.
- Yeah?

272
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,854
- A good impression how?
- Well, can he put a shirt on?

273
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,120
A shirt on?
How bloody posh are they?

274
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,320
That's another thing.

275
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,355
Courtney's dad,
he don't swear apparently.

276
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:35,287
So, let's just keep
the effing and jeffing

277
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,653
down to a minimum, please.

278
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,321
Oh, unbelievable!
Who is her dad?

279
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:41,091
The Archbishop of shitting...

280
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,121
Kent?

281
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,455
What did I just say?

282
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,955
Raya, help me out.

283
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,855
Look, he wants to make
a good impression...

284
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:51,253
because Courtney's great,
and he loves her...

285
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:52,520
and he respects her...

286
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:53,821
And he got her up the duff.

287
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,253
I didn't get her up the duff.

288
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:57,088
It's known as
an unplanned pregnancy.

289
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,188
All pregnancies
are unplanned, son.

290
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,653
Whatever happens tonight...

291
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:02,688
it will never be as bad
as when you went on in

292
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,989
King's Lynn
wearing his shorts.

293
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:06,487
Oh, yeah, your little
willy fell out.

294
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,321
Little?
Why would you say little?

295
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:09,921
Big enough to get
Courtney up the duff.

296
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,655
Ugh. That is gross.

297
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,154
Look, for Courtney's sake...

298
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:15,688
let's all just try
and act a little bit normal.

299
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,987
- All right.
- Okay.

300
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,354
Dad?

301
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,621
Yes, I will behave.

302
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:22,056
Thank you.

303
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,921
May I just say my husband
and I are delighted

304
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,587
to finally make
your acquaintance.

305
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,521
Absolutely, and likewise.

306
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:36,855
Courtney tells us that
you're all, uh, wrestlers.

307
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:38,753
- Yeah, whole family.
- Yup. Yes, we are.

308
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:39,920
Whole family of wrestlers.

309
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,453
And our half-brother, Roy.

310
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:44,420
So, what sort of people
enjoy wrestling?

311
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:46,155
That's a good question.

312
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,957
I mean, it's all fake
anyway, isn't it?

313
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,520
Come again?

314
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,821
It's not fake, it's fixed.

315
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,354
Yeah, if it was fake,
would I have broken

316
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,821
half the parts
of my body deaf?

317
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,320
His left leg bends both ways.

318
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,787
Well, that's nothing.
You should see his cock.

319
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:01,623
Mum.

320
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:03,521
Sorry.

321
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,323
Penis, you should
see his penis.

322
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,621
Have you got
another question or...

323
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:13,755
I can, yes.

324
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:16,089
How did you
get into wrestling?

325
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:17,787
It's quite a romantic story.

326
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,420
We like
romantic stories, so...

327
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:21,753
Oh, right, well,
you'll like this one.

328
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,688
Well, when I met Rick, I was
thinking of killing meself.

329
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,754
Pills.

330
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:29,354
I was homeless, abused, living
on the street, you know.

331
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:30,522
Yep.

332
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,887
I myself had done
eight years in prison.

333
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:33,990
Prison?

334
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:37,453
What was that for?

335
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,354
- Mainly violence.
- Mainly violence, yeah.

336
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,022
Bit of armed robbery.
You know?

337
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,587
Anyway, I came back
to the flat one night,

338
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:44,922
and there was, uh, guns...

339
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,253
money on the table,
everything.

340
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:47,654
- Sorry, there was guns and...
- Money.

341
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,821
- Guns and money, right.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,988
Done a job, hadn't you?

343
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,588
And I looked at him...

344
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,120
The look said, essentially...

345
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:54,821
"Ricky, turn your back
on crime.

346
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,353
Otherwise, I'm gonna
turn my back on you."

347
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,855
- And he did.
- That's what I did.

348
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:58,987
Never looked back.

349
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,988
Some people find
religion, but wrestling...

350
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,788
We found wrestling, didn't we?
It was our salvation.

351
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,187
We found each other and all.

352
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah.

353
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:09,119
It's a tale as old
as time itself, babe.

354
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:10,155
Hmm.

355
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:11,822
Oh.

356
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:12,987
Mum.

357
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,988
Not this now, please.

358
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:17,790
I'll get it.

359
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:20,119
Hello?

360
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,654
Can I put you
on speaker for a second?

361
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:22,922
Yeah, hang on.

362
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,287
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

363
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,453
- Go ahead.
- <i>Am I speaking to Zak</i>

364
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:27,855
- <i>and Britani?</i>
- Yeah.

365
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,190
<i>My name is Hutch Morgan.
I'm calling from WWE.</i>

366
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,620
<i>We were very impressed
by your tape.</i>

367
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:36,520
<i>In April, we're bringing</i>
SmackDown <i>to the O2 in London.</i>

368
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:39,490
<i>And we'd like both of you to
come down and try out for us.</i>

369
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,689
<i>Hello?</i>

370
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:46,086
They'd be
very happy to accept.

371
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,022
<i>Good. And we
already have a Britani,</i>

372
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,954
<i>so just think
of an alternative name.</i>

373
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:51,654
Yeah, sure, okay.

374
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,521
Thank you so much!

375
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:55,690
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

376
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:00,754
Oh, my God!

377
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,187
WWE!

378
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,487
Oh, my God!

379
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,654
Zak, they want us!

380
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:07,756
I told you, I told you!
It was a given.

381
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,254
Sorry, what is the WWE?

382
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:16,856
Say what?

383
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,386
<i>He is</i>

384
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,555
<i>the greatest professional
athlete in the world today!</i>

385
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,823
<i>Austin 3:16 says
I just whipped your ass!</i>

386
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,287
<i>Turn it sideways</i>

387
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,222
<i>and stick it straight up
your candy ass!</i>

388
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:36,287
<i>That is extraordinary
flexibility</i>

389
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,490
<i>from that young lady.</i>

390
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,019
<i>Austin, face first...</i>

391
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:42,520
<i>Never seen a reaction
to anybody</i>

392
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,286
<i>like this since the Beatles!</i>

393
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:49,121
<i>Because
the champ is here!</i>

394
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,321
For a wrestler,

395
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,687
it don't get bigger
than the WWE.

396
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:54,955
And to be WWE champion...

397
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:57,287
- Oh...
- It's the pinnacle. Okay?

398
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,954
It's something that
we have wished for

399
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,520
since we first
stepped in the ring.

400
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,287
And Zak's got it
all worked out.

401
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,486
We'd get a big villa
in Florida.

402
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,154
With a nursery,
of course.

403
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:09,621
Nice big playroom,
swimming pool.

404
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,187
I'll live next door,
so I can babysit whenever.

405
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,787
And when they come back
as Superstars,

406
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:15,187
we'll have full houses
every night.

407
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:17,253
We'll be shifting
a ton of merchandise.

408
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,354
You should buy shares in this.

409
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:20,854
No, seriously.

410
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:23,821
I've got the paperwork here,
if you wanna have a gander.

411
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:24,924
Dad, not now.

412
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,020
All right.

413
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,520
Do you think
you're likely to get in?

414
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,255
Will he get in?

415
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,621
I've been training this one

416
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,786
since before he had fur
on his bollocks.

417
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:35,987
Sorry, love, ball bag.

418
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,087
You should see
Raya in the ring.

419
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,521
She's like a beautiful
ballet dancer.

420
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,654
The biggest thrill I get
is when people say,

421
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,521
"She reminds me of you."

422
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,253
These tryouts,
are they very taxing?

423
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,388
Oh, yeah.

424
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,653
It's like <i>The Hunger Games,</i>
you know.

425
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,588
My other boy, Roy...

426
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,521
he did it a few years ago,
actually.

427
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,253
So he's in America now?

428
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,256
No, no. He's, um...

429
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,089
He's in prison.

430
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:05,687
When Roy didn't get signed,
he didn't take it too well.

431
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,523
He started drinking,
picking fights.

432
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,286
He threw a chunk of tarmac
at a bloke's head

433
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:12,623
and put him in a coma.

434
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,954
Look. Zak's not Roy.

435
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,687
And he's gonna make
you and Courtney

436
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,588
the most proud people
in the world.

437
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,757
I know this
'cause he's my brother.

438
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,190
You can trust me.

439
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:42,186
My name's Zak Zodiac.

440
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,753
When I was three years old...

441
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:46,086
I could name
every WWE wrestler

442
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,487
just by looking at his boots.

443
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,120
Zak Zodiac.

444
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,421
Every wrestler
just by looking at his boots.

445
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:55,624
When I was three years old,
I could name...

446
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,489
You all right?

447
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,020
All right. What's wrong?

448
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:03,656
I know when you're lying.

449
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,989
This is our shot, Zak.

450
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:11,156
I know.

451
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,953
But what if I screw up?

452
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:16,755
You won't.

453
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,187
Come on. You're gonna
smash it tomorrow.

454
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:20,287
How do you know?

455
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,154
Because you're a Knight.

456
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:24,086
Wrestling's in your blood.

457
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,356
That's not good. That makes
it sound like hepatitis.

458
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:29,154
Yeah, it is.

459
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:31,253
We're riddled with wrestling.

460
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:33,623
And there's no cure.

461
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:36,823
Okay?

462
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,289
Okay.

463
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,220
Tryouts that way?
We're here for the tryout.

464
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:57,187
- We're here for the tryouts.
- Yeah. Yeah, that way.

465
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,553
Great.

466
00:20:58,555 --> 00:20:59,953
Sorry. We're here for
the tryouts. Tryouts that way?

467
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:02,089
- They're downstairs.
- Great. Thank you.

468
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:17,454
Whoa!

469
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,153
So cool.
Can you imagine it?

470
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:29,488
20,000 people
just shouting your name.

471
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,323
Zodiac! Zodiac! Zodiac!
Just insane.

472
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:46,687
Whoa!

473
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,020
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry, mate.

474
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:49,322
Dick me dead,
bury me pregnant.

475
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,186
That's
a good pick-up line.

476
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:58,253
- Zak Zodiac, mate.
- What's up, Zak?

477
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:59,421
What an honor
to meet you, mate.

478
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:00,488
- Oh, thanks, Zak.
- Yeah,

479
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,688
- yeah, Zak, Zak. Yeah.
- Cool.

480
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,688
- This is my sister, Saraya.
- We're huge fans.

481
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,854
- Thank you so much.
- Since we were kids.

482
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,253
Yeah, we've been fans
since you had hair.

483
00:22:07,255 --> 00:22:08,654
Oh, thank you.

484
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:10,153
Hey, it's a choice.
A damn good one, too.

485
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:12,521
- Yeah, no, it looks good.
- It looks great, fantastic.

486
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:13,653
See you guys.

487
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:14,954
Rock, Rock, Rock!

488
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:16,186
Yo.

489
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:17,622
What's happening? Are you
getting back in the ring?

490
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:19,421
- You wrestling again?
- Uh, no. No, no, no.

491
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,853
I'm just shooting a movie
here in London...

492
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,487
and I'm gonna
surprise the crowd tonight.

493
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:24,521
Gonna electrify.
Don't tell anybody.

494
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:25,787
- No, no.
- No.

495
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:26,920
All right, see you guys.

496
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:29,187
- Rock, Rock, Rock!
- Hey.

497
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,453
We're wrestlers
as well, actually.

498
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,821
We're actually doing
the tryouts today.

499
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:32,986
Oh, cool.

500
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,253
Our whole family wrestle.

501
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:35,921
WAW, up in Norwich.

502
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:36,990
You've probably heard of it.

503
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,621
Uh, no.

504
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,786
No?

505
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:42,087
Actually,
whilst you're here...

506
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,320
He should come
to one of our shows!

507
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

508
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:45,752
We could
get you tickets...

509
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:47,188
Half-price, probably.

510
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,520
Half-price?

511
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,920
I'll text Mango Pete,
get him on the list.

512
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,954
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you need a plus-one?

513
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:54,088
Uh, that's awesome.
Thank you for the invite.

514
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,819
I don't think I'll be
able to make it, though.

515
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:57,354
Good luck
with your tryout. Okay.

516
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,254
- Thanks.
- Thanks, mate.

517
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,623
Rock, Rock, Rock!

518
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:03,186
Yes, Zak.

519
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:05,752
What advice would you give us?
If we wanna...

520
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:06,953
Win over the crowd.

521
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:09,188
Win over the crowd.
If we wanna...

522
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,323
If we wanna be the next you.

523
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:17,987
- What are your names again?
- My name is...

524
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:20,120
It doesn't matter
what your names are!

525
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,852
You walk around here
interrupting The Rock.

526
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:24,120
You, like you haven't seen
the sun in 20 years!

527
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:26,019
You, like you just
stepped out of <i>Oliver Twist!</i>

528
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,785
Please, sir, may I have
some more advice, sir?

529
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:29,920
You want some advice?

530
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,420
Here's The Rock's advice!
Shut your mouth!

531
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:34,154
What you want! What you want!
How about what The Rock wants?

532
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:36,453
The Rock wants you to go
out there, take no prisoners,

533
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:38,087
have no regrets, have no fear!

534
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,920
Lay it all out on the line!

535
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,154
Because if you
don't do that...

536
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:42,753
The Rock is gonna find
your friend Mary Poppins.

537
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,920
He's gonna take her umbrella.

538
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah, he's gonna
shine it up real nice.

539
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,153
He's gonna turn
that sumbitch sideways

540
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:49,254
and stick it straight up
your candy asses!

541
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:50,487
There's your advice!

542
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:52,620
Straight out
of the Jabroni-beating,

543
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:54,320
pie-eating, trailblazing,
eyebrow-raising...

544
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:56,153
entertaining the globe,
never hotter...

545
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,855
talking to two rejects
from <i>Harry Potter!</i>

546
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,687
So that's how you
win over the crowd.

547
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,786
Yeah.

548
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,620
Even though this
crazy wrestling world

549
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:10,455
is a fictionalized world...

550
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:13,453
The fans know 1,000%
if you're not being real.

551
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:15,487
All right? That guy just now,
that was The Rock.

552
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,487
The Rock is me.
Dwayne Johnson...

553
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,954
Just with the volume
turned way up,

554
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:20,521
the treble adjusted, the bass.

555
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:21,753
Same guy.

556
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:24,022
So don't worry about
being the next me.

557
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:25,955
Be the first you.

558
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:30,819
Hey! Are you two here
for the tryouts?

559
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,020
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

560
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:33,754
You can't just hang out
with The Rock.

561
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,087
What are you,
Make-A-Wish kids?

562
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,089
Let's go!

563
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:37,788
Better go.

564
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:40,186
- Thanks, mate!
- Yeah!

565
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,357
- Thanks, Dwayne!
- You got it!

566
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:45,520
That was The Rock!

567
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:47,719
Insane, insane.
Come on, let's go.

568
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,488
To be a WWE Superstar,
you have to have two things.

569
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,787
Number one,
you gotta have the skills

570
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,353
and number two,
you have to have the spark.

571
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:55,954
Now, skills,
that's obvious, right?

572
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:57,187
You gotta be able to wrestle.

573
00:24:57,189 --> 00:25:00,119
The spark, well...

574
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:01,820
That's the magic dust.

575
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:04,254
It's what the audience
falls in love with.

576
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,120
It's why they buy your poster.

577
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,619
It's why they
come back every week.

578
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:09,021
It's why they chant your name.

579
00:25:09,023 --> 00:25:10,453
It's why they buy

580
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:13,687
a six-inch
action figure of you.

581
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:17,787
Do you see yourself
as a six-inch action figure?

582
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:20,653
Yeah. Yes, I do.
I see myself as WWE Champion.

583
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:22,786
Ding, ding, ding!
Bingo, guys!

584
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,086
That's exactly right. That's
called a great attitude.

585
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,487
And that's a big plate of yes.

586
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,186
That is one of the biggest
requirements

587
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:30,819
that you have to have
to be a WWE Superstar.

588
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,786
And you don't have
any of the other things.

589
00:25:32,788 --> 00:25:34,820
But the attitude's the one
thing you're in control over

590
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:36,787
and the attitude's the one
thing that you have.

591
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:37,789
Name.

592
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:40,019
Zak Zodiac.

593
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:43,785
Sounds a little bit like
a dancer at a male strip club.

594
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:45,954
Why do you wanna wrestle?

595
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:49,354
I wanna be a wrestler because
since I was three years old...

596
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:51,086
I could name
every single WWE wrestler

597
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:53,187
just by looking
at their boots.

598
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:54,852
And I've wanted to be
one ever since.

599
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,120
I'm passionate,
I'm determined...

600
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,819
And I'm the toughest
bastard in any room...

601
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:02,254
Including this one.

602
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:03,620
Oh, probably shouldn't swear,

603
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:05,587
not when there's
ladies present.

604
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,689
Sorry, miss. Sorry about that.

605
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,652
Miss, what's your name?

606
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,288
Saraya.
No, sorry, Britani.

607
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,587
Do you not remember your name?

608
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:18,354
No, I do. It's just
they asked me to change it.

609
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:19,620
Do you remember
what you changed it to?

610
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:20,987
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's good.

611
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:22,153
What is it?

612
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:23,255
Uh, Paige.

613
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:24,753
As a wrestling name, Paige?

614
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:25,954
Yeah.

615
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:27,953
Paige feels a little more
like she might work

616
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:30,019
at the perfume counter
at the mall...

617
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,954
Like, "Do you want
a free sample?"

618
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,454
No, Paige is the name
of a witch

619
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:35,020
from a TV show that I like.

620
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:36,856
So you liked the name off
the show and then you took it?

621
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:38,623
Yeah.

622
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,620
Nobody's gonna pay to watch

623
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,656
a timid little
British girl wrestle.

624
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:49,354
Yeah, well, not all
British girls are timid.

625
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:51,823
Just like not all Americans
are arrogant wankers.

626
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:54,990
Just saying.

627
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,787
Why do you wanna
wrestle, Paige?

628
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:01,086
Been wrestling since I was 13.
My whole family wrestles.

629
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,852
But why do you wanna wrestle?

630
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,619
Been wrestling since I was 13.
My whole family wrestles.

631
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,455
But why do you wanna wrestle?

632
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:11,090
Um...

633
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:15,953
It's an escape, isn't it?

634
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:18,254
From the real world.

635
00:27:18,256 --> 00:27:19,786
And when I'm in that ring
with my family,

636
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:23,419
working together,
flowing together...

637
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:26,688
It feels like the world
just disappears.

638
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,488
And I sort of feel like
I belong somewhere.

639
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:35,322
She showed us her heart.

640
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,086
And I wanna vomit.

641
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:39,986
You, who got you dressed?

642
00:27:39,988 --> 00:27:41,187
The whole thing
was your thing?

643
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:42,453
- That's your salad?
- Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:43,820
That's what you mixed up
in a bowl?

645
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:45,920
- Yeah, I like it.
- Okay.

646
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:47,519
Do you know what a push-up is?

647
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,489
Come on, guys.
Pace, pace, pace!

648
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:03,819
Who knew? A leopard
in sheikh's clothing.

649
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,189
Cupid's Arrow!

650
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,853
You need to play everything
out more, all right?

651
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:31,520
Sell your snaps harder, okay?
Shot, kick, bulldog.

652
00:28:31,522 --> 00:28:33,420
- Ready?
- Yeah, good one.

653
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:55,820
Nice finisher.
Is that your move?

654
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:57,523
Yeah, Zak Attack.

655
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,753
You dick.

656
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:04,086
Give yourselves
a big hand, everybody.

657
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:06,453
That was a tremendous amount
of energy and effort...

658
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:07,954
and I want to thank
all of you for that.

659
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,587
It takes a lot of courage
to put yourself out there

660
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,987
and I respect that.

661
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:14,452
If I call your name,
please step forward.

662
00:29:14,454 --> 00:29:16,486
That means you will be coming
with me to Florida,

663
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,954
where you will join
NXT Developmental.

664
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,054
At which point, we will assess

665
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:23,420
whether or not
you get to go on to the WWE.

666
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:24,986
If I do not call your name,

667
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:26,622
then this is the end
of the line for you.

668
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,289
Paige.

669
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:38,689
Thank you all very much.

670
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,456
Well done.

671
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:53,986
This isn't right.

672
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:02,123
Raya.

673
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:11,019
You have
to take my brother.

674
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,519
Excuse me?

675
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,619
No one deserves this more than
Zak. Why didn't you pick him?

676
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,720
99% of the people
don't get picked.

677
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:18,953
He was running rings
around those other guys!

678
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:20,519
We're not looking
for ring runners.

679
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:23,821
No, wait. You have to explain
why you didn't pick him!

680
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,020
I don't have
to explain anything.

681
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:27,286
I wish you the best, son.

682
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:29,090
But this is the end
of the line for you.

683
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:32,986
If he's not going,
neither am I.

684
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:34,753
- Raya, don't be stupid, okay?
- Is that a threat?

685
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,319
- Yes.
- No.

686
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:37,653
You know, thousands of people

687
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:39,853
apply for this opportunity
every week.

688
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:41,019
Now, I'm gonna give you
ten seconds

689
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,286
to let me know
that you want it.

690
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:43,486
Not without Zak.

691
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:44,788
Coach, she wants this.
Don't listen to her.

692
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:48,321
Raya, let's just leave it.
Come on!

693
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:50,020
Five.

694
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,586
Raya.

695
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,919
Four.

696
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,419
You're not just doing this
for you, Raya, are you?

697
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,621
You're doing it
for the family.

698
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:58,023
Three.

699
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:01,588
- Two.
- Yeah, okay, I want this.

700
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:04,656
See you in Florida.

701
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,153
Well?

702
00:31:43,155 --> 00:31:44,321
They didn't take me.

703
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:48,421
But...

704
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:50,920
my little sister just became

705
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,986
the first 18-year-old
English girl,

706
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:55,519
to be signed by the WWE!

707
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,088
Champagne!

708
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,619
Ez, oi, go down
to the corner shop,

709
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,953
nick a bottle
of champagne. Go on.

710
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:08,019
This is so exciting!

711
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:10,352
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah, of course. Fine.

712
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:11,453
Well done, Raya.

713
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:12,455
Attaboy.

714
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,422
Suits you, that.

715
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:18,319
Remember when we made these?

716
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,923
Yeah, of course.

717
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:23,318
Take your bag down, yeah?

718
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,655
Yeah, please. Thanks.

719
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,186
Come on. Chop-chop.
In the van.

720
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:50,819
I'm not gonna be able
to make it to the airport.

721
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,519
What're you talking about?

722
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:55,019
Just got some things
I need to do.

723
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:57,287
Your sister's
going to America.

724
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,953
Yeah, I know.
Just can't get out of it.

725
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,152
It's fine. If he's busy.

726
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,154
All right.

727
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,286
Sorry, I just
got things to do.

728
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:12,919
I get it. It's cool.

729
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,523
All right, well then...

730
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:26,619
Good luck with it all.

731
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:28,018
Good luck with the baby.

732
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,988
Yeah, yeah. Cheers.

733
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:35,555
Okay.

734
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,185
Don't cry.

735
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:39,420
Huh?

736
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:42,487
At the airport.
You know what Mum's like.

737
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,987
If you're crying,
she'll start crying

738
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,420
and then you're not gonna
wanna go, are you?

739
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,820
So just put your hood up,
don't look back.

740
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:51,789
Okay.

741
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:16,453
- Bye.
- Bye.

742
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:18,122
- Bye.
- Bye.

743
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,019
Oh, God.

744
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:22,755
Come on.
You're all right. Be strong.

745
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,685
I really wish Zak
was coming with me.

746
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:33,121
Yeah, we all do, love.

747
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,453
Can you take care of him?

748
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:37,653
He'll be all right.

749
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:40,085
He's the tough one
of the family.

750
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,918
When I was living on
the streets, I didn't think...

751
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,787
I'd be lucky enough
to have kids.

752
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:47,987
Let alone one with the talent
to get bloody rich and famous.

753
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,119
You go get it, baby, okay.
You're amazing.

754
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:51,688
You're absolutely amazing.

755
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,587
You're gonna be a star, babe.

756
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:57,653
Okay, I'm gonna go.

757
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,819
- Go on.
- Don't go.

758
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:01,153
- I love you. I love you.
- Proud of you, babe.

759
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:02,953
Bye, Raya.

760
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,485
Love you, Ray.

761
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:08,922
Love you, babe.
I love you, princess.

762
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:11,986
We're proud
of you, darling.

763
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:13,353
Come on, babe.

764
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:15,786
Love you!
We're gonna miss you!

765
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,622
You're gonna be amazing.

766
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,186
Hey.

767
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:32,289
Hey.

768
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:35,619
- NXT?
- Uh, yeah, hi.

769
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,519
- Us, too. How's it going?
- Good.

770
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,352
I'm all right.
Long flight. Tired. Hi.

771
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:43,252
- Oh, I'm Kirsten.
- Hi.

772
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:45,453
- Hi, I'm Jeri-Lynn. Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

773
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:47,852
- Hey, I'm Madison.
- Hi. I'm Saraya.

774
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:50,653
No, Britani. Wait, Paige.

775
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:51,852
I love your accent.

776
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,489
You sound
like a Nazi in a movie.

777
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:56,252
Oh, thank you.

778
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:57,486
Thank you.

779
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,653
I love
that. Say something else.

780
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:00,785
Like what?

781
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:03,520
Uh, anything.
Here. Read something.

782
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:05,152
Okay.

783
00:38:05,154 --> 00:38:06,851
Uh...

784
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:09,819
"The sudden fire claimed
the lives of five orphans."

785
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,686
I love it.

786
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,486
"The charred remains
of the children

787
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:15,620
could only be identified
from dental records."

788
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:18,119
- So sexy, right?
- So sexy.

789
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,422
I am so jealous
of you right now.

790
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,322
Thank you.

791
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:49,422
Welcome.

792
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,621
Well, this is where
we assess you...

793
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:55,486
and see whether or not
you get to go on to WWE.

794
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,385
Look to your left.
To your right.

795
00:38:58,387 --> 00:38:59,751
Before you leave Orlando,

796
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,952
at least one of you
will be a stripper.

797
00:39:01,954 --> 00:39:04,586
How many of you wanna be
on the WWE main roster?

798
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:05,752
Yes, Coach!

799
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:07,852
Would you like to be
WWE World Champion?

800
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,253
Yes, Coach!

801
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:10,520
What I'm determined
to find out is,

802
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:12,119
do you want it bad enough...

803
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,119
to push your ass
past what you think

804
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,853
you're physically capable of?

805
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:16,986
Yes, Coach!

806
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,186
There's two ways out.

807
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,337
Either I cut you,
or you ask for the horn.

808
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,536
Because you know

809
00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:23,668
that you got yourself
in over your head.

810
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,903
All you gotta do is squeeze
it, makes it all stop.

811
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,501
- Would you like the horn?
- No, Coach!

812
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:28,669
- You.
- No, Coach.

813
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:30,303
- Anybody want the horn?
- No, Coach!

814
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:35,003
Good! Welcome to the suck.
Let's have some fun.

815
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:37,538
Go!

816
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:40,270
Set!

817
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:42,206
Keep moving, guys.
Keep moving.

818
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:46,669
Down!

819
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:47,738
Up!

820
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:50,104
Down!

821
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:51,872
Bump! And again!

822
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:54,769
- Squeeze the horn and go home!
- No, Coach!

823
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:55,839
- Squeeze the horn!
- No!

824
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:04,602
<i>I ain't goin' back
Till the bottle runs dry</i>

825
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:06,935
<i>I ain't goin' back</i>

826
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:11,171
<i>Till the car gets high
I ain't goin' back</i>

827
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:14,501
If I do shake your hand,

828
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:16,272
that means this is
the end of the line for you.

829
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:20,205
Thank you for your time.

830
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:27,337
I'll see the rest
of you tomorrow.

831
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:30,269
Barry's gone.

832
00:40:30,271 --> 00:40:32,735
Take the wrist.

833
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:37,068
Swing under and take the head.

834
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,537
Good. And again. Come on.

835
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:46,235
Push, push!
Okay, dig deep!

836
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,702
Get on your feet.
Get on your feet.

837
00:40:49,704 --> 00:40:50,704
Are we done here?

838
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,604
All right,
go to the locker room.

839
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:57,902
Come on, Paige.
Push it, push it up.

840
00:40:57,904 --> 00:40:59,770
What if you gotta do
a belly-to-back suplex

841
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:01,002
and lift someone?

842
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:02,202
You can't lift them,
you drop them

843
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:03,570
on their head.
You'll break their neck.

844
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:04,902
You'll give me a shit-ton
of paperwork.

845
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:07,203
I hate paperwork.
I can barely write, Paige.

846
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:08,536
Push it!

847
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:14,036
Keep going! Nice, big,
long push, Courtney!

848
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,735
Come on! Good girl.

849
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:17,569
Come on!

850
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:20,368
A nice, long, deep push.

851
00:41:36,604 --> 00:41:38,003
<i>Good morning,
wrestling nerds.</i>

852
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,335
Good morning, Coach!

853
00:41:39,337 --> 00:41:41,102
Welcome to promo class.

854
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:43,069
Now, as you all know,
wrestling is storytelling.

855
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:45,570
It is soap opera in spandex.

856
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:49,103
Good versus evil.
Babyface versus heel.

857
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,203
We do a lot
of our storytelling

858
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:51,301
in the ring with wrestling...

859
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,403
but equally as important,

860
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:54,702
you must be able
to storytell on the mic.

861
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:56,602
This is an essential part
of being able

862
00:41:56,604 --> 00:41:58,368
to get over with the fans.

863
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,369
This is your opportunity
to let them know who you are.

864
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:03,103
Tell them what you're about.

865
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:06,102
The WWE can put you
on the main roster...

866
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:08,538
but only the fans
can keep you there.

867
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,368
Who wants to go first?

868
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,837
My name is Jeri-Lynn.

869
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,036
And I may look like
the girl next door...

870
00:42:16,038 --> 00:42:19,403
but underneath this
is a firecracker.

871
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:21,769
And I am going to blow you...

872
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:24,569
- Excuse me?
- ...out of the water!

873
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:25,836
My 10-year-old just

874
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:27,235
asked me some questions
I don't wanna answer.

875
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:28,336
- Let's put it together.
- Yeah.

876
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,502
- Let's keep it one.
- Of course.

877
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,502
My name is Augustus Heights.

878
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:33,835
- Augustus?
- Augustus Heights.

879
00:42:33,837 --> 00:42:35,169
Are you a polo player?

880
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:36,803
- Uh, no.
- Are you gonna

881
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,204
- come out in full polo garb?
- No.

882
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:39,336
How did you come up
with Augustus Heights?

883
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:40,402
It's my name.

884
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:41,535
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

885
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:42,902
Okay, let's go again.

886
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:44,670
My name is Augustus Heights.

887
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:46,436
Are you a guy who's going
to inherit a beer company?

888
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,736
No.

889
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:48,903
Let's come up
with a wrestling name.

890
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:50,136
Augustus Heights
feels like a guy

891
00:42:50,138 --> 00:42:52,436
who's gonna politely
ask me for some butter.

892
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,602
My name is Paige.
And I am all the rage.

893
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:59,036
Girls wanna be me.
Guys wanna get to know me.

894
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:01,369
May sound like bragging,
but it ain't if it's true.

895
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,269
It ain't about the size
of the dog in the fight...

896
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:04,835
it's about the size
of the fight in the dog.

897
00:43:04,837 --> 00:43:07,938
And this dog
is about to bite hard!

898
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:10,269
I love it.

899
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:11,502
Yeah?

900
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:13,169
When I heard it 20 years ago.

901
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,737
Those are like lines
you could get off a Dixie cup.

902
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:18,070
Well, people liked it
in Norwich, so...

903
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:19,269
Yeah, but here
they have cable,

904
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:20,636
and running water,
and electricity...

905
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:22,601
and they would've heard
their 5-year-old brother...

906
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,870
use it at a dinner table.

907
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,003
You go out and you take that

908
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,369
in front of
a live crowd here...

909
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,069
it's like throwing a pork chop
to a bunch of hyenas.

910
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,435
They're gonna chew you up.

911
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:32,003
You gotta find something
that's specific to you.

912
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:34,669
Something that only
you can say.

913
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,337
All right, let's go. Next.

914
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:39,602
My name is Nick Barnes.

915
00:43:39,604 --> 00:43:42,302
For those of you who don't
know me, let me fill you in.

916
00:43:42,304 --> 00:43:43,535
Where I come from...

917
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,268
...you have to work hard
to get what you want.

918
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,605
But what I see here is a bunch
of lazy wannabe wrestlers.

919
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:56,205
- I say, do it!
- Do it? Yeah?

920
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:01,771
All right.

921
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:20,670
<i>Go for Hutch.</i>

922
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:23,970
<i>Hello, Mr. Morgan?
It's Zak Zodiac calling again.</i>

923
00:44:23,972 --> 00:44:26,105
Just wanted to check up
on the tape.

924
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:28,069
<i>We reviewed your tape,</i>

925
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,569
<i>and we were
all very impressed.</i>

926
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:31,936
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, thank you.

927
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:33,572
That means a lot. Thank you.

928
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,905
<i>But the, uh,
answer is still no.</i>

929
00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:43,736
Could I speak to someone else,
please, sir?

930
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:45,736
Someone higher up maybe.

931
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:47,438
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

932
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:52,402
Sir, I don't think
you understand. Um...

933
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:54,070
You see,
this is my dream, this.

934
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:55,669
I do understand.

935
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:57,370
<i>No, no, you don't.</i>

936
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:59,336
Look, I have a kid now, sir,

937
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:02,936
and I've made
my girlfriend promises.

938
00:45:02,938 --> 00:45:05,368
We're looking
for something you don't have.

939
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,268
What's that, then?

940
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,836
Something extra.

941
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:10,736
- Something extra?
- <i>A spark.</i>

942
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:13,735
I have that. I've got that
in buckets, mate.

943
00:45:13,737 --> 00:45:15,002
<i>No, you don't.</i>

944
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,371
Yes, I do. I do.

945
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:18,338
<i>No, you don't.</i>

946
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:21,071
And what? But my sister does?

947
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:25,935
Let it go, son.

948
00:45:25,937 --> 00:45:29,268
Please, please don't do this.
All right. Don't do this.

949
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,435
<i>Let it go.</i>

950
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,769
I can't. I can't let it go

951
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,104
because this is all
I can do, right?

952
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,503
Then you'll have
to find something else.

953
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:40,235
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- I...

954
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:47,904
Jesus...

955
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:07,902
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

956
00:46:07,904 --> 00:46:09,036
You're supposed to pull it,

957
00:46:09,038 --> 00:46:10,502
not actually kick me
in the ovaries.

958
00:46:10,504 --> 00:46:12,003
I'm sorry.

959
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,170
Okay. Doesn't matter.
Let's go again.

960
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:19,003
Oh, my...

961
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:20,235
I'm so sorry.

962
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:22,235
- What was that?
- It was a mistake.

963
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,435
Yeah, no, I know wrestlers

964
00:46:23,437 --> 00:46:25,003
that are paralyzed
from mistakes.

965
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:26,703
Where did you wrestle before?

966
00:46:26,705 --> 00:46:27,936
I didn't.

967
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:29,204
So, what did you do?

968
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:31,238
I was a model.

969
00:46:32,904 --> 00:46:35,269
Okay, um...

970
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:38,103
Right. You need to look at me
so I know when to move.

971
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,337
Okay.

972
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,939
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

973
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,436
What happened?

974
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:51,434
She slapped her.
Like a for-real slap.

975
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,269
No. It was a receipt.

976
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:55,169
- Looked like a slap.
- It's called a receipt.

977
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,902
You botch a move,
you get a receipt.

978
00:46:56,904 --> 00:46:58,836
- All right, apologize.
- For what?

979
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:00,169
Receipts are important.

980
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:01,770
It teaches you not to make
the same mistake twice.

981
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:04,069
We don't give receipts here.
I said apologize.

982
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,268
Well, you should. They'd
pick things up a lot quicker.

983
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,436
When I was learning,

984
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:09,001
I got loads of receipts
from my brother.

985
00:47:09,003 --> 00:47:10,703
This isn't some inbred,
backyard wrestling unit.

986
00:47:10,705 --> 00:47:11,903
This is the NXT.

987
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:14,036
We don't do the receipt stuff
around here.

988
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:15,569
So, if I ask you to apologize

989
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,368
or do anything else,
I expect you to do it.

990
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,602
I was just teaching her
how to...

991
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:21,272
Paige, I just asked you
to apologize!

992
00:47:24,705 --> 00:47:26,435
I'm sorry.

993
00:47:26,437 --> 00:47:27,572
It's fine.

994
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:32,371
All right. Get back at it.

995
00:47:36,871 --> 00:47:38,035
You okay?

996
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:39,335
Yeah.
You wanna switch up?

997
00:47:39,337 --> 00:47:41,402
Yeah, yeah,
I'll switch in.

998
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:43,869
<i>I miss
you all so much.</i>

999
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,368
I just lie awake, thinking
about what you're all doing.

1000
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,536
I haven't even met Caden yet!

1001
00:47:48,538 --> 00:47:50,268
You ain't missing much,
just shitting and pissing.

1002
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,101
<i>How's
the training, love?</i>

1003
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:53,269
It's really hard.

1004
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,469
<i>I mean,
it's meant to be hard.</i>

1005
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,271
If it was easy, any
poor bastard could do it.

1006
00:47:57,605 --> 00:47:59,002
What's
your competition like?

1007
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,268
Hmm. All the other
girls are gorgeous.

1008
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,435
<i>Yeah, they've probably
been chosen</i>

1009
00:48:02,437 --> 00:48:03,802
<i>for their looks, unlike you.</i>

1010
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:05,869
- Thanks, Mum.
- <i>No, I don't mean that, do I?</i>

1011
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:07,135
I just mean that WWE,

1012
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,336
they take on models
and cheerleaders and girls

1013
00:48:09,338 --> 00:48:10,502
that just wanna get famous

1014
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:11,934
jiggling their
tits and their ass.

1015
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:13,703
<i>They don't have girls with
wrestling experience like you.</i>

1016
00:48:13,705 --> 00:48:15,169
<i>You're gonna blow them
out of the water.</i>

1017
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:16,503
Maybe.

1018
00:48:16,505 --> 00:48:18,403
<i>Ever since we
announced you'd been signed...</i>

1019
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:21,901
<i>it has gone absolutely
mental over here.</i>

1020
00:48:21,903 --> 00:48:24,201
<i>We are selling
a ton of merchandise.</i>

1021
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:25,204
What merchandise?

1022
00:48:28,504 --> 00:48:29,570
Who's that?

1023
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:31,236
- It's you, innit?
- You.

1024
00:48:31,238 --> 00:48:32,405
Who's making them?

1025
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,702
Are you running a sweatshop?

1026
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:38,401
It is not a sweatshop!

1027
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:40,069
Nah, in a sweatshop,
you get paid.

1028
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:43,336
All right,
no more rice for you, huh?

1029
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,736
Hey, babe...

1030
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:46,435
<i>number one best-selling item.</i>

1031
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:47,602
Ho-ho.

1032
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:48,868
Signed picture.

1033
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,969
But who's signing them?

1034
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:52,235
Who do you think? I got RSI.

1035
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:54,935
<i>Yeah, but that is
from wanking, not writing.</i>

1036
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:56,935
Wait. Guys, "Paige"
should have an "I" in it.

1037
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,736
<i>Should it?</i>

1038
00:48:58,738 --> 00:49:01,103
<i>Puh, ah... Ah, yeah.</i>

1039
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,101
<i>Yeah. It doesn't matter.</i>

1040
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:04,770
None of our fans
can read anyway.

1041
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:07,501
<i>Listen, I had a brainwave
about the Christmassacre.</i>

1042
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:10,737
<i>Zak Zodiac versus the WWE's...</i>

1043
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,435
- <i>Paige!</i>
- <i>Paige!</i>

1044
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:15,168
I don't know, Dad.
I'm not sure.

1045
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,269
<i>You're gonna win.</i>

1046
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:17,436
The fans will love it.

1047
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:18,967
What do you think, Zak?

1048
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:21,769
Zak loves the idea! We sold
a lot of tickets, babe.

1049
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:23,735
Wait, you sold tickets?
Without telling me?

1050
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:26,703
We're telling you now.

1051
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:29,602
<i>Look at that. Look at that!
That's all you.</i>

1052
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:31,069
<i>You should be proud.</i>

1053
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:33,035
<i>You're doing that
for your family.</i>

1054
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:34,501
Now, imagine you get
on the main roster. Huh?

1055
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:35,705
We'll make millions!

1056
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:39,834
What if I don't get
on the main roster?

1057
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:43,168
<i>What? Don't talk
like that, darling.</i>

1058
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:47,135
<i>Look, you just work hard,
yeah? Keep focused.</i>

1059
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:49,234
<i>We're all proud of you.
We believe in you.</i>

1060
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,035
<i>Yeah. Bye, babe.</i>

1061
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:52,868
- <i>Love you, Raya! We love you!</i>
- Bye.

1062
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,704
<i>Bye! Love you!</i>

1063
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,868
He's not
the smartest cookie.

1064
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,235
Yeah, he's been dropped
on his head too many times.

1065
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,235
Hey!

1066
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:11,502
I just wanted
to explain the receipt.

1067
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:15,069
I got a bit nervous,
because Kirsten...

1068
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:17,568
up until a few months ago,
she was just a model.

1069
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,935
Sometimes,
WWE, they hire girls...

1070
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:21,668
who just wanna
jiggle their tits and ass

1071
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,169
and get famous, basically.

1072
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,672
Like cheerleaders, models,
dancers, whatever.

1073
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:27,372
I was a model.

1074
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:29,535
Ah, right.

1075
00:50:29,537 --> 00:50:30,537
Cheerleader.

1076
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:33,668
Cool.

1077
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,171
Well, at least you're
not dancers.

1078
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:41,272
I'm...

1079
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:44,904
See you later!

1080
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,502
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1081
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:49,102
<i>...we are NXT!</i>

1082
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:52,235
<i>And the future is now!</i>

1083
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:54,568
<i>Introducing
to the WWE Universe</i>

1084
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,935
<i>for the very first time...</i>

1085
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:58,268
<i>Madison!</i>

1086
00:51:03,037 --> 00:51:06,868
<i>Please welcome Jeri-Lynn!</i>

1087
00:51:09,071 --> 00:51:12,338
<i>Welcome Kirsten!</i>

1088
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,704
I love you, Kirsten!

1089
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,703
<i>All the way from the UK...</i>

1090
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:22,901
<i>Paige!</i>

1091
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:31,268
Yeah, this is
what I paid for,

1092
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,235
three hot chicks
and my dead grandmother.

1093
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:36,535
Look on the bright side.

1094
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:38,702
At least
she's not in a bikini.

1095
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:45,035
And now it's time for the WWE
Divas Promo Challenge!

1096
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:55,701
My name is Kirsten.

1097
00:51:55,703 --> 00:52:00,435
And I'm the future of NXT.

1098
00:52:00,437 --> 00:52:03,735
And the future looks good!

1099
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:08,336
But what can I say
about Paige?

1100
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:10,035
Where's your black cat?

1101
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:12,205
I could say, I'm gonna
rearrange your teeth.

1102
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,203
Ooh!

1103
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:17,336
But you're British,
I'd be doing you a favor!

1104
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,401
Now, the world
can be a very dark place.

1105
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:27,502
That's why people
want sunshine and glamour.

1106
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:31,402
Which is why I'm gonna stick
your broomstick up your butt

1107
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:34,602
and fly you home to Hogwarts!

1108
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,402
What you got?

1109
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,169
Come on, Ozzy Osbourne!

1110
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,369
Sing something!

1111
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:04,068
Speak! The power
of Christ compels you!

1112
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,369
We can't hear you!

1113
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:09,069
We can't hear you!

1114
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:11,602
We can't hear you!

1115
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:13,602
We can't hear you!

1116
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,436
You just suck!

1117
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,738
Freak!

1118
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:28,601
Yeah, gonna have to
get used to it, though.

1119
00:53:28,603 --> 00:53:30,204
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1120
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:32,372
Hey, you okay?

1121
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,338
Mmm-hmm.

1122
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:20,204
Jesus Christ, Zak!

1123
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:44,505
<i>Hello! You've reached Zak.

Zak's here, Zak's here!
Y'all, let's go, let's go.

1125
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,338
All right, let's go.
Come on! Let's do this!

1126
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:19,903
What's going on?

1127
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:23,502
Why'd he just leave like that?

1128
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:24,568
Dude?

1129
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,834
Guys, we're not wrestling.

1130
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:27,036
I take it
we're not wrestling today.

1131
00:55:27,038 --> 00:55:28,268
Yeah.

1132
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,034
- Hey!
- Hey!

1133
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:24,702
Hey!

1134
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:26,236
You're blonde!

1135
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:27,402
Yeah.

1136
00:56:27,404 --> 00:56:29,534
Thought I'd
change it up a bit.

1137
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:31,068
Who did it?

1138
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,369
I did it myself.

1139
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:33,434
- Really?
- Last night, yeah.

1140
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:35,238
- Right on.
- Nice!

1141
00:56:35,903 --> 00:56:37,069
And you're so tan!

1142
00:56:37,071 --> 00:56:38,400
I did that myself, too.

1143
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:40,169
- Looks so natural.
- Nice!

1144
00:56:40,171 --> 00:56:41,834
It's good to change it up.

1145
00:56:41,836 --> 00:56:43,038
- Yeah.
- Sometimes, I wanna do that.

1146
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:46,071
Did someone break up with you?

1147
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,170
No.

1148
00:56:52,604 --> 00:56:53,735
Whatever.

1149
00:56:53,737 --> 00:56:54,835
Well, should we load up?

1150
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:55,934
Yeah!

1151
00:56:55,936 --> 00:56:57,271
Yeah, we'll go get a seat.

1152
00:57:03,404 --> 00:57:06,501
This is our last day
before the holiday!

1153
00:57:06,503 --> 00:57:08,535
I'm not gonna have
your asses for a week!

1154
00:57:08,537 --> 00:57:12,433
So, please, show me
that you wanna be here!

1155
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,770
Fight for it!

1156
00:57:31,603 --> 00:57:33,434
Come on!
Get her out of the ring!

1157
00:57:33,436 --> 00:57:35,903
Let me see
how bad you want it!

1158
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,101
Next group up!

1159
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:52,068
Don't be shy with those!

1160
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:58,735
You wanna headline
<i>WrestleMania.</i>

1161
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:01,070
You wanna be Divas Champion,
then show me!

1162
00:58:05,437 --> 00:58:06,537
All right, come on, ladies!

1163
00:58:11,603 --> 00:58:15,203
Here we go! Look who got
a makeover to come in last!

1164
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,835
Come on! You look
like a snow leopard!

1165
00:58:18,837 --> 00:58:20,601
Thank God for
the camouflage pants

1166
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:22,604
so the hunters can't see you
in the sand!

1167
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:25,902
Flip the tire three times!

1168
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:30,671
Three times!
Come on, English, let's go!

1169
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,035
That's two. Come on.

1170
00:58:47,037 --> 00:58:48,101
How're you gonna flip a girl

1171
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:49,434
five nights
a week in a ring...

1172
00:58:49,436 --> 00:58:53,403
if you can't even flip
a vulcanized rubber circle?

1173
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,368
Oh, shit! I can't!

1174
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,868
I can't...

1175
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,536
Put yourself
out of your misery.

1176
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:22,671
Next group up!
Bar's been lowered!

1177
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:42,435
I don't even know
if I wanna be here anymore.

1178
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:44,001
Talk about me again
behind my back...

1179
00:59:44,003 --> 00:59:45,434
and I swear I'll give you
more than a receipt.

1180
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:46,835
I wasn't talking about you.

1181
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:48,035
You are so fake.

1182
00:59:48,037 --> 00:59:49,267
- No one was talking about you.
- Oh, my God.

1183
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:50,902
- I saw you!
- We weren't talking about you!

1184
00:59:50,904 --> 00:59:52,002
What, do you think I'm stupid?

1185
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:53,535
I've been sat right there
just watching you!

1186
00:59:53,537 --> 00:59:55,038
We're talking about her.

1187
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,734
Who is she?

1188
00:59:57,736 --> 00:59:59,268
My daughter...

1189
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,367
who I haven't seen in four
months because I'm here...

1190
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:04,370
putting up with your shit,
so she can have a better life.

1191
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:06,868
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

1192
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,934
No, you don't know
anything about me.

1193
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:12,037
Or them, or about our lives,
or why we're here.

1194
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,335
Well, you never told me.

1195
01:00:15,337 --> 01:00:17,035
You never asked.

1196
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:18,600
Why would you?

1197
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:19,770
We're just
tits and ass, right?

1198
01:00:43,837 --> 01:00:45,670
Well,
the girls took a vote.

1199
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:50,436
You're the homecoming queen.

1200
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,871
Thanks.

1201
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:57,737
How do you think
this ends for you?

1202
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:04,167
On the main roster.
Divas Champion.

1203
01:01:04,169 --> 01:01:05,501
You realize that today

1204
01:01:05,503 --> 01:01:07,702
was about proving
that you deserve that.

1205
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:08,704
Right?

1206
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,035
I'll start proving myself

1207
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:14,767
when you put me
with real wrestlers.

1208
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:16,903
Wrestlers like my brother.

1209
01:01:17,904 --> 01:01:20,202
Your brother's a journeyman.

1210
01:01:20,204 --> 01:01:22,101
- No.
- Yes.

1211
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:24,701
- No!
- There are stars...

1212
01:01:24,703 --> 01:01:26,201
and there's journeymen
who take the hits...

1213
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:27,434
that make the stars look good.

1214
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:29,001
And your brother's
a journeyman.

1215
01:01:29,003 --> 01:01:30,268
He's the punching bag.

1216
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,901
He's the guy with the bad
shorts with no fanfare.

1217
01:01:32,903 --> 01:01:34,235
No, you bring him here...

1218
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:37,435
I bring him out here
and then what?

1219
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:39,735
We put him on the road
for 200 days a year?

1220
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,435
He's chasing fame that's
never gonna come to him?

1221
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:44,333
His wife starts screwing
the garbage man

1222
01:01:44,335 --> 01:01:45,834
'cause he's never around?

1223
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,936
His kid can't remember
his face, and for what?

1224
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,868
Maybe he'd get a shot
at a pay-per-view event.

1225
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,667
And he would try so hard
to make an impression...

1226
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,335
he'd probably let
a real star...

1227
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,801
throw him off a 30-foot cage
onto a concrete floor.

1228
01:01:58,803 --> 01:02:00,301
Have his shoulder bone...

1229
01:02:00,303 --> 01:02:02,234
just kinda splice right
through his rotator cuff...

1230
01:02:02,236 --> 01:02:04,168
tear it clean in half.

1231
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,535
And then the doctor would say,

1232
01:02:05,537 --> 01:02:08,601
"That's it. Your
wrestling career is over."

1233
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:10,501
But why quit then?
He wouldn't stop.

1234
01:02:10,503 --> 01:02:13,435
So then the wife would
leave him and take the kid.

1235
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:15,101
And then, he would just keep
chasing the pipe dream...

1236
01:02:15,103 --> 01:02:18,368
until he'd end up
4,000 miles away

1237
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,100
from anyone
that ever loved him.

1238
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:22,534
He'd be bitter,
and he'd be mean.

1239
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:26,268
And he'd be all by himself...

1240
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,101
just wishing that, God,
he could get his kid

1241
01:02:28,103 --> 01:02:30,070
to return his phone call.

1242
01:02:31,337 --> 01:02:34,535
Is that the life that you want
for your brother?

1243
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:36,904
No, I know that
wouldn't happen to Zak.

1244
01:02:38,502 --> 01:02:40,203
I didn't think
that would happen to me.

1245
01:02:43,604 --> 01:02:45,234
We didn't sign your brother.

1246
01:02:45,236 --> 01:02:46,701
And we shouldn't
have signed you.

1247
01:02:46,703 --> 01:02:47,901
You're weak in your body...

1248
01:02:47,903 --> 01:02:50,101
and your spirit's weak.

1249
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,368
You think it's tough now.
This is only gonna get harder.

1250
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,234
You should go home.

1251
01:02:56,236 --> 01:02:59,069
Wrestle with your family
and be happy.

1252
01:03:00,203 --> 01:03:02,069
That's how this ends for ya.

1253
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:20,067
It's gonna be
four grand up, love.

1254
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:23,401
There's a big buzz about
the Christmassacre, you know.

1255
01:03:23,403 --> 01:03:24,735
I'm thinking
that I might have to do

1256
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:27,871
maybe two nights, babe,
if you can hang around.

1257
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,067
Bloody hell!
Look at that tan!

1258
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:40,103
Willy Wonka called, he needs
you back at the factory.

1259
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:42,735
Hi, Mum.

1260
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:44,503
Come here, baby!

1261
01:03:47,037 --> 01:03:48,434
- Who made you do all that?
- Huh?

1262
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:51,034
- All of that.
- No one.

1263
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,037
- It's America, it's different.
- Right.

1264
01:03:55,204 --> 01:03:56,701
Anyway, how's Caden?
How's Courtney?

1265
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:58,167
- Caden's beautiful, yeah.
- Yeah?

1266
01:03:58,169 --> 01:04:00,000
- Yeah.
- And how's Zak?

1267
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,235
- Yeah, no, Zak's good.
- Yeah?

1268
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:03,904
- Yeah, he's good.
- Okay.

1269
01:04:22,103 --> 01:04:23,104
Hey!

1270
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:27,736
- Hey.
- Hey.

1271
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,035
- You all right?
- How you doing?

1272
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:31,802
Yeah, good, yeah, good.

1273
01:04:31,804 --> 01:04:33,534
How are you?

1274
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,334
Yeah, well...

1275
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:38,067
I tried calling you
loads of times, but...

1276
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:41,267
Yeah, my phone's
probably been off. Caden...

1277
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:42,501
Been working a ton.

1278
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,870
Oh, okay.

1279
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:49,103
How is the States?

1280
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,368
Uh...

1281
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,767
Yeah, I've been wanting
to talk to you

1282
01:04:55,769 --> 01:04:57,670
about that, actually.

1283
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,670
Um...

1284
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,571
I'm not gonna go back.

1285
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:11,335
It's harder than we ever
thought it would be.

1286
01:05:11,337 --> 01:05:13,371
And I... I can't do it.

1287
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:20,568
I was hoping you could help me

1288
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,070
tell Mum and Dad
about it later.

1289
01:05:25,669 --> 01:05:27,934
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- <i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

1290
01:05:27,936 --> 01:05:29,735
Thanks.

1291
01:05:29,737 --> 01:05:31,668
<i>Please welcome...</i>

01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,670
- Yeah, Paige!
- We love you, Paige!

1301
01:06:21,404 --> 01:06:22,903
All right. Let's go.

1302
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,866
Bit of back and forth.

1303
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:29,034
You get the better of her.

1304
01:06:29,036 --> 01:06:30,602
Last minute,
you smash him up. Yeah?

1305
01:06:30,604 --> 01:06:33,367
- Good, let's go. Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1306
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:34,868
You ready? Ring the bell!

1307
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,700
- Come on, baby girl!
- Come on, Paige!

1308
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,204
Come on, girl!

1309
01:06:52,169 --> 01:06:53,203
Yeah.

1310
01:06:58,436 --> 01:06:59,602
Zak, come on.

1311
01:06:59,604 --> 01:07:00,770
- Zak!
- Get out, Zak!

1312
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:07,937
What's he doing?

1313
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:11,570
What?

1314
01:07:13,537 --> 01:07:14,571
- Zak!
- Zak!

1315
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:19,537
Hey!

1316
01:07:25,935 --> 01:07:27,133
Go easy, would you?

1317
01:07:27,135 --> 01:07:28,836
You're going too hard.

1318
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:31,369
No, no, no! Zak, no! Don't!

1319
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:37,035
- Ref, get involved!
- I'm warning ya!

1320
01:07:37,037 --> 01:07:38,537
- She's fine, she's fine!
- Ease up on her.

1321
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:41,368
Come on, Raya, get up!

1322
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,702
Daddy, I don't know
what he's doing.

1323
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:44,104
Big smile, Raya. Big smiles.

1324
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:47,104
Yeah!

1325
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,469
- One!
- Yes!

1326
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:54,534
- Two!
- Three!

1327
01:07:54,536 --> 01:07:56,202
- No! Two!
- No, three!

1328
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:58,601
- That was two.
- Get up, Paige!

1329
01:07:58,603 --> 01:08:00,501
- Zak, get off me!
- No, no, no!

1330
01:08:00,503 --> 01:08:01,767
Let me down, Zak!

1331
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:03,000
- Don't you dare!
- No!

1332
01:08:03,002 --> 01:08:04,069
Zak! No!

1333
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,568
- One!
- Zak!

1334
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,535
- Two!
- Let me up!

1335
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:12,870
Three!

1336
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:22,800
- Shut up!
- Raya, you all right?

1337
01:08:30,237 --> 01:08:31,336
What was that?

1338
01:08:32,536 --> 01:08:34,833
Slam me three times!
Is that a joke?

1339
01:08:34,835 --> 01:08:36,667
- Zak?
- Oi, dickhead!

1340
01:08:36,669 --> 01:08:38,734
You could've broken her neck!

1341
01:08:38,736 --> 01:08:39,900
She was in the ring, too.

1342
01:08:39,902 --> 01:08:41,733
She's a big girl.
Give her shit.

1343
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:43,935
She does what she's told!
She follows the script!

1344
01:08:43,937 --> 01:08:45,504
Does she?

1345
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:47,866
Shut up, Zak.

1346
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:49,368
Well, you wanted my help
telling them.

1347
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,733
- Let's tell 'em.
- No, shut up!

1348
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:52,734
- What is going on?
- Nothing. It's fine.

1349
01:08:52,736 --> 01:08:54,200
Look, babe.

1350
01:08:54,202 --> 01:08:56,335
- You ain't pregnant, are ya?
- No, I'm not pregnant, Dad.

1351
01:08:56,337 --> 01:08:58,034
- I will hit the roof.
- No, I'm not pregnant!

1352
01:08:58,036 --> 01:08:59,437
- It's fine.
- She's quitting.

1353
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,867
- What?
- You prick.

1354
01:09:02,869 --> 01:09:04,437
You're welcome.

1355
01:09:09,203 --> 01:09:10,236
Wait.

1356
01:09:11,736 --> 01:09:13,535
You what?

1357
01:09:13,537 --> 01:09:15,437
Raya, I'm confused.
Is he... Is he joking?

1358
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,436
No, I can't do it.

1359
01:09:19,336 --> 01:09:20,601
Of course, you can do it.

1360
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:23,535
No, I wake up...
I work out, I train...

1361
01:09:23,537 --> 01:09:26,733
I come home, I can't sleep.

1362
01:09:26,735 --> 01:09:28,270
And then we do it
all again the next day.

1363
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:31,933
I'm really lonely
and I have no friends.

1364
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,935
Yeah, life of a wrestler.
Get a cat!

1365
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:36,901
No, Dad, I don't wanna be
4,000 miles away.

1366
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:39,201
I wanna be here,
I wanna be with my family.

1367
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:40,901
You're doing this
for your family!

1368
01:09:40,903 --> 01:09:42,133
Yeah, I thought
Zak would be there.

1369
01:09:42,135 --> 01:09:43,569
Well, he ain't there!

1370
01:09:43,571 --> 01:09:45,535
He bollocksed it up!
So did Roy!

1371
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:47,168
I'm not letting you
bollocks it up and all!

1372
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,600
I'm not going back!

1373
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:49,901
You are going back
to the States,

1374
01:09:49,903 --> 01:09:51,401
if I have to
drag you there myself!

1375
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:53,367
You're an alchie ex-con, Dad!
They're not gonna let you in!

1376
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:56,101
- Oi, you watch your mouth!
- You... Stay!

1377
01:09:56,103 --> 01:09:57,933
Raya.

1378
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:59,501
Raya, wait. Come here.

1379
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:01,267
I know it's hard, okay? I do.

1380
01:10:01,269 --> 01:10:03,901
But you cannot give this
opportunity up. It's massive.

1381
01:10:03,903 --> 01:10:06,167
You're gonna regret it.

1382
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:08,267
And it's what you've
always wanted.

1383
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:10,404
Yeah? Or is it
what you've always wanted?

1384
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:12,201
What do you mean?

1385
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:13,867
Mum.

1386
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:15,837
You named me
after your own ring name.

1387
01:10:24,436 --> 01:10:26,702
Go away.

1388
01:10:28,869 --> 01:10:31,967
Ray, Courtney rang.

1389
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:32,936
Your brother's not come home.

1390
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,934
If you don't wanna go back
to America,

1391
01:10:50,936 --> 01:10:52,566
we're not gonna make you.

1392
01:10:52,568 --> 01:10:54,699
Shut up!

1393
01:10:54,701 --> 01:10:56,933
Has everyone gone mad?

1394
01:10:56,935 --> 01:10:59,100
If she gets on the main
roster, she is set for life.

1395
01:10:59,102 --> 01:11:01,534
- She is, or you are?
- All of us!

1396
01:11:01,536 --> 01:11:03,200
Jesus Christ!

1397
01:11:03,202 --> 01:11:04,368
You want me to go back
to robbing banks

1398
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,067
- to feed this family?
- What family?

1399
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,633
Our daughter's miserable,
one son's in prison,

1400
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:08,768
the other one's hanging on
by a thread.

1401
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:09,867
Zak is fine!

1402
01:11:09,869 --> 01:11:11,235
Would you get your thick head

1403
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:13,367
out of your fat ass?
He's not fine!

1404
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,034
We're out looking for Zak!

1405
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:16,368
If you have to go back
to robbing banks

1406
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,335
to feed this family, so be it.

1407
01:11:18,337 --> 01:11:20,737
'Cause at this rate, we ain't
gonna have one to feed.

1408
01:11:33,835 --> 01:11:35,368
Dad?

1409
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,601
- What, babe?
- Dad, that's Zak's car.

1410
01:11:37,603 --> 01:11:39,371
That's his car, right there.

1411
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,501
I ain't joking.
These builders...

1412
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,369
they said they're gonna
take about a month.

1413
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,267
How long they been there?
Come on, how long?

1414
01:11:52,269 --> 01:11:54,035
Six, seven weeks.

1415
01:11:54,037 --> 01:11:56,700
Every week,
they boost the prices, though.

1416
01:11:56,702 --> 01:11:57,867
They need this,
they need that.

1417
01:11:57,869 --> 01:12:00,004
A little bit of extra dough
for this...

1418
01:12:00,603 --> 01:12:01,603
Hey!

1419
01:12:02,136 --> 01:12:03,204
Oi!

1420
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:06,501
What're you doing, mate?

1421
01:12:06,503 --> 01:12:07,768
What?

1422
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,034
You just stuck your elbow out.

1423
01:12:09,036 --> 01:12:10,204
No, I didn't.

1424
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:12,901
You calling me a liar?

1425
01:12:12,903 --> 01:12:14,371
No, I'm calling you a wanker.

1426
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,536
I didn't hear that.

1427
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:19,237
Then you're a deaf wanker
as well.

1428
01:12:25,369 --> 01:12:26,535
Come on, then!

1429
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:32,669
Let's get him!

1430
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:36,566
Come on, then!

1431
01:12:42,936 --> 01:12:45,267
Come on! Come on, then!

1432
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:46,403
Come on!

1433
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:48,037
Come on!

1434
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,133
Hey!

1435
01:12:50,135 --> 01:12:53,000
That is enough! Let's go.

1436
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:54,734
It's done.

1437
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:56,500
That's Ricky Knight.

1438
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:57,734
Silly sod!

1439
01:12:57,736 --> 01:12:59,837
Yeah, that's enough.
It is enough!

1440
01:13:00,404 --> 01:13:01,500
Zak!

1441
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,700
Mum, it's fine.
We've got it. It's fine.

1442
01:13:02,702 --> 01:13:03,834
Silly bugger,
what're you doing? Come here!

1443
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:04,837
Where you going?

1444
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:07,268
Zak!

1445
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,303
Yeah, you're right.
He's fine.

1446
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:10,767
Jules.

1447
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:12,533
Oi, come here.

1448
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:15,036
Can we just talk
for a second, please?

1449
01:13:16,237 --> 01:13:18,533
Zak, why won't you talk to me?

1450
01:13:18,535 --> 01:13:19,968
'Cause I can't even look
at you.

1451
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:21,037
Why?

1452
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:24,268
Why? Why?

1453
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,001
Okay, do you actually know
what it's like, Raya,

1454
01:13:26,003 --> 01:13:27,600
to want one thing in life?

1455
01:13:27,602 --> 01:13:30,434
One dream that you think about
every single day...

1456
01:13:30,436 --> 01:13:32,433
you work for,
and you train for,

1457
01:13:32,435 --> 01:13:34,000
and you get
that close to it...

1458
01:13:34,002 --> 01:13:36,300
and then your own sister
takes it away from you.

1459
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:37,666
And then it turns out

1460
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,600
she doesn't even want it
in the first place.

1461
01:13:39,602 --> 01:13:41,037
That's why.

1462
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,533
I didn't take your dream, Zak.

1463
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:46,235
No, then why am I still here?

1464
01:13:46,237 --> 01:13:48,703
Because they didn't want you!

1465
01:13:50,735 --> 01:13:52,734
I'm sorry,
and it is so shitty,

1466
01:13:52,736 --> 01:13:54,234
but it is not my fault.

1467
01:13:54,236 --> 01:13:55,566
And it's not yours.

1468
01:13:55,568 --> 01:13:57,271
It is just how it is.

1469
01:13:58,035 --> 01:13:59,433
Right.

1470
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,501
Yeah. So you can either
curl up into a ball and die...

1471
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:05,601
or you can live with it
and move on...

1472
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:08,366
and start seeing all
the things you've got here.

1473
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:09,534
What have I got here?

1474
01:14:09,536 --> 01:14:12,403
A beautiful son,
a girlfriend that loves you.

1475
01:14:13,536 --> 01:14:15,934
All those kids at the gym.

1476
01:14:15,936 --> 01:14:19,267
Zak, you're teaching
a blind kid how to wrestle.

1477
01:14:19,269 --> 01:14:20,703
How is that even possible?

1478
01:14:22,136 --> 01:14:23,267
Just 'cause millions of people

1479
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:24,434
aren't cheering
when you do it...

1480
01:14:24,436 --> 01:14:26,603
it doesn't mean
it's not important.

1481
01:14:34,502 --> 01:14:38,004
I didn't take your dream, Zak.
It was my dream, too.

1482
01:14:41,236 --> 01:14:43,103
Then why are you
throwing it away?

1483
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:06,369
Hey.

1484
01:15:12,736 --> 01:15:13,837
Can I come in?

1485
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,470
Your mum is right.

1486
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:33,269
If you don't
wanna go back, don't.

1487
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:35,701
You don't have to do anything

1488
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:37,934
that me or Mum or anyone
want you to do...

1489
01:15:37,936 --> 01:15:40,070
unless you wanna do it.

1490
01:15:43,068 --> 01:15:46,299
You are
the spark in our lives...

1491
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:48,269
no matter what you do
with yours.

1492
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:54,736
Come here.

1493
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:00,901
What have you done
with this hair?

1494
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:04,367
I don't know.

1495
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:06,535
It's like kissing an afghan.

1496
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:25,784
Can I help you with something?

1497
01:17:25,786 --> 01:17:28,716
You didn't cut me
and I didn't quit.

1498
01:17:28,718 --> 01:17:30,317
I have a showcase
in six weeks.

1499
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:31,617
I don't have time
for any drama.

1500
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:32,683
I know.

1501
01:17:32,685 --> 01:17:33,951
Are you sure
you wanna be here?

1502
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:35,850
Yes.

1503
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:37,683
Then you better
prove it to me.

1504
01:17:37,685 --> 01:17:39,186
Yes, Coach.

1505
01:17:56,153 --> 01:17:57,284
Let's move!

1506
01:18:18,178 --> 01:18:19,200
One.

1507
01:18:20,115 --> 01:18:20,977
Two.

1508
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:27,254
Can I join?

1509
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:36,749
Come on!

1510
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,001
Look at them, look at me, go,
land at the same time, go!

1511
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,081
I'm sorry.

1512
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:52,950
Come on,
you're not a wrestler.

1513
01:18:52,952 --> 01:18:54,316
Squeeze the horn and go home.

1514
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,117
Come on, you came to Florida,
you got a nice tan...

1515
01:18:56,119 --> 01:18:57,616
now it's over. Squeeze it.

1516
01:18:57,618 --> 01:18:59,617
Squeeze it.

1517
01:18:59,619 --> 01:19:00,982
Don't you dare.

1518
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:03,517
Squeeze his horn and I will
give you such a receipt.

1519
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:04,685
Horn's right here.
Just one squeeze.

1520
01:19:04,687 --> 01:19:05,817
Don't you touch
his dirty horn.

1521
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:07,784
Come on, Jeri,
let's go!

1522
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:09,251
- You can squeeze it.
- You can do it!

1523
01:19:09,253 --> 01:19:11,084
- You got nothing in the tank.
- Come on, Jeri! You got it!

1524
01:19:11,086 --> 01:19:12,516
Take the horn.
Take the horn.

1525
01:19:12,518 --> 01:19:14,250
Stop, take it!

1526
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:15,753
Take it. Take it.

1527
01:19:18,485 --> 01:19:19,586
Come on! Bring it in!

1528
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:26,815
Take my wrists.

1529
01:19:26,817 --> 01:19:28,284
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like this?

1530
01:19:28,286 --> 01:19:30,083
This is your time.

1531
01:19:30,085 --> 01:19:31,783
Okay! Yeah.

1532
01:19:31,785 --> 01:19:33,250
You're not the girl
I paid for.

1533
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:35,782
I know. The girl you paid for
is tied up in your basement.

1534
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:38,249
- You suck!
- Yeah, but you swallow.

1535
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,650
Eat me!

1536
01:19:39,652 --> 01:19:41,250
No, thanks.
I'm trying to bulk up.

1537
01:19:43,452 --> 01:19:45,285
Them, me, go.

1538
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:47,249
Whoa, Madison, hey.

1539
01:19:47,251 --> 01:19:48,417
All right, just lose
the suicide dive,

1540
01:19:48,419 --> 01:19:49,585
you're not gonna get it.

1541
01:19:49,587 --> 01:19:51,653
No, we will. I swear.
We'll get it.

1542
01:19:52,519 --> 01:19:53,886
You have to go for it.

1543
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,349
Tag!
Let's go, in the ring.

1544
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,420
You got it, Kirsten.

1545
01:20:06,953 --> 01:20:09,017
One...

1546
01:20:09,019 --> 01:20:10,850
- Two!
- Whoo!

1547
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,687
- Tag me!
- Tag!

1548
01:20:29,652 --> 01:20:30,686
Yeah!

1549
01:20:39,519 --> 01:20:41,150
Come on, get out!

1550
01:20:46,152 --> 01:20:47,416
Come on! In the ring!

1551
01:20:47,418 --> 01:20:49,083
No, no, no!

1552
01:20:49,085 --> 01:20:50,153
Madison!

1553
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:02,267
Unfortunately, we're
at that moment again.

1554
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:04,070
Thank you for your time.

1555
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:09,502
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks, Coach.

1556
01:21:10,435 --> 01:21:11,566
For the rest of you,

1557
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:13,532
as a reward
for making it this far...

1558
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:15,667
I'm gonna take you to
a quiet, romantic, little spot

1559
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:16,900
I like to call <i>WrestleMania.</i>

1560
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:18,167
What?

1561
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:19,268
Yes!

1562
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,533
Keep your focus.

1563
01:21:20,535 --> 01:21:21,934
There's still a lot of stuff
to do ahead of us.

1564
01:21:21,936 --> 01:21:24,201
But we're gonna get to go out
and have some fun, okay?

1565
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:27,036
Go home and get some
rest, guys. Thank you.

1566
01:21:34,002 --> 01:21:35,200
All good?

1567
01:21:35,202 --> 01:21:36,735
- All right?
- All right, love?

1568
01:21:40,435 --> 01:21:42,502
- My big boy. Yeah.
- You all right?

1569
01:21:57,701 --> 01:21:58,834
Oh, my God.
That's Divas Champion.

1570
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:01,269
That's Divas Champion.
Oh, my God!

1571
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,535
No.

1572
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:08,866
Hamburgers.
It's free food!

1573
01:22:08,868 --> 01:22:10,333
You know
I'm an emotional eater.

1574
01:22:10,335 --> 01:22:11,399
You're enabling me now.

1575
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,666
This is gonna make me
gain weight.

1576
01:22:12,668 --> 01:22:13,734
You can burn it off
in the ring. That's great.

1577
01:22:13,736 --> 01:22:14,900
- I can't burn it off.
- Hi, guys.

1578
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:16,068
Eat as much as you want.

1579
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:17,233
- Hi.
- Hey.

1580
01:22:17,235 --> 01:22:18,600
I'm a massive fan.

1581
01:22:18,602 --> 01:22:19,833
- Cool.
- Thanks. Thanks.

1582
01:22:19,835 --> 01:22:20,835
Just gonna...

1583
01:22:21,668 --> 01:22:22,799
It's free, right? Yeah?

1584
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:24,034
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's free.

1585
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:25,234
Yeah.

1586
01:22:25,236 --> 01:22:26,700
You wanna leave some
for the rest of us there?

1587
01:22:26,702 --> 01:22:27,866
- Yeah.
- Come with me.

1588
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:29,234
Have a good match, boys.

1589
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:30,400
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1590
01:22:30,402 --> 01:22:31,601
Bye.

1591
01:22:31,603 --> 01:22:32,699
If she can eat it,
you can eat it...

1592
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:33,867
- Don't eat a hot dog.
- Here.

1593
01:22:33,869 --> 01:22:35,033
No, I don't...

1594
01:22:35,035 --> 01:22:36,101
Do you know
what's in a hot dog?

1595
01:22:39,903 --> 01:22:41,170
Is that The Miz?

1596
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:44,566
Hey, Coach.

1597
01:22:44,568 --> 01:22:45,799
Where are you going?

1598
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:48,067
I have no idea. I don't know.

1599
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:49,536
- What's happening?
- Where is she going?

1600
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,536
I'm sorry, I thought
the hot dogs were free.

1601
01:23:03,036 --> 01:23:04,399
Please.

1602

How're you doing?

1609
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:37,333
Yeah. Good. You?

1610
01:23:37,335 --> 01:23:38,700
Did you bring it?

1611
01:23:38,702 --> 01:23:42,233
Yeah.
Yeah, I brought it.

1612
01:23:42,235 --> 01:23:45,070
Paige, when's the last time
you spoke to your family?

1613
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:47,432
Couple of weeks ago.

1614
01:23:47,434 --> 01:23:48,702
Well, I think
we should call 'em.

1615
01:23:50,236 --> 01:23:51,933
You wanna
call my family?

1616
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:53,600
I would like to call
your family.

1617
01:23:53,602 --> 01:23:54,703
So what's their number?

1618
01:23:56,002 --> 01:23:57,566

Yeah,

1630

Well, let's hope not.

1631
01:24:23,602 --> 01:24:24,867
No, it is, Mr. Knight,

1632
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:26,070
it's Dwayne Johnson.
How are you?

1633
01:24:26,536 --> 01:24:27,536
Prove it.

1634
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:30,069
Uh, okay.

1635
01:24:31,969 --> 01:24:34,766

Dad! It's actually him.

01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:55,900
- You what?
- Yeah, it's actually him.

1643
01:24:55,902 --> 01:24:57,636

- Yeah, right.

<i>I'm here

<i>and, uh, I first met her
in London.</i>

1649
01:25:09,701 --> 01:25:11,067
<i>And I've been
keeping tabs on her...</i>

1650
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,700
and I just heard some news

1651
01:25:12,702 --> 01:25:14,199
that I wanted
to share with her...

1652
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:16,500
and I thought you guys should
hear it too at the same time.

1653
01:25:16,502 --> 01:25:18,133
- Right.
- What news?

1654
01:25:18,135 --> 01:25:21,268
Paige's time
with the NXT is over.

1655
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:23,102
Oh.

1656
01:25:23,768 --> 01:25:25,199
- Oh.
- Okay.

1657
01:25:25,201 --> 01:25:26,833
Because tomorrow night...

1658
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,199
she'll make her debut
live on <i>RAW</i>

1659
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:33,003
and she will be fighting
AJ Lee for the Divas title.

1660
01:25:33,569 --> 01:25:34,603
Wait, what?

1661
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:40,002
Dick me dead,
bury me pregnant.

1662
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:42,500
There it is again.

1663
01:25:42,502 --> 01:25:44,565
You don't know what this means
to us, Mr. Rock.

1664
01:25:44,567 --> 01:25:45,833
Actually, uh...

1665
01:25:45,835 --> 01:25:48,165
I know exactly what it means
to you, ma'am.

1666
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:50,700
I myself have come from
a wrestling family, too...

1667
01:25:50,702 --> 01:25:52,067
<i>and I wanted
to share this news</i>

1668
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:53,034
<i>with you guys
just so you could enjoy it...</i>

1669
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:55,200
and also just so Paige can

1670
01:25:55,202 --> 01:25:58,500
prepare herself mentally to go
out there tomorrow night...

1671
01:25:58,502 --> 01:26:01,167
and win over the crowd.

1672
01:26:01,169 --> 01:26:02,466
Because
if you don't do that...

1673
01:26:02,468 --> 01:26:05,334
then they're gonna find
somebody else who will.

1674
01:26:05,336 --> 01:26:07,265
And then
this whole opportunity

1675
01:26:07,267 --> 01:26:09,268
will be gone by next week.

1676
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:17,366
<i>She's not gonna
let you down, Mr. Rock.</i>

01:26:17,368 --> 01:26:19,199
<i>I'll promise ya.
She's gonna smash it.</i>

1678
01:26:19,201 --> 01:26:21,233
- <i>She'll kill it.</i>
- <i>Proud of you, Ray.</i>

1679
01:26:21,235 --> 01:26:23,866
<i>I love you, princess.
We're all with you, darling.</i>

1680
01:26:23,868 --> 01:26:25,433
You're amazing, baby.

1681
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:27,200
I love you, Rock.

1682
01:26:27,202 --> 01:26:28,932
Rock?

1683
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,335
I... I love you, too.

1684
01:26:35,569 --> 01:26:37,736
It's The Rock! Huh?

1685
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:47,034
Good luck tomorrow, Paige.

1686
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:49,400
Yeah. Um, thanks
for picking me.

1687
01:26:49,402 --> 01:26:51,902
Nah, I didn't pick you,
I just work here.

1688
01:26:53,435 --> 01:26:55,000
You know him?

1689
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:57,099
Yeah.
Yeah, I know that guy.

1690
01:26:57,101 --> 01:26:59,200
We once had a crazy match
where he threw himself...

1691
01:26:59,202 --> 01:27:00,766
off the top
of a 30-foot steel cage...

1692
01:27:00,768 --> 01:27:01,770
just to make me look good.

1693
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:05,300
I'll see you later, Sex Tape.

1694
01:27:05,302 --> 01:27:06,867
Why'd you call him "Sex Tape"?

1695
01:27:06,869 --> 01:27:08,834
Oh, because he makes
people famous.

1696
01:27:08,836 --> 01:27:10,202
Good luck tomorrow.

1697
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:35,066
Who'd a thought it, eh?

1698
01:27:35,068 --> 01:27:37,332
Our little sister's gone
from here...

1699
01:27:37,334 --> 01:27:38,869
to WWE.

1700
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,399
You would've too, Roy,

1701
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:43,866
if they'd given you
the chance.

1702
01:27:43,868 --> 01:27:45,466
No.

1703
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,201
No, she has something
I never had.

1704
01:27:49,402 --> 01:27:50,503
What's that?

1705
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:52,168
You.

1706
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:21,669
Ez!

1707
01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:24,870
Get in the van, mate.

1708
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:29,936
Come on, mate.
You're late for training.

1709
01:28:31,068 --> 01:28:32,534
Piss off, dickhead!

1710
01:28:32,536 --> 01:28:33,833
I would do, sweetheart,

1711
01:28:33,835 --> 01:28:35,099
but he's already paid
for the lessons.

1712
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:37,368
And by Christ, he needs 'em.

1713
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:42,232
Ez.

1714
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:43,769

1715
01:28:45,935 --> 01:28:47,401
Ez.

1716

Ez!

1717
01:28:57,067 --> 01:28:59,999
- All right?
- Yeah.

1718
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:02,202
He looks lovely.

1719
01:29:04,234 --> 01:29:06,900
Smash it!

1720
01:29:06,902 --> 01:29:09,835
Out of the way!
I got a hammer on a pole!

1721
01:29:14,034 --> 01:29:16,168
Come on! Oh, watch it!

1722
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:23,367
- Zak's back!
- Get in the van! Come on!

1723
01:29:23,369 --> 01:29:24,935
Leave that there!

1724
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:34,566

Please don't tell me

1725
01:29:34,568 --> 01:29:36,603
you're deaf as well, now!

1726
01:29:39,336 --> 01:29:41,399
Strong into the ropes.
Strong.

1727
01:29:45,901 --> 01:29:47,099
That's it!

1728
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:49,035
All right. Find the ropes.

1729
01:29:50,067 --> 01:29:52,900
Ez, let him know you're there.

1730
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:55,199
All right, don't be scared.

1731
01:29:55,201 --> 01:29:56,468
Stand tall, mate.

1732
01:30:08,535 --> 01:30:10,870

01:32:49,694 --> 01:32:51,659
I'm gonna botch a move. I...

1757
01:32:51,661 --> 01:32:53,391
I won't go over
with the crowd.

1758
01:32:53,393 --> 01:32:55,525
Paige!

1759
01:32:55,527 --> 01:32:57,991
Come on! Let's go!

1760
01:32:57,993 --> 01:33:01,126
Zak, I have no idea who
I'm supposed to be out there.

1761
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,891
Do what The Rock said.
Be the first you.

1762
01:33:04,893 --> 01:33:07,524
Oh, bollocks to The Rock!

1763
01:33:07,526 --> 01:33:10,190
That's not advice, Zak,
that's a tweet!

1764
01:33:10,192 --> 01:33:12,826
He's not some weirdo freak
from Norwich, is he?

1765
01:33:13,728 --> 01:33:16,224
No, but that is who you are.

1766
01:33:16,226 --> 01:33:17,394
Who else you gonna be?

1767
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:21,793
<i>Come on. If you can't
do this, no one can.</i>

1768
01:33:22,827 --> 01:33:24,890
You're a Knight.

1769
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:26,327
Wrestling's in your blood.

1770
01:33:28,794 --> 01:33:30,026
Like hepatitis?

1771
01:33:32,361 --> 01:33:33,890
A, B, and C.

1772
01:33:33,892 --> 01:33:36,027
<i>Riddled.</i>

1773
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,725
And you got something else.

1774
01:33:38,727 --> 01:33:40,659
Something that I don't have.

1775
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:42,624
Yeah? Like what?

1776
01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:44,657
That extra something.

1777
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:46,858
Yeah, you don't know that.

1778
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:49,891
<i>I've always known that.</i>

1779
01:33:49,893 --> 01:33:52,494
Why do you think I've been
acting like such a prick?

1780
01:33:53,893 --> 01:33:56,158
<i>And listen to me, right?</i>

1781
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,558
No matter what happens
when you go out there...

1782
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,725
it will never be as bad
as that time in King's Lynn...

1783
01:34:01,727 --> 01:34:03,923
when I went on
wearing Dad's shorts.

1784
01:34:03,925 --> 01:34:05,524
When your penis fell out!

1785
01:34:05,526 --> 01:34:06,924
When my penis fell out.

1786
01:34:06,926 --> 01:34:08,691
Everyone was laughing at it.

1787
01:34:08,693 --> 01:34:10,457
Everyone wasn't
laughing at it.

1788
01:34:10,459 --> 01:34:12,158
People were laughing
at the situation.

1789
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,291
Why did you even stay
in the ring?

1790
01:34:14,293 --> 01:34:15,691
Because I'm
a bloody professional.

1791
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:17,558
And so are you, right?

1792
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,891
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

1793
01:34:19,893 --> 01:34:22,557
So, have you got
your own shorts on tonight?

1794
01:34:22,559 --> 01:34:24,790
Yes. My penis won't fall out.

1795
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:25,990
Then get out there.

1796
01:34:25,992 --> 01:34:27,694
<i>All right?</i>

1797
01:34:28,627 --> 01:34:29,960
Thank you.

1798
01:34:31,494 --> 01:34:34,023
It's what I'm here for.

1799
01:34:34,025 --> 01:34:36,190
<i>Now, go and win over
that crowd.</i>

1800
01:34:36,192 --> 01:34:37,958
<i>I wanna hear 'em
chanting your name.</i>

1801
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,823
Okay.

1802
01:34:41,825 --> 01:34:43,126
Paige!

1803
01:34:45,993 --> 01:34:48,793
Come on, we're gonna be late.
Where were you? Jesus.

1804
01:34:51,493 --> 01:34:55,956
<i>The Divas Champion, AJ Lee!</i>

1805
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:59,390
<i>Well, guys,
today marks day number 295...</i>

1806
01:34:59,392 --> 01:35:00,491
<i>in the historic</i>

1807
01:35:00,493 --> 01:35:02,991
<i>Divas Championship reign
of AJ!</i>

1808
01:35:02,993 --> 01:35:07,490
<i>Last night, she outlasted
13 other Divas...</i>

1809
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:10,025
<i>to retain the title
at WrestleMania.</i>

1810
01:35:10,027 --> 01:35:12,890
<i>And, guys, I still
don't know how she did it.</i>

1811
01:35:12,892 --> 01:35:15,493
<i>She keeps
finding ways to win.</i>

1812
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,859
She on yet?

1813
01:35:20,726 --> 01:35:22,958
<i>For 295 days...</i>

1814
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,625
<i>I have been
your Divas Champion!</i>

1815
01:35:29,192 --> 01:35:32,557
<i>The longest reigning
Divas Champion...</i>

1816
01:35:32,559 --> 01:35:34,894
<i>of all time!</i>

1817
01:35:47,059 --> 01:35:48,358
<i>Well, this right here is</i>

1818
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,124
<i>a very
interesting development.</i>

1819
01:35:50,126 --> 01:35:51,358
<i>But that young lady...</i>

1820
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,824
<i>...is Paige.</i>

1821
01:35:53,826 --> 01:35:56,024
- <i>She's from Norwitch, England.</i>
- Norwich!

1822
01:35:56,026 --> 01:35:58,691
<i>And she comes to us
from NXT.</i>

1823
01:35:58,693 --> 01:36:00,358
<i>Certainly different.</i>

1824
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,724
<i>And this is a huge
opportunity for Paige</i>

1825
01:36:02,726 --> 01:36:06,023
<i>to impress
this crowd here tonight.</i>

1826
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:09,692
<i>AJ doesn't look
too happy to see Paige.</i>

1827
01:36:11,827 --> 01:36:14,689
<i>A capacity crowd
in New Orleans...</i>

1828
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:16,856
<i>millions watching
around the world...</i>

1829
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:20,726
<i>under the bright lights
of</i> Monday Night RAW.

1830
01:36:30,025 --> 01:36:32,058
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

1831
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,025
<i>is it Halloween already?</i>

1832
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,693
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

1833
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:46,790
<i>Well, you can understand
Paige being...</i>

1834
01:36:46,792 --> 01:36:48,124
She's frozen.

1835
01:36:48,126 --> 01:36:49,425
- <i>...a bit hesitant here.</i>
- Come on, darling.

1836
01:36:49,427 --> 01:36:52,025
<i>But these WWE fans
will turn on her quick.</i>

1837
01:36:52,027 --> 01:36:53,657
Do something!

1838
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:04,358
<i>Tell you what.</i>

1839
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,856
<i>Why don't I do to you
what I did</i>

1840
01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:08,691
<i>to every single Diva
last night?</i>

1841
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,790
<i>I think we should have
a match right now.</i>

1842
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,490
<i>And as a special
post-</i> WrestleMania <i>treat...</i>

1843
01:37:16,492 --> 01:37:19,857
<i>I will put my title
on the line.</i>

1844
01:37:28,027 --> 01:37:29,491
<i>Paige isn't ready.
I mean...</i>

1845
01:37:29,493 --> 01:37:31,058
<i>Paige came from a
wrestling family in England...</i>

1846
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,624
<i>but she... Oh!</i>

1847
01:37:32,626 --> 01:37:34,689
<i>She wasn't ready
for a match tonight.</i>

1848
01:37:34,691 --> 01:37:36,023
Come on, Ray. Get up.

1849
01:37:36,025 --> 01:37:37,157
<i>Paige needs to do
something here...</i>

1850
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:39,125
<i>or she's gonna
let this opportunity</i>

1851
01:37:39,127 --> 01:37:40,894
<i>slip through her fingers.</i>

1852
01:37:43,825 --> 01:37:46,361
This is my house, freak!

1853
01:37:52,494 --> 01:37:53,760
- Yes!
- Come on!

1854
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,560
Yes!

1855
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:09,059
Yeah!

1856
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:30,494
Suck on that, bitch!

1857
01:38:31,492 --> 01:38:32,890
Mmm-hmm.

1858
01:38:32,892 --> 01:38:34,624
Sorry.

1859
01:38:34,626 --> 01:38:36,524
<i>And this could be
Paige's moment!</i>

1860
01:38:36,526 --> 01:38:38,857
<i>She's heading up
to the top rope right there!</i>

1861
01:38:38,859 --> 01:38:41,425
<i>AJ Lee has turned
this match around!</i>

1862
01:38:41,427 --> 01:38:42,656
<i>This doesn't end well.</i>

1863
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:45,657
<i>Top rope,
AJ on the top rope.</i>

1864
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:48,125
<i>AJ takin' out Paige!</i>

1865
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:49,556
<i>Oh, man. Wow!</i>

1866
01:38:49,558 --> 01:38:51,857
<i>I don't think Paige knows
where she's at.</i>

1867
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:53,392
<i>And now,
the Divas Champion</i>

1868
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:56,157
<i>crawling toward Paige,
hooks the leg!</i>

1869
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,458
- One! Two!
- <i>And it's over!</i>

1870
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,660
<i>Oh, a kick-out!</i>

1871
01:39:01,525 --> 01:39:03,225
<i>Last moment kick-out by Paige!</i>

1872
01:39:03,227 --> 01:39:04,457
Hair!

1873
01:39:04,459 --> 01:39:06,727
<i>And this has just
angered AJ!</i>

1874
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,327
<i>AJ with a kick
to the midsection.</i>

1875
01:39:12,892 --> 01:39:14,824
<i>It's the Black Widow!</i>

1876
01:39:14,826 --> 01:39:16,858
<i>The submission move...</i>

1877
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,790
<i>that's taken out
so many Divas!</i>

1878
01:39:20,992 --> 01:39:22,625
<i>Paige is trying
to hang on here...</i>

1879
01:39:22,627 --> 01:39:24,025
<i>but she's gotta tap out!</i>

1880
01:39:24,027 --> 01:39:27,291
<i>She's gonna get seriously hurt
if she doesn't tap here!</i>

1881
01:39:27,293 --> 01:39:28,990
<i>Paige has gotta tap out!</i>

1882
01:39:39,892 --> 01:39:42,157
One! Two! Three!

1883
01:39:50,893 --> 01:39:53,190
<i>Now, the winner
of this match...</i>

1884
01:39:53,192 --> 01:39:58,257
<i>and new Divas Champion...</i>

1885
01:39:58,259 --> 01:40:01,692
<i>Paige!</i>

1886
01:40:06,525 --> 01:40:08,390
<i>This is unbelievable,
guys! You gotta watch...</i>

1887
01:40:08,392 --> 01:40:10,657
<i>what happens here
at the end of this thing!</i>

1888
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:12,691
<i>Watch Paige
with a Paige Turner!</i>

1889
01:40:12,693 --> 01:40:15,324
That's the Zak Attack!
She stole your move!

1890
01:40:15,326 --> 01:40:17,457
She didn't steal it,
I gave it to her!

1891
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:28,361
<i>I am a freak!</i>

1892
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:34,058
<i>From Norwich, England!</i>

1893
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,891
<i>And I have dreamt of this...</i>

1894
01:40:35,893 --> 01:40:39,456
<i>since I was 13 years old!</i>

1895
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:42,227
<i>And it's not just mine,
it belongs to my family!</i>

1896
01:40:46,892 --> 01:40:48,523
<i>It belongs to anyone
who ever felt</i>

1897
01:40:48,525 --> 01:40:51,991
<i>like they are the freak
from Norwich...</i>

1898
01:40:51,993 --> 01:40:54,290
<i>the oddballs, the outsiders...</i>

1899
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:56,390
<i>the ones that don't belong!</i>

1900
01:41:02,392 --> 01:41:05,390
<i>My name is Paige.</i>

1901
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:07,858
<i>And this is my house now!</i>

1902
01:41:12,726 --> 01:41:15,894
- Yes!
- That's right! That's right!

1903
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:36,058
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1904
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:39,225
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1905
01:41:39,227 --> 01:41:42,023
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1906
01:41:42,025 --> 01:41:44,390
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1907
01:41:44,392 --> 01:41:47,556
<i>Paige! Paige! Paige!</i>

1908
01:41:47,558 --> 01:41:49,823
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1909
01:41:49,825 --> 01:41:51,857
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1910
01:41:51,859 --> 01:41:54,859
Paige! Paige! Paige!

1911
01:42:10,225 --> 01:42:12,691
- Look, the big man's crying!
- Sod off!

1912
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:13,958
Look at him.

1913
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,957
I'm not crying,
I'm allergic to the dog.

1914
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:21,860
- Oh, my God!
- Go, Paige!

1915
01:42:24,392 --> 01:42:27,524
Oh, my God!
That was incredible.

1916
01:42:27,526 --> 01:42:31,356
Oh, my God!
That was amazing!

1917
01:42:31,358 --> 01:42:34,491
- You were amazing. You did it!
- You were incredible!

1918
01:42:41,992 --> 01:42:43,894
<i>Yeah!</i>

1919
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,723
<i>What an
incredible moment!</i>

1920
01:42:54,725 --> 01:42:57,157
<i>She wasn't even ready
to be in the WWE...</i>

1921
01:42:57,159 --> 01:42:59,623
<i>and Paige is gonna
leave here tonight...</i>

1922
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:02,393
<i>the new Divas Champion!</i>

1923
01:43:56,392 --> 01:43:59,390
That youth title should be
around my waist, or trophy,

1924
01:43:59,392 --> 01:44:01,124
'cause I'm gonna
kick your ass!

1925
01:44:01,126 --> 01:44:03,659
And that's the bottom line,
'cause Zodiac don't care.

1926
01:44:05,992 --> 01:44:07,357
My first match,
I was knocked out

1927
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:09,026
in about five minutes,
if that.

1928
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:12,858
<i>I started growing up
watching it,</i>

1929
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,323
<i>and I was just like,
"Ugh! It's really boring!"</i>

1930
01:44:16,325 --> 01:44:17,589
<i>Zak would get in the ring</i>

1931
01:44:17,591 --> 01:44:19,091
<i>and throw me
about and stuff like that.</i>

1932
01:44:19,093 --> 01:44:21,624
<i>So, I always knew, like,
a couple of moves and stuff.</i>

1933
01:44:21,626 --> 01:44:23,490
<i>Dad was short
on a show one day</i>

1934
01:44:23,492 --> 01:44:25,389
<i>when I was 13 years old.</i>

1935
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:29,224
So, yeah, I had to fill in
for that one slot,

1936
01:44:29,226 --> 01:44:31,127
and I've been hooked
ever since.

1937
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:45,990
I'd done eight years in prison
before I was 25.

1938
01:44:45,992 --> 01:44:47,957
- Mainly violence.
- Mainly violence.

1939
01:44:47,959 --> 01:44:49,691
She was a young lady
at the time,

1940
01:44:49,693 --> 01:44:51,057
was contemplating suicide...

1941
01:44:51,059 --> 01:44:52,357
was going nowhere in life.

1942
01:44:52,359 --> 01:44:54,058
<i>Some people find religion.</i>

1943
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,357
<i>Well, me and Julie
found wrestling.</i>

1944
01:44:56,359 --> 01:44:59,223
<i>That, to me,
is proper salvation.</i>

1945
01:44:59,225 --> 01:45:00,924
What? What?

1946
01:45:00,926 --> 01:45:03,524
<i>We are a family of wrestlers.
We make no apologies for that.</i>

1947
01:45:03,526 --> 01:45:05,456
<i>This is what we do,
this is what we love.</i>

1948
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:06,723
This is our passion.

1949
01:45:06,725 --> 01:45:09,190
This is gonna be our legacy
when I pop me clogs.

1950
01:45:09,192 --> 01:45:10,493
This is what it's all about.

1951
01:45:14,959 --> 01:45:17,692
I love you. I love you.

1952
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:24,993
The rowdy man
that's crying his eyes out.

1953
01:45:29,992 --> 01:45:32,057
<i>Paige Turner,
she did it!</i>

1954
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:33,627
<i>Paige did it!</i>

1955
01:45:43,729 --> 01:45:48,729

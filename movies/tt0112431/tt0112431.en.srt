2
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,813
This is a tale about
an unprejudiced heart...

3
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:37,185
and how it changed our valley forever.

4
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,520
There was a time not so long ago...

5
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,029
when pigs were afforded no respect
except by other pigs.

6
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,261
They lived their whole lives
in a cruel and sunless world.

7
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:08,214
In those days, pigs believed that
the sooner they grew large and fat,

8
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:11,017
the sooner they'd be taken
into pig paradise.

9
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,753
Haa! Haa! Get up!
A place so wonderful...

10
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:18,957
that no pig had ever thought
to come back. Yo! Yeah!

11
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,001
Good-bye, Mom.

12
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:35,605
So when the day came for their parents to
go to that other world of endless pleasures,

13
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,548
it was not a time
for young pigs to be sad.

14
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:43,681
Just another step towards the day when
they, too, would make the journey.

15
00:03:56,235 --> 00:04:00,569
perhaps it was because he was alone.

16
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,098
perhaps his sadness
made him easier to catch.

17
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:07,668
Whatever the reason, of the thousands
of animals in the piggery that day...

18
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,443
only one was chosen.

19
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,711
How's this one, Harry?
Just right for the purpose.

20
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,983
How much do I owe you? It's a runt,
Harry. A worthless, little runt.

21
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,603
You're too modest, Esme Hoggett.

22
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,109
Nine out of 10 first prizes
for jams and jellies...

23
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,111
is more than a matter of luck.

24
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,774
Luck still plays its part. Our berries
were wickedly good this year.

25
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,443
And our water is very tasty too.

26
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,249
Of course, we don't use
the town water.

27
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:55,987
Arthur Hoggett!
How's it going, Arthur?

28
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,462
How are those sheep of yours?
Come on, try your luck.

29
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,262
How about taking a guess, Arthur?
All for a good cause.

30
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:10,609
- Don't keep pigs.
- Christmas day. Think of it. What a feast!

31
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,270
That'll do, Pig.

32
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:20,747
The pig and the farmer
regarded each other.

33
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,449
And for a fleeting moment,
something passed between them.

34
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:29,460
A faint sense of some common destiny.
Hah. Strange.

35
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,053
First time the little thing
hasn't screamed its head off.

36
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,795
Now you'll have to have a guess.

37
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:41,465
Sixteen pounds, five--

38
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,667
Eew.

39
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,981
Two ounces.

40
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,448
Hooey! Hoggett!

41
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,424
Hooey! Hoggett!

42
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,985
Thanks, Arthur. We'll be weighing
the little pig tomorrow.

43
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,361
We'll phone you if you win.

44
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,493
When you win, Arthur.
When you win!

45
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,594
Care to guess the pig's weight, sir?

46
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,832
Support the Lion's Club.

47
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,055
Ooh!

48
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,066
What could we do
with a pig, eh, Duchess?

49
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:45,365
Just think. Two nice hams.
Two sides of bacon.

50
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:50,067
Oh, and pork chops, kidney, liver,
chitlins, pickle his feet.

51
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:53,043
Save his blood for black puddin'.
There's the telephone.

52
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,773
Hoggett!

53
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,408
Good news, Arthur.
You've won the pig.

54
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,748
Oh.

55
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:07,353
pigs are definitely stupid.

56
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

57
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,110
What is it, Mom?
That's a pig.

58
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,704
They'll eat him when he's big.
Will they eat us?

59
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,741
Good heavens, no! The bosses
only eat stupid animals...

60
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,344
like sheep and ducks and chickens.

61
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,913
Yeah!

62
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,792
It does look stupid, Mom.

63
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,735
Not as stupid as sheep, mind you.
But pigs are definitely stupid.

64
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,262
Excuse me. No, we're not.

65
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,367
- Good heavens! Who are you?
- I'm a large White.

66
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,777
- Yes, that's your breed, dear. What's your name?
- I don't know.

67
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:06,113
What did your mother call you to tell
you apart from your brothers and sisters?

68
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,312
Our mom called us all the same.

69
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,150
And what was that, dear?

70
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:12,622
She called us all Babe.

71
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,956
Perhaps we shouldn't talk
too much about, uh, family.

72
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:21,330
I want my mom.

73
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,736
There, there. You've got
to be a brave boy now.

74
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:33,073
I left my mother when I was your age,
and my pups will have to leave me soon.

75
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:37,445
But I'll keep an eye on you, if you like,
just 'til you find your feet.

76
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,121
The little pig's a bit low.
He's going to sleep with us...

77
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,250
just 'til he finds his feet.

78
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,962
Until he finds his feet.

79
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,471
But, Mom, he'll wet the bed!

80
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,336
Nonsense!

81
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,536
If you do want to do anything,
you'll go outside, won't you?

82
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,275
Good boy.

83
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,442
Yeah!

84
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,113
Yeah! Yeah!
Stomp on him!

85
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,850
What's your name, Pig?

86
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:22,257
What does he taste like?
Where did he come from?

87
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:48,148
Comin' through!
Hey, get lost!

88
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,895
We've got to do something
about that duck.

89
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,989
Ooh! Ooh!

90
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,034
Doodle-loo-dee-doo.

91
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,093
What's that noise?
It's only Ferdinand.

92
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,104
What's Ferdinand?
He's a duck.

93
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,164
He wants to be a rooster.
He hates being a duck.

94
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,609
We'll catch him one day
and eat him. Won't we, Mom?

95
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,204
Yes, dear.

96
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:19,717
Yech!
Who'd want to eat a duck?

97
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,773
Babe,you wait here.

98
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,212
- Aren't pigs allowed?
- Not live ones.

99
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,274
Sorry, dear. Only dogs
and cats inside the house.

100
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,820
- Why?
- That's just the way things are.

101
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,768
Whoa!

102
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,168
Ow!
pig-pig-piggy!

103
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:21,610
Ooh, what a spectacular feast
I've got for you.

104
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,740
Oh, yes! What a lucky
little pork chop you are.

105
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,411
Delicious! Oh, yes!
Yum, yum, yum.

106
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,852
Who's gonna grow up
to be a big, fat pig?

107
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:34,018
You are! You are!
Yum, yum, yum.

108
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,999
Where are we going?
To work with the sheep.

109
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,165
- What's sheep?
- Sheep is animals with thick, woolly coats.

110
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,766
And thick woolly heads. And men
can't look after them without us.

111
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:57,305
Why do they need us?
'Cause we're sheepdogs! Yeah!

112
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,793
- Not you, dear.
- Why not?

113
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:16,563
We have to do dogs' work. You're a pig.
Your job is to stay here and eat your food.

114
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,798
We'll be back
at the end of the day.

115
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,614
They don't think
I'll remember. Well, I don't forget.

116
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:34,675
Seems like a sheep's
just born to suffer.

117
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,153
Hello? Excuse me.

118
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,213
Darn wolf!

119
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,751
- I'm not a wolf. I'm a pig. What are you?
- Ewe.

120
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,854
Pig. What are you?

121
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,764
I'm a ewe. A ewe!

122
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,930
You're a sheep! I'll not be called
a common sheep, thank you kindly.

123
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,667
I'm a Border Leicester ewe.
The name's maa.

124
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,403
Oh.

125
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,470
- What's wrong with you, Maa?
- Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough.

126
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,746
And I'm not as young
as I used to be.

127
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,823
Hmph.

128
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:19,753
- Seem like a nice young pig. What be your name?
- Babe.

129
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:22,698
Not like them wolves.
Treat you like dirt, they do!

130
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,828
Bite you as soon as look at
you, those savages! Bite you?

131
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,372
And worse.
Some wolves be so bad,

132
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,738
they run a sheep down
and tear it to pieces.

133
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,243
Fly would never do that!

134
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,146
Fly, is it? A right vicious creature
she be, I'll tell you.

135
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,152
- Not Fly.
- All them wolves is cruel to sheep. Always have been.

136
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,053
Brutal savages!
That's what they be.

137
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:48,388
I wouldn't want to see a gentle soul
like you mixin' with the likes of them.

138
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,730
That afternoon when he saw Fly,

139
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,005
the pig's mind
was a tangle of questions.

140
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,241
cruel, vicious, brutal?

141
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:13,250
What was it that dogs did
in the fields all day?

142
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:17,618
- Hello, Babe? Had a good day?
- Yes, thank you.

143
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:31,029
The old sheep
had to be wrong about Fly.

144
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:36,769
And the pig promised himself that he would
never think badly of any creature ever again.

145
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,511
Crime and Punishment!

146
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,608
The morning of the terrible crime...

147
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,449
started like any other
on Hoggett Farm.

148
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,490
Comin' through!
Comin' through!

149
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,718
Take off!

150
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:00,395
- Now!
- Up, up, up.

151
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,990
Nee-nee-nee-nee.

152
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,729
Hmm?

153
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,830
I was worried it might have a harsh tone,
but that's quite a nice musical ring.

154
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:13,173
I walked into O'Halloran's Hardware,
and there it was waiting for me.

155
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,372
What a splendid way
to wake up each morning!

156
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,972
Hoggett, dear. Church.

157
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:27,925
When embarking
on an audacious crime,

158
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,723
a duck needs a willing accomplice.

159
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,765
A creature who is reliable,
beyond suspicion,

160
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,198
and above all... extremely gullible.

161
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,202
Hey! Psst!

162
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,329
Wha-- What?

163
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,568
You look like an intelligent,
sophisticated, discerning young fella.

164
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:48,670
- Who, me?
- Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy! Are you in for some fun!

165
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:53,582
What are we doin'?
Where are we goin'?

166
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,712
Now the duck knew
exactly what he had to do.

167
00:15:56,788 --> 00:16:00,485
The alarm clock had to go.
His very life depended on it.

168
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,756
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

169
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,763
Good.

170
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,994
So I go through the kitchen,
across the living room...

171
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,262
Good, good.
into the bedroom.

172
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,770
Get the mechanical rooster
and bring it out to you.

173
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,808
- What about that cat?
- But quietly bring it out to you.

174
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,139
Excellent.
I don't think I can do it.

175
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,442
It's against the rules. Only dogs
and cats allowed in the house.

176
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,951
It's a good rule, but this is bigger
than rules. This is life and death.

177
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:31,011
- It is?
- Mm-hmm. Follow me.

178
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,490
Hello! Look,
there's something you should know.

179
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,290
- Humans eat ducks!
- I beg your pardon?

180
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:42,493
Most ducks prefer to forget it, but the
fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks.

181
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,764
I don't think so.
Not the boss. Not the boss's wife.

182
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:48,533
Come on.
Humans don't eat cats. Why?

183
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,837
- Well, they're-- - They're
indispensable. They catch mice.

184
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:55,278
Humans don't eat roosters. Why? They make eggs
with the hens and wake everyone up in the morning.

185
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,281
I tried it with the hens.
It didn't work.

186
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,182
So I turned to crowing, and lo!
I discover my gift.

187
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:04,416
But no sooner do I become indispensable
then they bring in a machine to do the job!

188
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,923
Ah, the treachery of it!

189
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,756
A mechanical rooster!
Oh, dear me.

190
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,594
Oh, dear you?

191
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,225
I suppose the life
of an anorexic duck...

192
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,202
doesn't amount to much
in the broad scheme of things.

193
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,296
But, pig,

194
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,171
I'm all I've got.

195
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,176
Why do you need me to do it?

196
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:29,236
I'm allergic to cats.
Oh.

197
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,680
They make me sneeze.

198
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,810
Ahh.

199
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:38,219
Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.

200
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,219
My life is in your hands.

201
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:48,062
Oh, dear.

202
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,158
Oh, no!

203
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,197
Ah, boy.

204
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:57,390
No, no, no!

205
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:08,108
Your foot, your foot!
Take the string off your foot.

206
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,115
Wait, wait. Let me put it this way.
Stop. Turn around--

207
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:15,778
Shh.

208
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:20,382
No, no!
The other way! Turn--

209
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,019
No, stop! Oh!

210
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:27,462
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

211
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:38,233
Don't, don't, stupid.
Go outside... now.

212
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,837
- But you said you can't do without me.
- I can. Trust me, I can.

213
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,007
Are you sure? You're positive?
Yes!

214
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,383
Go outside and stand guard.
Okay. Good idea.

215
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:01,128
Oh, boy. Want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

216
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,511
Hmm.
Guard against what?

217
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:17,343
Ahh! Ahh!
Don't worry.

218
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:22,614
Stick with me and please,
I beg you, not one more word.

219
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,416
All right.

220
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:20,076
Aah--

221
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,511
Don't sneeze, Ferdie.

222
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,447
- Just hold your breath.
- Ahhh--

223
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:40,493
Ah-choo!

224
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,976
It was my mistake. I was
trying to loosen things up a little.

225
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,640
But, no. Today proves
that it doesn't work.

226
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,979
From now on,
we'll all respect the rules.

227
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,985
To each creature
its own destiny.

228
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,578
Every animal in its proper place.

229
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:42,092
And a pig's proper place is under
the old cart, not in the barn.

230
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,027
And absolutely never
in the house.

231
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:47,894
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

232
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:52,198
Now, Pig, regarding the company
you keep. Being young,

233
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,034
it's hard to discriminate,
so I'll make it easy for you.

234
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:58,667
I forbid you to talk to
or consort with...

235
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:01,473
that duck... ever.

236
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:06,506
Have I made myself clear?
Uh... what's " consort"?

237
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,677
I t means, young man,

238
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:12,211
that you must not go
anywhere near that duck.

239
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,316
As for the fugitive duck, when
he shows himself, let him know this:

240
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:19,693
Being a duck he must behave like a duck.
No more of this crowing and nonsense.

241
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:23,131
He should accept what he is
and be thankful for it.

242
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,034
- That goes for all of us.
- Here, here!

243
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:30,632
Rex continued long into the night.

244
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,903
Elsewhere, there was more talk.

245
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:35,775
The subject was Christmas dinner...

246
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,180
and whether that year the main course
would be roast pork...

247
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,515
or Duck a l'Orange.

248
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,680
And pork is a nice, sweet meat.

249
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,522
Then there's the crackling.
That always adds interest and texture.

250
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:54,857
Get him!

251
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,800
Get the pig! Get the pig!
Get the pig!

252
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,837
Get him! Get him!

253
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,158
- Psst!
- Ferdinand!

254
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,532
- Everyone's been looking for you.
- Shh. Shh.

255
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,595
- What is this place?
- What's happenin' out there?

256
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:39,109
Rex isn't very happy.
Boy, all these new rules!

257
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,111
I'm not allowed to-- Oops.

258
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,170
Not allowed to what?

259
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,115
Huh?

260
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,621
piggy! What? You didn't
see me, all right?

261
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,886
And I didn't see you.
All right? Oops.

262
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,723
The time comes for all creatures...

263
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,731
when childhood ends...

264
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,429
and the doorway opens
to life as an adult.

265
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,473
And so it was with Fly's pups.

266
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:50,771
Though that time
was all too soon for Fly.

267
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,681
Puppy, puppy, puppy. Come on.

268
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,567
I n my pocket.

269
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,678
Fly?

270
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:08,453
May I call you Mom?

271
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:16,228
And so it was that the pig...

272
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,100
found his place
in the world of the farm.

273
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:25,006
And he was happy, even in his dreams.
pork

274
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:52,460
Hello!
Fol ks, how are you? Merry Christmas!

275
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,132
How's my favorite girl?

276
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,268
Nanny's got a jellybean.

277
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,335
Give us a kiss.

278
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:05,041
Guess what we're having
for Christmas dinner?

279
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,313
Roast pork.
I hate pork.

280
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,412
Darn silly carry-on,
if you ask me.

281
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,186
The cats says
they call it Christmas.

282
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:19,457
Christmas!
Christmas dinner, yeah.

283
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,998
Dinner means death.

284
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:26,560
Death means carnage!
Christmas means carnage!

285
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:28,662
Christmas means carnage!

286
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:46,154
Oooh.

287
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,389
Yes!

288
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,764
Wait.

289
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:02,033
Eatin' pigs!
Blaah! Barbarians!

290
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:04,574
You're goin' back
to the fields, Maa.

291
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,634
Oh, young'un, tragic there
ain't more of your kind.

292
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,204
- I'll be thinkin' of ya always.
- I could come visit you.

293
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,080
I'd like that, but--

294
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,950
Well, we shouldn't hope
for too much. Ooh!

And so, it was Christmas Eve.

300
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,745
And time had run out for the pig.

301
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:46,579
Are you doing him tonight then?
Mmm.

302

Shame to miss out on the best ham prize

Nice plump haunches he's gettin'.

Here it is!

319
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,756
The bi rd.
Yuck. Chicken?

320
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,758
No, it's Duck a l'Orange.

321
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:38,192
And, Mother, it looks
absolutely superb.

322
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:41,231
I'm not going to eat any of it!
This is fabulous.

323
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,392
Ferdinand!

324
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:47,426
If you're out here,
who's that in there?

325
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,838
Her name's Rosanna.

326
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,372
Why Rosanna?

327
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,251
She had such a beautiful nature.
Oh, Ferdinand.

328
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,381
I can't take it anymore.
Really!

329
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:11,656
The fear's too much for a duck.
It eats away at the soul.

330
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:15,961
There must be kinder dispositions
in far-off gentler lands.

331
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:18,331
The only way you'll find
happiness is to accept...

332
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:21,838
that the way things are
is the way things are.

333
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,000
The way things are stinks!
I'm not gonna be a goner. I'm gone.

334
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,203
I wish all of you
the best of luck.

335
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,975
Where will you go?
No idea.

336
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,175
But I'm a clever duck.
I could do with an adventure.

337
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,584
- I'll miss you, Ferdie.
- Ferdie? No one's ever called me that before.

338
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,953
Hey, good luck, Pig.
Huh?

339
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,390
I am outta here.
Bye, bye.

340
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,760
Ow!
Would you do me a favor, Pig?

341
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,698
- Anything.
- Open the gate, huh?

342
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:57,203
Ah! Ah! Ahh!
Ha-ha-ha! Whoa!

343
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:12,116
The pig knew it was
against the rules to leave the farm.

344
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:16,250
But something was definitely wrong.

345
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,533
How lovely, darling.
What is it?

346
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,299
It's a fax machine.
You can send us letters by phone.

347
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:31,205
H m m.
Oh.

348
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:39,978
At any other time,
the pig would've been tickled pink...

349
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,348
by his first visit to the sheep fields.

350
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,684
But now there was fear in the air.

351
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:48,748
Maa and her kind were under threat.

352
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,600
Hey, Frank, feel like pork
for dinner tonight?

353
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,874
- Young'un, you're alive!
- Maa!

354
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,006
What's happening?
Who are these men?

355
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:17,543
I'll get him out. Come around, Sniff!

356
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,714
Where's our boss?
It doesn't seem right.

357
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:35,765
What's wrong, dear?
It's the wrong one!

358
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,934
I want the house I saw
on the television!

359
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:43,241
Oh, there, there.

360
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,041
Get! Quick! Get the dog in.

361
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,306
Out of the sheep! come on!

362
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,213
Let's go!

363
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,648
Good dog.

364
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,926
Good pig.

365
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,112
Oooh.

366
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:39,920
Oooh!

367
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:44,593
Hey, hey. Dad says his little
porker's a watch pig. Dearie me!

368
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:47,831
If it's not a duck
that thinks it's a rooster,

369
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:52,467
it's a pig that thinks it's a dog!

370
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,410
A pig that thinks it's a dog!

371
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:02,379

A pig that thinks it's a dog!

375
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,672
A washing machine,
a radio, a new alarm clock.

376
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,942
I think it's a lovely fax machine,
darling, but can't you use it?

377
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:35,179
We already have one, Mom.
That's the whole idea.

378
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,880
We can send faxes to each other.

379
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,890
Don't be afraid of it
just because it's new.

380
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,256
These accounts are
a real worry, Arthur.

381
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,125
Every month your expenditure
is greater than your income.

382
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:48,596
It's eating up your reserves.

383
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,658
You need to modernize, get
some sort of cash flow going.

384
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:56,536
You're still using
a horse and cart, for God's sakes.

385
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,837
Dad?
Funny, that.

386
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:03,505
- What?
- Those chickens, that pig.

387
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,676
What's the pig
got to do with anything?

388
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:10,185
Nothing.

389
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:14,418
Just look at them.
The browns and the whites.

390
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:43,143
Come, Rex.
Come, Fly.

391
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,189
Come, Pig.

392
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:50,750
Come, Pig!

393
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,462
perhaps he's pleased
with you for what you did yesterday.

394
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:00,264
I didn't do much.
If it wasn't for you, dear,

395
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,635
they could've stolen
the whole flock.

396
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:06,335
Is Rex unhappy with me?
Oh, he'll be all right.

397
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,243
Just stay out
of his way today.

398
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:16,786
Way to be, Fly.
Rex, come by.

399
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,357
That'll do.

400
00:39:58,595 --> 00:40:02,759
You're so quick.
I'd never be able to fly like you can.

401
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,324
Pigs aren't built to fly, dear.

402
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,098
But speed isn't the thing.
It's attitude.

403
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,504
They just have to know who's boss.

404
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,911
Out you go.

405
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,764
Mmm!

406
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,262
Get 'em up, Pig.

407
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:14,702
- He wants you to drive them out of the yard.
- Away to me, Pig.

408
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,796
Remember, you have
to dominate them.

409
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:21,072
Do that and they'll do
anything you want. Go.

410
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,112
Woof!

411
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,341
Woof, woof, woof!

412
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:27,883
Woof! Woof!
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

413
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:35,049
Woof, woof, woof!

414
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,829
This is ridiculous, Mom.

415
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,166
Nonsense. It's only your first try.

416
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:49,967
But you're treating them like equals.
They're sheep. They're inferior.

417
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,203
- Ah, no they're not.
- Of course they are!

418
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,678
We are their masters. Let them doubt it
for a second and they'll walk all over you.

419
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:01,844
-Fly, get that pig out of there.
-Make them feel inferior. Abuse them. Insult them.

420
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,819
But they'll laugh at me.
Then bite them.

421
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:07,220
Be ruthless. Whatever it takes.
Bend them to your will.

422
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:11,284
- Enough!
- Go on! Go!

423
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,269
move along there,you--

424
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,361
You, uh, big butt heads!

425
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,876
- Ow!
- Young'un, stop this nonsense.

426
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:35,248
What's got into you? I just finished
tellin' what a nice young pig you be.

427
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,049
Maa, I was just trying
to be a sheepdog.

428
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,612
Hah! Enough wolves
in the world already...

429
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,251
without a nice lad like you
turnin' nasty.

430
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,386
You haven't got it in ya,
young'un.

431
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:55,871
You and I are descended
from the great sheepdogs.

432
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:58,100
We carry the bloodline
of the Ancient Bahou.

433
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,143
We stand for something.

434
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,145
And today I watched in shame
as all that was betrayed.

435
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,876
- Rex, he's just a little pig.
- All the greater the insult.

436
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:13,282
I'm sorry I bit you.
Are you all right?

437
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:17,726
I wouldn't call that a bite, myself. You
got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums?

438
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,632
You see, ladies,
a heart of gold.

439
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,795
Ahh. Heart of gold.

440
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,465
No need for all this
wolf nonsense, young'un.

441
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,533
All a nice pig like you
need do is ask.

442
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,105
Thanks very much.
It was very kind of you.

443
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,579
A pleasure.
What a nice little pig!

444
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,981
All right, how did you do it?

445
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,822
I asked them, and they did it.
I asked them nicely.

446
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,454
We don't ask sheep, dear.
We tell them what to do.

447
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,499
I did, Mom.
They were really friendly.

448
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:34,369
Maybe Rex might be a little more
friendly if I had a talk with him.

449
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:38,430
No, no, no.
You better leave that to me.

450
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,923
Rex?

451
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:10,166
I know it was hard
for you today...

452
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,969
watching all that happening.

453
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:15,306
But surely it's not worth
all this misery.

454
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:19,246
Please, dear,
not on such a beautiful night.

455
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:22,011
You put these ideas
into his head!

456
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:24,747
Two-faced traitorous wret--

457
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:35,996
Get down!

458
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:39,694
Down, Rex. Fly!

459
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:04,349
A dark cloud
had descended on the valley.

460
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:07,487
And the pig felt that
the troubles were all his fault.

461
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:11,830
But he was certain that he knew
how to put things right again.

462
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:17,430
Oh, uh, e-excuse me, sir.

463
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,805
But I -I -I think
all this trouble--

464
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:30,474
Well, it's not distemper.
can't be rabies.

465
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,147
Must be the hormones.

466
00:46:33,222 --> 00:46:38,091
What about Hoggett's notion, the dog jealous
of the wee pig? I don't see that myself.

467
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:41,289
No. So what should we do?

468
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:46,802
You can keep him locked up
or... snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.

469
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:49,667
- No.
- Or Wednesday.

470
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:53,539
Hoggett doesn't want the dog
operated on. He's a breeding dog.

471
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,011
I can sedate him, of course,

472
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,516
but he'll be useless
as a working dog.

473
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:11,090
I'll give you pills
to put in his food.

474
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,321
Good dog.

475
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:20,435
The Sheep Pig.

476
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:46,193
A pig doing the work of a sheepdog?

477
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:50,790
With Rex out of action and Fly injured from
the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice.

478
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,893
Maa! Maa! The boss has to
give you some medicine.

479
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,565
Oh, dear, I thought so!
It's horrible stuff, that.

480
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,101
- I know, but it's for the best.
- Young'un, if you say so.

481
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,725
Shoo! Shoo!

482
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,390
When the thought first came to him,

483
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:25,730
Farmer Hoggett dismissed it
as mere whimsy.

484
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:30,398
But, like most of his harebrained
ideas, it wouldn't go away.

485
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:39,278
What are they doing?
It's a sheepdog trial.

486
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:41,839
So it's like
a competition for sheepdogs?

487
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,853
And their bosses.
It's like an obstacle course.

488
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,082
How do they decide who wins?

489
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:51,456
It's time and mistakes.
You get points for how quick you are.

490
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,791
And they take points off
for every mistake.

491
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:57,560
Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,
that's a mistake and you lose points.

492
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:02,627
- Looks like fun!
- For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.

493
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:06,038
- Rex and I used to--
- Hmm?

494
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,805
Never mind.

495
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,745
Oh.

496
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:15,011
Was Rex a champion?

497
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:20,283
He had the makings of the greatest champion
there ever was, but it wasn't to be.

498
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:25,055
What happened? A while back
when Rex was in his prime,

499
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,825
the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

500
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:32,231
Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

501
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:35,395
Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

502
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:40,636
He found them. They'd been
stranded by the rising water.

503
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,147
He tried to herd them across
to safety, but they wouldn't budge.

504
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:49,207
Too afraid and too stupid
to save their own skins.

505
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:52,880
It was freezing cold
and the water kept rising.

506
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:57,221
Rex stayed with them
right through the night.

507
00:49:57,293 --> 00:50:00,592
By morning, the sheep were drowned.

508
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:05,691
And when they found Rex, he
was barely alive. Oh, mom!

509
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:09,135
Two weeks rest in front of
the fire saw him back on his feet.

510
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:12,140
But his hearing
was never the same again.

511
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:17,271
He'd never want anyone to know,
but he's almost totally deaf.

512
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:22,010
I s that why he's so, you know, angry?
That's not the half of it.

513
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:25,918
All this was barely a month
before the Grand National Challenge.

514
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:30,322
He tried his best, but he couldn't hear
the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.

515
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:34,056
The cold truth is that,
but for the stupidity of sheep,

516
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,622
Rex would've been
the champion of champions.

517
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:43,904
Good dog.

518
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:12,862
That's it, all right. Good.

519
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:16,302
Here we go. All right.

520
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:19,364
Now, through here like this.

521
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:21,910
And then, big hook to the left.
Big hook.

522
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:26,074
Big hook.
Through this gate here.

523
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:31,051
It was at that time that Mrs. Hoggett
began to worry about her husband.

524
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,023
But Farmer Hoggett knew
that little ideas...

525
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,255
that tickled and nagged
and refused to go away...

526
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:41,888
should never be ignored...

527
00:51:41,964 --> 00:51:45,593
for in them lie the seeds of destiny.

528
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:49,069
Close the gate like that,
and you're done.

529
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:54,966
A Tragic Day.

530
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:13,992
Mom. Mom!
Can we start work early today?

531
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:17,032
Oh, dear,
it's not even dawn yet.

532
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:23,004
You can go to work when the rooster
crows. Oh, go back to sleep.

533
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:31,980
Ahem.

534
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,449
Um, excuse me.

535
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:39,545
Hello, sir. Excuse me,
but it's nearly dawn, and--

536
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:43,080
What?
Sorry to disturb you.

537
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:47,255
It's nearly dawn, and I wondered if you'd mind
crowing just a few minutes early this morning.

538
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,321
- Get out of here!
- But, well, see I--

539
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:52,390
- Get lost!
- Oh, okay.

540
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,132
Whoa!

541
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:47,179
Now the pig understood
why the sheep called all dogs wolves.

542
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:51,215
And he was filled with
a deep and terrible rage.

543
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,814
Maa! Maa!

544
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,088
Are you all right?
Hello, young'un.

545
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,755
Oh, Maa, can you get up?

546
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,890
I don't reckon.

547
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:34,868
It's over, Maa.
The wolves have gone far away.

548
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:38,168
I'll get the boss up here
to look after you.

549
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,403
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right!

550
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:47,474
Oh, Maa! Maa!

551
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:52,613
Maa! Maa!

552
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:54,679
Maa!

553
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:58,420
Maa!

554
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,107
Home, Pig.

555
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:26,713
Fly knew that there
was only one fate for any creature...

556
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:30,020
that took the life of a sheep
on Hoggett Farm.

557
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:51,071
But Fly could never believe
that Babe was a sheep killer,

558
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:56,847
so she remained in the field to do something
she 'd never done before: talk to the sheep.

559
00:55:56,919 --> 00:55:59,285
Tell me. Who killed the old one?

560
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:03,121
- Wolf! - Wolf. I s that the
only words you half-wits know?

561
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:06,127
- Wolf!
- Are you saying it was a dog?

562
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:09,756
- Where's Babe?
- Was it wolf or Babe?

563
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:12,995
Wolf! Babe!

564
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:21,036
Farmer Hoggett was carrying
something in the crook of one arm.

565
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,578
A kind of black, shiny tube.

566
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:27,047
Come, Pig.

567
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:31,212
The pig had a vague
memory that shiny tubes produced food...

568
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,586
and guessed that some
quite unexpected surprise...

569
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,854
would come out
of two small round mouths.

570
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,862
Babe! Wolf!

571
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,593
Babe! Wolf!

572
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:48,034
Quiet!

573
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:50,401
Fly decided to speak very slowly,

574
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:54,465
for it was a cold fact of nature
that sheep were stupid...

575
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:56,636
and no one would ever
persuade her otherwise.

576
00:56:56,712 --> 00:57:00,842
Please, please would you be...

577
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:04,317
so kind as to tell me what happened?

578
00:57:04,386 --> 00:57:09,517
- Quiet!
- Please, tell me what happened this morning.

579
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,722
The sheep spoke very slowly...

580
00:57:13,796 --> 00:57:16,492
for it was a cold fact of nature
that wolves were ignorant...

581
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:19,056
and nothing would
convince them otherwise.

582
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:22,592
Babe came! He saved us!

583
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:27,699
- The wolves killed Maa.
- But Babe drove the wolves away!

584
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:31,507
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you all very much!

585
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,539
Pleasure talkin' to ya.

586
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:06,310
Hooey! Hoggett!
Hooey! Arthur!

587
00:58:08,984 --> 00:58:12,613
Oh, there you are!
Well, what do you think?

588
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:15,782
That was the police on the telephone.
Said there are wild dogs about.

589
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:18,827
Apparently the Mitchells
lost six lambs this morning.

590
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:23,058
What on Earth
are you doing with that gun?

591
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,966
Oh, I-- Nothing.

592
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:52,457
Pig of Destiny!

593
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,858
It's all very simple.
Half an hour at 350 degrees.

594
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:05,168
I've given you
rabbit casserole for Friday.

595
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,232
Now, for Duchess, it's liver
in the morning, heart for the evening.

596
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,541
Except Fridays, when it's steak in
the morning and cooked liver at night.

597
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:17,017
Warm it up a bit but test it, because she
bites into it before she knows what's what.

598
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,577
That'll be the bus.

599
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,685
Oh, bye-bye.
Have a good time. Bye.

600
00:59:27,763 --> 00:59:29,321
Hello, everyone!

601
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:38,132
Oh, dearie me, Valda.

602
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,402
I know I have to be
at the National Conference.

603
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:43,707
I am the Assistant General Secretary
of the Northeast Region after all,

604
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:47,442
but I do worry about
leaving that man alone.

605
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:51,316
Still acting a bit strange?
Just silly things.

606
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:54,481
Odd little things
only a wife would notice.

607
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:59,858
Still he can't get up to too much
mischief in three days. Of course not.

608
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,232
Go on.

609
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,370
Go on!

610
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:36,521
Oh! Good evening.
Shame about the weather.

611
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:39,158
Nasty cough!

612
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,000
It had been
a long time since Arthur Hoggett...

613
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:50,238
had had an animal in whose abilities
he had so much faith.

614
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:54,305
And with the National Grand challenge
Sheepdog Trials only two days away,

615
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:58,012
he wasn't going to let the fact
that his animal was a pig deter him.

616
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:03,350
He had been worried,
for he was a truthful man,

617
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:06,485
that the heading might say
"Name of dog. "

618
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,928
And then whatever he put
would be a lie.

619
01:01:08,997 --> 01:01:13,366
But as it happened, luck,
for the moment, was running with him.

620
01:01:22,644 --> 01:01:24,635
It's all right, really!

621
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:28,342
I'm just, well-- Bless you.

622
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:21,129
Whoa, whoa!
Uh, easy, whoa!Ah.

623
01:02:21,203 --> 01:02:23,137
Oh, no.

624
01:02:23,205 --> 01:02:27,369
So, ah... what's happening?
Oh, no.

625
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:32,677
Shh. Easy, easy.

626
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:36,741
Good pig. Good pig.
Huh? Huh?

627
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:40,117
Hold still. Hold still.

628
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:42,213
Huh?

629
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:50,162
There are many
perfectly nice cats in the world.

630
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:52,826
But every barrel has its bad apples.

631
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:55,301
And it is well to heed the old adage,

632
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:59,864
"Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge. "

633
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:25,593
How are you feeling?
A bit tired.

634
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:28,653
You'll need a good sleep to put you
in top condition tomorrow.

635
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,130
Don't stay up too late.
Good night.

636
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,191
Good night, Mom.

637
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:46,442
Oh, do forgive me
for scratching you, dear.

638
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:51,248
I got a bit carried away.
It's a cat thing.

639
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:54,982
Oh. Well--
But, oh--

640
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,254
Feeling good about tomorrow,
are you?

641
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,886
Mm-hmm. It should be all right,
I think.

642
01:05:00,962 --> 01:05:06,491
I probably shouldn't say this,
but I'm not sure if you realize...

643
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:11,198
how much the other animals are laughing
at you for this sheepdog business.

644
01:05:11,273 --> 01:05:13,332
Why would they do that?

645
01:05:13,408 --> 01:05:18,311
Well, they say that you've forgotten
that you're a pig. Isn't that silly?

646
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,941
They even say that you
don't know what pigs are for.

647
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:23,985
What do you mean?

648
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:28,887
You know... why pigs are here.
Why are any of us here?

649
01:05:28,957 --> 01:05:31,687
Well, the cow's here to be milked.

650
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,695
The dogs are here to help
the boss's husband with the sheep.

651
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:37,960
And I'm here to be beautiful
and affectionate to the boss.

652
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:40,297
Yes?

653
01:05:40,368 --> 01:05:44,805
The fact is that pigs
don't have a purpose.

654
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,808
Just like ducks don't have a purpose.

655
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:52,506
I don't-- All right, for
your own sake, I'll be blunt.

656
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:57,018
Why do the bosses keep ducks?
To eat them.

657
01:05:57,085 --> 01:06:00,486
So why do the bosses keep a pig?

658
01:06:00,555 --> 01:06:06,152
The fact is that animals that don't seem
to have a purpose really do have a purpose.

659
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:10,756
The bosses have to eat. It's probably
the most noble purpose of all...

660
01:06:10,832 --> 01:06:13,027
when you come to think about it.

661
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:15,092
They eat pi gs?

662
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,799
Pork, they call it. Or bacon.

663
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,604
They only call them pigs
when they're alive.

664
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:24,008
But, uh, I'm a sheep pig!

665
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:28,815
The boss's husband's just
playing a little game with you.

666
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:32,684
Believe me, sooner or later,
every pig gets eaten.

667
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:36,417
That's the way the world works.

668
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:41,451
Oh! I haven't upset you,
have I?

669
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,124
Mom?
Mm-hmm.

670
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,425
Mom!
Good heavens!

671
01:07:15,497 --> 01:07:19,092
What on earth are you doing
out in the rain?

672
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,625
You should be looking after yourself
with such a big day ahead of you.

673
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:25,901
- Are pigs for eatin'?
- Who told you that?

674
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:29,603
The cat told me. Pigs don't have
a purpose except to be eaten.

675
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:33,512
Is it true?

676
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,779
It's true.
For many pigs, it's true.

677
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,650
So my mother, my father,
my brothers and my sisters,

678
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:42,918
all--
Probably, dear.

679
01:07:45,527 --> 01:07:50,396
Do you want to talk about it?
No, it's all right.

680
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:54,629
I understand. I'll be all right.

681
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:01,505
Even... the boss?

682
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:04,136
Yes, dear.

683
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,238
Ooh! Ooo!

684
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:32,671
Babe?

685
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,402
Babe!

686
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:36,273
Babe!

687
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:44,049
Babe!

688
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:46,383
Babe!

689
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:51,815
Babe's run away.

690
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:54,191
Rex?

691
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:55,991
Please?

692
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:58,658
Call the boss.

693
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:24,154
He's over here.

694
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:28,855
Hold on, Pig,
you'll be home soon.

695
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:38,605
He's got a cold, but that doesn't
explain a pig not eating.

696
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:42,006
He's got me stonkered, Arthur.
But I can tell you this.

697
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:46,673
If you don't get fluids into him soon,
you're gonna lose him.

698
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:51,583
C'mon, son. Pull yourself together.

699
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:53,985
The boss needs you.

700
01:10:09,137 --> 01:10:12,470
Here we go.

701
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,509
Come on, Pig. Ah, come on.

702
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:17,704
There's my boy.

703
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:21,442

Listen, Arthur,
I'll tell you what we can do.

718
01:12:47,095 --> 01:12:50,292
You're listed third, but we can
put you last in the program.

719
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:53,960
However, you must be here by 3:30;;
otherwise you'll be disqualified.

720
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:56,128
All right.

721
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,413
And welcome back to the National Grand
Challenge Sheepdog Trials...

722
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:19,892
coming today from the Kingsmith Show
Ground in the heart of sheep country.

723
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:22,452
The weather's been patchy,

724
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:27,661
but we've already seen some wonderful
work by these talented dogs.

725
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:40,247
Stay there.

726
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,476
Excuse me, sheep.

727
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:46,281
Hello! Hello!
Good morning to you all!

728
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:53,349
I've never met a sheep
with such a strong, dark face.

729
01:13:53,428 --> 01:13:56,989
Are they feeding you well?

730
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,692
Babe, I'll try.

731
01:13:58,766 --> 01:14:03,100
All right, blockheads!
Pay attention over here!

732
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:07,631
Now, you pay attention
to what this pig has to say...

733
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:11,372
or I 'll come in there
and rip you to shreds!

734
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:15,906
Hadn't thought of this. Keep talking
to them. I'll see what I can do.

735
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:26,026
Doesn't it look a picture? Our show ground
on the telly! Apart from the weather.

736
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:30,463
Look! There's your Bert!
- Bert Ford and Sweep doing very well.

737
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:35,594
Sweep's having a little trouble with this
gate, Clive. A lot of trouble actually.

738
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:40,164
- That's going to set Bert back.
- Don't worry, Valda. Just a little slipup.

739
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,971
Look, he's doing
much better now.

740
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:46,070
Too many loose sheep.
And Sweep's usually such a reliable dog.

741
01:14:51,986 --> 01:14:54,318
Hey, whoa. Stop!

742
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,197
If those sheep won't talk to Babe,
the boss is going to look like an idiot.

743
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,330
I don't know what to do.
There is one thing.

744
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:16,138
I gotta go!
I'll try to be back in time.

745
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:26,276
Ahem. It must've been
terrible weather for you,

746
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:31,451
out in the field with
all this rain we've been having.

747
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,257
Hey, that dog's in a hurry.

748
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:42,064
Come on, Nick,
I got a beer and a TV waiting.

749
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,076
The last entry
is pig. Owner, A. Hoggett.

750
01:15:57,151 --> 01:15:59,381
Is that Hoggett?
I think it was!

751
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:03,356
Huh? He said Hoggett.
It was clear as a bell.

752
01:16:03,424 --> 01:16:08,418
Must be another Hoggett. We only have
the two dogs, and they certainly...

753
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:10,487
aren't--

754
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:23,533
Wolf! Wolf!

755
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:25,841
Wolf! Wolf!

756
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:29,542
Shut up, you morons!

757
01:16:29,617 --> 01:16:32,711
The little pig's in trouble.

758
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:35,119
What trouble has come
to our Babe, wolf?

759
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:37,953
The sheep at the trials
won't talk to the little fellow.

760
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:40,289
They won't listen.
He doesn't know what to do.

761
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:43,558
Don't know what
we could do to help.

762
01:16:43,631 --> 01:16:49,126
It's not right to give help to a wolf.
You wait here, wolf.

763
01:16:49,203 --> 01:16:52,366
You'll have to speak up.
I'm a... little hard of hearing.

764
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:57,104
I asked you to wait here, wolf.

765
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:01,672
Do what you're told by an old sheep for a
change. We'll see what we can do for you.

766
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:06,912
Work completed. Restore power.

767
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:11,482
Very frustrating
to be sitting up here...

768
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:13,550
wondering what's causing the delay.

769
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:16,222
We have someone on their way
to the judges' rooms now.

770
01:17:16,297 --> 01:17:18,822
We'll tell you what's causing
the problem as soon as we find out.

771
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,494
perhaps it's a drug test, Eric?
Yeah, it could be.

772
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:24,436
I've never heard of a drug test
at a sheepdog contest before.

773
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:29,841
We've got somethin' here
that might be of use to our pig.

774
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,971
Password! Password!

775
01:17:33,047 --> 01:17:37,416
Before we gives you anythin',
you'll be makin' us a solemn promise.

776
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:39,976
Yes?
Treat us civil!

777
01:17:40,054 --> 01:17:42,420
Yes! You gotta treat us nice-like.

778
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,981
I'll try.

779
01:17:45,059 --> 01:17:48,517
No bitin'! That's right. Wolf
must avoid bitin' us sheep...

780
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:52,225
at all costs!
All right! I'll try that too.

781
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,396
It's preposterous! We'd be the laughingstock
of every sheepdog organization...

782
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,304
in every civilized country in
the world! There's no rule--

783
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:03,139
We'll see about that when the adjudication
committee have finished their meeting.

784
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:09,013
What will we have next year,
a laughing hyena doing show jumping?

785
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,075
But the most important of all,
you must promise...

786
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:15,850
never ever to let this password
we be about to give...

787
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:18,187
to be used against
any sheep anywhere.

788
01:18:18,259 --> 01:18:20,784
I promise you that.
I'll make sure the pig knows it too.

789
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:24,457
We have the promise!
'Tis for Babe.

790
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:27,194
Maa would have wanted it.

791
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:33,506
Baa, ram, ewe.

792
01:18:33,574 --> 01:18:36,372
Baa, ram, ewe.

793
01:18:36,444 --> 01:18:40,346
To your breed, your fleece,
your clan be true.

794
01:18:40,414 --> 01:18:45,477
Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.

795
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:50,354
Is that it?
Is that the password?

796
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:08,470
Mr. Hoggett, the judges
would like me to convey to you...

797
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,944
their disappointment
that a man such as yourself,

798
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:16,416
with a long and honorable association with
the work of National Sheepdog Association,

799
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:18,645
should see fit to flout...

800
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,713
the historic conventions
which have long ruled our sport.

801
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:26,555
However we find there
is no rule, as such,

802
01:19:26,627 --> 01:19:31,530
which would prevent your...
animal... being entered.

803
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:49,010
The committee has ruled
that if you wish to proceed,

804
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,711
there is nothing we can do
to stop you.

805
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:55,117
What do you wish to do?

806
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,766
There appears
to be some movement down there now.

807
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,324
I expect if there are
no further problems,

808
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:12,236
we shall see Hoggett
and his dog pig.

809
01:20:12,306 --> 01:20:15,707
Unusual name. Strange name, isn't it?
Pig.

810
01:20:15,776 --> 01:20:17,403
Anyone for a game of cards?

811
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:20,174
Oh, good grief! Look!

812
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:40,327
He's a fool!

813
01:20:40,401 --> 01:20:44,895
Entry number 23,
Mr. A. Hoggett with pig.

814
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:15,495
This is just too crazy to believe.

815
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:19,164
And if that isn't enough.
We have a stray dog on the field.

816
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,832
They trying to round him up?

817
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:25,368
The dog's gonna give a few tips
on how to be a sheep pig.

818
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:42,260
Well, it's up to him now.

819
01:21:57,578 --> 01:22:00,445
Away to me, Pig.

820
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:11,585
Get off!

821
01:22:15,596 --> 01:22:19,327
Baa, ram, ewe.
Baa, ram, ewe!

822
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,097
To your breed, your fleece,
your clan be true.

823
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:26,037
Sheep be true.
Baa, ram, ewe.

824
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:29,770
What... What did you say?

825
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:33,610
Get yourself a dog, Hoggett.

826
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:43,879
There, there, Esme.
It's not the end of the world.

827
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:48,054
Is he just going to
stand there until his time runs out?

828
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,563
Or could this be
some sort of protest?

829
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,395
maybe we should line up an
interview with the sheep pig?

830
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:55,958
Or the sheep pig's trainer.

831
01:22:56,036 --> 01:22:58,334
He's a lively sort of fellow
by the looks of things.

832
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:01,272
Good heavens!

833
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:26,632
Hey!
Shh.

834
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,327
It's Babe!

835
01:23:39,947 --> 01:23:42,040
I -I --

836
01:23:42,116 --> 01:23:44,607
I t, uh--
Hmm.

837
01:23:51,258 --> 01:23:55,024
Oh, beautifully done! I can't
tell you how grateful I am to y'all.

838
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:57,029
Now, for one last favor.

839
01:23:57,097 --> 01:24:00,032
If the three ladies with collars
would kindly walk out of the ring,

840
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,795
I'd be very much obliged.

841
01:25:49,576 --> 01:25:52,807
And so it was that
in all the celebration,

842
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,849
in all the hubbub
of noise and excitement,

843
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:59,010
there were two figures
who stood silent and still...

844
01:25:59,086 --> 01:26:02,180
side by side.

845
01:26:03,824 --> 01:26:06,987
The pig did it! The perfect score!

846
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:12,124
Yippee! Yippee!

847
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:16,397
And though every single human in the
stands or in the commentary boxes...

848
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:20,031
was at a complete loss for words,

849
01:26:20,107 --> 01:26:23,668
the man, who in his life had uttered
fewer words than any of them...

850
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:28,579
knew exactly what to say.

851
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:31,675
That'll do, Pi g.

852
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:36,045
That'll do.

853
01:26:49,203 --> 01:26:52,900
And a-one and a-two
and a-three. Hit it.

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,953
<i>Survival of the fittest.</i>

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,236
<i>It's the law of the jungle.</i>

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,279
<i>There's always someone trying
to take what's yours.</i>

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,470
<i>How do I know?</i>

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,276
<i>It almost happened to me.</i>

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,470
Hi-yah!

8
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,560
Tim Templeton...

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,949
quit monkeying around.

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,759
Hot dogs are getting cold.

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,115
Hot dogs?

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,237
<i>At least, this is how I remember it.</i>

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,510
All right, buddy, let's eat.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,478
<i>You see, I was seven years old...</i>

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,599
<i>and back then,
you relied on your imagination.</i>

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,558
<i>When I wasn't exploring the Congo...</i>

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,951
<i>I was a deep sea diver.</i>

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,151
Tim!

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,276
Our hero!

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,635
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,677
I got this!

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,630
Grab on!

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,231
<i>Some days, I rescued my parents.</i>

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,430
That way!

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,233
<i>Other days, they rescued me.</i>

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,112
- I'm losing control.
- <i>Tim, look out!</i>

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,040
Tree!

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,031
<i>You're breaking up!</i>

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,111
Slow down, Tim!

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
- Turn, Tim.
- Turn!

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,076
Show Mommy your teeth.

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,919
<i>It was just the three of us.</i>

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,355
<i>The Templetons.</i>

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,671
<i>And three is the perfect number.</i>

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,830
<i>Interesting fact...</i>

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,799
<i>did you know that the triangle
is the strongest shape found in nature?</i>

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,352
<i>I was the luckiest kid ever.</i>

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,671
<i>My parents even had cool jobs.</i>

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,520
<i>They worked for the biggest pet company
in the world...</i>

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,631
<i>Puppy Co.</i>

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,632
- Yes, Mr. Francis?
- <i>Puppy Co needs you.</i>

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,836
It's go time.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,312
<i>They worked in a department
called "Marketing..."</i>

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,672
<i>where they got to launch new products.</i>

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,594
<i>Even though my parents worked really hard...</i>

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>they still made just enough time for me.</i>

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,040
Three stories, five hugs,
and my special song, right?

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,230
You got it!

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,793
<i>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</i>

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,231
<i>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</i>

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,790
<i>All your life</i>

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,557
<i>You were only waiting
For this moment to arise</i>

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,151
Hey, Tim. How would you like
to have a baby brother?

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,471
No, thanks. I'm enough.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,552
<i>Life was good. Life was perfect.</i>

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,359
<i>But as I drifted off to sleep...</i>

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,479
<i>something my parents said got me thinking.</i>

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,711
<i>Where do babies come from?</i>

60
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,310
<i>The day I got a little brother
started like any other day...</i>

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,879
<i>but little did I know...</i>

62
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,953
<i>my life would never be the same.</i>

63
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,959
<i>Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

64
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,470
<i>Wake up, little halflings!</i>

65
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,471
Morning, Wizzie!

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,316
<i>What great adventure
lies in wait for you today?</i>

67
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,070
Oh, yeah!

68
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,632
<i>My parents always said
that I had an overactive imagination.</i>

69
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,840
<i>But I clearly remember...</i>

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,391
<i>the baby was delivered in a taxi.</i>

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,990
What the...

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,190
Hey!

73
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,879
Tim, look who's here.

74
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,038
Meet your new baby brother.

75
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,350
Baby what?

76
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,752
Brother.

77
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,718
<i>I had a million questions.</i>

78
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,712
<i>Who is this guy? Why is he here?</i>

79
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,870
<i>What's with that outfit?</i>

80
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,356
<i>Why's he so fat? Why's he staring at me?</i>

81
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,352
<i>Does he know karate? What's going on?</i>

82
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,071
That way?

83
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,117
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,873
<i>Right from the start,
he was yelling at people...</i>

85
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,679
<i>ordering everyone around.</i>

86
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,394
Oh, you want this?

87
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,237
<i>One thing was clear. He was the boss.</i>

88
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,112
<i>He set up his office, right
smack dab in the middle of the house.</i>

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,390
<i>He conducted meetings.</i>

90
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,432
- You called?
- Do you need Señor Squeaky?

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,914
<i>Lots and lots of meetings.</i>

92
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,753
<i>Even in the middle of the night.</i>

93
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,034
I'm up! I'm up!

94
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,594
- We're coming!
- We'll be right there!

95
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,958
<i>If things weren't done
to his immediate satisfaction...</i>

96
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,557
<i>he had a fit.</i>

97
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,594
- Where's the bottle?
- He has to have his bottle!

98
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,554
<i>He had everyone wrapped around
his chubby little finger.</i>

99
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,112
<i>Everyone except for me.</i>

100
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,909
- Diaper!
- Bottle!

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,957
Dad! I can't sleep.

102
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,634
I know, bud. Me neither.

103
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,917
The baby needs a lot of attention right now.

104
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,070
Okay, good talk!

105
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,356
- But...
- It's okay.

106
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,636
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,990
What about me?

108
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,597
The year: 2057.

109
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,039
Ensign T-Rex and I are investigating
a hostile alien invasion.

110
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,152
It's so much worse than we thought.

111
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Mom, he's naked!

112
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,830
I'm naked!

113
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,150
Say "naked."

114
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,310
No!

115
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,515
Who's Mommy's little cutie?
Are you Mommy's little cutie?

116
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,036
No, he's Daddy's little tough guy, right?

117
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,640
You know one of us has to go
with Mr. Francis to the pet convention.

118
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,069
In Vegas.

119
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,357
- You know what? You should go.
- No, no. You should go.

120
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,510
Well, you need a break.

121
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,871
- I'll stay with the baby, and you...
- Maybe the baby should decide.

122
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,671
Who do you want to stay with you?
Daddy or Mommy?

123
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,990
Or Daddy?

124
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,594
He wants his mommy.

125
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,558
Okay, we need to talk!

126
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,756
In private.

127
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
- Sure.
- About what, bud?

128
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,432
About the b-a-b-e-e.

129
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,360
"Y," Tim.

130
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,239
Why? Because he came out of nowhere!

131
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,390
We don't even know him.

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,755
How can we trust him?

133
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,673
Come on, he's just a baby.

134
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,715
Seriously? I'm the only one that thinks
there's something weird about this guy?

135
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,912
- Oopsie! I got it.
- Five-second rule.

136
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,349
Tim?

137
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,754
Look at him! He wears a suit!

138
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,594
I know. Isn't it cute?
He's like a little man.

139
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,592
He carries a briefcase.

140
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,558
Does no else think that's...

141
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,951
I don't know, a little freaky?

142
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, you carried Lam-Lam around
until you were like...

143
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,274
This is not about Lam-Lam.

144
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,560
All babies are different, Tim.

145
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,074
And each one is special.

146
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,959
He's taking over the whole house!

147
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,440
Are you taking over the house?

148
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,398
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,120
Trust me, one day you're gonna
get to know this little guy...

150
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,795
and you are gonna love him
with all of your heart.

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,950
Just like we do.

152
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,754
All of your heart?

153
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,472
Never.

154
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,191
Hello!

155
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,990
It's time for my three stories,
five hugs, and special song!

156
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,192
How about one story...

157
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,478
three hugs, and my special song?

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,231
Just my special song?

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,834
Mom?

160
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,515
Dad?

161
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,829
Hey.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,753
What happened to bedtime?

163
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,994
We'll have it on Monday, Mr. Francis.

164
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,998
Don't cry! Don't cry.

165
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,230
Hello?

166
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,273
Hello? No, ma'am, not yet.

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,551
No, I'm not making excuses.

168
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,514
Yes, ma'am,
I know I've been here a long time.

169
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,030
Believe me, it feels like my whole life.

170
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,034
I'm making great progress
with the parents already.

171
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,558
The usual procedure,
sleep deprivation, hunger strikes.

172
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,393
They're very disoriented.

173
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,950
I've got them
eating out of the palm of my hand.

174
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,391
They do everything for me.

175
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,710
It's hilarious.

176
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,473
But I think the kid might be on to me.

177
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,397
No, I can handle him.

178
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,756
I know how important this mission is
to the company.

179
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,155
Mission?

180
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,154
Well, trust me, ma'am.
You got the right baby for this job.

181
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,754
Hands up, devil baby!

182
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,910
Fart! Poop! Doodie!

183
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,994
I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.

184
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,116
You can talk!

185
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,592
Uh, goo-goo Ga-ga.

186
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,991
No, you can really talk. I heard you!

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,071
Fine. I can talk.

188
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,435
Now, let's see if you can listen.

189
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,670
Get me a double espresso...

190
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,752
and see if there's someplace around here
with decent sushi.

191
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,992
I'd kill for a spicy tuna roll
right about now.

192
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,759
Get yourself a little something.

193
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,434
Who are you?

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,196
Let's just say I'm the boss.

195
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,592
The boss? You're a baby! You wear a diaper.

196
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,353
You know who else wears diapers?

197
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,955
Astronauts and NASCAR drivers, that's who.

198
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,474
It's called efficiency, Templeton.

199
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,429
The average toddler spends, what?
45 hours a year on the potty?

200
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,951
I'm the boss.
I don't have that kind of spare time.

201
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,679
Well, you're not the boss of me.

202
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,957
- I am the boss of you.
- No, you're not.

203
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,110
- Am, too.
- Are not.

204
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,555
- Am, too!
- Are not!

205
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,270
- Am, too.
- Are not!

206
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,470
- <i>Am, too.</i>
- Are not!

207
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,109
<i>Am, too. Am, too.</i>

208
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,310
I was here first.

209
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,551
Just wait until Mom and Dad find out
about this.

210
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,030
Oh, yeah? You think they'd pick you over me?

211
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
With your track record?

212
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,473
You don't know anything about me.

213
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,390
So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
Let's see.

214
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,191
Templeton, Timothy. Middle name....

215
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,991
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,991
Leslie!

217
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,879
- Mostly C's...
- How do you know all that?

218
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,157
Can't ride a bike without training wheels?

219
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,314
Even bears can ride a bike
without training wheels, Leslie.

220
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,236
DOB says you're seven.

221
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,675
Seven and a half.

222
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,552
Power nap! You were saying?

223
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,154
I'm seven and a half.

224
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,834
Exactly! You're old.

225
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,913
It's time to make way
for the next generation.

226
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,355
It's the way of the world.

227
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,751
You would never ask your parents
for an old toy.

228
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,831
Lam-Lam?

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,036
Everyone wants the hot, new thing.

230
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,720
<i>Destroy. Destroy.</i>

231
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,349
- Lam-Lam!
- I've got fresh batteries.

232
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,510
Boom!

233
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,273
Mom and Dad don't even know you.

234
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,715
They love me!

235
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,354
Oh, yeah? Do the math, kid.

236
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,910
There's only so much love to go around.

237
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,958
It's like these beads.

238
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,510
You used to have all your parents' love.

239
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,951
All their time. All their attention.

240
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,191
You had all the beads.

241
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,919
But then I came along.

242
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,958
Babies take up a lot of time.

243
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,557
They need a lot of attention.
They get all the love.

244
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,400
We could share.

245
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,791
You obviously didn't go to business school.

246
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,918
Look, Templeton,
the numbers just don't add up.

247
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,390
There's not enough love for the two of us.

248
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,711
Not enough beads to go around.

249
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,476
And then, all of a sudden,
there's no place for Tim.

250
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,154
Tim doesn't fit anymore.

251
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,710
Oh, no! What about Tim?

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,310
So keep quiet. Stay out of my way.

253
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,312
Or there's gonna be cutbacks.

254
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,630
You can't be fired from your own family.

255
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,434
Can you?

256
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,512
<i>Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

257
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,796
<i>Wake up, little half...</i>

258
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,394
What's the use?

259
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,715
<i>Arise for a nutritious breakfast!</i>

260
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
<i>It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

261
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,439
<i>What's wrong, Timothy?</i>

262
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,637
<i>Has that little dwarf made you blue?</i>

263
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,951
Mm-hmm.

264
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,760
<i>Then I shall cast upon him a great curse!</i>

265
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,276
<i>He shall not pass!</i>

266
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,794
It's no use, Wizzie.

267
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,792
He's got Mom and Dad completely fooled.

268
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,953
If they knew what I knew,
they'd never let him stay.

269
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,798
<i>Perhaps your parents need to be enlightened.</i>

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,117
<i>With a great curse!</i>

271
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,555
<i>They shall not pass!</i>

272
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,552
Yeah. I need to enlighten them...

273
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,835
with proof!

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,559
That's what I need, proof!

275
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,912
<i>Expose his dark magic!</i>

276
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,840
Testing, testing.

277
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,315
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

278
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,000
Maybe they can return him to the store...

279
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,355
and get their money back!

280
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,113
<i>We could buy a bouncy house!</i>

281
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,671
<i>Godspeed, Tim! It's 8:45 a.m.</i>

282
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,151
Ninja.

283
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,510
Ninja.

284
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,836
Ninja.

285
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,839
Ninja.

286
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,155
Babies everywhere! They're spreading.

287
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,915
Mom! Dad! What's going on?

288
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,079
It's an invasion!

289
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,558
It's a play date!

290
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,240
That's a keeper.

291
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,040
It's a meeting, and you won't be attending.

292
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,039
We'll see about that.

293
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,673
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.

294
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,069
Now, before we begin...

295
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,871
Yes, sir!

296
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,275
- Sure is!
- Affirmative!

297
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,113
Jimbo, run some interference.

298
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,716
Hey!

299
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,440
- We babies are having a crisis!
- Oh, no!

300
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,670
- That's awful!
- Horrible!

301
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,870
What is it?

302
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,760
It's simpler if I just show you.
Teddy, if you please.

303
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,599
<i>Let's put on a show.</i>

304
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>Here we go!</i>

305
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,269
Jimbo, hit the lights.

306
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,272
You see, babies aren't getting
as much love as we used to.

307
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,199
Why? Have we been bad?

308
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,271
No, Staci.

309
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,119
But I'll tell you who is.

310
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,717
Behold our mortal enemy. Puppies!

311
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,077
No! That's exactly the problem.

312
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,715
Puppies? What's the deal with puppies?

313
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,950
Throughout history...

314
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,359
people have loved babies
more than anything in the world.

315
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,159
We've always been a must-have item...

316
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,596
number one on every wish list.

317
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,673
Puppies were merely accessories.

318
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,359
But all that changed
when the puppies began coming out...

319
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,512
with new designer models.

320
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,280
Each one more adorable than the last.

321
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,238
Remember the Labradoodle?

322
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,595
The Peekapoo?

323
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,639
The Chiweenie?
Try to say "Chiweenie" without smiling.

324
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,195
Not possible. Don't waste your time.

325
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,073
We all laughed at the Shar Pei.

326
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,951
And now it's number one in China.

327
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,430
- Oh, no.
- That's terrible!

328
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,319
- Horrible!
- Yes.

329
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,800
And it gets even worse.

330
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,670
Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co,
made this announcement.

331
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Teddy, roll the clip.

332
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,392
<i>And we are on schedule...</i>

333
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,031
<i>to release the most adorable puppy ever.</i>

334
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,989
<i>We're gonna launch it
at the pet convention in Las Vegas!</i>

335
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,435
<i>Watch out, world!</i>

336
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,195
<i>It's gonna crush the competition!</i>

337
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,269
- Yay!
- No, Jimbo.

338
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,636
No "Yay"! We are the competition!

339
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,120
This is war.

340
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,715
Puppies are winning, and babies are losing.

341
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,711
Thank you, Teddy.

342
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,951
And if this new puppy
is as cute as we fear...

343
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,635
it could put the baby business
out of business, baby.

344
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,790
That's awful!

345
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,871
Bad news, baby!

346
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,394
What are we going to do?

347
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,870
My job is to find out exactly what
that new puppy is...

348
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,713
so that Baby Corp can stop it.

349
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,234
And you're going to help me.

350
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,151
- Genius!
- Home run!

351
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,276
You still got it, boss!

352
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,191
Yay!

353
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,111
Yay.

354
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,158
Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co.

355
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,471
So have you learned anything from them?

356
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,915
- Yes, sir!
- Sure did!

357
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,196
Fantastic. Triplets, go!

358
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,157
- A.
- B.

359
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,197
- C.
- D.

360
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,591
No, what have you learned
about the new puppy?

361
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,916
Yay, puppy!

362
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,799
No, Jimbo! Puppies are evil.

363
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,235
Staci, read back the notes.

364
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,960
I can't read. What's it say?

365
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,953
This is my team?

366
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,840
A muscle-head, a bunch of yes men,
and a doodler?

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,797
- Exactly!
- Affirmative!

368
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,632
Good call.

369
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,756
- <i>Oh, yeah!</i>
- <i>Nice one, BB!</i>

370
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,990
Gotcha!

371
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,200
Put that cookie down.
Cookies are for closers.

372
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,874
- <i>Let's have another show!</i>
- No, Teddy!

373
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,759
- <i>How about a hug?</i>
- No more shows!

374
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,512
Boss?

375
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,149
- <i>There's plenty of love to go around.</i>
- Go to sleep!

376
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,356
<i>Nighty-night.</i>

377
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,351
- Boss!
- Boss!

378
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,476
- What?
- Parents!

379
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,158
It's like they're having their own
little meeting.

380
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,398
- Isn't that adorable?
- Who wants dessert?

381
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,635
God, this is so humiliating.

382
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,359
<i>God, this is so humiliating.</i>

383
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,040
Wait until Mom and Dad hear this.

384
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,956
Hey, Templeton, what you got there?

385
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,035
Nothing.

386
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,520
Hand over the tape.

387
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,790
Never!

388
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,991
Mom! Dad! Over here!

389
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,356
- Hi, Timmy!
- Hi! Anyway...

390
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,076
<i>Flower power!</i>

391
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,640
<i>You can't get away from Johnny Law,
simpleton.</i>

392
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,035
<i>Fasten your seat belt. Let's go!</i>

393
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,830
Run, run, run.

394
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,550
What? Hey!

395
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,630
Uh-oh.

396
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,789
Run, run, run.

397
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,474
Catch, catch, catch.

398
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,871
Yes!

399
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,717
Oh, yeah!

400
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,159
Let go, you little...

401
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,437
Oh, look! The kids are finally getting along.

402
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,915
That's nice.

403
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,870
Sayonara!

404
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,270
You wanna play?

405
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,830
Let's play.

406
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,599
No!

407
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,116
Save Boss! Save Boss!

408
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,590
- Get him!
- I got him!

409
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,750
- I got him!
- I got him!

410
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,073
You're toast, baby man!

411
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,232
Upsies, I need upsies!

412
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,320
Who wants...

413
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,596
Cheese sticks!

414
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,831
Mom, Dad! I've got proof!

415
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,352
Someone can't go down the stairs?

416
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,911
Nothing can stop me!

417
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,034
Mom! Dad! Where are you guys?

418
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,190
Hello?

419
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,754
Where did everyone go?

420
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,676
Mom, Dad! The baby can talk!

421
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,513
Oh, can he now?

422
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,955
Wait, how did you...

423
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,315
Hand over the tape, Timmy.

424
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,960
Or Lam-Lam gets it, see?

425
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,791
No!

426
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,236
What's that, Lam-Lam? You want a nose ring?

427
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,279
It's really not my scene,
but who am I to judge?

428
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,477
And an eyebrow ring?
Seems like a little too much, Lam-Lam.

429
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,878
How's that gonna look in a job interview?

430
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,871
Stop it!

431
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,952
The tape, Timmy! Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip.

432
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,236
No! Let go!

433
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,390
- You let go!
- You let go!

434
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,880
- Give me the tape!
- Give me Lam-Lam!

435
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,953
Whoops! Too far.

436
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,079
Templeton! Templeton, let's be reasonable.

437
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,118
We can be reasonable, right?
What are you doing?

438
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,237
You've been asking for this
since you got here!

439
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,113
We can talk about this over a juice box!

440
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,834
Time for juice boxes is over.

441
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,310
No, Templeton. You wouldn't.

442
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,597
Say bye-bye, baby! You're fired!

443
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,511
What are you doing?

444
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,670
Nothing.

445
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,830
My proof!

446
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,679
Tim! Explain yourself!

447
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,956
Yes, explain yourself.

448
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,759
It wasn't me! It was the baby's fault.

449
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,030
The baby's fault?

450
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,953
It's true! He can talk.

451
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,757
They all can talk.
They were having a meeting.

452
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,036
There's something about puppies.

453
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,351
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!

454
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,193
Timothy Leslie Templeton!

455
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,840
We are very disappointed in you.

456
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,356
- No, we're mad at you!
- Exactly, we're mad at you.

457
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,119
- Mad?
- You need a time-out!

458
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,999
- You're grounded!
- Yes, grounded!

459
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,150
- For two...
- Three!

460
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,356
- Three days?
- Weeks!

461
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,749
Weeks! Three weeks!

462
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,752
For three... evers!

463
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,671
Grounded?

464
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,560
You're gonna stay in this house
with your baby brother...

465
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,030
until you learn to get along.

466
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,310
Great.

467
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,479
<i>It was my first time behind bars.</i>

468
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,313
<i>The big house.</i>

469
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,800
<i>The lock-up.</i>

470
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,033
<i>Grounded for life.</i>

471
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,236
<i>The minutes turned into hours,
the hours into days.</i>

472
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,232
<i>Every man has his breaking point.</i>

473
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,280
<i>This was mine.</i>

474
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,878
<i>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</i>

475
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,070
- <i>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</i>
- Hey, that's my song.

476
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,996
<i>All your life</i>

477
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,039
<i>You were only waiting
For this moment to arise</i>

478
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,592
It's okay, little halfling.

479
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,355
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

480
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,914
Blackbird singing in the dead of night!

481
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,592
Pray, take these broken wings
and learn to fly!

482
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,353
Fly, you fools!

483
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,636
Thanks, Wizzie.

484
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,039
But it's not the same.

485
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
If only I could reach my magical shank.

486
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,469
I could break us out of this big house.

487
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,150
Templeton!

488
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,119
Templeton, we have to talk.

489
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,310
Go away.

490
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,071
<i>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</i>

491
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,797
Stop it!

492
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,559
That's my song, not yours.

493
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,518
My parents wrote it just for me.

494
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,956
Really?
Your parents are Lennon and McCartney?

495
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,351
No, Ted and Janice.

496
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,840
You don't even know their names!

497
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,559
You're just trying to steal them from me.

498
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,955
You stole everything!

499
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,793
You're the one who should be in jail!

500
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,873
Look, it's time we put our differences aside.

501
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,236
Have you been...

502
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,430
No!

503
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,954
Where's HR when you need them?

504
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,951
Take it.

505
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,839
I don't want your filthy money.

506
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,151
Look, I told you to stay out of my way.

507
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,152
I can't! You're in my house.

508
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,470
I don't wanna be here...

509
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,279
any more than you want me to be here.

510
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,312
Then why are you torturing me?

511
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,949
The truth is I'm no ordinary baby.

512
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,997
Well, no kidding.

513
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,317
I'm on a mission from above.

514
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,676
Are you the Baby Jesus?

515
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,436
Yes. I'm the Baby Jesus.

516
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,396
No!

517
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,995
You see, I'm more middle management
for the company.

518
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,117
The company? What company?

519
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,270
Here.

520
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,197
Take this. It'll explain everything.

521
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,953
What do you want me to do with that?

522
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,512
- I want you to suck it.
- You suck it!

523
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,517
No, it's for you to suck.

524
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,676
I'm not sucking that!

525
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,320
- Suck it.
- I don't know where it's been!

526
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,359
It's not where it's been.
It's where it will take you.

527
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,550
Don't you wanna know...

528
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,598
where babies really come from?

529
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,600
Binky. Papish. Nuk-Nuk.

530
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,956
Boo-Boo. Bo-Bo. Bah-Bah.

531
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,430
Chupie. Hushie-Baby. Tootsie.

532
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,637
It goes by many names.

533
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,759
But through its power,
you will know the truth.

534
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,671
Come on, faster!

535
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,871
Mommy!

536
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,949
Where are we?

537
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,476
Welcome to Baby Corp!

538
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,875
No way.

539
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,309
- Thank you.
- What?

540
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,471
Relax. They can't see us or hear us.

541
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,552
- We're, like, virtual and stuff?
- Yep.

542
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,313
- You mean they won't feel this?
- Nope.

543
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,630
- Or this?
- Nada.

544
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,751
Karate!

545
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,515
Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton.
I can still see you.

546
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,598
So this is where babies come from?

547
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,877
Where'd you think, the cabbage patch?

548
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,996
Magic fairies?

549
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,197
No, my parents told me that...

550
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,555
What?

551
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,757
No. That's disgusting.

552
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,151
Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either.

553
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,390
I can't believe
my parents didn't tell me about this.

554
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,837
If people knew where babies really came from,
they'd never have one.

555
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,719
Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.

556
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
<i>Going upsies!</i>

557
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,353
So how come I don't remember this place?

558
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,351
You did.

559
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,751
But after normal babies
get their pacifiers taken away...

560
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,872
you forget all about Baby Corp.

561
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,360
How come you're not normal?

562
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,751
A few of us, the best of the best...

563
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,513
are selected for the...

564
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,953
For the ultimate honor.

565
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,559
Upper management.

566
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,191
This, Templeton, is where all the action is.

567
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,716
<i>Nap time in Sector G.</i>

568
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,278
So this whole place is run by babies?

569
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,391
Yep.

570
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,711
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."

571
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,314
"And those who can't, supervise."

572
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,789
Your father is a hippy.

573
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,914
What happens when you grow up?

574
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,917
We don't.

575
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,397
We drink a super-secret baby formula
that keeps us babies forever.

576
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,709
Back to work! Formula break is over!

577
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,320
We're in a crisis here!

578
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,994
Don't you know we're in a crisis here?

579
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,071
Who is that?

580
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,800
That is my boss. Big Boss Baby.

581
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,917
What is she screaming about?

582
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,480
Well, see this pie chart?

583
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,957
Wow, it looks like a giant pie.

584
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,589
It represents all the love there is
in the world.

585
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,989
- I love pie.
- Who doesn't?

586
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,991
- Apple.
- Fine.

587
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,071
- No, cherry!
- Perfect!

588
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,117
- Not pumpkin.
- Okay.

589
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,077
That's a vegetable.

590
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,836
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.

591
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,599
They're stealing all our love!

592
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,754
Just like you did to me.

593
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,910
Exactly.

594
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,113
And if this keeps up...

595
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,795
there might not be enough pie left
for babies.

596
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,916
No pie?

597
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,759
No pie.

598
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,274
So, my mission is to find out
what this new puppy is.

599
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,432
So you're, like, on a spy mission? Cool!

600
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,280
Yes! Cool! And if... When I succeed...

601
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,830
I'll become a Baby Corp legend.

602
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,640
Like Super Big Boss Baby, Mega Boss Baby...

603
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,632
Seriously Big Boss Baby...

604
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,390
and him.

605
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,120
Now that's a big, fat baby.

606
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,712
No, that's Big Fat Boss Baby.

607
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,635
This is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby.

608
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,157
He was the youngest Chief Executive Infant
in the history of the company.

609
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,993
Was? What happened to him?

610
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,799
Retired, years ago.

611
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,992
But I still try and live up to his legend.

612
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,833
In every situation, I ask myself...

613
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,992
"W-W-S-C-B-F-B-B-D?

614
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,320
"What Would Super Colossal
Big Fat Boss Baby Do?"

615
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,879
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?

616
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,315
Come here!

617
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,076
I'll get a promotion.

618
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,197
The corner office...

619
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,192
with my own private potty.

620
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,749
Wow.

621
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,355
So when you're done, you're coming back here?

622
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,079
A-S-A-P, T-i-m.

623
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,835
I'm not a family man. I belong behind a desk.

624
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,832
- That's awesome!
- I know, right?

625
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,510
- Pew pew.
- What?

626
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,196
So help me,
I will nail his diaper to the wall!

627
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,511
Have we heard anything
from that little Boss Baby...

628
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,194
that we sent down to the Templetons?

629
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,919
- I don't know.
- You're fired!

630
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,877
Oh, no.

631
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,190
You're all fired!

632
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,192
The pet convention is in two days.

633
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,874
If he doesn't come up with answers...

634
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,599
he is fired, retired!

635
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,513
- Gone!
- Tour's over.

636
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,876
What was Big Bossy Baby Lady screaming about?

637
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,271
She's demanding actual results.

638
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,353
The pet convention is in two days,
and I've got nothing!

639
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,395
That's her! Don't answer it!

640
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,870
Stress nap!

641
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,436
If I don't find out
what that new puppy is and fast...

642
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,239
not only will I not get that promotion...

643
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,629
I could get fired!

644
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,396
Hey, relax.

645
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,756
I'm sure there's other cool jobs
for babies, right?

646
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,077
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.

647
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,310
You better start packing.

648
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,152
What?

649
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,920
You don't get it, Templeton.

650
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,595
If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.

651
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,672
I will turn into a normal baby...

652
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,593
and live here forever with you.

653
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,035
- No!
- Yes!

654
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,919
And I promise you this...

655
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,515
Every morning you wake up...

656
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,239
I'll be there.

657
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,520
<i>Every night, at dinner...</i>

658
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,559
I'll be there.

659
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,393
<i>Every birthday party...</i>

660
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,552
<i>I'll be there.</i>

661
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,200
<i>Every Christmas!</i>

662
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,510
<i>I'll be there</i>

663
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,240
Year after year after year.

664
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,232
We will grow old together.

665
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,680
<i>You and I...</i>

666
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,352
will be brothers.

667
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,957
Always.

668
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,191
- No. No, this is terrible!
- I know.

669
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,033
- This can't be happening.
- But it is!

670
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,270
- You can't stay here!
- I can't!

671
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,073
- Don't panic!
- But it feels right!

672
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,072
I know, but we have to fix this.

673
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,792
We have to make sure you don't get fired.

674
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,632
We?

675
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,312
We.

676
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,755
I will help you...

677
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,149
but just to get rid of you.

678
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,549
Deal?

679
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,271
Deal.

680
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,079
Here's to never seeing you again.

681
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,720
Back at ya, baby.

682
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,593
Now let's get to work.

683
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,319
Come on, come on, come on.

684
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,638
Slice!

685
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
No, no.

686
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,311
There's nothing here about a new puppy.

687
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,834
Aren't you gonna do any work?

688
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm very busy delegating.

689
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,230
He drains it!

690
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,872
So once we find the file on the new puppy...

691
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,030
what do we do then?

692
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,759
Send in the baby ninjas?

693
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,910
Even better.

694
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,833
I'm going to write the perfect memo.

695
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,195
- Boom!
- Boom!

696
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,631
Wait. What's a memo?

697
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,032
A memo is something you write
to give people information.

698
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,675
That's your plan?
You're gonna write a book report?

699
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,513
That's so boring.

700
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,909
No, Templeton.

701
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,680
Memos are for important things.

702
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,275
A memo can bring people together.

703
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,955
A memo can be a call to arms...

704
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,635
a manifesto, a poem.

705
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,560
A memo can change the world.

706
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,319
Wow! When you explain it like that...

707
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,119
it still sounds boring.

708
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,120
You'll learn, kid.

709
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,270
You'll learn.

710
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,637
Wait a second. This is it!

711
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,120
What? What is it?

712
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,715
Check this out. Take Your Kid to Work Day.

713
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,396
People take children
to a place of business? Why?

714
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,960
Because it's awesome!

715
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,117
It's disgusting.

716
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,397
Don't you see? We can get inside Puppy Co...

717
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,119
and find out what the new puppy is!

718
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,236
What's the point?

719
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,836
You're grounded.

720
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,077
Your parents aren't
going to take us anywhere.

721
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,592
You're right. They think we hate each other.

722
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,393
Hate is a strong word.

723
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,040
It's the right word, but still.

724
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,077
We have to convince them
that we're actual brothers.

725
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,111
Right.

726
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,839
That we...

727
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,190
Loathe?

728
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,350
No.

729
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,357
Like!

730
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,835
No. That we...

731
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,759
La, la, la...

732
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,195
Le, Le, Le...

733
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,196
No.

734
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,716
No way. No. You don't mean...

735
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,879
Love each other.

736
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,191
I just threw up a noodle and swallowed it.

737
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,600
- Here comes the choo-choo train!
- No.

738
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,750
- Choo, choo, chugga, chugga.
- No choo-choo!

739
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,873
Hold the train! No!
It looks like it's already been eaten!

740
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,474
Who's there? I got a racket!

741
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,915
What's going on in here?

742
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,719
I'm just feeding the baby.

743
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,829
They're watching.

744
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,155
Choo-choo.

745
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,112
Okay.

746
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,590
Choo-choo on that.

747
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,800
I don't wear nautical. It's not even Friday!

748
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,599
Come on, you're putting this thing on!

749
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,877
You gonna make me? You can't make me, punk.

750
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,120
- What have you done to me?
- Stop!

751
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,634
- Get back here!
- No!

752
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,190
No way.

753
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,270
Come on!

754
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,953
Tim, what are you doing in here?

755
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,076
Oh, no.

756
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,276
Hey, what's all the racket?

757
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,554
Isn't he adorable?

758
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,718
I've got one for you, too! Ahoy, matey!

759
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,711
What?

760
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,631
Bummer.

761
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,836
<i>Smile!</i>

762
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,593
Smile for the camera.

763
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,479
It makes me feel weak.

764
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,677
- Who's ticklish?
- It doesn't work on me.

765
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,956
- Here?
- I'm dead down there.

766
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,873
Come on, everyone has a tickle spot.

767
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,231
"'I don't think I'll fit,' said Gretel."

768
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,957
Come here, look at this.

769
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,152
"'I could get in myself.'

770
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,913
"And then, Hansel and Gretel...

771
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,555
"pushed the wicked old woman into the oven.

772
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,270
"And the godless witch
was miserably burnt to death."

773
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,069
Let me get this straight.

774
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,358
The story is about cannibalism
and burning people alive.

775
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,271
Yeah.

776
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,477
No wonder kids are so messed up!

777
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,831
Getting along is exhausting.

778
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,911
Back at ya, Tim.

779
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,072
You should have seen your face
in that picture.

780
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,276
You were all...

781
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,673
I'm not used to being tickled.

782
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,435
Once at a corporate retreat.
But those things always get weird.

783
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,877
What? You've never been tickled?
What about your parents?

784
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,834
I'm sorry. I forgot.

785
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,869
You didn't have parents, did you?

786
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,436
Tim, I may look like a baby...

787
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,957
but I was born all grown up.

788
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,829
I can't even imagine not being a kid.

789
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,196
You missed out on your whole childhood?

790
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,876
You never had someone to love you?

791
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,156
You can't miss what you never had.

792
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,599
<i>Wake up, little halflings!</i>

793
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,513
Hey, Tim. Wake up, buddy.

794
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,433
- What?
- Rise and shine!

795
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,954
Is something wrong? Am I fired?

796
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,954
No, you're late for work.

797
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,951
What?

798
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,191
It's Take Your Kid to Work Day!
And you're the kid.

799
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,113
You're officially un-grounded.

800
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,634
- Really?
- Really.

801
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,475
Can the baby come, too?

802
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,790
I don't see why not.

803
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,270
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

804
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,797
Yeah!

805
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,553
I wish I was that excited for work.

806
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
Look, it's my spatula.

807
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,155
Yeah, baby.

808
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,510
All right, gentlemen. Welcome to Puppy Co.

809
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,558
Wow! This is awesome!

810
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,551
And Tim, look!

811
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,119
They have a puppy pool and everything!

812
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,509
Isn't that sanitary?

813
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,070
Hey, bud, you wanna get a picture
with Puppy Co Pete?

814
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,350
No, thanks.
It's probably too scary for the baby.

815
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,397
Nice call.

816
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,037
Your dad and I have some work to do.

817
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,556
You wanna come up to the office
and hang out with us?

818
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,552
We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone...

819
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,552
while we have a little Tim time.

820
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,950
Tim time?

821
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,477
Dad and I know we haven't been able
to do as much with you as we used to.

822
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,233
So, what do you say?

823
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,111
No, thanks.

824
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,953
I'd rather spend time with the baby.

825
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,680
- So cute.
- That's so sweet.

826
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,872
Way to keep your eyes on the prize,
Templeton.

827
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,635
We find out what the new puppy is,
and I go home.

828
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,238
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?

829
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,914
Okay, bye!

830
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,796
That's where we'll find
the secret file on the new puppy.

831
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,400
We'll never get through that door.

832
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,960
No, not that door.

833
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,596
The doggy door.

834
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,957
But how do we get past the guard?

835
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,316
No, no, no. No way.

836
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,311
No!

837
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,109
Itchy, plushy, puppy pants!

838
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,790
What a cute, little pup...

839
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,950
Ow!

840
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,631
Yay!

841
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,790
Kids.

842
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,960
Get down.

843
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,638
All the way down.

844
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,319
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.

845
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,470
Arf!

846
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,670
Hey!

847
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,556
Fetch!

848
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,153
What am I doing?

849
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,391
Oh, no!

850
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,510
Yes!

851
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,510
What a good boy.

852
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,400
No. No biting.

853
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,669
Timothy Templeton, office ninja.

854
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,838
- Over here.
- What is it?

855
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,160
It's gotta be in here.

856
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,160
It's begging us to go in.

857
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,557
Wow.

858
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,598
That's a lot of paperwork.

859
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,038
I thought puppies shredded everything.

860
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,073
This is getting creepy.

861
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,839
I've come for your soul.

862
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,877
Cut it out!

863
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,235
Wait!

864
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,590
That's it!

865
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,671
The file!

866
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,519
See! I was right.

867
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,354
No. I've seen this before somewhere.

868
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,557
We've gotta find something
to replace it with.

869
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,598
You're right. Like another file.

870
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,234
Yes! A file with the same weight.

871
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,631
So it can be placed
in the exact same position.

872
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,917
- With the exact same weight.
- You already said that.

873
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,754
I know I said it. Hey, you hit me twice.

874
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,639
Make it a third time. Wait!

875
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,359
I think I've seen one here.

876
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,030
Smead manila, pressboard edges.

877
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,431
About 50 ounces. No, 49.

878
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,556
Try this one.

879
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,077
Wait!

880
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,276
Now it's perfect.

881
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,310
Yes!

882
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,479
I feel like we should run.

883
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,360
I know, but it's just so mesmerizing.

884
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,440
I kind of wanna see how it ends.

885
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,477
Yeah, me too.

886
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,633
Well, that didn't end well.

887
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,550
What?

888
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,717
What the...?

889
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,192
Thanks for dropping in, kids.

890
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,794
Francis Francis?

891
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,270
I see you've met my big brother, Eugene.

892
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,994
A man of few words.

893
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,990
None, in fact.

894
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,629
Can you put your head back on, please?

895
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,354
What is all this?

896
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,795
Surprise!

897
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,680
A Baby Corp binky? Where did you get that?

898
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,238
You don't recognize me?

899
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,234
Perhaps from my youth!

900
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,152
Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?

901
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,354
He is him? And him is you?

902
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,354
Except older and wrinklier.

903
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,149
That's not right.

904
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,312
No. You were my hero!

905
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,239
How did you end up here?

906
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,078
You know what I do to little kids
who ask lots of questions about me?

907
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,515
Eugene!

908
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,232
I read them my story.

909
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,712
And, I baked cookies!

910
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,434
Eugene, my chair.

911
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,277
Now, it all started at Baby Corp...

912
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,875
a long, long time ago.

913
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,350
I was a hotshot executive...

914
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,239
headed straight to the top.

915
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,710
Everyone loved me.

916
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,190
They gave me a promotion,
the corner office...

917
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,714
my very own...

918
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,950
Personal potty?

919
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,917
I had it all.

920
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,070
But then one day...

921
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,397
I made a terrible discovery.

922
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,791
I was getting old.

923
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,713
The formula wasn't working anymore.

924
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,078
It turns out I was lactose intolerant.

925
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,430
- No!
- Yes!

926
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,559
I got called in
to see the board of directors.

927
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,120
Who are the boring directors?

928
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,715
The biggest baby bosses of them all.

929
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,599
I thought they loved me.

930
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,400
But they replaced me with someone new.

931
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,600
Someone younger.

932
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,080
That's horrible.

933
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,960
All of a sudden, she got all the love...

934
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,793
all the attention.

935
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,794
You know how that feels, don't you, Tim?

936
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,792
It hurts, doesn't it?

937
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,996
Yeah. It does.

938
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,200
And then what happened?

939
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,870
Well...

940
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,634
They fired me!

941
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,874
And took away my special formula.

942
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,953
Then they sent me down to live with a...

943
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,319
- family!
- Oh, Francis, no!

944
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,153
Baby Corp betrayed me!

945
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,677
And I'm finally going to get revenge...

946
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,911
with the Forever Puppy.

947
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,230
- Huh?
- That's it?

948
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,356
No, no.

949
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,671
Imagine a puppy that never grows up.

950
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,556
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

951
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,151
Once I launch my Forever Puppies
to every corner of the world...

952
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,840
they'll be so adorable...

953
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,320
<i>How cute!</i>

954
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,197
...no one will ever want a baby
ever, ever again.

955
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,149
The end of Baby Corp!

956
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,390
Please.

957
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,359
A puppy that never grows up?
That's impossible!

958
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,911
Isn't it?

959
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,877
It was, until you brought me
the key ingredient.

960
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,718
My secret formula.

961
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,673
It's mine! It's mine!

962
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,678
It's all mine.

963
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,518
No!

964
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,390
You brought me the very thing I needed
to destroy Baby Corp.

965
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,914
- No!
- Yes!

966
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,079
You walked right into my trap!

967
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,072
- You'll never get away with this!
- Yeah, not if we...

968
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,720
What? Tell?

969
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,076
Who are you gonna tell, Tim? Your parents?

970
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,230
<i>Where are the boys?</i>

971
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,079
<i>I told them to stay in the Puppy Zone.</i>

972
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,391
I'm taking them both with me to Las Vegas.

973
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,552
So stay out of my way.

974
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,270
I'd hate for them to get terminated.

975
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,280
They'd never leave us alone.

976
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,476
Oh, really?

977
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,875
Wait until they meet Puppy Co's certified...

978
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,232
in-house childcare expert.

979
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,314
Oh, no.

980
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,551
- Don't be nervous, buddy.
- It's only overnight.

981
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,080
We'll be back before you know it.

982
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,311
Besides, you boys are in great hands.

983
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,115
That's right!

984
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,796
Eugenia is practically perfect in every way.

985
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,757
No.

986
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,754
Please don't go with him.
Francis Francis is trying to...

987
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,070
Believe me...

988
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,920
Eugenia won't take her eyes
off your children.

989
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,151
Not for one second.

990
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,993
That's very reassuring.

991
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,432
Now you see them.

992
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,191
And now, you don't.

993
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,476
Too-da-loo!

994
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,109
To the airport!

995
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,871
It's over. I'm through.

996
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,156
What do we do, Templeton?

997
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,197
What do we do?

998
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,756
We have to get to the airport
and stop Francis Francis...

999
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,354
before the plane takes off!

1000
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,319
Yes! But how do we get past
Scary Poppins down there?

1001
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,358
Okay. There must be something we can do.

1002
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,674
Hey, it's not that bad.

1003
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,271
Are you okay?

1004
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,750
What's the matter with you?

1005
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,000
Don't look at me!

1006
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,872
Oh, no!

1007
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,152
Without that formula,
I turn into a normal baby.

1008
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,960
You know, goo-goo, Ga-ga. The whole bit!

1009
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,110
Oh, no!

1010
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,277
Gross!

1011
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,315
I'm a ticking baby time bomb!

1012
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,918
I'm going to turn into a puking,
pooping, helpless baby!

1013
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,074
Wait a second. That gives me an idea.

1014
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,356
What? What is it?

1015
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,557
I've been through a lot of babysitters...

1016
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,916
and they all fear one thing.

1017
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,998
<i>Now, ladies,
the secret to deep fried butter...</i>

1018
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,720
<i>is a healthy dab of margarine.</i>

1019
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,833
Hey, Mr. Lady Man!

1020
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,558
The baby. I think he's sick!

1021
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,719
You gotta do something!

1022
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,959
Oh, the horror!

1023
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,997
- Templeton!
- <i>Delicious!</i>

1024
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,720
Gross! It got in your mouth!

1025
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,398
It got in my mouth, too!

1026
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,120
I think I'm gonna be sick!

1027
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,711
Swirly!

1028
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,797
There's only an hour
before the plane takes off.

1029
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,390
Let's take the bike.

1030
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,755
The bike?

1031
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,715
I don't know.

1032
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,037
Let's move!

1033
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,276
- Okay, but wait right here!
- What?

1034
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,840
Where are you going? Templeton!

1035
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,400
Always wear a helmet.

1036
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,399
Too-da-loo, toilet head!

1037
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,589
You'll never catch us!

1038
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,557
Staci!

1039
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,915
<i>Staci, come in!</i>

1040
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,074
Oh, Staci!

1041
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,959
- Is that you, boss?
- <i>Code red!</i>

1042
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,430
I'm being chased by a killer babysitter!
Gather the team!

1043
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,510
On it, boss.

1044
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,877
- <i>Hello!</i>
- <i>Hello!</i>

1045
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,269
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Code red.

1046
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,032
<i>Got it!</i>

1047
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,835
<i>We got a code red. Repeat...</i>

1048
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,195
<i>We got a code red!</i>

1049
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,513
What are you doing, Templeton? Go, go!

1050
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,796
But that's jaywalking!

1051
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,990
Here, I'll pay your ticket.

1052
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,150
Go!

1053
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,230
I think we lost him!

1054
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,473
Oh, no, we didn't!

1055
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,960
<i>Flower power!</i>

1056
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,914
Pow, pow, pow!

1057
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,350
That's my boy!

1058
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,389
Poppy!

1059
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,709
Run, run, run.

1060
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,277
Uh-oh.

1061
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,914
Run, run, run.

1062
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,153
Tim, you've gotta go faster!

1063
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,640
I can't do it!

1064
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,069
You can.

1065
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,311
You've got it in you, Templeton.
Now, eyes ahead.

1066
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,709
I said eyes ahead, son!

1067
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,031
Buttocks up! Now pedal like you mean it!

1068
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,238
Either you run the day, or the day runs you.

1069
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,717
Good!

1070
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,630
Uh-oh!

1071
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,110
My training wheels!
I can't ride without training wheels!

1072
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,398
Whether you think you can
or you think you can't, you're right!

1073
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,710
What are you talking about?

1074
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,440
The path to success
is not a straight line, Templeton...

1075
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,080
but rather a wild ride...

1076
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,236
like a ship at sea.

1077
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,720
And you're a sea captain...

1078
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,599
taming a turbulent ocean!

1079
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,271
I'm a sea captain, taming the ocean!

1080
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,071
Good!

1081
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,913
Tree! I'm gonna hit it!

1082
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,037
Aim for failure, and you'll always succeed.

1083
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,600
- What?
- Aim away from failure!

1084
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,793
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1085
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,872
Once success is a habit...

1086
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,360
then it's all downhill.

1087
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,156
Look!

1088
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,720
There they are! Mom, Dad!

1089
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,150
- Train!
- Choo-choo!

1090
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,911
Stop!

1091
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,354
What are you doing?

1092
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,597
- We're gonna make it.
- But I don't have a quote for this!

1093
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,710
You did it!

1094
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,837
No! We did it.

1095
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,476
And all without your training wheels.

1096
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,396
Coming through!

1097
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,710
Baby on board!

1098
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,996
Hang on to your diaper!

1099
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,800
Duck and cover!

1100
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,590
Hold it, buddy!

1101
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,353
I'm gonna need a strip search on two.

1102
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,992
There they are! Mom, Dad!

1103
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,230
Hey, not so fast!

1104
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,430
Oh, no.

1105
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,550
Templeton!

1106
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,154
- Hey!
- Sorry!

1107
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,556
Hey, where'd you go?

1108
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,671
Oh, no!

1109
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,956
Not again!

1110
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,270
Not now!

1111
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,836
What the...?

1112
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,317
No, no, no!

1113
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,636
Come on!

1114
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,632
I think I ate $1.75.

1115
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,032
Excuse me, coming through! Mom, Dad!

1116
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,916
Hurry now! Move!

1117
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,070
We don't wanna miss our flight!

1118
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,873
- No!
- I warned you!

1119
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,710
Wait!

1120
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,469
- No!
- No.

1121
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,438
Mom, Dad! Stop!

1122
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,231
No!

1123
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,152
No, no, no.

1124
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,959
They're gone.

1125
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,670
I failed.

1126
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,073
I would've gotten to my parents
if I didn't have to go back for you!

1127
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,596
What? We would have been here
in plenty of time...

1128
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,672
if you knew how to ride a bike
like a normal kid!

1129
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,957
We're never going to stop the launch on time.

1130
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,237
Who cares? My parents are in danger.

1131
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,000
I care! Baby Corp is going to go
out of business.

1132
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,995
That's all you ever talk about.

1133
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,635
You don't even know what it's like
to be part of a family.

1134
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,678
And you don't know what it's like
to have a job!

1135
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,312
You don't know anything about hugs,
or bedtime stories, or special songs!

1136
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,949
Oh, please! Stop acting like a baby.

1137
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,110
You're a baby!

1138
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,870
You take that back.

1139
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,111
My life was perfect until you showed up!

1140
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,432
Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual.
I wish I'd never met you!

1141
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,114
I wish you'd never been born!

1142
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,554
Where are you going?

1143
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,030
Fine!

1144
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,831
<i>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</i>

1145

<i>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</i>

1146
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,236

<i>Would Timothy Templeton please pick up
the white courtesy phone?</i>

1149
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,517
<i>Timothy Leslie Templeton,
please pick up the white courtesy phone.</i>

1150
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,080
<i>Leslie.</i>

1151
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,671
Hello?

1152
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,991
<i>It's me. Don't hang up, Tim!</i>

1153
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,550
<i>Tim, I wasn't born. I was hired.</i>

1154
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,995
What do you mean?

1155
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,669
Baby Corp is the only home I've ever known.

1156
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,670
So you're right.
I don't know what it's like...

1157
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,200
<i>to be part of a family.</i>

1158
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,954
<i>But I do care.</i>

1159
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,190
You do?

1160
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,510
<i>Yeah.</i>

1161
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,634
<i>And the only way to save both
is to stop Francis Francis.</i>

1162
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,631
Yeah.

1163
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,632
<i>I can't do this without you, Tim.</i>

1164
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,120
<i>I need you.</i>

1165
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,034
- I guess we do make a pretty good team.
- <i>No.</i>

1166
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,478
<i>Literally, I can't reach the door knobs.</i>

1167
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,869
Oh, right.

1168
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,954
Don't worry, Tim.

1169
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,793
We're gonna save your parents.

1170
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,233
And your company.

1171
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,758
But how do we get to Vegas now?

1172
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,071
We're gonna need a miracle.

1173
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,595
Follow that Elvis!

1174
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,790
Why?

1175
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,999
Where there's Elvis, there's Vegas!

1176
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,230
There's another one!

1177
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,390
And another one!

1178
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,229
Elvises everywhere!

1179
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,672
Tim, there's our flight!

1180
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,309
And there goes our ticket!

1181
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,760
Hey! Don't be cruel!

1182
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,070
Sorry!

1183
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,080
- Well, thank you!
- Oh, baby!

1184
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,475
Well, thank you very much.

1185
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,630
Hello.

1186
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,919
Hi.

1187
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,839
Ticket please.

1188
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,280
One moment.

1189
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,590
It's been stolen!

1190
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,076
Impersonating an Elvis impersonator?

1191
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:27,760
Get him!

1192
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,876
Humina, humina, humina.

1193
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:30,952
Stop!

1194
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,270
The ghost of Elvis!

1195
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,836
We gotta find seats!

1196
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,116
Come on, this way!

1197
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,635
What is this place?

1198
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,998
This, Templeton, is first class.

1199
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,316
Why is it empty?

1200
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,800
No one can afford it.

1201
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,078
That's what makes it so wonderful.

1202
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,632
<i>Hello! This is Captain Ross.</i>

1203
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,792
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach...</i>

1204
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,913
<i>please fasten your seat belts.
We're about to take off.</i>

1205
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,520
What's the matter, Templeton?

1206
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,314
My parents always hold my hand
during takeoff.

1207
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,595
Boy, the stocks are crazy today.

1208
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,078
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again.</i>

1209
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,192
<i>As you can see,
I've switched off the seat belt sign.</i>

1210
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,272
What are you two boys doing up here?

1211
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,513
We're Captain Ross's kids.

1212
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,034
He told us to sit here.

1213
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,394
Well, can I get you special guys anything?

1214
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,550
Anything?

1215
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,074
Anything.

1216
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,952
Aye! All right, Francis Francis.

1217
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,760
This will teach you
to kidnap the parents of One-Eyed Tim.

1218
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,111
Oh, please. If only it were that easy.

1219
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,555
What's your plan?

1220
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,234
You're not gonna write a memo, are you?

1221
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,391
No.

1222
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,076
Come on. You said you never really
had a childhood, right?

1223
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,390
Why don't you give it a try?

1224
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,880
- No, I can't.
- It's fun!

1225
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,759
Here, let's get you into character.

1226
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,400
I don't know. I feel silly!

1227
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,313
Go on! Say something mean to him.

1228
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,755
All right, all right, all right.

1229
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,237
So, you went to a community college, is it?

1230
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,231
I don't know.

1231
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,231
Keep going!

1232
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,996
And you have the guts
to ask me for a bonus, now?

1233
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,551
See!

1234
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,120
Now you're getting into it.

1235
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,236
Huh?

1236
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,232
Well, blow me down.

1237
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,551
Your exit interview is over!

1238
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,156
That was pretty good.

1239
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,590
Who was that guy anyway?

1240
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,319
- The captain!
- What?

1241
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,310
En garde!

1242
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,990
Heave!

1243
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,630
Ho!

1244
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,676
Thar she blows!

1245
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,600
Watch your stern!

1246
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,000
- Aye!
- Dodge, parry, and thrust!

1247
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,514
Sounds like a heck of a law firm!

1248
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,637
Nice try! Heads up!

1249
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,793
You're fired!

1250
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,429
And here's your severance package. Ha!

1251
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,109
Wait. You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

1252
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,111
You're not?

1253
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,792
You're supposed to end with "Argh!"

1254
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,314
Got it! Argh!

1255
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,516
That's great!

1256
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,478
Thanks! I just went with the flow.

1257
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,711
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach...</i>

1258
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,314
<i>on the left side of the plane...</i>

1259
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,951
<i>you can see we're approaching
fabulous Las Vegas.</i>

1260
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,870
Land ho!

1261
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,480
Ahoy, matey.

1262
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,515
Bye, Dad! Thanks for the lift!

1263
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,154
- Okay. What?
- Let's move.

1264
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,357
- Going to the Heartbreak Hotel?
- I'm going to the Heartbreak Hotel.

1265
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,397
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

1266
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,397
Me, too!

1267
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,599
We've gotta get to the convention center.

1268
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,035
Should we get a taxi?

1269
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,432
Darn! I spent all my per Diem.
That's more our speed.

1270
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,757
Right.

1271
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,872
Excuse me, ladies.

1272
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,840
Can we get a ride home?

1273
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,516
Jimmy's been sick,
and he needs his expensive medicine.

1274
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,274
Where do you live, sweetie?

1275
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,955
The convention center.

1276
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,434
Bye, sweetie!

1277
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,034
Have a fun lady party!

1278
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,634
Chicks dig babies.

1279
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,274
The people of Long Island do not know
how to make an iced tea.

1280
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,032
Oh, no! How are we gonna find my parents
in here?

1281
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,951
Tim!

1282
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,110
Over there.

1283
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,880
Okay, now where's Puppy Co?

1284
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,032
Puppy Co, Puppy Co, Puppy Co...

1285
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,953
Aha! Here it is. Found it!

1286
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,629
But how did you...?

1287
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,072
Hey! Where'd you go?

1288
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,990
Not again!

1289
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,238
Come on! I need you!

1290
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,315
I'm back! I'm back.

1291
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,915
What's going on?

1292
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,070
That's right.

1293
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,120
We're gonna launch a brand new puppy
in every continent.

1294
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,953
In every country!

1295
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,797
We're going to take over the world,
one heart at a time.

1296
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,751
- Tim, there they are!
- Mom, Dad!

1297
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,071
Imagine a puppy that never grows up...

1298
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,158
never gets old.

1299
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,993
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

1300
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,435
I give you the only thing you'll ever love...

1301
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,035
the Forever Puppy!

1302
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,110
Mommy?

1303
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,120
Avert your eyes, Templeton!

1304
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,360
Hey! What are you doing here?

1305
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,437
Mom, Dad!

1306
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,960
What are they doing here?

1307
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,793
What are Tim and the baby doing here?

1308
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,270
What are any of us doing here, really?

1309
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,199
What is going on here?

1310
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,631
He's got my parents!

1311
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,632
We're really here to get them.

1312
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,551
Get them!

1313
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,996
Get the Forever Puppy!

1314
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,549
We've got to get backstage.

1315
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,630
In there!

1316
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,310
Run!

1317
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,674
Go, go, go!

1318
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,515
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

1319
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,670
Yes!

1320
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,831
Fart. Poop. Doodie.

1321
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,070
Look at all that formula.

1322
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,992
Now that's how you launch a product.

1323
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:08,838
Oh, no!

1324
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,513
He's putting them under the rocket!

1325
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,876
Elvis has left the building!

1326
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,560
Mom, Dad...

1327
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,716
I'm coming!

1328
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,917
Atta boy! Go, Tim! Go, go!

1329
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,190
<i>Launch initiated.</i>

1330
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,440
I'm launching my Forever Puppies,
and there's nothing you can do about it!

1331
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,750
No!

1332
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,480
Baby Corp stole all the love from me...

1333
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,791
and now I'm going to take it back from them.

1334
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,553
You should understand what I'm talking about.

1335
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,993
You got replaced just like me!

1336
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,719
No! I'm nothing like you!

1337
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,870
Bratty kid!

1338
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,595
Let our parents go! His parents. The parents.

1339
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,716
Yeah!

1340
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,230
You could have had your parents' love
all to yourself again!

1341
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,231
But no!

1342
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,311
You blew it!

1343
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,797
You let that baby boss you around.

1344
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,996
He doesn't work for me.

1345
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,560
We're partners!

1346
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,274
I'm not ticklish.

1347
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,155
Hey! Where's the baby?

1348
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,754
Everyone has a tickle spot!

1349
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,671
My ears!

1350
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,160
Stop it!

1351
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,989
Little brats!

1352
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,991
Nothing is going to get in the way
of my vengeance.

1353
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,953
Not you, not anybody!

1354
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,640
Baby Corp is through.

1355
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,280
I win! Ha!

1356
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,317
Wrong!

1357
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,198
You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

1358
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,272
- That's right!
- What?

1359
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,113
You're supposed to end with...

1360
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,430
Argh!

1361
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,316
En garde!

1362
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,631
You're fired!

1363
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,792
And here's your severance package!

1364
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,633
Take that, you scurvy scallywag!

1365
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,517
Argh!

1366
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,478
<i>One minute and counting.</i>

1367
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,315
- Help!
- Anybody!

1368
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,074
Tim! What are you doing?

1369
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,830
No!

1370
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,714
Mom, Dad, I'm coming!

1371
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,996
Is that you?

1372
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,232
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I got this!

1373
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,914
- Are you okay?
- Is the baby all right?

1374
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,996
Yes, the baby's fine.

1375
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,310
Who was that?

1376
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,994
That was me!

1377
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,230
The baby's fine.

1378
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,155
It won't budge!

1379
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,470
What's happening?

1380
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,676
Wait a second!

1381
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,150
Hey.

1382
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,674
I know a way to move my parents.

1383
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,990
- How?
- We can use the puppies!

1384
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,351
Upsies.

1385
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,150
I need upsies.

1386
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,754
But what if you "go baby" again?

1387
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,991
It'll be fine. Fine, fine.

1388
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,037
Fine!

1389
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,554
It'll be fine.

1390
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,154
Hang on to your diaper!

1391
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,030
We're moving!

1392
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,429
Why are we moving?

1393
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,034
All right, Mom and Dad, hang on!

1394
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,192
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1395
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,794
Oh, no! Wait!

1396
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,436
Hold on!

1397
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,875
Go, Tim! Get your parents...

1398
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,510
out of here.

1399
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,915
You've gotta jump!

1400
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,073
Come on, it's a piece of cake!

1401
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,191
No! No patty cake! Get down!

1402
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,712
Don't cry. I'm sorry. Please don't cry!

1403
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,630
<i>20 seconds.</i>

1404
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,558
<i>15 seconds.</i>

1405

<i>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</i>

1406

<i>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</i>

1407

<i>All your life</i>

<i>You were only waiting
For this moment to arise</i>

1409
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,950
- <i>Three...</i>
- Gotcha!

1410
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,032
<i>...two, one.</i>

1411
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,236
<i>Blast off!</i>

1412
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,270
Yeah!

1413
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,072
Hey, are you still in there?

1414
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,671
Aha!

1415
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,240
What happened? Did we win?

1416
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,231
- We won!
- We won?

1417
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,120
- We won, we won, we won!
- We won! Yes!

1418
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,796
Victory nap!

1419
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,550
You ruined everything!

1420
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,032
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1421
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,236
That's not right.

1422
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,713
Now you're really going to pay!

1423
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,839
Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone
your own size!

1424
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,830
What?

1425
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,438
Eugene! You put me down!

1426
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,432
You hear me? I am the boss of you!

1427
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,800
This time, we'll raise him right.

1428
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,070
I'm sure that's gonna turn out fine.

1429
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,829
Tim, what's happening?

1430
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,593
Mom, Dad, hold on!

1431
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,996
Yes!

1432
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,835
- Tim?
- Tim!

1433
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,514
Tim! Are you okay?

1434
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,750
I'm fine. We're fine.

1435
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,910
You saved us.

1436
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,355
You're our hero.

1437
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,920
And a great big brother.

1438
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,157
We love you both so much.

1439
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,436
Both of us?

1440
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,239
With all our heart.

1441
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,119
Let's go home.

1442
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,360
How do I look?

1443
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,000
You look great.

1444
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,392
Well, team, good job.

1445
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,997
Staci, this letter should get you
into the school of your choice.

1446
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,358
- Kindergarten?
- That's right.

1447
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,874
And if there's anything else...

1448
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:26,996
How about a raise?

1449
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,395
Staci, you don't get paid.

1450
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,789
- One million ziggity-five!
- Eight!

1451
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,791
- A tricycle!
- Skates!

1452
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,797
- Candy corn?
- Lollipop!

1453
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,990
Deal.

1454
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,519
Best boss ever.

1455
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,320
And you guys don't always have to
toe the company line, you know?

1456
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,755
It's okay to think for yourself.

1457
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,751
- No, sir!
- No way!

1458
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,036
That's a terrible idea!

1459
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,554
That's the attitude.

1460
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,830
- You're so right!
- You've got it, sir!

1461
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,070
- You're the man!
- Absolutely!

1462
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,909
Here you go, big guy.

1463
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,235
You've earned it.

1464
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,594
You wanna hug me, don't you?

1465
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,356
I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay.

1466
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,591
- There, there.
- It'll be okay, big guy.

1467
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,070
So...

1468
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,430
you did it.

1469
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,751
No. We did it.

1470
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,672
By the way,
congratulations on your promotion.

1471
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,669
The corner office, the private potty.
All that stuff.

1472
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,360
But, hey! How about you?

1473
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,591
You have your parents all to yourself.

1474
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,439
So what am I gonna tell Mom and Dad
after you leave?

1475
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,630
Don't worry.

1476
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,235
Baby Corp has a procedure
for situations like this.

1477
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,274
It'll be like I was never born.

1478
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,755
I almost forgot!

1479
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,118
No way! Lam-Lam!

1480
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,800
- You fixed her.
- Yep.

1481
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,316
She's as good as new. She's a tough one.

1482
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,315
Well, I guess we both got what we wanted.

1483
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,960
It's a win-win.

1484
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,116
Probably should...

1485
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,270
Yeah.

1486
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,400
So, stay in school.

1487
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,637
I don't really have a choice.

1488
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,790
Yeah, right.

1489
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,992
- Goodbye, Tim.
- Bye.

1490
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,119
Yeah, right.

1491
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,832
<i>He left as suddenly as he arrived.</i>

1492
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,071
Bye.

1493
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,478
<i>Finally, my life was perfect again.</i>

1494
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,477
Forget about the baby.

1495
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,116
Oopsies!

1496
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,509
Pardon me, big fella.

1497
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,795
Surprise!

1498
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,953
Hooray!

1499
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,475
Forget about the baby?

1500
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,439
No, thanks. I'm good.

1501
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,115
Okie-dokie.

1502
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,910
Argh.

1503
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,560
<i>Dear Boss Baby...</i>

1504
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,552
<i>I don't usually write very much...</i>

1505
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,758
<i>but now I know
that memos are very important things.</i>

1506
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,196
<i>Even though I never went
to business school...</i>

1507
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,556
<i>I did learn to share in kindergarten.</i>

1508
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,440
<i>And if there isn't enough love
for the two of us...</i>

1509
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,956
<i>then I wanna give you all of mine.</i>

1510
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,393
<i>I would like to offer you a job.</i>

1511
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,676
<i>It will be hard work...</i>

1512
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,877
<i>and there will be no pay.</i>

1513
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,718
<i>But the good news is that
you can never be fired.</i>

1514
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,959
<i>And I promise you this.</i>

1515
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,120
<i>Every morning when you wake up,
I will be there.</i>

1516
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,590
<i>Every night at dinner, I will be there.</i>

1517
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,269
<i>Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning...</i>

1518
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,635
<i>I will be there.</i>

1519
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,755
<i>Year after year after year.</i>

1520
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,677
<i>We will grow old together.</i>

1521
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,236
<i>And you and I will always...</i>

1522
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,911
<i>...be brothers.</i>

1523
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,670
<i>Always.</i>

1524
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,638
<i>Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

1525
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,993
What's the point, Wizzie?

1526
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,436
<i>Because it's 7:00 a.m.</i>

1527
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,320
<i>I have one job to do,
and you make it so difficult.</i>

1528
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,513
<i>It's okay, little halfling.</i>

1529
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,512
<i>Sometimes, I get confused too.</i>

1530
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,240
<i>Especially during daylight savings time.</i>

1531
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,198
<i>Spring forward, fall back.</i>

1532
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,556
<i>We don't even have calendars
in the wizard's realm!</i>

1533
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,270
<i>There is no spring, only darkness and winter!</i>

1534
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,716
I'm not confused at all, Wizzie.

1535
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,990
I just miss him.

1536
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,633
Tim, look who's here!

1537
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,959
It's your new baby...

1538
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,190
Brother!

1539
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,480
You're here! You're really here!

1540
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,790
Gentle, gentle.

1541
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,952
You came back!

1542
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,872
Say hello to Theodore Lindsey Templeton.

1543
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,350
Lindsey?

1544
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,112
Who's ticklish? Who's ticklish?

1545
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,475
Here you go.

1546
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,756
<i>So, that's my story.</i>

1547
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,669
<i>Our story.</i>

1548
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,190
Luckily for me and my little brother,
it had a happy ending.

1549
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,237
Is that a true story, Daddy?

1550
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,636
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.

1551
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,553
- But you know what I found out?
- What?

1552
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,951
There's plenty of love for everyone.

1553
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,031
Even me?

1554
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,714
Especially you.

1555
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,280
Just ask your Uncle Ted.

1556
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,750
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have
a baby sister.

1557
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,195
I wanted a horse.

1558
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,920
Here you go, kid. Go get yourself a horse.

1559
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,874
You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.

1560
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,673
Back at ya, Lindsey.

1561
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,032
Hi there, baby sister.

1562
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,631
Argh!

1563
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,995
All right, guys.

1564
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,196
Time for bed.

1565
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,471
Come on, Mom. Just a little longer.

1566
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,915
Okay.

1567
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,637
<i>Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.</i>

1568
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,191
<i>Go and live your peasant lives.</i>

1569
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,720
<i>Be gone with you!</i>

1569
01:37:20,305 --> 01:38:20,587

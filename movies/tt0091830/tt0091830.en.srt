THE GREEN RAY

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,279
MONDAY, JULY 2nd

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,599
Don't you think it's hot then, too?

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,799
You mean in August?

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,199
No, it's bearable,
nothing like Cairo...

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,719
I mean, give me
2 or 3 weeks warning and...

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,239
One moment, please.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,359
Delphine, it's for you!

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,039
Hi, you OK?

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,319
That's terrific!
Are you pleased?

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,839
Then all three of us can go.

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,959
What are you trying to tell me?

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,839
You're dumping me, is that it?

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,919
2 weeks before our vacation,
that's rough.

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,239
What am I supposed to do?

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,999
That's really...
I think that's rough. Sorry!

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,479
Good-bye.

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,559
TUESDAY, JULY 3rd

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,879
Manuella!

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,999
Hi, Delphine. How are you?

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,239
My eyes hurt.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,839
Can we go elsewhere?
It hurts my eyes here.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,639
Sorry, but let's move
into the shade.

25
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,959
What's the matter?

26
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,639
Something wrong?

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,079
There sure is.

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,559
What's happened?

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,719
Caroline told me last night
she's not going on vacation with me.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,319
- What'll you do?
- I don't know.

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,039
Go with someone else.

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,159
There's no one.
Not for the moment, anyway.

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,679
You'll find people.

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,319
In 2 weeks? I doubt it.

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,559
Sure you can find

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,239
people in 2 weeks.

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,159
Who?

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,759
I don't know.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,479
You going with anyone?

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,519
With Antoine.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,399
There is a guy who'd love
to go with you.

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,679
Who?

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,719
He's got a big
vacation house for you.

44
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,919
Who is it?

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,159
Raoul.

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,319
Are you out of your mind? Raoul!

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,919
Listen, he's really charming.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,319
OK, then go alone.

49
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
It's rough, going alone.

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,439
You're sure to meet people there.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,039
Where? You don't realize...

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,399
I don't know.

53
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,519
Go to my grandmother's in Spain.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,119
- Yeah, sure.
- No joke.

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,839
She has a big house on the beach.
She'll rent you a room.

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,079
In a city?

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,959
In a small village.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,639
I'll have to think it over.
Alone in Spain!

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,159
You'll meet tourists.

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,119
I'm not the adventurous type.

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,319
That's just it:
This year you have to try.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,479
You could meet a guy you'll like.

63
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,159
How about this one?

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,119
He should appeal to you.
He's handsome.

65
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,039
A little dirty, maybe,
but he's magnificent.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,079
Look at those calves!

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,159
WEDNESDAY, JULY 4th

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,999
Orange juice, grandpa?

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,039
- Weird, no?
- What is?

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,519
- Weird weather for July.
- Sure isn't warm.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,839
What do you do on vacation?

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,439
Nothing. I'm retired, on a pension.

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,679
So I keep house.
That's all I have to do.

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,559
Don't you ever leave Paris?

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,959
Never.

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,079
I used to go to the mountains
for 2 months,

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,319
just this side of the Swiss border.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,559
Have you spent a lot
of Augusts in Paris?

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,399
I started taking vacations
very late,

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,399
because I was a hard worker.

81
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,119
When I saw the sea
for the first time I was around 60.

82
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,759
You don't get many vacations
when you work alone.

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,199
I was a cabbie, which didn't give me
any 2-month vacations.

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,679
Later I took long vacations

85
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,879
at someone's place in the country.

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,359
I took care of the livestock,
and I tended

87
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,879
the garden, and I stayed 2 months.

88
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,279
You liked the Alps?

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,239
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,359
I'm so used to driving in Paris,

91
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,279
those ravines scared me.

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,519
- A Parisian!
- A real Parisian!

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,759
- Paris is nice.
- It's nice in Paris.

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,199
There's everything you need here
for an outing: A big park...

95
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,799
It doesn't have nature,
or the sea.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,159
We don't have the sea,
but there's the Seine! Same thing.

97
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,879
No, that's not enough.

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,119
- Sure it is!
- To me, the Seine...

99
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,639
Who needs the sea?

100
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,879
I get into water up to my ankles
and I'm scared. I can't swim.

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,359
THURSDAY, JULY 5th

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,639
And in summer?

103
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,519
Sure, sometimes it rains,
but it's nice too.

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,559
We mostly go there
because Alaric hates heat,

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,159
so we prefer places
that aren't too hot.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,959
How do you go? Where?

107
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
We go camping.

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,799
What if it rains?

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,159
You go to a bed-and-breakfast
place if you can.

110
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,159
But it won't rain all the time.

111
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,639
We go in July-August. Isabelle...

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,079
knows better than I...

113
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,319
if it rains or not.
I've gone in July

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,839
and the weather was fine.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,159
If we're lucky,
maybe it'll be nice this time too.

116
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,879
So you just show up there
with the tent and everything?

117
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,599
Sure, why?

118
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,879
You're allowed to camp
anywhere there. Not like in France.

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,519
Camp grounds are rare.

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,439
The West coast is unspoiled,
easy to camp in.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,319
Are the people nice?
Can they...

122
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,639
Don't you camp on someone's land?

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,319
We ask permission
of whoever's around.

124
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,759
And the people are nice?

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,759
Very nice. No problem.

126
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,319
He knows a lot of them.

127
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,359
We have addresses, everything.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,519
He knows a lot of people
we can go to.

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,039
There's always somebody...

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,199
We know people everywhere.
Besides, there's Isabelle.

131
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,119
Dublin's not the best part, huh?

132
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,719
You glad to be going, dear?

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,759
Have you ever been to Ireland?

134
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,999
No, not yet.

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,999
You like foreign places?

136
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,279
No, I don't.

137
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,519
But Ireland's a foreign country.

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,879
I don't want to go
to a foreign place.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,559
Then why do you want
to go to Ireland?

140
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,119
Because it's a pretty country.

141
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,159
How do you know it is?

142
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,999
Isabelle told me about it.

143
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,519
Oh, well, if Isabelle told you!

144
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,719
It's rainy there. That scare you?

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,599
Delphine, come see us

146
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,879
in Dublin this summer.

147
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,159
Mom visited us,
Claude and Dominique are coming.

148
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,999
The whole family, except you.

149
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,399
I don't know.

150
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,439
In summer I prefer warm countries,
get some heat.

151
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,719
I want the sun, and all...

152
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,519
It's not on account of you,
I'll go some other time.

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,199
But in August I want to see the sea,
to swim,

154
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,679
get a tan, and all that.

155
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,759
Right, doll?

156
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,999
You like it too.
That's fine! I mean...

157
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,999
I like Ireland.

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,959
You want to go?

159
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,959
I'll go too, someday,
but not right away.

160
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,119
I must call Jean-Pierre.
We'll see.

161
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,599
FRIDAY, JULY 6th

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,119
Hi, Jean-Pierre!

163
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,839
Thanks for calling.

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,999
I wanted to ask you
if I can go to Antibes a while.

165
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,079
I thought you'd be in the mountains.

166
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,119
In that case it's no go, huh?

167
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,999
Yes, I'm OK.

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,039
Thanks a lot! All alone in the Alps!
You putting me on?

169
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,999
I was set to go to Greece,
but it was canceled.

170
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,839
I don't know,
maybe I'll go to Ireland with Babie.

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,279
So you're going to the Riviera.
You don't usually.

172
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,879
SUNDAY, JULY 8th

173
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,439
Regain CONTACT
with yourself and others

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,519
Group and private sessions

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,959
I went to Florence by myself.

176
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,239
Why don't you go on vacation alone?

177
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,559
It's a drag.

178
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,799
I don't want to.
I went alone once. I don't like it.

179
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,039
It's great to go alone.

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,719
You kidding? I've done it.
I went to Nice once.

181
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,679
It was inhuman!

182
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,199
You can meet people.

183
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,999
I didn't meet anyone.

184
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,719
That's how I met Antoine.

185
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,479
Do you meet people in Paris?

186
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,239
Not many.

187
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,679
But you don't want to.

188
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,799
Sure I do.

189
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,119
Why don't you go
on a group vacation?

190
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,239
- You crazy?
- Why?

191
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,559
Really, Beatrice!

192
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,519
You prejudiced?

193
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,319
What's wrong with groups?

194
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,799
You're nuts! You attacking me?
Shit!

195
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,279
It's no attack. But you must
escape your loneliness.

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,719
You can't go on this way.

197
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,759
No one can live alone forever.

198
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,559
Look how sad you are!

199
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,599
- I'm not sad. What an idea!
- You are too!

200
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,639
I'm fine. I'm OK, I'm not sad.

201
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,879
But you're alone, right?

202
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,959
So what?
Why are you laughing? It's dumb!

203
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,879
You think it's fun being alone?

204
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,319
It's no fun! But I won't solve it
by going with a group!

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,639
You solve it by making an effort.

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,879
OK, enough!

207
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,519
You get it? It's true!

208
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,199
There were times
when I was stalled like you,

209
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,479
when I was sad. It was awful!

210
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,839
Awful! I know how it is,
but you must break out of it.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,119
We're your friends. We want to help!

212
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,959
Don't exaggerate! I'm not sad.

213
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,119
You have to push things
to the limit to... lance the boil.

214
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,319
You don't know me.

215
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,879
But I can see you.

216
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,599
You see me occasionally
for 5 minutes.

217
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,119
What do you mean?

218
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,119
We've discussed it before.

219
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,679
Very little.
And you do all the talking.

220
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,919
I've something to express
and I express it.

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,079
I have a lot of things to express,
but I don't express them.

222
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,599
So express!
We want you to express yourself.

223
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,959
We're all ears.

224
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,119
I'm sorry.
What do you have to say?

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,079
I'm not mean, I want to help you,
but sometimes you have to be mean

226
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,479
in order to shake people up.

227
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,319
I don't know.
If you were brought up

228
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,279
to have your own way...

229
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
She's crazy! She's mean!
Why's she saying that?

230
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,799
OK, I'm crazy, I'm mean...

231
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,959
How was I brought up?

232
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,559
You need opposition to develop.

233
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,039
Now hold on! I'm fine.
Maybe I'm a little lonely right now,

234
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,959
but I'm not completely alone.

235
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,199
There's someone in my life
even if I'm not seeing him just now.

236
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,999
And that's important to me.
So you just shut up!

237
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,439
So OK.

238
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,599
I didn't know you had someone.

239
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,879
I saw you like this and thought
you needed to get around.

240
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,159
Sorry.

241
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,199
I didn't know.

242
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,079
I thought you had no one now,
so I figured you had to get around.

243
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,479
I'm willing to be rough
to help my friends.

244
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,679
I've been a lot rougher than this.

245
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,319
I even slapped a friend
to get her laughing,

246
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,959
to make her stop!

247
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,959
But you're different.

248
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,119
So are you.
That's the spice of life.

249
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,279
But you scream things at me and...

250
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,919
I don't know how to deal with you.

251
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,519
You mustn't stagnate.

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,439
Listen, Delphine, you know
it's all over with Jean-Pierre.

253
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,399
Either you meet someone new
or you live with a memory.

254
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,759
- Want a new guy?
- I hope to find one.

255
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,879
You waiting for Prince Charming,
or will you go looking?

256
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,319
What can I do?

257
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,359
We can consult your stars.

258
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,479
I can make the spirits talk tonight,
I can make tables turn.

259
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,319
I never asked the spirits
to find me a man. But I can try.

260
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,239
You must have beliefs.

261
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,799
If you don't...

262
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,359
Sure I believe... in the things
that crop up in life,

263
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,599
things that happen
all by themselves,

264
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,519
things about love.

265
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,719
Haven't you any superstitions?

266
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,959
Don't you believe in luck,
in the cards,

267
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,119
in the stars, nothing?

268
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,239
I believe in personal superstitions.

269
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,919
I can believe in things.
In playing cards

270
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,399
you find in the street.
I find them.

271
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,599
Often?

272
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,239
Sometimes, when I least expect it.

273
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,599
I'm walking along and I find a card.

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,399
It always means something.

275
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,039
Last time, going to my sister's,
I found a queen of spades.

276
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,759
A bad omen.

277
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,039
Can you read omens?

278
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,559
Some of them.

279
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,519
So on my way to my sister's,

280
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,439
I spotted a...
What's more, the card was green.

281
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,359
What's weird is that I'd met
a medium, a friend of mine,

282
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,079
who told me green would be
my color for the year.

283
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,919
It's really weird, but since then...
maybe I'm just noticing it,

284
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,359
I keep running into green things.

285
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,039
On my way to my sister's,
what did I see?

286
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,159
A green card by a green lamppost.

287
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,359
And I was wearing green.

288
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,279
Maybe you'll meet
a little green man!

289
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,999
The color of hope.

290
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,639
It's a good year.

291
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,999
Let me see the horoscope.

292
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,239
You're Capricorn.

293
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,119
"Unaware that you're just waiting
for Prince Charming,

294
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,799
"you're alone and that seems
to depress you.

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,199
"A vicious circle!

296
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,999
But you're too stubborn to change."

297
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,559
I'm not stubborn.
Life is stubborn toward me.

298
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,479
It's true.

299
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,159
In fact he was saying
you're retarded!

300
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,799
And it still kept going?

301
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,199
Where's Delphine?

302
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,839
Outside, sulking. I don't get her.

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,759
She's always alone. What's going on?

304
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,599
It's because Delphine is sad.

305
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,679
Sad by nature, or what?

306
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,559
Because she broke up
with Jean-Pierre.

307
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,399
Who's Jean-Pierre?

308
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,719
- Her fiance.
- For long?

309
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,359
I'll sit with her.

310
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,359
She won't talk. Me, I like talking
about other people's troubles.

311
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,199
Sure, but she's been alone
for 2 years.

312
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,559
So she's a little down.

313
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,199
What's the matter?

314
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,559
Nothing.

315
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,999
Why are you crying?

316
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,599
Leave me alone!

317
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,879
Because of guys?

318
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,959
Not! Let me be!

319
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,039
Because of vacation?

320
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,639
To hell with that!

321
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,119
- Then why are you crying?
- For nothing.

322
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,399
You mustn't cry like that.

323
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,159
It's not over what we told her.

324
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,319
We weren't cruel.

325
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,639
Come see my folks:
Big house, a garden.

326
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,199
My sister's there,
my brothers, the kids.

327
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,839
You'd have the sea and the sun.
Do come!

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,359
Yes, but... Babie wants
me to go to Ireland with Mom.

329
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,839
That's no vacation!

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,839
I need a real vacation.

331
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,479
I'm fond of my family,
but I can't...

332
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,079
Then come to Cherbourg.

333
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,719
We'll have fun, meet people.

334
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,479
WEDNESDAY, JULY 18th

335
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,279
Cute dog swimming there.

336
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,159
That's Mount Roule over there.

337
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,399
Over there's a place
called La Hougue.

338
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,479
That's an offshore oil rig.

339
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,079
And that's the marina,
of course.

340
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,159
La Hague is over there.

341
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,919
The other shore is completely wild.

342
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,519
Do you see him?

343
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,199
Do you see that guy?

344
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,679
Hey, look at him!

345
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,519
Don't stare like that!

346
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,159
He's not bad.

347
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,439
He's dark.

348
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,479
- Nice build.
- He's eyeing you.

349
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,759
Quit ogling him!

350
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,319
He's looking at us.

351
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,239
He's got the hots for you!

352
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,279
Stop undressing me!

353
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,279
He's your type.

354
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,919
No, he's your type.

355
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,959
You're his type, anyway.

356
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,719
You've got nerve! Cut it out!

357
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,039
- You from here?
- Yes.

358
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,159
What's your name?

359
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,959
Edouard.

360
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,079
This is Delphine,
and I'm Francoise.

361
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,639
What are you doing here?

362
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,319
We're on vacation.

363
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,039
With your family?

364
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,999
I'm going to Ireland tomorrow.

365
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,039
That's funny,
I almost went to Ireland.

366
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,479
I almost went,
but in the end, well...

367
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,839
I preferred Cherbourg.

368
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,759
- You a sailor?
- Yes. My ship's over there.

369
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,639
- You all alone?
- Yep, all alone.

370
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,279
- Busy tonight?
- How about you?

371
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,319
Dining with the family.

372
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,159
Can we meet later?

373
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,159
Around 10 or 11?

374
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,599
We can't ditch the family.

375
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,919
Sure we can.

376
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
No, we can't!

377
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,119
Why not?

378
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,599
We promised and we must stick to it.

379
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,319
It can be arranged.

380
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,279
Maybe we can meet
after dinner, huh?

381
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,039
For ice cream at the bowling alley?

382
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,679
Sure!

383
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,239
We have to go. Bye!

384
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,279
Maybe tomorrow.

385
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,039
I'm off tomorrow.

386
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,719
Well, see you around.

387
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,319
Why'd you leave?

388
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,919
I don't know. I got suspicious.

389
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,319
- Didn't like him?
- He's sort of a hustler, really.

390
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,159
- At this rate you'll meet no one.
- Sure, but...

391
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,719
A guy who's leaving the next day...
he seems weird.

392
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,959
I don't know.
In your place I'd have said yes.

393
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,639
- But we're different, Francoise.
- You said it!

394
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,879
Here are the pork chops.

395
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,839
Rare,

396
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,599
very rare, however you like them.
Help yourselves.

397
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,359
I don't eat meat.

398
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,959
That so?

399
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,079
- Don't like it?
- No, I don't.

400
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,919
Doesn't matter. No problem.

401
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,239
- Doesn't matter!
- Something else?

402
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,679
No, I'm OK with my salad.

403
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,559
Make her an egg.

404
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,879
I'll add a tomato to what I have.

405
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,879
Help yourself.

406
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,399
A tomato! You should have told us.

407
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,039
We'd have made something else.

408
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,999
She likes vegetables.

409
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,439
You eat eggs, don't you?

410
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,319
Not many.

411
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,199
- You never eat meat?
- No, never.

412
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,359
You eat fish?

413
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,279
Not much fish, either.

414
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,959
I eat it sometimes,
when there's nothing else.

415
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,239
A little protein's all right
when I eat with other people.

416
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,599
And your health?
No problems? Everything OK?

417
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,399
Sure, I'm fine.

418
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,559
At home I eat
grain products, I eat...

419
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,919
I cook things.

420
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,999
- Dairy foods?
- Dairy, yes.

421
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,439
Milk, almonds, stuff like that.

422
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,399
We don't need meat.

423
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,519
Must be a problem
when you're at other people's.

424
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,799
Like here.

425
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,639
We can buy her what she likes.

426
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,319
Don't buy anything special for me.
It's OK.

427
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,319
- This is fine.
- Shellfish?

428
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,559
That's out too.

429
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,639
Lobster?
Crabs?

430
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,039
They're animals.

431
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,239
So it's anything animal that...

432
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,679
I don't know,
they're animals, and...

433
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,599
I don't think we should.

434
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,759
It's especially red-blooded animals.

435
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,439
So when a pork chop
is put in front of you,

436
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,159
what you see is the animal,
that it?

437
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,599
But you like green vegetables.

438
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,199
When you pick a lettuce
in the garden,

439
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,399
it's alive, but then what?
It wilts, so it's dead.

440
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,919
I don't see it that way.

441
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,519
To me, a lettuce

442
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,759
is very far removed,
it's much more remote from me

443
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,759
than meat, than an animal.

444
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,199
A lettuce is a friend,

445
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,679
it's lighter, it's...

446
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,919
Vegetables are airier.
I don't know, they have...

447
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,559
No blood.

448
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,599
No beating heart.

449
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,519
Maybe I'm not aware of things,

450
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,039
but at my present stage,
the way I am now,

451
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,079
maybe I'm wrong.

452
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,639
It's an instinctive thing.

453
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,599
That's how I feed myself.

454
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,159
When I was young,

455
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,479
I felt that way at the butcher's.

456
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,359
Now I buy meat in supermarkets
and I don't feel that way at all.

457
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,799
That proves it's a question
of awareness.

458
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,679
I think that's wrong.

459
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,839
You eat meat because you don't care
what you're doing

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,279
or how an animal is killed,

461
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,879
that's wrong!

462
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,679
You cared at the butcher's,

463
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,159
about the blood and the violence...

464
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,079
Absolutely.

465
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,519
And then you stopped caring.

466
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,999
Listen, when I buy 2 or 3 things...

467
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,399
You stopped caring,
but you mustn't stop.

468
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,559
Yes, but I also buy things
made by people

469
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,999
who live differently from me,

470
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,919
and that doesn't bother me.

471
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,799
If I have to go to a supermarket

472
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,279
and rack my conscience
whenever I buy things...

473
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,919
But I'm mostly talking
about meat.

474
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,519
We can do without it there,

475
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,599
in France there are lots
of other things to eat.

476
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,319
It's a problem of conscience
that's easy to solve:

477
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,359
You just don't eat it,
you eat other things.

478
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,599
And it's much cheaper.

479
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,679
Meat's expensive.
Grains are low-budget.

480
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,999
And for the national economy,

481
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,239
it certainly costs more
to raise cattle in a field

482
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,439
than to eat what grows
in the field. That's for sure!

483
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,799
But for flavor, I prefer...

484
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,599
Meat's tasteless.
When it comes to flavor,

485
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,479
I think even strictly
vegetarian pate

486
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,519
tastes like meat and I can't eat it.
It disgusts me.

487
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,199
So it's the word "pate".

488
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,999
No, it's the flavor,
the impression I get.

489
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,559
It's heavy stuff.

490
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,279
But something's missing.

491
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,999
No there isn't.
I like to aerate myself.

492
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,559
That kind of food is,
I don't know...

493
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,199
it's airy and light.

494
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,519
Suppose you were offered, maybe,

495
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,559
a leg of lamb cooked
in the open air.

496
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,439
On the barbecue there.

497
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,919
By airy, I don't mean
the surroundings.

498
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,999
I'm talking about
how the body reacts.

499
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,679
Your body is...

500
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,399
you are what you eat.

501
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,759
There's air,
and then there's nourishment.

502
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,039
Nourishment helps you live,
I think...

503
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,439
Sure, it's all very mystical.
You're teasing me!

504
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,839
It's not a plot.

505
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,319
I can't eat flowers, either.

506
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,919
It's a matter of instinct,
because...

507
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,999
What's left?

508
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,879
You can eat rice like the Chinese.

509
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,079
I do eat rice,

510
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,439
but I think a flower...

511
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,199
I can't eat one.
To me it's poetic, it's a picture.

512
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,599
THURSDAY, JULY 19th

513
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,199
Want to help pick strawberries?

514
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,439
Coming?

515
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,719
Want to swing?

516
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,199
Not really.
Swings make me nauseous.

517
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,999
You never went on a swing as a kid?

518
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,359
I told you, it made me sick.

519
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,359
- You don't like rough games.
- Swings aren't rough.

520
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,679
You seem pretty... calm.

521
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,839
Do you like to sail?

522
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,879
Boats make me sick too, sweetie.

523
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,159
These currants are good.

524
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,639
Had any before?

525
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,919
Sure I've had currants.

526
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,839
Got a boyfriend?

527
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,799
Yes, I have a boyfriend.

528
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,439
Then why didn't he come with you?

529
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,079
He can't. He's working.

530
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,479
A shame, no?

531
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,999
I don't care, but...

532
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,119
What's his name?

533
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,599
Jean-Pierre.

534
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,559
See him often?

535
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,239
Yes, but he doesn't work in Paris,
so I don't see him much.

536
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,599
He's still my boyfriend.

537
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,879
You going to live with him later on?

538
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,879
Yes, someday.

539
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,999
I got stung. It hurts!

540
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,879
Why'd you ask me that?

541
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,119
You scared?

542
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,999
No, I was just asking.

543
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,159
I have a boyfriend too.
Boyfriends: I switch.

544
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,159
You staying here long?

545
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,039
Until you throw me out.

546
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,959
You're going to phone him, no?

547
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,679
Your boyfriend.

548
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,199
Maybe.

549
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,999
Anyway, I have others.

550
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,839
You change them like shirts.

551
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,919
These are good,
but you get tired of them.

552
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,919
Why'd you ask me that?
Who asked you?

553
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,119
Nobody.

554
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,199
I'm curious.

555
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,679
- By nature?
- Yes, kind of.

556
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,079
You got plans with him?

557
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,159
You really are curious!

558
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,079
I've no plans now,
things just happen.

559
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,359
We can spend the afternoon here.

560
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,759
"Axle": Have to check, I'm not sure.

561
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,239
- What's an axle?
- Double axle, in skating.

562
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,119
- In what?
- Skating.

563
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,519
- A technical term, no?
- Never heard of a double axle?

564
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,239
Stir, stir

565
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,759
the children's soup

566
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,039
Let's get some?

567
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,759
Once more, then finished.

568
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,919
No, sweetie. Slowly.

569
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,719
FRIDAY, JULY 20th

570
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,839
Want to go to the beach tomorrow,
go sailing?

571
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,079
Sailing?

572
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,399
OK for the beach,
but sailing makes me sick.

573
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,119
You get seasick?

574
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,279
Pisces isn't your sign, then.

575
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,799
No, I'm Capricorn.

576
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,599
- Good at signs?
- Sort of. I do some astrology.

577
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,479
Gerard is a Capricorn too,
like me.

578
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,159
What's it mean?

579
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,559
It's the sign
of the goat climbing the mountain

580
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,279
all the way up.

581
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,359
But it's usually alone.

582
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,079
That's a bit like you.

583
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,919
Don't you think so?

584
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,719
That could be me.

585
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,399
It's true, we haven't known you long
but we've the feeling

586
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,399
that every time
we suggest something, it's:

587
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,799
"No, I'd rather not,
no, not really..."

588
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,359
I'm not difficult. That's nonsense!

589
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,279
What do you like?

590
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,519
What do you mean? I'm not being
difficult. I've been sweet so far.

591
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,479
- Oh, very sweet!
- I haven't been difficult.

592
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,799
I've done errands, gone for walks.

593
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,639
I've been nice, damn it!

594
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,559
- Washed dishes.
- I washed dishes.

595
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,079
- But you always tell me...
- What are you blaming me for?

596
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,159
Nothing at all.

597
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,439
We want to please you,
do as much for you as we can here.

598
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,159
I'm OK, I feel fine.

599
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,599
What would really interest you?

600
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,639
What are you really dying to do,

601
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,759
while you're here?

602
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,599
Just go for walks.

603
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,679
You're a plant!
A plant.

604
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,319
I'm a plant?

605
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,719
SATURDAY, JULY 21st

606
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,279
There's Delphine!

607
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,119
Been out walking?

608
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,719
Where've you been?

609
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,639
Walking, in the pasture.

610
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,919
You're destroying nature.

611
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,599
- A big branch like that!
- Pretty, eh?

612
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,599
For me?
No, keep it.

613
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,599
I didn't pick any for you.
I don't cut flowers.

614
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,479
You weren't bored?

615
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,239
No, I saw the sea, I saw...

616
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,119
We'd better hurry.

617
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,959
In you go!

618
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,599
With Mommy!

619
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,839
With uncle.

620
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,639
SUNDAY, JULY 22nd

621
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,999
He likes the job,
anyway he chose it!

622
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,599
It's always work, work, work!

623
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,879
- Francoise?
- What?

624
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,639
I can't stay here. Take me with you.

625
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,399
What's the matter?
Don't you like it here?

626
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,039
Sure, it's fine.

627
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,199
- Aren't they nice?
- They're very nice.

628
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,159
But I can't stay here all alone.

629
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,519
I'll find something to tell them.

630
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,919
They're smart, they'll understand.

631
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,599
- I'm embarrassed.
- Don't worry.

632
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,159
- It'll be nice.
- How many of us will there be?

633
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,279
Is this good-bye?

634
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,719
Yes, but I also want to tell you:

635
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,039
- Delphine's leaving.
- She angry?

636
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,519
Not at all. But she'd rather
the 3 of us went back together.

637
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,679
- I'm not surprised.
- It's a pity. She's nice.

638
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,399
Well, after all,
she's different from us.

639
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,159
So we're taking her to Paris.

640
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,759
Well, all right.

641
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,919
- Delphine's leaving?
- That's right.

642
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,519
But why?

643
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,839
Well, since we're going,
it's better.

644
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,079
She'll be all alone in Paris!

645
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,199
Don't ask...

646
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,599
MONDAY, JULY 23rd

647
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,839
You want my photo?

648
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,639
Why not? You're beautiful!

649
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,359
Cigarette?

650
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,079
Jean-Pierre?

651
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,599
It's Delphine. You OK?

652
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,639
I'm in Paris.

653
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,439
Cherbourg was nice, but...

654
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,399
I came back, that's all.

655
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,319
You know how I am.

656
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,519
I wanted to ask you: Can I use
your place in the mountains...

657
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,919
WEDNESDAY, JULY 25th

658
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,239
Paulo here?

659
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,839
Hi, Delphine!

660
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,719
Hi, Michel! Things OK?

661
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,119
You on vacation?

662
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,439
Just arrived from Paris.
Paulo has Jean-Pierre's keys.

663
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,239
Paulo's in the valley.
Be back at 6 p.m.,

664
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,039
with the keys, I guess.

665
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,999
- Want to wander around?
- I wouldn't mind.

666
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,799
I'll mind your bags.

667
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,639
- I'll take my white hat.
- If you like.

668
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,439
See you, Michel.

669
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,279
- You OK, Paulo?
- Fine. Just get here?

670
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,079
I've the apartment keys.

671
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,919
- I don't need them.
- Why not?

672
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,559
- I'm going home.
- What for?

673
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,439
I'm bored.

674
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,159
You came to air your luggage?

675
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,879
No, I'm all mixed up.

676
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,959
Just give me my bags.
I'm leaving.

677
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,719
I don't get it at all.

678
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,719
Just give them to me.
It's OK.

679
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,359
Thanks, Paulo. Sorry.

680
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,359
They've aired. They're healthy.

681
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,879
I'm really sorry. You OK?

682
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,079
Whenever you want,
the keys are here for you.

683
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,159
THURSDAY, JULY 26th

684
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,199
Back already?

685
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,919
I only stayed one day.

686
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,799
Came back the same night.

687
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,199
You're a little crazy!

688
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,399
I couldn't... I know that resort.

689
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,919
It's rough there by yourself.

690
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,679
I can't take it any more.

691
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,599
What'll you do now?

692
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,479
You have money.
So take off again.

693
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,919
But I hate going alone.

694
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,959
It's no fun.

695
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,799
But you can't just stay in Paris!

696
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,639
You always meet someone
when you least expect it.

697
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,999
Since I don't expect it,
let's see if I do.

698
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,119
Wait and see!

699
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,999
I'm talking nonsense.

700
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,279
I don't know what I want to do.

701
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,479
I really feel out of it.

702
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,679
- Of course you can stay.
- Leave me alone!

703
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,439
Stay where? In Paris?

704
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,439
I don't know.

705
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,159
FRIDAY, JULY 27th

706
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,559
Hello, Irene.

707
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,079
How are you?

708
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,879
Getting along.
It's funny seeing you here.

709
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,239
What brings you here?

710
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,559
Shopping. I was in the neighborhood,
so I stopped by.

711
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,599
What about you?

712
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,239
I was on my way home.
I still live in the same place.

713
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,359
I'm on vacation,
sort of in transit...

714
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,799
Looking for a place.

715
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,799
I can't get over it!

716
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,759
What've you been up to?

717
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,879
I took the plunge. I got married.

718
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,999
Again!

719
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,919
This time it's serious.
I have a little son.

720
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,999
When did you have him?

721
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,759
17 months ago.

722
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,759
He's handsome, right?

723
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,119
He's pretty handsome.

724
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,559
Are you happy?

725
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,919
Yes and no.
There are times...

726
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,399
So far it's been difficult,
very rough.

727
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,079
It's too long a story
to tell you now, but...

728
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,199
I've been on vacation.

729
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,679
You're not working?

730
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,479
Sure I'm working,
but this is my vacation.

731
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,999
I still have 2 weeks to go,
but, really...

732
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,719
Not going away?

733
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,959
That's just the trouble:
I went away,

734
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,479
I came back, I went off again
and came back...

735
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,639
Now I feel sort of foolish,
here in Paris like an idiot.

736
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,079
The weather's awful
and I'd love to get away fast.

737
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,359
The weather'll change.

738
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,319
You know my pad on the Left Bank:

739
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,519
When the sun's out, it's hot.

740
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,479
I have an idea.

741
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,519
What is it?

742
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,599
I'll lend you my brother-in-law's
apartment in Biarritz.

743
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,919
He lends it to me every year,
but it doesn't suit me.

744
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,679
My husband and I go to Deauville.

745
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,959
- How sweet of you!
- Wonderful idea!

746
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,319
It's a beautiful place.

747
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,599
Very nice crowd there,
so you never know!

748
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,999
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 1st

749
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,359
THURSDAY, AUGUST 2nd

750
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,519
You still reading Jules Verne?

751
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,399
You really like it?

752
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,639
I reread
"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"

753
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,239
and it bored me stiff.

754
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,799
Until I picked up this book

755
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,879
and read "The Green Ray",

756
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,719
I found him paralyzing.

757
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,919
But now, I think "The Green Ray"

758
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,719
is amazingly interesting.

759
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,399
I read "The Green Ray".
I thought it was very good.

760
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,759
It seemed to me
a kind of fairy tale.

761
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,639
The heroine is a fairy-tale heroine.

762
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,919
She's as simple
as Cinderella or Snow White.

763
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,919
- Is it a love story?
- And it's set in Scotland.

764
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,079
You love it there!

765
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,039
Yes, a country I liked a lot.

766
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,119
Have you read it?

767
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,279
When I was a child,
but I remember it only vaguely.

768
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,039
You're reading it now?

769
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,679
I've finished it, and although
I don't much like Verne,

770
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,799
I found "The Green Ray"
extraordinary,

771
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,639
because it's a love story,
a romance,

772
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,319
with characters who are...

773
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,039
Searching.

774
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,439
Yes, searching for something.

775
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,759
The Green Ray. You've seen it?

776
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,519
Three times, in fact.

777
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,639
The first time, when I was 8 or 9,
at La Baule. Know La Baule?

778
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,279
There's a lovely beach,
nearly 5 miles long.

779
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,639
I was with my father, and he spoke
to me about Verne's book.

780
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:53,119
The day was very clear and dry,
there were no clouds.

781
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,679
He said,
"Maybe we'll be lucky today,"

782
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,999
and I did see it,

783
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,959
just for a split second,

784
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:04,599
when the sun set on the horizon.

785
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,519
At the final stage

786
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,839
there was a kind
of pale green shaft,

787
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,519
like a sword blade,
a horizontal beam,

788
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,079
very pretty, but extremely brief.

789
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,159
We won't see it today.
Look at the sky,

790
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,679
all hazy and...

791
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,279
Very hazy and gray.

792
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,279
Not a hope.

793
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,759
Know what Verne says?

794
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,159
That when you see the green ray

795
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,399
you can read your own feelings
and other's too.

796
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,799
Really? That's wonderful!
If it's true,

797
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,759
we'd have heightened perception
on seeing the green ray.

798
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,879
That's what happened to his heroine.

799
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,999
Who never sees the green ray,

800
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,919
but who finally reads
her own feelings

801
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,439
and those
of the young man she's met.

802
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,479
And you, sir, are you familiar
with the green ray?

803
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,839
Very much so.
I've seen it several times,

804
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,599
perhaps 5 times in my life.
It's very rare.

805
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,679
Some summers you never see
the green ray

806
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:12,599
because atmospheric conditions
are unfavorable.

807
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,039
Today, for example, is too hazy.

808
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,279
Too cloudy.

809
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,119
As my wife said,
the atmosphere must be very clear.

810
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,679
And the reason for this phenomenon

811
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,799
is the diffraction... refraction?

812
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,719
Refraction.

813
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,999
Refraction in the atmosphere.

814
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,679
Shall I explain it in detail?

815
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,559
You see the sun, there.

816
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,159
It is not exactly where you see it.

817
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,919
It's really a little lower,

818
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,359
because the sun's rays curve
in the atmosphere,

819
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,759
and the closer the sun is
to the horizon,

820
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,759
the greater the diffraction
in the atmosphere.

821
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,919
When the sun seems
to touch the horizon,

822
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,159
it is in fact already
below the horizon.

823
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:14,079
The solar disk
seems slightly raised,

824
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,319
perhaps half a degree.

825
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,039
That's the first reason
for the green ray.

826
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,479
The second is that there's also
the dispersion of colors,

827
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,719
When light passes through a prism,
there's a spectrum,

828
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,999
and the color that's most curved

829
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,959
is blue!

830
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,999
I'd have guessed green.

831
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,919
No, the green is near the blue.

832
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,319
There are red, yellow, green,

833
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,079
blue and violet.

834
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,399
Blue and violet are very weak.

835
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,799
What we can clearly observe
are the colors yellow and green.

836
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,359
So when the sun sets,

837
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,959
the disk is slightly raised,

838
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,119
but the blue colors,

839
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,759
the greens,
are higher than the reds.

840
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,799
So when the disk sinks
below the horizon,

841
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,879
the last ray you see is the green.

842
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,319
- Is the green!
- A lovely green.

843
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,039
You're like a scientist

844
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,519
in the book
named Aristobulus Ursicloss.

845
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,399
- What a name!
- I haven't read it.

846
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,079
FRIDAY, AUGUST 3rd

847
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,839
It's OK, leave it.
It's all right.

848
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,039
Feels great.

849
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,719
Haven't been in yet?

850
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,519
No, but I will.
I'll have a little dip.

851
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,799
You've got some tan already!

852
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,439
Sure!

853
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,599
You're the one who's tanned.

854
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,239
I don't think so.
I can't be tanned already, after all.

855
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,599
Been here long?

856
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,079
Just since day before yesterday.

857
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,839
You know this beach already?

858
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,999
I've been here several days.

859
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,039
- That so! You on vacation?
- That's it.

860
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,559
Me too.

861
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,519
- You're German?
- No. Guess!

862
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,159
Excuse my French.
I speak it badly.

863
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,439
Lots of mistakes.

864
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,719
I understand you perfectly.

865
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,239
I don't know... are you Dutch?

866
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,399
A little higher up.

867
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,999
- Norwegian? Swedish?
- Right, Swedish.

868
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,599
And you're French?

869
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,319
Very good.
A pretty country, France.

870
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,319
I don't know if I've time
to see it all,

871
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,439
because, a trip once a year,
on vacation...

872
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,559
You touring all over France?

873
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,159
No, because I came here
with a plane,

874
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,319
and then I'm going to Spain.

875
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,159
You're traveling alone?

876
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,039
I love it!

877
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,999
I love to travel alone
because you see a lot of things

878
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,719
and meet new people and like that.

879
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,119
You traveling alone?

880
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,399
It's really nice here!

881
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,679
You cold?

882
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,479
Listen, dry yourself.
You swim with that bathing suit?

883
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,639
Why not?

884
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,039
Why don't you take it off?
It makes you a chill.

885
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,719
Not at all, it's fine.

886
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,479
Don't think so?

887
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,639
You sunbathe with it, too?

888
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,479
But it leaves stripes... marks.

889
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,399
Listen, you...

890
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,759
I'm better with nothing.
Look at the beach.

891
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,279
Because...
I don't know, I'm used to it.

892
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,119
In Scandinavia
we're always half-naked.

893
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,999
You see everything here.
It's nice!

894
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,279
It's pretty.

895
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,679
See that good-looking guy?

896
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,159
Where?

897
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,799
That one. He's a good swimmer.

898
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,719
Nice build, too.
Don't you think?

899
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,959
You look at guys?

900
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,079
Sure I look at guys.
I'm alone on vacation.

901
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,159
I have to find a good one.
The best!

902
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,479
You have a fiance?

903
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,319
My fiance!

904
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,519
You don't have a fiance?

905
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,479
- You're lucky!
- Why?

906
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,399
Because they're a pain.
They're too jealous.

907
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,359
You can't look

908
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,399
right or left, they're always
watching you, following you.

909
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,999
Because it's really
not good to be alone,

910
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,439
and it's not good to stay
with one person too long.

911
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,639
Have you always been alone?

912
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,719
You've been engaged?

913
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,759
I was for a very long time,

914
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,599
and now it's not that way any more.

915
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,679
So what happened?

916
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,919
What happens is that's how it is,
I'm alone.

917
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,839
He dropped you?

918
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,839
You walked out on him, then?

919
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,799
No, it's life.

920
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,399
Yeah, but it's complicated.

921
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,839
You have to profit from a vacation.

922
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,879
Sure, but if you stay
in an apartment all day!

923
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,639
We have to go out some evening.

924
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,559
Go out where?

925
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,759
Don't you want to go dancing?

926
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,119
Don't you like it?
We'll cruise around...

927
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,439
Cruise?

928
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,319
Cruise? Bruise?

929
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,519
I'm ready for that!

930
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,399
Look there! Terrific guy!

931
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,759
I have trouble finding an ideal guy.

932
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,839
What's your ideal?

933
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,919
What you prefer?

934
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,759
My ideal is romantic.

935
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,759
So money doesn't matter?

936
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,599
Money doesn't matter.

937
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,959
I always think...
no, my ideal is romantic.

938
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,039
You like dinner with candles...

939
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,999
No, not candles,
none of that stuff...

940
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,439
I always hope that there,

941
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,519
in the hollow of a wave,
there'll be a...

942
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,399
How do you tell, when you see,

943
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,719
I don't know,
when you see someone go by,

944
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,759
a handsome guy,

945
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,999
how do you know he's right for you?

946
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,919
How do you tell about the guy
when he comes over

947
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,359
and talks to you?

948
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,799
How do you tell
if you like him or not?

949
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,399
How do you know,
maybe you like him.

950
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,199
If you don't look around...

951
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,519
Don't you think I look?
I look at people a lot.

952
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,799
But the rest is all hazy for me.

953
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,759
- All crazy?
- All hazy.

954
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,799
Why hazy?

955
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,359
I don't know, because I'm not
very operational in life,

956
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,279
I'm not functional,
I look at people.

957
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,359
But I never do anything special
to find someone or something.

958
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,079
Maybe I'm wrong.

959
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,719
You wait for people to come to you?

960
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,199
Like I told you...

961
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,599
A guy won't come to you.
You have to do something.

962
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,759
To me that's just talk.
"Do something!" I've heard it before.

963
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,999
My Paris friends tell me:
Do something, search! It's all talk!

964
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,679
Have you looked?

965
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,319
I really don't believe
in searching either.

966
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,559
You have to feel it.
Do you feel it? You talk to people?

967
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,639
How do you feel it?
They're just as...

968
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,359
Girls as much as boys.

969
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,199
Sure I feel it...

970
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,559
I'm very open to people.
I feel it.

971
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:38,959
I'm receptive, I listen, I'm open.

972
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,839
You're disappointed?

973
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,399
I don't know... Yes and no.
If nothing special's happened...

974
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,399
I've never...

975
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,839
I listen to people,
watch them live, but...

976
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,159
You can't trust people right off.

977
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,679
Yes you can.

978
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,439
I don't think so.

979
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,679
You don't trust people?

980
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,799
I play with people.

981
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,999
Meaning?

982
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:11,159
To find someone who's right,
who's nice,

983
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,719
you mustn't reveal
your own feelings right away.

984
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,439
Then what do you reveal of yourself?

985
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,319
I live, I have fun,

986
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,879
I observe others reactions,

987
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,799
then I decide.

988
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,679
Is it good or is it bad?

989
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,599
It's like a card game:

990
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,599
You can't show what's in your hand
right away.

991
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,119
My hand's empty.

992
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,119
You must have something!

993
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,759
I don't have anything!

994
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,119
It's really not sad.

995
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,519
What's the matter?

996
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,999
Why are you crying?

997
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,319
Listen, forget your troubles.

998
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,799
I'm forgetting them.
I didn't think of them.

999
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,559
You talk of showing things...
I don't know, I don't have anything.

1000
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,759
If I had something to show,
people would see it, that's all!

1001
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,879
What do people do?

1002
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,519
Forget it!

1003
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,959
Don't be like that!

1004
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,359
You can see I'm not like you.
I'm not...

1005
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,919
Things aren't obvious to me.
I'm not normal, like you.

1006
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,279
If I had something to give,
people would see it.

1007
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,759
If I'm dumped,
it has to be my fault.

1008
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,999
When I make an effort,
I try to listen, to talk to people.

1009
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,959
I'm very open...

1010
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:54,119
I listen, I watch what's going on.

1011
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,239
If people don't come to me
it's because I'm worthless and...

1012
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,079
Forget your troubles.
Forget everything.

1013
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,199
Tonight we'll have fun!

1014
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,399
And there are the victims!

1015
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,199
How are you?
What are you doing tonight?

1016
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,079
Can we sit with you?

1017
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,479
You cold?

1018
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,239
- What nationality?
- Me?

1019
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,599
I'm Spanish.

1020
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,319
You speak Spanish?

1021
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,479
I speak all languages.
You speak Spanish too?

1022
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,599
French, yes.

1023
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,959
Do you think I'm Spanish?

1024
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,119
No, I think you're Swedish.

1025
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,839
You're Swedish!

1026
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,079
- Certainly not!
- Finnish, then.

1027
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,679
- So what are you?
- I'm German.

1028
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,639
- Do you like...
- I speak German, too.

1029
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,039
- Like flowers?
- I love flowers.

1030
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,519
This is for you.

1031
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,719
- But... I swiped it!
- There you are!

1032
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,119
What are you doing here?
On vacation with your friend?

1033
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,119
- You're alone?
- We're both alone.

1034
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,039
- What's your name?
- Lena.

1035
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,399
- What do they call you?
- Joel.

1036
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,639
- And what's your name?
- Me? Pierrot.

1037
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,359
Pierrot's a circus name!

1038
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,639
Sure, a clown.

1039
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,959
Right! The white clown.

1040
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,599
What's the clown doing tonight?

1041
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,679
He doesn't know.

1042
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,279
It depends on you.
We'll do what you want.

1043
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,759
We also don't know...

1044
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,479
We can decide together!

1045
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,359
Maybe.

1046
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,239
Sure!

1047
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,559
What do you think, Delphine?

1048
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,119
Me? Nothing.

1049
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,879
Nothing.

1050
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,799
You and your cigarettes!

1051
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,839
Where are they?

1052
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,959
Here!

1053
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,879
It's normal for women.
I could put mine there too.

1054
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,959
I'll stick with my flowers.

1055
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,239
Ja? That's German.

1056
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,039
Ya is English.

1057
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,599
It's real German.

1058
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,639
You speak German?

1059
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,119
I no speak German.

1060
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,479
They're a riot, Delphine!

1061
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,279
You're French. I'm English.

1062
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,519
Delphine's sad.

1063
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,159
This isn't her day.

1064
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,359
- What's wrong?
- Who knows!

1065
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,599
But we're out to have fun!

1066
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,239
You are?

1067
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,079
Great! Delphine, too?

1068
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,719
Of course!

1069
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,679
- What's she think?
- What are you doing?

1070
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,799
- We could go...
- Where?

1071
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:08,399
There's a little bar,
with a little band.

1072
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,439
Sounds nice.

1073
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,559
Hey, Delphine, a band!

1074
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,959
I'm a musician, too.
And a poet.

1075
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,559
"Make France
the promised land of hope."

1076
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,919
Know what I am?

1077
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,559
English, you already said.

1078
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,199
No, what I do.
I'm a musician, too.

1079
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,079
- What instrument?
- Piano.

1080
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,519
What'll I speak now?

1081
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,799
Whatever you like.

1082
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,279
What do you do, usually?
You have friends?

1083
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,279
I don't know anyone.

1084
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,399
It figures. You on vacation here?

1085
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,119
I live here.
We met at the Bayonne fair.

1086
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,039
- Made friends.
- What's Bayonne?

1087
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,479
- A big city.
- I thought it was a sausage.

1088
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,599
No. There's a Bayonne ham.

1089
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,719
"Ham is best...

1090
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,199
when you've still got zest."

1091
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,759
That's cute!

1092
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,559
"Ham is best..."

1093
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,639
Like a hamburger.

1094
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,279
- You from Hamburg?
- A hamburger.

1095
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,799
Delphine, what do you want to do?

1096
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,799
- Wait!
- What do you want?

1097
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,999
Nothing.

1098
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,359
We were a foursome.

1099
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,719
We could've had fun together...

1100
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,759
Why? I don't want to be with you!

1101
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,719
...hear music.

1102
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,319
Why make me do things
I don't want to do?

1103
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,239
I don't know. You reached me.

1104
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,079
I'm all alone here.

1105
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,319
I'm not the one for you.

1106
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,559
We could walk on the sand.
I mean you no harm.

1107
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,639
I don't want to.

1108
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,359
No! Good-bye!

1109
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,439
Hi, I'd like to know

1110
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,799
the number of the Biarritz station.

1111
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,119
25...

1112
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,039
...5203. Thank you.

1113
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,399
SATURDAY, AUGUST 4th

1114
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,519
My book interests you?

1115
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,919
Yes... no... I know it.
"The Idiot",

1116
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:50,999
Dostoyevski.

1117
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,159
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

1118
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,879
- Almost finished, huh?
- Just about.

1119
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,639
Like it?

1120
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,319
I can never read in stations.

1121
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,359
- Don't like stations?
- I don't like leaving.

1122
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,839
I'm going back to Paris.
Don't much want to.

1123
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,599
- You Parisian?
- That's right.

1124
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,559
I've had a few days' vacation
in Biarritz.

1125
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:26,839
And you?

1126
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,959
Going to St. Jean de Luz
for a weekend,

1127
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,839
just two days.

1128
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,839
Until Monday.

1129
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,439
- Then what?
- Training.

1130
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,279
For what?

1131
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,119
I'm a cabinetmaker.
It's on-the-job training.

1132
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,239
I'm a secretary. Not very exciting.

1133
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,719
Why?

1134
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,679
Anyway...

1135
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,079
stations get people down.

1136
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,519
- Is St. Jean de Luz far?
- Five minutes away.

1137
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,319
Very pretty...
a little fishing port.

1138
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,119
Know it?

1139
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,519
- What've you done here?
- Not much.

1140
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,839
I saw the North Beach.
Know it?

1141
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,999
I didn't stay long.

1142
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,079
In fact, I've loused up my vacation.

1143
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,079
Why? Weather bad?

1144
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,919
- What's so funny?
- It's not really funny...

1145
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,839
I'm supposed to go to Paris,

1146
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,639
but... I...

1147
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,919
What?

1148
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,639
- I don't know St. Jean de Luz.
- It's awfully pretty.

1149
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,199
Maybe I could take tonight's train.

1150
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,839
Sure, a night train!

1151
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,199
I mean... I just mean...

1152
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,759
Take me with you?

1153
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,039
OK, sure!

1154
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,319
I'm wary of guys.

1155
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,399
I'm crazy.
I don't meet any... any more.

1156
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,119
I meet guys who run after me
to have a drink,

1157
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,879
for silly things...

1158
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,119
Maybe for sex, and all that.

1159
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,919
I turn them all down.

1160
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,079
You never run after guys?

1161
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:00,119
No, just you.
I don't know why I was so blatant...

1162
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,279
I'm not sorry, but it's a risk.
I don't know what'll happen.

1163
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,519
You've never loved a man?

1164
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,999
Because you say
all men are in love...

1165
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,319
I never said they were.

1166
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,559
They're certainly not
in love with me.

1167
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,759
They chase me a while,
I know it's not love,

1168
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,559
because...
I know what a guy wants from me,

1169
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,399
and I know it's no big deal...

1170
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,519
I know when a man looks at me,

1171
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:42,999
and it's no big deal,
it's something superficial

1172
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,319
that he wants from me.

1173
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,879
I think it's too futile.

1174
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,679
Not many men take
a really good look at you.

1175
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,719
When one does, I want to...

1176
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,639
go out to him, to give.

1177
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,919
Yes, I've been in love

1178
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,439
three times in my life.

1179
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,919
Three times.

1180
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,239
Are you in love at the moment?

1181
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,679
But I hope to be.

1182
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,319
It could happen.

1183
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,159
- What's up?
- Nothing...

1184
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,079
I'm a fool!

1185
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,959
- I don't think so.
- I do.

1186
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,319
I haven't met a guy in a long time.

1187
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,159
It's true that I chose...

1188
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,719
to be alone
until I found someone with whom...

1189
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,599
When you go with someone once,

1190
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,119
just like that,

1191
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,199
you feel more alone afterward.

1192
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,119
You go home at night,

1193
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,519
you've slept with a guy once

1194
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,479
and you know
neither one of you cares,

1195
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,959
then nobody's satisfied.

1196
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,039
That's worse than coping
with loneliness.

1197
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,679
So it becomes
an ethical rule of life.

1198
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,879
You live alone for a long time,

1199
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,199
you don't see many guys.

1200
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,199
It drives you nuts,
but in a way...

1201
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,359
within yourself,

1202
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,719
you stay pure...

1203
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,239
you preserve
what little energy you have,

1204
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,199
you keep on dreaming, and waiting.

1205
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:45,839
It's better to wait than to...
than to ruin...

1206
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,959
Than spoiling your hopes.

1207
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,719
I talk a lot,
but I don't expect anything.

1208
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,039
I'm fed up!

1209
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,719
GREEN RAY

1210
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,079
There is one thing... incredible!

1211
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:25,239
- What?
- You can't understand...

1212
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,479
You couldn't know.

1213
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,639
Will you come there with me?

1214
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,559
To watch the sun set? Will you?

1215
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,479
Working Monday?

1216
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,039
I have vacation time left.

1217
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:09,039
Will you spend a few days
with me near Bayonne?

1218
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,199
You're making fun of me.
You're kidding.

1219
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,159
- No I'm not.
- You are!

1220
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,439
Why would I kid you?

1221
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,639
Why do you want me
to spend a few days with you?

1222
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,519
I'd like it.

1223
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,959
That's all.

1224
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,639
It's simple.

1225
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,119
Let yourself go.

1226
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,159
Come on...

1227
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,239
Be nice...

1228
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,679
Don't want to?

1229
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,039
- Say you will.
- No, wait!

1230
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,839
I'd enjoy it.

1231
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,679
- We'll wait a little.
- What?

1232
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,319
We'll wait.
Please be patient.

1233
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,159
Wait for what?

1234
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,319
- Ever see the green ray?
- No. What's that?

1235
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,959
The last ray at sunset.

1236
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,119
Jules Verne wrote a book on it.

1237
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,199
I haven't read it.

1238
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,679
- Doesn't it bring luck?
- Not exactly.

1239
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,399
It helps you to know...

1240
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,399
- What?
- Tell you later.

1241
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:32,079
What do you learn?
I'd like to know.

1242
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,799
So would I.

1243
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,679
I think I get it.

1244
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,519
Are you crying?

1245
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,799
I mustn't.

1246
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,679
Don't cry.

1247
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,679
Look!

1248
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,239
Wait...

1249
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,159

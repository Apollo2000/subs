00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:57,828
Whoo!

5
00:00:58,176 --> 00:00:59,569
Dang it.

6
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:03,486
Hey. What's up, man?

7
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,532
- Good. Is this your Bimmer?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,317
Okay, cool. I'm almost done.
I just gotta do the interior.

9
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,622
- I'm Chris, by the way.

10
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,536
Keith.
Nice to meet you, Keith.

11
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,798
Be like, five minutes.

12
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,104
- You good. Take your time.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:14,845
- Where you from, man?
- Birmingham, Alabama.

14
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,455
Birmingham. Whoa, okay.

15
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:17,761
I'm a Florida guy.

16
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,458
Born and raised.

17
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:20,938
Just trying to hustle,
do my thing, you know.

18
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,157
Yeah, same here.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,462
You gotta fake it
till you make it, right?

20
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:24,811
That's it!

21
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:25,725
That's what
I'm talking about.

22
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:26,813
You know what's up.

23
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:28,859
Okay. Right on. Cool.

24
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,687
I knew a guy that, like,
got a, uh...

25
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:46,703
Shit!

26
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,358
That was my high school crush.

27
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,489
- Huh?
- I swear to God,

28
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:51,664
that's my crush
from high school.

29
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:52,796
- For real?
- Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,537
- That's Maria Li.
- For real?

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,495
I haven't seen her
in forever, man. I'm like...

32
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,323
- All right. Yeah.
- I'm shaking. Yeah, dude.

33
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,542
That's why I got quiet.

34
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,500
'Cause I promised myself
next time I saw her,

35
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:02,632
I was gonna ask her out.

36
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,807
But I haven't seen her
in forever.

37
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,808
I don't even know
if she remembers me.

38
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:05,765
Oh, man.
Shoot, you're just shy.

39
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:06,723
- You think so?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:07,898
I look like a schlub, though.

41
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,334
Nah, you look good, man.

42
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,857
You think so?

43
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,337
The least you could do is
just... "Hey, how you doing?

44
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,425
- "You remember me?"
- Yeah?

45
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,948
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

46
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:16,515
- "Good to see you."
- All right. Cool.

47
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,908
I'll vacuum your car

48
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,910
and then I'll get you
out of here. Yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,694
Can you just
hit that "on" switch

50
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:22,956
on the vacuum for me?
Thanks, man.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,610
- Right here?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks, man.

52
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:27,787
Yeah, there's probably so many
other guys that wanna...

53
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:28,875
Shit.

54
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,920
Oh, shit.

55
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,271
Shit!

56
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,795
Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!
What the fuck?

57
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,971
No, no, no.

58
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,886
No, no, no.
Oh, my God! Turn it off.

59
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,236
What did you press?

60
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,498
Turn it off! What the fuck?

61
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,716
I'm gonna get fired again.

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,283
- Oh, shit.
- Give me your jacket.

63
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,067
Jacket, jacket,
jacket, jacket.

64
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,853
Thanks, man. Holy fuck.
Why, why, why?

65
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:51,724
- What did you do?
- I just pressed "on".

66
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:53,335
Shit.

67
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:54,727
Oh, now, that's Maria.

68
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,555
That's Maria. Holy shit.

69
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,948
- Hey, excuse me, sir.
- Oh, God.

70
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,429
Hi. Hey. Hi.

71
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,692
Um, do you know how long
an interior detail takes?

72
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,346
I'm a little bit in a rush.

73
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,695
I just wanna know how long
it's gonna take.

74
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:07,958
- Um, I'm not sure.
- Psst! Psst!

75
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,699
Don't let her leave.
Don't let her leave.

76
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,048
Okay.

77
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,354
I'm just gonna go
to another car wash.

78
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:13,920
- Wait, wait. Keith!
- Okay, thank you.

79
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:15,879
- Okay. Thanks.
- Get her number.

80
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:16,923
Get her number.
Get her number.

81
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,316
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,536
Can I get your number
to have somebody call you?

83
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,407
My number? No. Uh...

84
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,757
Thank you, though.
I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

85
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:32,461
Hey, dude,
what the fuck just happened?

86
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,027
She's left, dude?

87
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:35,072
Fuck.

88
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,423
I was so close, though.

89
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,643
- No, you weren't.
- Damn it.

90
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,388
Bud, you will never guess

91
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:47,737
who I just ran into
at the car wash.

92
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,608
It was crazy. Let's hang out.

93
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:50,783
Okay, cool.
I got a customer.

94
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,350
I'll see you after work.

95
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:54,439
All right, bro.
I'll talk to you soon.

96
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:55,484
Hi. How can I help you?

97
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,789
I broke this.

98
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,096
Is there any way
you could possibly fix it?

99
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,359
I don't know if it's
ruined completely, but...

100
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,622
I think there's something
we can actually do.

101
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,102
Luckily, we're not as busy...

102
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,582
Yeah. Are you normally
pretty busy?

103
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,931
Yeah. For some reason

104
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:08,932
everybody's breaking
their phone.

105
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,110
Can I get your information?

106
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,521
- 0-5-7...
- What up, bro?

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,872
What up...
What up, Trina? What's up?

108
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,440
Nothing much.

109
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:39,702
- How you doing?
- Hi. How are you?

110
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,443
Good, good, good.

111
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:42,748
Y'all see that car
right there?

112
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,402
That's yours?

113
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,534
Yeah, that's my
Bad Bitch right there.

114
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,449
When you see it,
it make everything okay.

115
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:49,015
'Cause it's kinda like
Pepto-Bismol.

116
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,496
- There you go. There you go.
- It fixes everything.

117
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,671
I like to drink Pepto-Bismol

118
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,020
with a little bit of Hennessy
in it.

119
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,109
- Really?
- Yeah, it's good.

120
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,589
What you need?

121
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,069
I need 50 bucks.

122
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,550
I'm at work right now.

123
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,029
You can't be in here asking me
for money in front of

124
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:04,335
- everybody like that.
- I'm sorry.

125
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,989
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, no. That's okay.

126
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,512
This is my little brother.
Come on.

127
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,557
First of all,
ain't you supposed

128
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,688
to be on house arrest?

129
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,037
House arrest,
smouse arrest.

130
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,082
Ain't nobody worried
about that.

131
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,910
Let me hold 50.

132
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:16,521

00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:20,830
That's all I got.

136
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:23,833

00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,095

141
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,885
No, this is mine.

142
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:35,105
I'm so sick of you
with your stupid threats.

143
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,498
Give me this.

144
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:41,590
Fuckin' crybaby-ass bitch.

145
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:45,071
You ain't never
gonna get out this town.

146
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,073
You ain't never gonna be shit.
You know what?

147
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,858
Fuck house arrest.
Fuck all this shit.

148
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,774
Hey, hold that for me.

149
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,950
And here.

150
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:55,865
- No, no, no.
- That's for you.

151
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,780
Keep your mouth shut.

152
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,085
- But...
- You too.

153
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,567
Don't say nothin'.
I remember faces.

154
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,526
I'm gonna kill every one of
you white motherfuckers

155
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,918
if you snitch.

156
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,794
Cheers. Thank you.

157
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,754
Got you a snack
to cheer you up.

158
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,103
Cheers. Ding.

159
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:20,759
- Thanks, man.
- Of course.

160
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,587
Don't let her get
in your mind, bro.

161
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,763
You gotta stand up
to her, man.

162
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,069
You know my sister.

163
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,462
It's hard to stand up to her.
She's a bully.

164
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,595
I think Trina's right, man.

165
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,031
I don't think we're ever gonna
get out of this town.

166
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,555
- No.
- Man, I hate that shit.

167
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,557
No. Trina is not right, dog.

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,646
I'm telling you,
seeing Maria today,

169
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,212
that was a positive omen, man.

170
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,128
Mark my words,
by this time next year,

171
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,782
we're gonna be
out of these jobs.

172
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:45,958
We're gonna be going
on big adventures.

173
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,960
All right.

174
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,191
Hello?

175
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:17,773
Oh! What the fuck?

176
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,035
Who are you?

177
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:20,210
- I'm a plumber.
- What time is it?

178
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:24,257
Fuck, I'm late!
I'm late! I'm late for work!

179
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,042
I'm late!

180
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:27,870
Oh, I'm late for work!
Shit, shit.

181
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,701
Oh, God!

182
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,227
I cannot get fired.

183
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:38,707
God damn it.

184
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,060
Shortcut.

185
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,672
Shit.

186
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,070
I was looking at my watch.
Sorry!

187
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:03,253
Ow.

188
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,565
Oh, my God.

189
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,219
Oh! Whoa!

190
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:15,657
Sorry.

191
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:19,051
I thought the window was open.

192
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,097
I'm late for work. My bad.

193
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:38,070
I can help you.

194
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:39,376
Thank you.

195
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,685
Have a good one.

196
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,383
- Bye.
- Bye.

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,219
Shit. No, shit.

198
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:57,307
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,091
Sorry!

200
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,093
What the fuck, dude?

201
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:02,965
I'm late. I'm late. I'm late.

202
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:08,100
Oh, shit. Damn it.

203
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,928
I'm sorry about that.
Sorry. Are you okay?

204
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,277
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

205
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,670
Allow me. Ladies first.

206
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,758
Thank you.

207
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,630
After you.

208
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,415
All right. Nice! I made it.

209
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:27,380
Can you, um, tell me
about the detox?

210
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:29,948
Uh, it kind of makes you poop.

211
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:31,689
You'll be in the bathroom
for a while.

212
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,256
- Okay.
- Yeah.

213
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,910
Yeah. You wanna try
our new flavor?

214
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,128
Oh, it's not a margarita?

215
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,217
Oh, I wish.

216
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,350
Put some of this in there.

217
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,658
Some mango or whatever.

218
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:46,095
But why would you put a spoon
in there

219
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,792
if you're gonna use your hand?

220
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,446
Oh, sometimes I forget.

221
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,927
You know, the best chefs
in the world use their hands.

222
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,407
No, no, no, no, no.

223
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:55,844
That's unacceptable.

224
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,284
You work in health care,
you know...

225
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,982
Germs actually help
your immune system.

226
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,245
No, no, no.
You're touchin' the counters.

227
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:07,725
You're touchin' the counters.

228
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,031
You're touchin' all these
different things,

229
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,336
and then you're gonna put
your hand in there

230
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,947
and comment you're a chef?

231
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,166
And we supposed to
accept that?

232
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,994
Here, you want money
or something? Like...

233
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:17,474
You can take out of this jar.

234
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,954
Like, it doesn't even go
to that. Like...

235
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,347
Can we just all settle
on that?

236
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:35,797
What in the world?

237
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,412
Maria!

238
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,893
I'm sorry.
Was that loud? Maria.

239
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,285
- Come, come...
- Hi.

240
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,766
She's a VIP customer.

241
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,985
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah.

242
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,203
Just cut in front of
these people.

243
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,379
- Hi, sorry. Hi.
- I'm sorry, guys.

244
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:55,033
How you gonna do that
right there?

245
00:10:55,077 --> 00:11:00,082
She's a VIP, but we're in line
and we gotta get waited on.

246
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,084
- Sorry.
- Chris Carey.

247
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,521
From high school.
Biology class.

248
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,262
- You know, "Crazy Chris".
- Um...

249
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,393
"Retard Chris".

250
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:09,221
- Oh!
- Yeah!

251
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,833
- How the hell are you?
- Oh, my God, Chris.

252
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,138
I haven't seen you
in forever.

253
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,314
Yeah. I'm actually living
in New York City.

254
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:17,229
Wow, New York! The Big Apple.

255
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:18,578
Yeah.

256
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:20,102
Hey, that's an apple
I'd like to juice. Right?

257
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,062
What are you doing up there?
I've never been up there.

258
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:27,413
Oh, I'm actually, um,
a curator at an art gallery.

259
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,807
- So, yeah.
- Right on.

260
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,244
Um, here, uh, have a juice.
On the house.

261
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:34,203
- Okay. Oh.
- Huh?

262
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:36,901
This is terrible.
This is not good at all.

263
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,816
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's terrible.

264
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,253
I'm at work and it gets crazy
at work sometimes.

265
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:42,777
This is not good.

266
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:44,953
What do you, uh...

267
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:48,043
What...

268
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,436
What would you say, like...

269
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,917
What do you, uh...
What are you doing later?

270
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,398
You wanna, like,
get a bite or something?

271
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,531
I... God, I would
love to actually,

272
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:01,317
but I'm on my way
to the airport right now.

273
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,319
Yeah, there's this big
art show I'm doing on Friday

274
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:05,147
that I have to get back for.

275
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,279
- Oh, okay. Okay, cool.
- So, yeah.

276
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:09,412
But listen,
if you're ever in Manhattan,

277
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,457
you should come
to the gallery.

278
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,807
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

279
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:20,466
- For real?
- Yeah, I'll show you around.

280
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,033
- Yeah. Okay. Great.
- Thank you for this.

281
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,340
- This is so great.
- This is great.

282
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:25,645
- Okay, I'll see you.
- Mix it up.

283
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:26,951
- Mix it up.
- I'll see you later.

284
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:27,909
Great seeing you, Chris.

285
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:30,259
See ya.

286
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,612
Can we order now?

287
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:48,625
Oh, my God!

288
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,586
Oh, my God.
He fell down, he fell down.

289
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,851
Yes!

290
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:13,041
You mind if I, uh,
ask you for advice?

291
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,347
I just saw my dream girl

292
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,133
and I finally mustered up
the courage to ask her out.

293
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,309
I'm in total shock.

294
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:23,921
Why? 'Cause she's accepted
or what?

295
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,358
Yeah. But she lives
in New York, that's the catch.

296
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:28,186
- So what?
- I've never felt this way

297
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,361
about a woman before.

298
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,015
What do you have going here?

299
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,364
I don't got anything
going here,

300
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:33,670
- that's the thing.
- No?

301
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,193
I got, you know,
my best friend is here.

302
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,281
My friend, Bud.

303
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,587
Man, you know, I say...

304
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,677
Go for it.

305
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,114
If you don't,
the rest of your life,

306
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:46,030
you're gonna be sitting here
saying, "What if I woulda?

307
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,249
"What if I coulda?"

308
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,425
Yeah. What am I doing here?

309
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:51,470
I can't...

310
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,951
I can't just wait around
and hope for things to happen.

311
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,257
I gotta make it happen.

312
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,649
There you go. Claim it.

313
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,216
Claim it. Yes.

314
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,739
- Yeah.
- Thank you, man.

315
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:01,437
Thanks for the advice, man.

316
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,440
I'm going to New York.

317
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:10,185
I saw a girl today

318
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:14,189
I saw a girl, no way

319
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:18,236
I saw a girl today

320
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,979
And her name is Maria

321
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:25,113
I saw a girl today

322
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,244
What the...

323
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:28,029
The one that got away

324
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,508
I saw a...

325
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,076
Holy cow!

326
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,470
And her name is Maria

327
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:36,602
Whoo! Thank you, man.

328
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:39,649
I owe you. Thank you. Whoo!

329
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,781
I'm going to New York,
brother! Thank you!

330
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,479
Whoo!

331
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:47,222
He's in love. He's crazy.

332
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:52,618
I saw a girl today

333
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,098
What? Get off me.

334
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:56,622
I saw a girl, no way

335
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,189
What are you doing?

336
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,451
I saw a girl today

337
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:00,800
Get the fuck away from me.

338
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:03,325
And her name is Maria

339
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,593
Spinning my wheels,
I haven't done shit

340
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:13,378
I'm out of here,
I fucking quit

341
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:16,120
Maria has opened the door

342
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:19,558
Later, smoothies,
I'm off to New York

343
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:22,387
He saw a girl today

344
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,475
Oh, shit.

345
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,129
He saw her girl, no way

346
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,699
He saw a girl today

347
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,746
And her name is Maria

348
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:39,665
I saw a girl today

349
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:42,668
I saw a girl, no way

350
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,366
Shit!

351
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,761
I saw a girl today

352
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:53,201
And her name is Maria

353
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,728
Maria

354
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,340
Maria

355
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:06,649
Maria

356
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,218
The fuck?

357
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:14,178
I'm telling you,

358
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,790
Maria just fell out of the sky
into my lap today.

359
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,184
And said, "Hey, Chris,
I haven't seen you in ages.

360
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:21,403
"What have you been up to?"
And I go...

361
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,752
"I don't know,
I just been working

362
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:23,970
"at the mall
since high school."

363
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:25,711
And she was, like,
"Oh, well, good news.

364
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,540
"I'm your guardian
fucking angel.

365
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:30,542
"And I'mma take you
outta this hellscape

366
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:33,676
"and bring you to the
motherfucking promised land!"

367
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,808
So what? I mean,
what does that mean?

368
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,854
Look at our lives, man.

369
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,726
Stuck in Florida,
spinning our wheels,

370
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,207
bullshit job
after bullshit job.

371
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:45,644
It's finally time for that
big adventure, brother.

372
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:50,214
I'm talking road trip
to the NYC!

373
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:52,173
Hey, has anybody here
been to New York City?

374
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:53,348
Yes!

375
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,871
New York

376
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,396
Concrete jungle
Texas albino

377
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,572
My pussy's on fire

378
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,531
Come on! New York, man. Pizza.

379
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,620
Calm down, bruh.

380
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,666
Okay. I hear you, right?
And that sounds good.

381
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,146
Yeah.

382
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,539
But how we gonna get there?
We don't have a car.

383
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,498
I figured it out.

384
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:19,939
Hell, no.
We're not taking Trina's car.

385
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,680
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

386
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,247
Hear me out. Hear me out.

387
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,771
You're the one paying
to store her car.

388
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:26,903
- Right?
- Yes.

389
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,426
Trina is in jail.

390
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,256
She's been in jail.
She's gonna stay in jail.

391
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,564
She is in J-A-I-L. Prison.

392
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:36,913
- I'm not doing this.
- Okay.

393
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,306
- Trina is crazy.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

394
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,263
You know that.
We can't take her car.

395
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,612
It's her car.

396
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,179
Just for once,
in your whole life,

397
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,267
forget about Trina.

398
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,182
Think about us.

399
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:47,271
Let's steal that goddamn car
and go to New York

400
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:48,794
and have the adventure
of a lifetime

401
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:50,405
that we always talked about.

402
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,756
I hate you.

403
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:59,501
We're going to New York!

404
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:02,852
Here you go. Bud Malone.

405
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,810
Yeah, we're driving
to New York.

406
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,856
- Looks good.
- What's your name again?

407
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:09,598
Kurt? Bud, Chris.
Nice to meet you.

408
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:10,947
- Nice to meet ya.
- Nice to meet ya, man.

409
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:24,787
Choo-choo!

410
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:28,965
Check this out, bruh.

411
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,314
I got it all mapped out,
all right?

412
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,489
I went on Google Maps
yesterday.

413
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,664
I get everything together,
right?

414
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,231
We're gonna take
the I-95, right?

415
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:35,537
It's gonna be the quickest way
to get to New York City...

416
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,539
No, no, no. No rush, mi amigo.

417
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,368
We got four whole days
till Maria's art opening.

418
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,935
We can kick back, relax,
and breathe in America, dude.

419
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:45,851
- Hey.
- Ow!

420
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:47,070
Feet down, man.

421
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,246
You cannot mess up
my sister's car, man.

422
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,465
Will you relax?

423
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:53,250
The car is fine.
Your sister's in prison.

424
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,861
She'll never know.
What's she gonna do?

425
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:58,212
Bust outta jail?

426
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,407
Bus is all clear.

427
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:27,023
Psst! Psst!

428
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:29,895
Excuse me.

429
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:31,419
I'm stuck up here.
I'm stuck.

430
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,769
Can you help me get out?

431
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,467
Please. I'm stuck under here.

432
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,729
Oh, God.

433
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,688
Oh. Thank you.

434
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:44,954
Oh, shit.

435
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:47,696
Hey. Shh.

436
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:49,611
Oh, man.

437
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,352
You see any guards out here
or anything?

438
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,921
You better take your ass off.
You better take off.

439
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:58,054
You better fucking...
You better run.

440
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,361
Man, I'm gonna get my car,
and I'm gonna go to Mexico

441
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,450
and I'm gonna just start
all over, man.

442
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,756
Get those clothes off
and get the fuck outta here.

443
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,018
Can I borrow your vest?

444
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,716
I can't give you my vest.

445
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,457
You my lookout.
I never forget a face.

446
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,762
Go.

447
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,460
Thank you
for helping me escape!

448
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:15,767
Hey.

449
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,989
We had a convict escape.
Did you see anyone?

450
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,080
- Where?
- Where?

451
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,604
They were here somewhere.
Did you see anybody?

452
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,824
No. You said someone escaped?

453
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,782
And you haven't
helped her at all?

454
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:32,654
No. How am I gonna help her?

455
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:35,352
- By giving her my vest?
- I don't know.

456
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:38,312
Did you see someone out here?
I need to know that.

457
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,096
Go that way.

458
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,446
That way?

459
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,361
- Someone went that way?
- Go that way.

460
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,449
Go that way?

461
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:46,755
Go that way.

462
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,626
Okay. It's an emergency.

463
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,628
We got an emergency here.

464
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:00,116
Man, I just wanted
to thank you.

465
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,422
Go, go, go.
He's looking for you.

466
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:02,988
He really?

467
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:04,163
- They're looking for you.
- Oh, shoot. Thank you so much.

468
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:06,514
- Go.
- Thank you so, so much.

469
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,429
I really appreciate you.
You got a baby mama?

470
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:09,778
Run away, please.
Get away from me

471
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:10,822
before I get in trouble.

472
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:12,433
Thank you for helping me.

473
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:13,651
Get the fuck outta here.

474
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:15,044
- Don't! No. Bye!
- Thank you. Thank you.

475
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,655
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

476
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,962
God bless you.
You an accomplice to my shit.

477
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:23,618
Whoo! I'm free!

478
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,188
Look, man,
you don't realize

479
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:30,451
how strong she is, okay?

480
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:31,539
My sister's crazy.

481
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,671
I've told you that
a million times.

482
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,499
She doesn't have
a regular girl hand.

483
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:39,155
I once seen her fry some fish
with her bare hand.

484
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,678
She grabbed the fish
out the batter,

485
00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:42,114
put it in the frying pan.

486
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:44,029
Set it there till it was done.

487
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:47,032
That's insane. I've seen her
flip barbecue ribs.

488
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:49,034
No spatula. Hand.

489
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,080
God.

490
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,041
Pressing the meat. Bare hand.

491
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,566
I... I don't think I wanna eat
at your house anymore.

492
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:05,834
How you doing?

493
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:08,532
- Good, good.
- Hey, hey. Um...

494
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:10,708
I'm really excited
to get my car.

495
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:12,101
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, it's under Malone.

496
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:15,583
Pink Crown Vic.
Crown Victoria.

497
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,149
Someone just picked that up.

498
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:18,542
What?

499
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,588
Bud Malone
just picked that up.

500
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,548
Bud picked up my car?

501
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:26,594
Was he with somebody?

502
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,899
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:29,771
What'd he look like?

504
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:32,077
Uh, they were
African American.

505
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,731
Do you know
where they were going?

506
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:34,906
I think
they said, uh, New York.

507
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,561
- New York?
- Yeah.

508
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,215
Their name was
on the card, so...

509
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:43,741
What's your name, man?

510
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,919
Bob, I ain't trying to go back
to jail for killing nobody.

511
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:49,138
But I'm about to
kill somebody, Bob.

512
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,751
You gave 'em my car,
now they got to die.

513
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:56,624
Sorry.

514
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:03,979
Okay.

515
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,597
Dude, check it out. I got
a Chinese finger trap, man.

516
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,860
It'll be like our good luck
charm on the road.

517
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:17,122
How about this?

518
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,776
I'll ask one of these
fellow Americans

519
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,169
where a cool bar is.

520
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,650
Celebrate. First road trip.

521
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,521
All right, whatever
you say, man. I'm down.

522
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:25,653
Excuse me, sir.

523
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,132
Is there a bar around here?

524
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:29,134
Me and my friend
wanna party tonight.

525
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:30,571
We're going
to Electric Cowboy tonight.

526
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:32,137
Oh, really? Oh, thanks, man.

527
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:33,661
Yeah. If you wanna turn it
around, I'll hold it for you.

528
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,836
Oh, really?

529
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,186
Oh, shit.

530
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:39,928
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

531
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:41,799
Help me. Help me. Help me.

532
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:43,192
Shit.

533
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,237
Quickly, get away.
Get away, bro.

534
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:47,326
Get away from it!
Get away, bro.

535
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,632
Somebody just turn it off.
Turn it off. Turn it off!

536
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:49,851
Get away!

537
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,548
Hello?
Where's the shut-off? God!

538
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:52,854
I swallowed some of it.

539
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:56,640
Where's the shut-off?

540
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:58,163
Here, here, here. Hold this.

541
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:00,688
No, I'm not touching that
shit. Get away from it, bro.

542
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:01,863
Here, let's just
get outta here.

543
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,125
That thing is broken, man.

544
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,561
Come on, man.
Not on the seat, man!

545
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:05,867
Thank you, cowboy man.

546
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,529
Chocolate glazed for you?

547
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:20,229
- Bacon? Sure.
- Great.

548
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:22,013
Hey, man.
You live in this area?

549
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,667
- Do we? Yeah.
- Yeah.

550
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:24,973
You seen this dude?

551
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,583
These dudes right here,
they stole my car.

552
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:28,019
- No, ma'am.
- This is my car right here.

553
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,151
This is my Bad Bitch.

554
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:30,326
Sorry. No, I don't.

555
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,245
Well, they're all here.
They love donuts.

556
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:42,686
- You okay?
- No, man.

557
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,035
Have you seen this car?

558
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,297
I have not.

559
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:47,691
This is my car.

560
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:50,651
My grandma gave me that car
for my 16th birthday.

561
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,566
I just got outta jail.

562
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:53,697
And these dudes,
I know they stole my car, man.

563
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:55,133
Where do you stay at?

564
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,962
"Where do I stay at?"
I stay in the Avenues, man.

565
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:00,704
Okay. You gotta go down
to the precinct.

566
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:02,140
Man, you are handsome.

567
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,707
- Huh?
- You are so handsome.

568
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:05,056
Thank you.

569
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,624
Yeah, you gotta go to, um...

570
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:10,279
You gotta to the, uh,
Zone Four Precinct.

571
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,629
Man.

572
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:15,719
It's been so long since a man
looked me in my eyes.

573
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,112
- You are beautiful.
- Thank you.

574
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:18,069
You gotta go
to the Zone Four Precinct.

575
00:25:18,113 --> 00:25:19,157
Can we kiss?

576
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,985
- No.
- No?

577
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,727
It's been so long
since I kissed a man.

578
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:25,816
What's your name, Officer?
Can I get your number?

579
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,731
No. I'm married.

580
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,298
So? You a police.

581
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:30,734
Y'all don't care
about shit like that.

582
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:31,996
I do.

583
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,781
My pussy hairy like a booty.

584
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,785
Hey, hey, hey.

585
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,830
Excuse me. Y'all been out here
eating donuts and stuff.

586
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,049
You seen these guys?

587
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,311
Have you seen these two dudes?

588
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:43,965
- No.
- They stole my car.

589
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,272
They ain't trying
to holla at me.

590
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:48,752
They're not helping at all.

591
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,275
- Oh, wow.
- That's what I'm saying.

592
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,755
So you doing it
yourself right now?

593
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,757
- Basically.
- Say "yes" to it.

594
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,237
Yes. Say "yes" to it.

595
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,239
You know what?
Sometimes you just gotta

596
00:25:57,282 --> 00:25:59,110
- do shit yourself.
- Uh-uh. You better not!

597
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:00,938
Fuck the police!

598
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:02,287
I'mma kill
these motherfuckers.

599
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,637
Oh, my God!

600
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:05,421
Holy shit!

601
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:07,945
Holy shit!

602
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,994
Hey! Hey, hey!

603
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,084
Oh, my God!

604
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,266
Damn it.

605
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,660
He's got to feel
like an idiot, doesn't he?

606
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,147
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:38,454
Hey, White Chicks.

608
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,325
Oh, yes.

609
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,153
That's my favorite movie
right there, man.

610
00:26:42,197 --> 00:26:43,285
You know something?

611
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,156
The first time
I saw that movie, right?

612
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,723
Halfway through
I really thought

613
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,203
they were white women.

614
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,988
They look like, uh,
burn victims in that movie.

615
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:53,164
You're stupid. You don't know
anything about good cinema.

616
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,514
I'm more like, "God damn,
some thick-ass white girls."

617
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,951
Fat-ass booties.

618
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:58,387
I was like, "they got
black girl booties."

619
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,957
Terry Crews was convinced.
You saw the movie.

620
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,743
Ah, this is it.

621
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:09,354
This is the place the cowboy
was talking about.

622
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:12,227
Look at this place, man.
Fuck yes!

623
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:15,230
All right. Whoo!

624
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,538
Yo!

625
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:21,192
Chris, I don't know
about this, man.

626
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:25,414
Dude, trust me.
It's gonna rock. Whoo!

627
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:27,068
It's called
Electric Cowboy, though.

628
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:28,156
Mmm-hmm. Exactly.

629
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,374
We're not cowboys.

630
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:31,202
We're about to be.

631
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,347
What do you think, man? Huh?

632
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,436
USA, baby!

633
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,352
We are the only black people
in here.

634
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,397
I don't see race.
Didn't even notice.

635
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,399
You know what race I see?
The American race.

636
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,272
Right out on that dance floor.

637
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:04,845
Sorry.

638
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:12,809
Bud, this is awesome!

639
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:13,941
Get your ass over here.

640
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:21,078
- Great job!
- Thank you. Thank you.

641
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:23,298
Let's get some shots, huh?

642
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,561
First night of the road trip.

643
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,390
Couldn't ask for a better
partner on the road.

644
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:34,483
Let me buy you a round.

645
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,354
Let me buy you
a round of some shots.

646
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:38,052
Yeah, this is
my best friend, Bud.

647
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,531
He's a little shy.

648
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:41,142
Cheers. Pick it up. Cheers.

649
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:43,144
Here's to you, Bud Malone.

650
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:50,238
- Wow!
- This should be it, okay?

651
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,544
Give me one more shot.

652
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,289
I guess it do.

653
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:08,473
I would have suggested
not to do that.

654
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:10,432
Did he just drink
outta that thing?

655
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:12,173
I drank
a little bit too much.

656
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:13,348
I'll put it that way.

657
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,308
I gotta make a call
real quick.

658
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:18,962
See you later, pal.

659
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:20,311
What's wrong with him?

660
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:21,617
He's just so wound up.

661
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,140
He's so uptight.
I don't know. Like...

662
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:24,663
Can we pray for him?

663
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:26,143
Do you mind praying for him
real quick?

664
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:27,275
I'm not...

665
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:30,147
Dear Jesus who art in Heaven,

666
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:32,280
Father be thy name.

667
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:34,195
Thy kingdom come.

668
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,938
I hope Bud has an amazing time
on this road trip.

669
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,418
I hope I get to Maria

670
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,029
and we fall in love...

671
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,684
and we make love and have sex
with her without a condom.

672
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:48,905
And, like, of course I'll
make her come first.

673
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:51,473
And then,
I'm kinda free to, like,

674
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:54,389
you know,
jizz whenever I want to.

675
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:56,521
I wanna make her come first,

676
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,567
but then I'll jizz
whenever I want to. So...

677
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,656
- Amen.
- Amen.

678
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,050
I gotta go pee-pee.

679
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:03,964
I'll be right back.

680
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:08,707
Uh, excuse me.
Where's the bathroom?

681
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:10,666
Holy shit. I'm sorry.

682
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,538
How much did you drink?
Are you a fucking camel?

683
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:16,498
Happy birthday, dear Lena

684
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:20,023
Happy birthday to you

685
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:23,200
Shots on him.
Now, I don't know your name.

686
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:24,680
Bud. I've never been out
like this before,

687
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,160
but this is fun.

688
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,378
What do you want a shot of?

689
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:31,165
Hey, DJ, cut the music!

690
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,514
Cut the music!

691
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:34,211
I'd like to make a toast

692
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:37,214
to my best friend, Bud Malone.

693
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,347
What the fuck are you doing
up there? Get down.

694
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,088
Yeah, he's a little nervous.

695
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,612
We're the only
black guys in here.

696
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:46,049
He's the coolest guy
in the world, man.

697
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,398
- Get down from there! Wait!
- I love you all.

698
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,272
Hey, he all right?

699
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,274
Oh, shit!

700
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:54,579
- Are you okay?
- Get him out there.

701
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:56,407
Is he all right?

702
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:57,582
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up. Get up.

703
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:00,934
Give him some room.
Give him some room.

704
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,241
No, no, no.

705
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:05,416
You just fell off
a freaking bar,

706
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,243
so you need to get
checked out.

707
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:07,592
I'm fine.

708
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:09,203
Do you have a water bottle?
Or a cup?

709
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,726
- I got a wet rag.
- Yeah, give him some water.

710
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:21,128
Oh, my God.

711
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,782
Okay. I'm serious about
calling this guy an ambulance.

712
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:25,610
- He's not okay if he's puking.
- I'm fine.

713
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:28,744
Somebody needs to get me
a fucking drink and chill out.

714
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:29,963
No, seriously,
that's not gonna be good.

715
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:42,018
Easy now, killer.

716
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:50,374
What the fuck is wrong
with you? Like, seriously?

717
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:52,768
I wanted to celebrate you.

718
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:56,641
This is a celebration of you
and your life.

719
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:01,298
I don't know. Thank you
for talking me into this.

720
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:03,779
Felt good to be out.
I needed it.

721
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,352
We should probably get
some rest or wash up.

722
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,550
Good night, Bud.

723
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:38,031
Night, Chris.

724
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:41,773
God damn it.
What type of light is this?

725
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:44,385
What the fuck?

726
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:48,171
One day closer
to Maria.

727
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:49,607
- All right, let's do this.
- All right. Okay.

728
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:50,695
I feel good.
It's a new day, right?

729
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:51,827
Yeah, a new day.

730
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,742
Okay. USA.

731
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:24,599
The price of art
is skyrocketing.

732
00:33:24,642 --> 00:33:27,384
This is the first one that
I wanted to show because it's

733
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,386
the one that there's
a lot of debate about.

734
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,562
I was thinking it looked like
Lord of the Rings, uh, thing.

735
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:33,564
It kinda looks like, uh,

736
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,218
a relic.

737
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:41,137
Maria.

738
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:42,312
Chris?

739
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:43,748
Oh, God. Yes.

740
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:45,359
Yes, Chris! Yes!

741
00:33:47,274 --> 00:33:49,624
Chris.

742
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,584
Chris!

743
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,718
Chris!

744
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,156
This looks awesome.

745
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,767
We're doing
some free sampling.

746
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:04,421
Well, let's get, like,
three of those,

747
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:05,683
and maybe some bread.

748
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:07,294
Hey, looking good, babe.

749
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:10,775
You talking to my girl?

750
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:11,863
- I got this. I got this, baby.
- Oh, that's your girl?

751
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:13,126
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry about that.

752
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:13,778
- Are you sure?
- I got this. You all right?

753
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:15,258
Come on.

754
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:16,738
You like hitting on
women at farmers markets?

755
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:19,393
- What's wrong with you?
- Piece of shit!

756
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:20,481
- Crazy ass.
- What the fuck are you doing?

757
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:21,830
You're fucking
hitting on me here?

758
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,179
What's wrong with you?

759
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:24,876
Damn. What the fuck?

760
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,270
- Fuck. Crazy bitch.
- That is hot.

761
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:28,141
What are you looking at?

762
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,666
Hey, he's blind.
He's blind.

763
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,842
He's blind.
He's blind. Please!

764
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,626
Fucker.

765
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:39,456
Get his money. Get his money.
Get his money.

766
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,371
- No! He didn't do anything.
- What is happening?

767
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,417
Run. Let's run. Let's run.
Let's just go. Let's just go.

768
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,374
Go, go, go!

769
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,680
Go, go, go!

770
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:46,811
- Oh, my God.
- Stop!

771
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:58,519
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

772
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,869
You may kiss the bride.

773
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:10,183
And you may now

774
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:11,880
kiss me.

775
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,491
Uh...

776
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:15,710
What?

777
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,886
Oh, my God.

778
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,802
Okay, there's no way
White Chickswould work

779
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:06,282
- in real life, man.
- I'm telling you...

780
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:07,544
They look like bleached
Ninja Turtles.

781
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:09,024
Bruh, matter of fact,

782
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,634
this lady right here.
That could be a brother.

783
00:36:10,678 --> 00:36:12,027
That's ridiculous.
Okay, watch this.

784
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,376
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

785
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:15,378
Are you a black man?

786
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:16,901
No.

787
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:18,773
Case in point.

788
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,904
Why would you ask
somebody that?

789
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:21,906
You said that it could work.

790
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,081
It'd look frightening.

791
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,388
Wait a minute. What is this?

792
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,303
The zoo?
Come on, man.

793
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:28,565
You know I love zoos.

794
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:29,697
We gotta do this, bruh.

795
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,089
I think we got time, right?

796
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,395
Yeah. We're more
than halfway there.

797
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,483
We're making great time.

798
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,485
- Thank you, ma'am.
- No problem.

799
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:36,747
Or black sir.

800
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,577
Take care, brother.

801
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,328
Dude, zoos are sick!

802
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:53,764
- This makes me happy, man.
- You're having fun,

803
00:36:53,808 --> 00:36:54,852
- aren't you?
- I'm having fun.

804
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:55,940
Look at that.
That's a fancy cat.

805
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,335
- Two buds on the road.
- What up?

806
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:00,728
- Booyah.
- Booyah.

807
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:01,903
I like it, man.

808
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:03,339
- This is a good idea.
- Yeah, man.

809
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:05,950
Zoo life, baby!

810
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:07,082
Right now,
we'd like to take you guys

811
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,953
up here to see our wolves

812
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,955
and our large primate area.

813
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:12,609
Do me a favor, everybody,

814
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:15,351
and keep just
a little bit of room off here.

815
00:37:15,395 --> 00:37:16,657
Okay, come on in.

816
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:20,008
Oh, I like the Silverback.

817
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:22,097
Hey.

818
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,969
Step on in, guys.
Step on in.

819
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:26,928
Guys, this is Jesse.
Everybody can say hi to Jesse.

820
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,016
- Dude.
- Hey, Jesse.

821
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,409
Gorilla.

822
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:31,411
Dude.

823
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:34,631
- The gate's open.
- Why don't you close that?

824
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:35,937
- Put it down.
- Shut up.

825
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,155
I'm gonna get a selfie
with the gorilla.

826
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,809
- No. No.
- Yes. For Maria.

827
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:39,941
Come on. It'll melt her heart.

828
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:40,985
Are you crazy?

829
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:42,726
Come back here.

830
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,511
Shut up. Don't wake him up.

831
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,077
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shut up. Keep it down.

832
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:47,601
Hey. No, don't.

833
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:48,993
Come back here.

834
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:51,169
Come back here. Here.

835
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:52,649
Hey.

836
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,738
Good.

837
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:56,697
Very good. Good work.

838
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,133
So this is Gideon,

839
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,788
and he is our primary
ambassador wolf over here.

840
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:03,399
And Gideon is really,
really good at jumping.

841
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,010
Good.

842
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:09,449
He's got my leg!

843
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,452
Oh, my God!

844
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:14,367
Sir!
Sir, you can't be in there.

845
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:16,673
Oh, my God!

846
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:17,979
Oh, my God!

847
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,548
Hey, hey.

848
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,810
Please.

849
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:24,377
Be quiet. Be quiet.

850
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:27,510
Don't look him
in the eye.

851
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:28,381
I'm so scared.

852
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,471
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

853
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:32,863
Oh, my God!

854
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:34,691
- Oh, my God!
- Stay calm.

855
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:36,563
- Stay calm.
- Bud, help me.

856
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,651
Oh, my God.

857
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,699
- Stop that!
- Oh, my God!

858
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,051
You fucking a man.

859
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,184
He's a human being.

860
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,491
Oh, my God. Fuck.

861
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:52,709
- What's his name?
- His name is Chris.

862
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,058
Chris, come on!

863
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:57,061
Stay still.

864
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:58,889
- Shit! Shit!
- Stay calm. Stay calm.

865
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,064
- Stay calm.
- Shit!

866
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:02,502
- Oh, shit.
- Jimmy, back in.

867
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:03,590
Jimmy, back in.
Bananas for you.

868
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,721
Shit! Damn, we on this.

869
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:07,594
Help me, Jesus. Jesus!

870
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,118
- Back in there.
- Jesus!

871
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,076
Would you put the lock on
or something?

872
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,035
- Good boy.
- Why did you go in there?

873
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:15,863
The rest of us have kids.

874
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:17,560
I wanted to take a picture.

875
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:19,693
You wanted to take a picture
of the gorilla?

876
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:21,085
- Face to face?
- Yeah, for this girl.

877
00:39:21,129 --> 00:39:23,087
Would she go in there
for you?

878
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,611
- No.
- Exactly.

879
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,177
So why are you
going in there for her?

880
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:27,918
I'm trying to get her
to be my girlfriend.

881
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:29,790
She's not your girlfriend yet?

882
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,748
No. I gotta get my cell phone.

883
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,097
- No, you can't go in there.
- What the fuck are you doing?

884
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:34,577
Sir, you can't go in there.

885
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,753
If that damn thing come back,
you gonna be through.

886
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:37,580
Oh, here it is.

887
00:39:44,152 --> 00:39:45,545
Keep your mouth closed!

888
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:51,028
What are you doing
in there?

889
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:52,116
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

890
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,119
Bud.

891
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,599
How did he get
in there?

892
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:58,122
Pull your pants up, buddy.

893
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:03,606
Hey, excuse me,
brothers.

894
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,303
- Y'all seen this car today?
- No.

895
00:40:05,347 --> 00:40:07,305
This my brother Bud
and his friend Chris.

896
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,612
This dude don't look familiar
to you at all?

897
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:11,614
- No.
- You sure you don't know them?

898
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:12,963
I'm pretty sure
I don't know them.

899
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:14,791
Okay. We gotta walk. Okay?

900
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,227
This ain't you, man?

901
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:18,142
- That ain't.
- Your name ain't Craig?

902
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:19,404
Yeah.

903
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:20,754
And you're telling me
you don't know them?

904
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:22,146
You sitting up here
lying to me in my face?

905
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,757
This is you and them.

906
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,019
You, Bud, Chris.

907
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:28,022
Craig.

908
00:40:28,065 --> 00:40:30,024
- Where'd you get that picture?
- This is you!

909
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,982
- I know.
- Your name is Craig, right?

910
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:33,636
It is. And I don't know them.

911
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,551
Where is these dudes at?

912
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:36,639
Dude, I don't know
where they're at.

913
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:37,901
Well, when you see them...

914
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:38,989
The next time you see
these motherfuckers,

915
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,469
let 'em know
I'mma kill their ass.

916
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:42,689
Well, I ain't got your car,
and stop yelling at me.

917
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,647
No, you know
where my car at, Craig.

918
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:47,650
I've seen your ass on Facebook
and everything with them.

919
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:48,695
What the fuck
are you talking about?

920
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,826
Where's my car at?

921
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,132
Ask your fucking brother!

922
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:53,003
Well, tell me
where my brother is!

923
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:54,657
And why the fuck
would I know that?

924
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:57,007
Because you're taking pictures
with these niggas!

925
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:58,966
I just want you to
tell me where my car is.

926
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:00,358
Well, if I knew where your car
fucking was, I would.

927
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:01,621
Would you?

928
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:02,970
- Yes, I would.
- Would you really?

929
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,275
- Would you? Really?
- Yes. Why wouldn't I?

930
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,538
'Cause I feel like
you lying to me right now.

931
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:06,626
I feel like you are
a motherfucking liar!

932
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,844
You feel like
everybody's lying to ya.

933
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,026
Oh, God.

934
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,637
Still got that gorilla
cum taste in my mouth.

935
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,899
Ugh.

936
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:20,204
Does Trina got any mints
in the car?

937
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:21,641
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, don't be going around

938
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:22,990
digging in the car
like that, okay?

939
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,382
Dude, she's got a ton
of mints in here.

940
00:41:24,426 --> 00:41:26,689
- This is great.
- What?

941
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,212
Boy, if you gonna have a mint,
I want a mint.

942
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:30,214
- All right.
- Let me get some.

943
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:31,346
You need it
more than me, homie.

944
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,608
Your breath is so bad,

945
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:34,262
people look forward
to your farts.

946
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:38,266
Oh, okay. Your breath smells
like Steve Harvey's mustache.

947
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,181
I don't even know
what that smells like but...

948
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,402
You're pretty funny, man.

949
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:46,927
You're, like,
way funny tonight.

950
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:54,369
Yeah, I'm boiling.

951
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:06,381
Hello?

952
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,251
I mean, it's moving.

953
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,372
Can you put this
on your finger?

954
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,070
Sir, if you carry on
doing that,

955
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:44,288
I will turn around
and punch you

956
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:45,333
in your goddamn face.

957
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:49,990
Ooh. Electrolytes.

958
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:53,167
Maria?

959
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,691
Maria! Maria, where'd you go?

960
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,958
I look perfectly normal.

961
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:03,351
I look great.

962
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:04,874
Yeah, motherfuckers!
Try to find me now.

963
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:18,409
Oh, my God.

964
00:43:18,453 --> 00:43:19,976
Snowball fight.

965
00:43:22,196 --> 00:43:23,371
Yeah!

966
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:34,034
- Are you Maria?
- Nah. My name is Will.

967
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:36,384
Let's go to the dream place.

968
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:56,709
- Chris.
- Huh?

969
00:43:58,145 --> 00:43:59,233
Where are we?

970
00:44:01,278 --> 00:44:02,889
Oh, fuck,
I got a headache, man.

971
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,238
What happened last night?

972
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,067
- I don't even know.
- Oh.

973
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,852
I really gotta pee.

974
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:11,027
Ah!

975
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:18,208
Fuck!

976
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:22,038
Ow! Why are our dicks
in a Chinese finger trap?

977
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:23,213
What did you do to us, man?

978
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:24,345
I didn't do anything
to anybody.

979
00:44:24,388 --> 00:44:25,912
I don't remember a thing!

980
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,217
I wouldn't put my dick
connected to your dick.

981
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,392
Maybe if your dick...

982
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:29,654
Man, get your hands
off my dick.

983
00:44:29,698 --> 00:44:30,960
Sorry, sorry. Just get up.
Get up, get up.

984
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,527
- Dude, let go of my...
- Stop pulling my dick!

985
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,485
Come on!

986
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:35,922
We gonna do this together
if we gonna do this.

987
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,837
Okay. I'm gonna go for it!

988
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,015
Look, there's a golfer
over there.

989
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,843
We can ask him
to get us out of this.

990
00:44:43,886 --> 00:44:45,018
My God, he's not going to
fucking help us.

991
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,933
Help!

992
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,283
Help us.

993
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:50,980
Please.
We got stuck in this thing.

994
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,895
How'd you guys do that? What
the fuck did you guys do?

995
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:54,070
How do we get outta this?

996
00:44:54,114 --> 00:44:56,246
Just, uh, relax your dick

997
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,247
- and friggin' pull it out.
- Okay.

998
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:01,425
Push them together.
Push together.

999
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:02,905
Walk together.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1000
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:03,906
Okay. Okay.

1001
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,256
Just, uh...

1002
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,910
I have no idea
what to fucking do.

1003
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:11,522
You need to cut that fucker
in the middle.

1004
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:13,437
Hey, hey, easy,
Harvey Weinstein.

1005
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,917
Get the fuck out.
I'm gonna play golf.

1006
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:16,266
- Go!
- You turned on us.

1007
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,964
Yes! Get the fuck outta here.

1008
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,095
Go! Before I hit...

1009
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:20,270
You wanna really...
Fuck. Okay.

1010
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:21,924
- Let's go. I'll do it.
- No, no, no!

1011
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:23,534
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Get the fuck outta here.

1012
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:25,275
Okay, okay, okay,
I'm sorry, man.

1013
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:30,237
We'll go
to a barber shop.

1014
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,152
They got scissors.

1015
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:34,328
Hey, sir, can you get
our dicks outta this thing?

1016
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:35,590
Yo, man!
I promise you!

1017
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:36,939
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1018
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:38,288
I promise you,
my nigga. I promise you.

1019
00:45:38,332 --> 00:45:39,463
Hey.
You know where to get a...

1020
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:40,290
Yo,
get the fuck outta here!

1021
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:41,465
He's got a knife.

1022
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:45,992
Help! Help us!

1023
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,428
Help us!

1024
00:45:47,471 --> 00:45:49,386
- Oh, shit. Shit.
- Oh!

1025
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,518
Okay, okay.

1026
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:53,434
It's a Chinese finger trap.

1027
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:00,310
Help!

1028
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:02,878
Just come this way!
Ow! Ow!

1029
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:03,966
Help us.

1030
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,489
Somebody, help us!

1031
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:08,231
Somebody! Help!
Oh, my God. Somebody!

1032
00:46:08,275 --> 00:46:09,493
Come this way, please!

1033
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:10,668
Wait, chill! Would you?

1034
00:46:10,712 --> 00:46:11,974
I don't know what to do!

1035
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:13,019
- Okay.
- What the... No!

1036
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,151
It's do or die!

1037
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:20,591
We're free! We're free!

1038
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:22,158
Does anybody got any ice?

1039
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,030
Can I borrow water? Can I?

1040
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:26,597
It don't even matter.
I just wanna...

1041
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,168
It's really hard
to concentrate on food

1042
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:35,041
when your dick was just
attached to another man's.

1043
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,042
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty hungry.

1044
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:39,523
All right. So,
you're about to see Maria.

1045
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:40,960
Do you know what you're
going to say

1046
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:42,309
to her once you see her?

1047
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:44,528
You know
in the Boyz II Men video

1048
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:46,313
when the baritone dude
breaks it down?

1049
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:49,055
- Yes.
- And he's like, "Damn, girl.

1050
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,362
"Ooh, I would suck a skittle
out your bootyhole, girl."

1051
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:54,190
That's not
in any of the songs.

1052
00:46:54,234 --> 00:46:55,409
It's similar.

1053
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:57,541
- Question. I have a question.
- Yeah, go.

1054
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:00,544
Can my friend try something
on you real quick?

1055
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:02,242
And I just wanna see
how you'll react to it.

1056
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:03,721
Okay.

1057
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:05,985
I'm in love with an angel.
Chasing a girl.

1058
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:11,077
Mmm-hmm. So I'm just gonna go
up to her and say, like...

1059
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:13,079
"I love you.

1060
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,559
"Let's make love under
the sunset, us two."

1061
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:19,346
Yeah.

1062
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:22,392
Oh, okay.

1063
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:27,223
Okay.

1064
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,400
Ooh.

1065
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:32,054
Yeah. That's what
I was saying to him before.

1066
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:33,447
That's the kinda stuff
I was saying.

1067
00:47:35,405 --> 00:47:37,059
- At first?
- Let her make the first move.

1068
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:38,756
Quick question, 'cause
you keep saying "at first."

1069
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,281
When is the best time
to, like, all right.

1070
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:42,499
Now you say
all the nice stuff,

1071
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:43,587
and you be like,
"Okay, now sexually..."

1072
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,940
Oh, so this is still
on the first meeting?

1073
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:50,290
Same.

1074
00:47:55,295 --> 00:47:56,557
Same.

1075
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,081
"Genders and genres"?
God damn.

1076
00:48:03,651 --> 00:48:05,348
Traveled down the road

1077
00:48:05,392 --> 00:48:07,220
And back again

1078
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:09,483
Your heart is true

1079
00:48:09,526 --> 00:48:12,225
You're a pal and a confidant

1080
00:48:40,557 --> 00:48:42,472
Yeah, our battery died.

1081
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:45,519
Thanks so much for doing this.
The car's making crazy noises.

1082
00:48:45,562 --> 00:48:47,651
All right, start revving it.

1083
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:55,703
What did you do to my friend?

1084
00:48:55,746 --> 00:48:57,618
- I didn't do anything.
- You okay?

1085
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,533
She revved the thing.
I don't know.

1086
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:01,448
You told me to do that.
Don't play that.

1087
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:02,666
Why did you do that?

1088
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,494
You asked for a fucking jump.

1089
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:05,713
Don't play with me,
motherfucker.

1090
00:49:14,548 --> 00:49:16,506
I'm coming to fuck y'all up.

1091
00:49:30,912 --> 00:49:32,348
This is good.

1092
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:37,701
- Right here or...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1093
00:49:39,573 --> 00:49:41,401
Oh, jeez. Oh, it's starting.

1094
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,755
Help!

1095
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:49,539
What happened?

1096
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,150
- Fuck.
- What happened?

1097
00:49:51,193 --> 00:49:52,368
I'm stuck.

1098
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:54,544
I'm sinking.

1099
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:56,155
- Shit.
- I know. Come here.

1100
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,377
Wait a minute,
go get some butter.

1101
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:02,509
Butter me out of this thing.

1102
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:09,777
Shit!

1103
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,692
Oh, my God.

1104
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,389
- It's all over me.
- Oh, my God. What the fuck?

1105
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:25,749
Thank you for being a friend

1106
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,215
Y'all seen these dudes before?
Right here?

1107
00:50:56,258 --> 00:50:57,390
I don't know them.

1108
00:50:57,433 --> 00:50:59,174
- Hey, brother.
- What?

1109
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:00,480
I'm looking for these dudes
right here.

1110
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:02,612
They stole my car. Look at it.
She beautiful.

1111
00:51:02,656 --> 00:51:03,787
That's a colorful car.

1112
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,267
This is Bud right here.

1113
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:07,182
He, like, this tall,
real dark.

1114
00:51:07,226 --> 00:51:09,184
Real, kind of, chubby.
Look like a peanut.

1115
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,230
This dude right here, Chris,

1116
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:12,753
got a big nose,
that white boy nose,

1117
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:14,581
- but black features.
- All right.

1118
00:51:14,624 --> 00:51:16,235
Matter of fact, might have to
staple his nuts.

1119
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:17,801
You know what I'm saying?

1120
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:19,977
If y'all see these niggas
right here, they stole my car.

1121
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:21,631
I'mma kill these niggas.

1122
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:22,850
Just like that.

1123
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,722
Just like fucking that.

1124
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,463
Uh-uh!
Don't tear up in here, now.

1125
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:31,641
That girl,
she could've came in here

1126
00:51:31,685 --> 00:51:33,165
- and just started blazing.
- Exactly.

1127
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:43,349
You didn't get that
new Wesley Snipes CD?

1128
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,872
Wesley Snipes
don't make music, man.

1129
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,830
Man, he made
the Bladesoundtrack.

1130
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:48,658
- No, he didn't.
- Yeah.

1131
00:51:48,702 --> 00:51:49,833
And he's got that song.

1132
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:56,666
Where do you wanna sit at?

1133
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,625
- Is anybody sitting here?
- No.

1134
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,887
No?

1135
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,018
Crazy girl
just came in here

1136
00:52:01,062 --> 00:52:01,932
and said
she's gonna kill somebody.

1137
00:52:04,283 --> 00:52:05,762
See that brother
right there?

1138
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,982
Said she gonna kill him
if he stole her car.

1139
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,331
What the fuck is that?

1140
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:14,684
Oh, fuck.

1141
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:16,817
That's them. That's them.

1142
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,992
I gotta get the fuck
outta here, bro.

1143
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,254
Wait, wait, wait.

1144
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:20,560
I told you that's them.

1145
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:22,039
- That girl wanna kill 'em.
- Who put this up?

1146
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,693
She was coming through
the restaurant with them.

1147
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:24,825
What'd she look like?

1148
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,653
About 5'5".

1149
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:29,003
African American.
Lighter than you.

1150
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:30,570
I mean,

1151
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:32,572
light color.

1152
00:52:32,615 --> 00:52:34,226
That could be anybody.

1153
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:36,402
Y'all driving around in a hot
pink car that say "Bad Bitch."

1154
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,360
She gonna find y'all.

1155
00:52:38,404 --> 00:52:40,275
I mean, there's a lot of cars
that say that.

1156
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,886
That say "Bad Bitch"
on the back?

1157
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,801
She said you her brother.
She said...

1158
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:46,368
"Oh, that's Bud.

1159
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:47,891
- "I'm killing him first."
- I don't think she cares.

1160
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:49,066
Oh, I gotta get the fuck
outta here.

1161
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,503
She's a killer.
That girl's a killer.

1162
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,287
She's a real killer?

1163
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:54,550
She got marks on her face.
She got teardrops on her face.

1164
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:55,769
- That bitch'll kill you.
- Stay!

1165
00:52:55,812 --> 00:52:57,423
- Stay! Bud, man, please.
- Man, fuck you, man.

1166
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,294
Bud, please.
We are almost to Maria, man.

1167
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:01,035
He's not a good friend, Bud.

1168
00:53:01,427 --> 00:53:02,993
I told you it's them.

1169
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:04,604
- I don't forget nothing, baby.
- It could be anybody.

1170
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:05,822
- Eyes.
- Fuck you.

1171
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,041
No, fuck you.
We're staying here.

1172
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:08,608
No. We gotta take
the car back, bro.

1173
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:09,957
- No, we do not.
- Oh, shit.

1174
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,741
What I told you?
Did I not tell you?

1175
00:53:11,785 --> 00:53:13,569
Listen to me, we are so close.

1176
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:15,397
- No, you're not listening.
- We are staying here.

1177
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,399
These people don't know
what they're talking about.

1178
00:53:17,443 --> 00:53:18,748
The hell?
Y'all gonna say I'm lying?

1179
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:19,706
She said
she's trying to kill y'all.

1180
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:20,794
You just missed her.

1181
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:22,317
She seemed angry?

1182
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:23,405
Very angry.

1183
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:24,580
You have to take
the car back.

1184
00:53:24,624 --> 00:53:26,016
She's supposed to be in jail.

1185
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,714
She's supposed to be
in a jail?

1186
00:53:27,757 --> 00:53:29,063
She's supposed to be.

1187
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:30,325
That's why I don't know
if it's her for sure.

1188
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:33,110
It's her.
She said she gonna kill y'all.

1189
00:53:33,154 --> 00:53:34,590
Y'all stole her car.

1190
00:53:34,634 --> 00:53:35,896
Now go ahead on
from over here.

1191
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:36,940
Go, go.
I don't wanna die with you.

1192
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:38,420
- Go ahead on.
- No, no, no.

1193
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:40,335
- Get your ass from by me now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1194
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:41,293
No. I just need information.
I just need information.

1195
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,343
Get your ass from by me.

1196
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:49,736
Wait, wait, wait.

1197
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:51,085
Bud. Bud. Bud.

1198
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:53,435
Fuck that. No. We gotta
take her car back now.

1199
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,002
- We're so close to New York.
- Get in the car.

1200
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:56,960
- We're going back to Florida.
- We're going to New York.

1201
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:58,310
- No.
- Please!

1202
00:54:05,882 --> 00:54:07,449
"I gotta take her car back.
I gotta take her car back."

1203
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:08,668
Oh, my God.

1204
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:10,496
I said, "That nigga finna
kill you, nigga."

1205
00:54:14,804 --> 00:54:15,675
I heard that.

1206
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,641
Hey, did you see these dudes?
Did they come up in here?

1207
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:27,251
'Cause I know

1208
00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:28,601
- Girl, you just missed them.
- Them motherfuckers was here?

1209
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:29,645
I was about to call you.

1210
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:30,994
Did anybody here see

1211
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:32,518
which way
these motherfuckers went?

1212
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,650
- They went that way.
- That way.

1213
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:36,522
They got in the car
and went that way.

1214
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,349
I'm finna fuck

1215
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:40,743

1216
00:54:40,787 --> 00:54:42,963
Damn it. I missed it.

1217
00:54:43,006 --> 00:54:43,877
Bop-bop.

1218
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:47,054
Oh, shit. Let me get
the fuck outta here.

1219
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:57,499
What the fuck, man?

1220
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:58,761
How the fuck did she get
outta jail, man?

1221
00:54:58,805 --> 00:54:59,849
- We'll figure it out later.
- God damn it!

1222
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:01,155
We gotta get to Maria, please.

1223
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,983
We're going back to Florida
right now!

1224
00:55:03,026 --> 00:55:04,680
- Trina's on our ass.
- Look, I can't

1225
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:06,203
do this shit, man.
We gotta take the car back.

1226
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:08,510
Bud, stop living your life
in fear of your sister, man.

1227
00:55:08,554 --> 00:55:10,686
You know how crazy Trina is.
She gonna fucking kill us.

1228
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,906
You need to stand up
to your sister for once, man.

1229
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:14,081
We're going back to Florida,
all right?

1230
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:15,038
- No, we're going to New York!
- No.

1231
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:16,866
Come on. I gotta see Maria!

1232
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,085
No!

1233
00:55:25,919 --> 00:55:28,095
Oh, my God.

1234
00:55:29,749 --> 00:55:31,533
You all right?

1235
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:32,882
Oh, shit.

1236
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,496
Shit.

1237
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:42,065
Y'all okay?

1238
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,893
- You guys can move?
- Call 911.

1239
00:55:43,937 --> 00:55:45,417
Fucking asshole.

1240
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:51,074
- Uh... Uh...
- Sit down. Sit down.

1241
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,685
Let's sit down.
Let's sit down.

1242
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,077
No, we gotta get to New York.

1243
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,209
Let's sit down.

1244
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:57,559
We're never getting
to New York now.

1245
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:58,778
What the fuck you did?

1246
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:01,171
Maybe we can get somebody
to help us fix it.

1247
00:56:01,215 --> 00:56:04,697
We get back on the road,
and we get to New York.

1248
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,741
New York?

1249
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:11,573
You know somethin', man?
You ain't a real friend.

1250
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:13,836
Real friends
wouldn't do shit like this.

1251
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,098
You're an idiot, man.

1252
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:17,231
- I'm done. You bitch.
- I am done with you.

1253
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:18,711
- Don't! Hey, hey, hey, man.
- Get the fuck away from me.

1254
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:19,842
Come on, bruh.

1255
00:56:19,886 --> 00:56:21,148
Chill out.
Hey, you take a seat, man.

1256
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:22,541
- Yeah, you take a seat, Bud.
- Chill out, man.

1257
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:24,238
- Hey, you take a seat as well.
- Listen to him.

1258
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,587
Y'all need to
talk this shit out, man.

1259
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:26,719
Listen to him.

1260
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:27,937
Listen, you shut
the fuck up, man.

1261
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:29,243
That's my sister's car, man.

1262
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:30,505
I told you this was
gonna happen.

1263
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:33,116
- See?
- You ain't listen.

1264
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,944
And if we wait here till the
police come, we going to jail.

1265
00:56:34,988 --> 00:56:36,642
- No.
- That's a stolen car.

1266
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:49,219
Hey, hey. Hey, man.

1267
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:51,961
Chill out. Chill out, man.
Chill out, bro.

1268
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:54,094
- Fucking kick you in the face.
- Chill out, man. Hey.

1269
00:56:54,137 --> 00:56:55,791
What are you gonna
do about it?

1270
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,272
That's why you have no job.
You're a fucking loser.

1271
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,013
All you do is
make stupid ass decisions.

1272
00:57:00,056 --> 00:57:01,231
Hey, man,
he got a concussion, man,

1273
00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:02,798
so he don't know
what he's thinking.

1274
00:57:02,842 --> 00:57:04,757
He's a fucking idiot.
This is how he always thinks.

1275
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,149
I mean, he probably is, man.

1276
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:07,281
But right now's not
a proper time for that, man.

1277
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,543
Hey, chill out, man.

1278
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:09,936
I'm done with you, man.
Look at that shit.

1279
00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:11,198
- Look at it!
- Yeah, you do need

1280
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:12,678
- to look at that shit.
- It's your fault.

1281
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:13,156
It is kinda fucked up.
You need to look at that shit.

1282
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,288
It's my fault?

1283
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:15,811
No!

1284
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:19,772
Shit, man. This is all
your fucking fault.

1285
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,382
Fuck you.

1286
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:22,905
- Chill. We gotta get back...
- You better stay away from me.

1287
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:23,993
- ...before this car blows up.
- It's your fault.

1288
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:25,168
It don't matter
whose fault it is.

1289
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:26,692
- We gotta get outta here.
- It's his fault for being

1290
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:27,823
- a pussy his whole life.
- I'm done, motherfucker.

1291
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:29,216
Not standing up
to his sister.

1292
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:30,217
No. No, listen. That don't
even matter right now,

1293
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,566
because that car explodes,
we all dead.

1294
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:32,654
So let's get away, y'all,

1295
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:33,786
- and talk about it.
- I'm done.

1296
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,135
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I'm done.

1297
00:57:35,178 --> 00:57:36,005
- You are done. Let's go.
- I'm done!

1298
00:57:36,049 --> 00:57:37,616
I'm done with you, too.

1299
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:40,662
Yeah, exactly. Walk away.

1300
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:42,708
I'll get to New York
on my own.

1301
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,187
I don't need any of you.

1302
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:45,580
Stupid fucking car.

1303
00:57:45,624 --> 00:57:47,582
Hey, watch out
for that gas, man.

1304
00:57:47,626 --> 00:57:49,715
Hey, listen, you gonna walk
to your death if that...

1305
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:50,716
You know what, man?

1306
00:57:52,065 --> 00:57:54,284
I don't need him.
I don't need anybody.

1307
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:56,069
I'll get to New York
on my own.

1308
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:58,854
Get to New York on my own.

1309
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:05,295
What about you, Lexus?

1310
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,949
Going to New York!

1311
00:58:06,993 --> 00:58:08,081
Come on!

1312
00:58:15,044 --> 00:58:17,177
All you do is
think about yourself, man.

1313
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:24,837
Bud?

1314
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:27,709
Bud. Bud. Bud.

1315
00:58:27,753 --> 00:58:29,058
- Oh.
- What?

1316
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:31,800
I thought you were Bud.
With the glasses.

1317
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:35,238
You look like my best friend,
Bud. And I miss him.

1318
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:36,283
All right, sir.

1319
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:39,895
Bud? Oh.

1320
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:41,593
I thought you were
my friend, Bud.

1321
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:43,290
I miss him.

1322
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:50,863
Bud? Bud? Bud?

1323
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:52,125
What's up, bro?

1324
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:54,736
Oh, I thought
you were my friend, Bud.

1325
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,651
Everybody got a friend
named Bud nowadays.

1326
00:58:56,695 --> 00:58:57,739
Yeah.

1327
00:58:57,783 --> 00:59:00,699
Bud!

1328
00:59:08,707 --> 00:59:10,099
What wars are going on now?

1329
00:59:10,143 --> 00:59:11,187
- What wars?
- Yeah.

1330
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,711
We've still got conflict in,

1331
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:14,277
you know,
across the Middle East.

1332
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,628
I just wanna
go over there 'cause...

1333
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:20,806
I just wanna die.

1334
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,677
Man, what's going on
to make you say that?

1335
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:24,331
I lost my best friend.

1336
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:28,291
We got in a huge falling out
kind of fight.

1337
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:31,730
I'll go over
to Afghanistan or Iraq,

1338
00:59:31,773 --> 00:59:34,776
stand on the front lines
and then just bombs away.

1339
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,343
I understand you're going
through a hard time right now,

1340
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:38,127
but that's strong words
saying you wanna die, brother.

1341
00:59:38,171 --> 00:59:40,434
I'll go to Vietnam or whatever

1342
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,132
and I'll just get shot
by everybody.

1343
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:44,351
I will suck your dick
if you kill me.

1344
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:46,179
- Get it together.
- Please, man.

1345
00:59:46,222 --> 00:59:47,136
- Get it together.
- Please.

1346
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,921
Get it together.

1347
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:50,139
Right now you're acting
like a danger

1348
00:59:50,183 --> 00:59:51,401
to yourself and to others.

1349
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:53,795
I hate myself.

1350
00:59:57,277 --> 00:59:59,453
Please stop. Stop, stop.

1351
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:02,108
You're okay. All right?

1352
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:04,327
Look, you're in a bad place
right now.

1353
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:05,981
You've talked to me
for five minutes

1354
01:00:06,025 --> 01:00:07,113
and you've offered

1355
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:08,941
- to suck my dick to kill you.
- Yeah.

1356
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:09,811
I mean, you know
that's not right.

1357
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,247
Right.

1358
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:13,162
I get it, brother. I've been
in a bad place before.

1359
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:14,860
- Yeah.
- You know, everybody has.

1360
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:16,035
Yeah.

1361
01:00:16,078 --> 01:00:17,340
You just gotta
get it together, man.

1362
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:18,994
Talk to your buddy
and apologize to him,

1363
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:20,256
and you'll be fine.

1364
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,475
Just tell him how you feel.

1365
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:23,346
- Just tell him you're sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

1366
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,347
And if he's really
your friend,

1367
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:25,348
and if you guys
have been friends

1368
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:26,785
for as long as you have...

1369
01:00:26,828 --> 01:00:28,003
- Yeah.
- ...he's gonna forgive you.

1370
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:30,702
Yeah. God! Dude.

1371
01:00:33,574 --> 01:00:35,881
Let's bring it in, brother.
Thank you.

1372
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,144
I was kinda out of it, man.

1373
01:00:38,187 --> 01:00:39,841
You really brought me back.

1374
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:41,843
You brought me back, brother.

1375
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:42,844
Sir, I salute you.

1376
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:44,367
You too, sir.

1377
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:45,847
And I salute your shorts.

1378
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:47,893
Have a good day.

1379
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,242
Yeah! I'm gonna...

1380
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:51,244
Oh, you know what?
The bus is leaving soon.

1381
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:52,854
- You gotta go.
- I should go. Thank you.

1382
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:54,029
Thank you.

1383
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:30,936
Stop the...

1384
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,547
Stop the bus! Hey!

1385
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,898
Stop the fucking bus!

1386
01:01:36,942 --> 01:01:38,944
He's saying stop the bus.
Stop the bus.

1387
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,902
Hold that bus!

1388
01:01:40,946 --> 01:01:42,512
Please, please.

1389
01:01:42,556 --> 01:01:44,514
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

1390
01:01:44,558 --> 01:01:48,083
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1391
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:49,389
I need to talk
to my best friend.

1392
01:01:49,432 --> 01:01:50,912
I can't let you guys go
any further.

1393
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:54,307
Bud.

1394
01:01:54,873 --> 01:01:56,918
Please.

1395
01:01:56,962 --> 01:01:59,442
For the first time in my life,
let me apologize.

1396
01:01:59,486 --> 01:02:02,576
I am so, so sorry, man.
I'm shit.

1397
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,839
I realized I'm shit.
I'm an asshole.

1398
01:02:04,883 --> 01:02:06,275
- Miss, I'm an asshole.
- Okay.

1399
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,061
I suck shit
out of assholes.

1400
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,063
That's what I am.
I'm lower than that.

1401
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,934
And I'm sorry, man.

1402
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:15,284
I'm sorry I destroyed
your sister's car.

1403
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:18,418
I'm sorry
I took advantage of you.

1404
01:02:18,461 --> 01:02:20,463
And I know you probably
never wanna talk to me

1405
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:22,117
for the rest of your life,

1406
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:24,511
but just know that this trip

1407
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,906
has been the adventure
of a lifetime.

1408
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:30,517
And I'm so grateful
I had you by my side.

1409
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,519
And you're the best friend
a guy could ask for.

1410
01:02:33,172 --> 01:02:34,826
Aw.

1411
01:02:36,175 --> 01:02:37,524
So you think you could just

1412
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:39,961
chase a bus down,

1413
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:43,008
bang on the windows,
jump on here,

1414
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,966
and just apologize like that
and I just forgive you

1415
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,621
and everything's all good?
Huh?

1416
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:48,752
I... I don't know.

1417
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:50,363
You thought
that was gonna work?

1418
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:52,321
I...

1419
01:02:52,365 --> 01:02:53,627
Well, guess what.

1420
01:02:55,368 --> 01:02:57,892
It did.

1421
01:02:57,936 --> 01:02:59,589
That's the best thing
anybody's ever done for me.

1422
01:02:59,633 --> 01:03:02,157
Look, man,
you're my best friend, bruh.

1423
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:04,290
Aw, that's so sweet.

1424
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:07,162
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1425
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:08,511
So, look, you wanna still make

1426
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:10,209
this trip to New York,
I'm down.

1427
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,472
Don't fuck with me, man.

1428
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:13,908
I'm really vulnerable
right now.

1429
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:16,171
- Are you being serious?
- Forget my sister.

1430
01:03:16,215 --> 01:03:17,912
Yes, you are going
to see Maria.

1431
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:19,522
Yes!

1432
01:03:19,566 --> 01:03:21,350
New York City,
here we come, baby!

1433
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:25,572
Yes! Yes!

1434
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:29,141
We're going to New York.
Yes! Yes!

1435
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,534
Let's go. Let's go.
Can I give you a hug?

1436
01:03:31,578 --> 01:03:33,406
Can I give you a hug?
I love you, man.

1437
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:35,147
I don't know you,
but I love you, man.

1438
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,497
Let's go.
Take this bus to New York!

1439
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,412
No. No.

1440
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:40,587
Get the fuck out.

1441
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,197
That was the craziest
shit ever.

1442
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:58,561
Dude, this is awesome!

1443
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,260
Wow.

1444
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:07,266
We made it, man.

1445
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:11,400
Damn it. I left Maria's
business card in the car.

1446
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:13,228
- Seriously?
- Damn it.

1447
01:04:13,272 --> 01:04:15,578
Do you know
where the galleries are?

1448
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:17,754
- Straight that way.
- That way? Thank you.

1449
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:19,626
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chris!
- Shit. I'm sorry.

1450
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:22,542
Excuse me, do you know
where Maria's gallery is?

1451
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:23,717
- I have no idea.
- Maria Li.

1452
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,588
She's like, half Chinese.

1453
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:26,546
I have no idea
who that is.

1454
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:27,764
She's really sweet.

1455
01:04:27,808 --> 01:04:29,766
She stuck up for me
in high school.

1456
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,333
She's probably the hottest
girl in New York City.

1457
01:04:31,377 --> 01:04:32,378
You gotta know who she is.

1458
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,120
I don't really know...

1459
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,121
You're not from here?

1460
01:04:40,038 --> 01:04:42,954
I'm about to get
these motherfuckers.

1461
01:04:45,608 --> 01:04:46,958
Mmm-mmm.

1462
01:04:55,488 --> 01:04:56,532
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1463
01:04:56,576 --> 01:04:58,230
There it is right there.

1464
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:02,321
That's where your girl at,
brother.

1465
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:03,452
I'm freaking out.

1466
01:05:03,496 --> 01:05:05,106
I can't feel my throat

1467
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,673
and my hands are disconnected
to my body...

1468
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:09,415
Chris. Chris, hey.
Chris, calm down. Calm down.

1469
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,199
Look, you gotta trust
yourself, okay, man?

1470
01:05:11,243 --> 01:05:12,679
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You gotta trust yourself.

1471
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:13,636
What you gonna do?
You gonna go in there,

1472
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,724
you gonna be yourself,

1473
01:05:14,768 --> 01:05:16,074
and just talk
how you always talk,

1474
01:05:16,117 --> 01:05:17,423
and she's gonna fall in love
with you, brother.

1475
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:18,641
You got this.

1476
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:19,729
Go get your girl, brother.

1477
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:21,296
Okay, I got this.
Thank you, Bud.

1478
01:05:22,863 --> 01:05:24,778
Believe in yourself.

1479
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:27,128
Put some ChapStick on.

1480
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:29,783
I got this. I got this.
I got this. I got this.

1481
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:33,569
Do you have a wristband?

1482
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:35,658
- No. Uh, wristband?
- Yeah.

1483
01:05:35,702 --> 01:05:37,573
Maria just invited me
from Florida.

1484
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:38,835
That's crazy.

1485
01:05:38,879 --> 01:05:40,098
I don't have
a wristband on you,

1486
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:41,186
or I don't have your name.

1487
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,144
- I don't need a wristband.
- You do.

1488
01:05:43,188 --> 01:05:44,537
You don't know what I've just
been through to get here.

1489
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,712
You can't be stopping me
right now.

1490
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:49,803
You gotta let me in,
please. Please.

1491
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,326
- No. Take a walk, sir.
- Please let me in, sir.

1492
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,067
No. Take a walk, sir.

1493
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:54,416
Please let me in.
You have to let me in.

1494
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,809
- You're not on my list, sir.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1495
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:01,554
Come on. Come on, man!

1496
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:05,427
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

1497
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:06,515
I just got $2.

1498
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,170
- Go that way.
- And, uh...

1499
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:10,824
- And I got some Lincolns.
- No. Put your money away.

1500
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,782
- Looks like one, two...
- Pick up your pennies.

1501
01:06:13,392 --> 01:06:14,697
...four.

1502
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,526
Chill out. Chill out.
Chill out.

1503
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:18,875
The woman I love is in there.

1504
01:06:18,919 --> 01:06:20,399
- Do you understand?
- Okay, but chill out.

1505
01:06:20,442 --> 01:06:21,704
- It's gonna be all right.
- Have you ever been in love?

1506
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:22,879
- Yeah, I am now.
- Yeah, so you know

1507
01:06:22,923 --> 01:06:24,229
- what I'm going through.
- Okay, but listen.

1508
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:25,360
That's not the way you do it.

1509
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:26,361
I sacrificed everything.

1510
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:27,710
My job, my money. I...

1511
01:06:27,754 --> 01:06:29,582
I gave this guy the last

1512
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:31,105
- $2.05 I had.
- No.

1513
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:33,238
You need to find another way
to talk to that lady.

1514
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,501
I'm telling you, man,
from the bottom of my heart,

1515
01:06:35,544 --> 01:06:37,851
I've been waiting,
since I was a kid

1516
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,635
to tell her how I feel.

1517
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:41,724
So if you've
ever been in love,

1518
01:06:41,768 --> 01:06:43,335
you will let me through
that door.

1519
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:48,818
You letting me in?

1520
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:51,734
Yes! Thank you, man.

1521
01:06:51,778 --> 01:06:54,172
Yes! Thank you!

1522
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:56,870
This is amazing, man.
I owe you my life, dude.

1523
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:58,263
Go inside.

1524
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:00,178
Wow.

1525
01:07:16,759 --> 01:07:18,152
Hi, you guys.

1526
01:07:18,196 --> 01:07:19,762
We just wanna let you know
there's an artist

1527
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:21,590
that's gonna be speaking
at 3:45.

1528
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:22,809
- Okay. Awesome.
- Okay.

1529
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:23,679
So if you're able to stay
until that point,

1530
01:07:23,723 --> 01:07:24,767
that would be so great.

1531
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,294
Um, thank you guys so much
for coming today.

1532
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,252
This is our second group show.

1533
01:07:31,296 --> 01:07:32,427
Some of these artists
sell at auction

1534
01:07:32,471 --> 01:07:34,255
for millions of dollars,

1535
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:36,779
so we're very excited
to have their work here today.

1536
01:07:36,823 --> 01:07:38,868
We really wanna hear
what you guys think about

1537
01:07:38,912 --> 01:07:41,349
this particular collection
of artists.

1538
01:07:41,393 --> 01:07:45,614
And, of course, Anthony's work
which is unbelievable.

1539
01:07:45,658 --> 01:07:47,138
And I don't think
you ever show anywhere.

1540
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:51,794
Okay, some of you guys
can't say. You can't speak.

1541
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:53,709
Because you know
some of my work.

1542
01:07:53,753 --> 01:07:55,276
Well, I think it's a...

1543
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,408
- Hi.
- Hey.

1544
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:58,149
- Maria. Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1545
01:07:58,932 --> 01:08:00,455
- Hi.
- Hi.

1546
01:08:00,499 --> 01:08:01,848
Hey, Chris.
What are you doing here?

1547
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:03,458
How you doing? I'm sorry.
Do you wanna just talk...

1548
01:08:03,502 --> 01:08:04,807
- for a second? Sorry.
- Yeah.

1549
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:06,287
I'm sorry, guys. Anthony is...

1550
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:07,636
Okay.

1551
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,812
He can tell you
all about his experience.

1552
01:08:09,856 --> 01:08:11,205
I'm sorry,
I know you're working.

1553
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:12,293
No. Of course.

1554
01:08:12,337 --> 01:08:13,773
This is such a nice surprise.

1555
01:08:14,643 --> 01:08:16,863
Uh... Maria, I, um...

1556
01:08:18,865 --> 01:08:21,998
I don't quite know the words
to use right now.

1557
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:23,304
Uh...

1558
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:25,480
So I'm just gonna speak
from the heart.

1559
01:08:25,524 --> 01:08:27,656
Okay.

1560
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,789
Maria, when you walked into
my work the other day...

1561
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:32,008
I felt something special.

1562
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:33,923
And I knew
right then and there

1563
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:36,448
that I would stop at nothing

1564
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:38,014
to be able to see you again.

1565
01:08:38,058 --> 01:08:40,234
And, uh...

1566
01:08:40,278 --> 01:08:42,845
Trust me,
this trip was not easy.

1567
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:45,021
I went through hell
and high water to get here.

1568
01:08:45,065 --> 01:08:47,850
I experienced emotional
and physical traumas

1569
01:08:47,894 --> 01:08:50,853
I may never recover from,

1570
01:08:50,897 --> 01:08:53,247
but I would do it
a million times over

1571
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:55,206
just to be able to tell you...

1572
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:57,817
Oh. Uh...

1573
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,864
Maria Li,
I am crazy about you.

1574
01:09:01,908 --> 01:09:05,216
And I want to start a new life
with you.

1575
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:09,655
Oh, Chris. Oh, my God.

1576
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:11,744
That is...

1577
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:14,355
- Thank you...
- Yeah.

1578
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,226
...for that.

1579
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:17,402
But no.

1580
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:19,578
No.

1581
01:09:20,753 --> 01:09:23,712
That's... That's crazy.

1582
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:29,370
This is just kinda outta
left field, and I'm at work.

1583
01:09:29,414 --> 01:09:30,545
Yeah.

1584
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:32,286
We don't really
know each other.

1585
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:36,508
Listen, is it okay
if we're just friends?

1586
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:38,379
- Oh!
- Um...

1587
01:09:44,298 --> 01:09:45,517
It's a cop!

1588
01:09:48,128 --> 01:09:48,911
Oh, my God.

1589
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:51,914
Motherfucker!

1590
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,351
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait!

1591
01:09:53,394 --> 01:09:54,526
- You guys stole my Bad Bitch.
- Hey, Trina.

1592
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:55,657
- Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
- Piece of shit!

1593
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,748
Jesus.

1594
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:02,011
Stop! Stop!

1595
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:03,622
I hate you.

1596
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:04,797
Please stop.
Please stop.

1597
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,364
Gonna fuck you up,
you dumb bitch.

1598
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:07,930
Where you running to?
Where you running to, hoe?

1599
01:10:07,974 --> 01:10:08,975
Fuck!

1600
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:17,331
No, no, no way!
No, no, no!

1601
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:18,680
Please!
Somebody help me!

1602
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:20,291
Somebody, help me.

1603
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:24,338
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop, stop!

1604
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,952
You lying, skinny hoe!

1605
01:10:32,477 --> 01:10:33,608
Oh, fuck!

1606
01:10:33,652 --> 01:10:35,044
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

1607
01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:36,481
No. No, no, no.

1608
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:37,482
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1609
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:41,616
Shit, shit, shit.

1610
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,575
Shit, shit, shit.

1611
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:44,619
Oh, fuck!

1612
01:10:44,663 --> 01:10:46,447
No, no, no. No, no.

1613
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:47,622
- Oh, fuck!
- Where's Bud?

1614
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,015
Wait, wait, wait. Trina.

1615
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:50,973
You destroyed my car,
now I'm gonna destroy you.

1616
01:10:53,498 --> 01:10:56,370
You better tell me
where the fuck Bud is.

1617
01:11:00,026 --> 01:11:01,462
- Shut the fuck up!
- Oh, my God.

1618
01:11:01,506 --> 01:11:03,812
Oh, my God. Oh!

1619
01:11:03,856 --> 01:11:06,728
Oh, help! Help! Help!

1620
01:11:06,772 --> 01:11:08,600
- Dead man.
- Help! Help!

1621
01:11:08,643 --> 01:11:10,819
Where the fuck is Bud?

1622
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:12,430
What the fuck
y'all looking at?

1623
01:11:12,473 --> 01:11:13,692
Mind your goddamn business!

1624
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:16,347
Oh, my God!
Somebody needs to help him.

1625
01:11:20,002 --> 01:11:21,787
I can't stand under him.

1626
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:23,658
Please.
Talk her outta killing me.

1627
01:11:23,702 --> 01:11:25,007
No! I'm gonna
let your bitch-ass go.

1628
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:26,618
Help me!
Please! Somebody!

1629
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:28,010
Ma'am! Ma'am!
Please pull him up.

1630
01:11:28,054 --> 01:11:30,491
- No. I'mma drop his ass.
- Help me.

1631
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:32,841
The cops won't
get here in time.

1632
01:11:32,885 --> 01:11:35,017
What the hell you do to her?

1633
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:37,498
You better scale your ass
back up that wall!

1634
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:38,804
What?

1635
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:40,501
That nigga ain't worth it.

1636
01:11:40,545 --> 01:11:42,024
Hey, I'm from where you from.
I'm from where you from.

1637
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:43,722
No, you ain't from
where I'm from!

1638
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:45,288
- I'm from these streets!
- It ain't worth it, baby.

1639
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:47,682
If you was from the street,
you wouldn't be doing that.

1640
01:11:47,726 --> 01:11:49,162
- I don't know how to talk.
- Help! Help!

1641
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:50,424
People from the street
don't hang people from roofs.

1642
01:11:50,468 --> 01:11:51,947
Hey!

1643
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:54,863
Can somebody else
chime in too and give advice?

1644
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:56,691
Don't let it happen.

1645
01:11:56,735 --> 01:11:59,433
I know you got children.
You got family that love you.

1646
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:01,217
- I ain't got no goddamn kids.
- Help!

1647
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:02,915
You got a family
that loves you, though.

1648
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,526
My family don't love me.
My family stole my shit.

1649
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,094
There's somebody
that loves you.

1650
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:09,182
You better pray
for this nigga,

1651
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:10,662
because I'm about to
drop his ass.

1652
01:12:10,705 --> 01:12:12,490
Lord, help us.
Help us right now.

1653
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:14,100
Lord, help us, please.
Jesus, help us.

1654
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:15,536
No, no, no.

1655
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,016
Don't, baby. Please.

1656
01:12:17,059 --> 01:12:18,234
Put him down!

1657
01:12:18,278 --> 01:12:20,019
Bud, is that you?

1658
01:12:20,062 --> 01:12:21,542
Yeah. It's me, friend.

1659
01:12:21,586 --> 01:12:23,718
Trina, you heard me.
I said put him down!

1660
01:12:23,762 --> 01:12:25,198
What? What the fuck
did you just say to me?

1661
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,460
You heard me.

1662
01:12:26,504 --> 01:12:28,070
Kill me first, Trina.

1663
01:12:28,114 --> 01:12:29,724
Bud's my brother.

1664
01:12:29,768 --> 01:12:32,553
I don't wanna see him die.

1665
01:12:32,597 --> 01:12:34,555
Lord Jesus.

1666
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:35,948
Lord Jesus.

1667
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:39,125
What? You got
some courage today?

1668
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:41,083
You're looking
at a new Bud Malone.

1669
01:12:41,127 --> 01:12:43,216
That's right.
This trip made me better!

1670
01:12:43,259 --> 01:12:46,132
Bud Malone ain't scared
of shit no more!

1671
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,439
Well, you smell like shit!

1672
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:50,441
That may be true.

1673
01:12:50,963 --> 01:12:52,486
And for a lot of reasons

1674
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,096
I don't feel like
fucking talking about now.

1675
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,795
But God damn it,
I'm not scared of you.

1676
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,927
Fuck you think
you talking to, huh?

1677
01:12:58,971 --> 01:13:00,929
You gonna die today.

1678
01:13:00,973 --> 01:13:02,844
Go and say hi to Grandma,
motherfucker.

1679
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:04,106
I'm gonna live!

1680
01:13:05,543 --> 01:13:07,066
You've bullied me,
you've picked on me,

1681
01:13:07,109 --> 01:13:08,371
and I'm done with it.

1682
01:13:08,415 --> 01:13:11,070
You might be saying hi
to Grandma and not me.

1683
01:13:11,113 --> 01:13:12,637
- What?
- That's right.

1684
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,942
You think
you gonna fuck me up?

1685
01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:15,117
I'mma try!

1686
01:13:15,161 --> 01:13:16,902
- Really, bitch?
- Really!

1687
01:13:16,945 --> 01:13:18,599
- Okay, then.
- Okay, then.

1688
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:19,774
Let's go.

1689
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,910
Give me some, little nigga.
I'm so proud of you.

1690
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:27,652
I'm proud of you.

1691
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,263
You've been acting
like a bitch for years!

1692
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:32,831
You finally stood up
for yourself.

1693
01:13:32,874 --> 01:13:34,267
I know that I was hard on you,
growing you up.

1694
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,529
You know what I'm saying?

1695
01:13:35,573 --> 01:13:37,836
It was hard for me
to grow you.

1696
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:39,011
But that's only because

1697
01:13:39,054 --> 01:13:40,665
I didn't want you to be
no punk, man.

1698
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,101
Look at you.

1699
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:43,755
It fucking worked.

1700
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,844
I guess it did.

1701
01:13:47,976 --> 01:13:49,325
Look at me. I'm a tough guy.

1702
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:50,718
- You're a tough guy.
- I stood up to you.

1703
01:13:50,762 --> 01:13:52,198
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, you stood up to me.

1704
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:54,113
- That's crazy.
- And I forgive you, man.

1705
01:13:54,156 --> 01:13:55,549
- Thank you.
- I forgive you.

1706
01:13:55,593 --> 01:13:56,855
I didn't think you would.
You know what I mean?

1707
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:01,990
What the hell was that for?

1708
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:03,688
You did steal my car.

1709
01:14:05,037 --> 01:14:06,342
Yeah, that's fair.

1710
01:14:06,386 --> 01:14:07,779
All right, bro.

1711
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:09,258
I'm proud of you, man.

1712
01:14:09,302 --> 01:14:11,347
I'm real proud of you.

1713
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:13,306
I'll catch you
in the wind, nigga.

1714
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:17,876
I was ready to eat.

1715
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,671
Hey, Maria.

1716
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:35,850
I realize in hindsight
this was all a little crazy.

1717
01:14:35,894 --> 01:14:37,286
And I was bummed out

1718
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,201
because I thought
we were soul mates.

1719
01:14:39,245 --> 01:14:42,161
But it turns out
that I do have a soul mate.

1720
01:14:42,204 --> 01:14:44,163
My best friend, Bud.

1721
01:14:44,206 --> 01:14:46,382
I mean, the guy saved my life.

1722
01:14:46,426 --> 01:14:47,993
So, anyway,
I mulled it over...

1723
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:50,604
Get the fuck out of here!

1724
01:14:50,648 --> 01:14:52,345
Get out!

1725
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:56,610
Look at my gallery!
Look at what you did!

1726
01:14:56,654 --> 01:14:58,656
- Assholes!
- Let's go, let's go.

1727
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,048
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1728
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,964
- Now!
- Nice to meet you.

1729
01:15:03,008 --> 01:15:04,400
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'm Bud.

1730
01:15:04,444 --> 01:15:05,924
- Get the fuck out!
- Shit. All right.

1731
01:15:09,362 --> 01:15:11,016
Oh, God.

1732
01:15:12,974 --> 01:15:14,672
It's okay.

1733
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:15,934
Thank you.

1734
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,111
Thank you.

1735
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:27,380
I wanna thank you
for bringing me on this trip.

1736
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:29,295
Bruh, I'm about to do so much.
I'm about to do it big now.

1737
01:15:29,338 --> 01:15:31,645
You know what I mean?
I'mma dress better.

1738
01:15:31,689 --> 01:15:33,081
Can't keep wearing
these big-ass jeans no more.

1739
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,431
Bud, I owe you, man.

1740
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:38,086
No, honestly,
you do so much for me.

1741
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,653
It's time I do
something nice for you.

1742
01:15:39,697 --> 01:15:41,263
And I think
I figured out a way

1743
01:15:41,307 --> 01:15:42,961
to finally make
your dreams come true.

1744
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:11,990
Wow.

1745
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:13,774
I can't believe this, man.
This is great.

1746
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:15,297
My dream finally came true.

1747
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:16,777
Is this gonna work though?

1748
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:19,127
- I think. So far, so good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,128
What do I do? Should I just...

1750
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:21,260
We just gotta have fun.

1751
01:16:21,303 --> 01:16:22,478
- Blend in.
- Okay, okay.

1752
01:16:22,522 --> 01:16:23,697
And change your voice a bit
if you can.

1753
01:16:23,741 --> 01:16:24,785
- Okay.
- Wow, let's do it.

1754
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:26,091
I'm gonna think
white thoughts.

1755
01:16:26,134 --> 01:16:26,961
- Think white thoughts.
- Think white thoughts.

1756
01:16:27,005 --> 01:16:28,267
Think white thoughts.

1757
01:16:30,269 --> 01:16:31,705
Hi.

1758
01:16:31,749 --> 01:16:34,795
Uh... I'm going to yoga
and golf later.

1759
01:16:34,839 --> 01:16:36,101
Yeah?

1760
01:16:36,144 --> 01:16:40,018
And I'm gonna
go see Megyn Kelly,

1761
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:42,150
uh, do a TED Talklater.

1762
01:16:42,194 --> 01:16:44,762
- Cool.
- Great.

1763
01:16:44,805 --> 01:16:47,155
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

1764
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,722
I just got my lips done.

1765
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:49,984
I think you look
beautiful tonight.

1766
01:16:50,028 --> 01:16:51,290
Aw.

1767
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:53,814
You know
if Dow Jones is here?

1768
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:55,860
Mmm. Ah.

1769
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:00,473
Let's Lady and the Trampit.

1770
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,694
I'm looking for a sugar daddy.

1771
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,175
Dude, I gotta
hand it to you, man.

1772
01:17:07,219 --> 01:17:08,873
White Chicks
totally works in real life.

1773
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,049
I think
we found our third link.

1774
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:12,877
- I'm Kitty.
- Kitty?

1775
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,183
Meow-meow.
- To Kitty. Meow-meow.

1776
01:17:15,227 --> 01:17:17,229
Are you a white chick?

1777
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:21,799
I was penetrated by a gorilla.

1778
01:17:21,842 --> 01:17:23,191
Oh!

1779
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:24,845
Isn't this party fun?

1780
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:26,368
They got all different
types of... Fuck!

1781
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:27,805
What the hell, dude?

1782
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:29,067
Mmm-hmm.

1783
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:31,069
Trina, is that you?

1784
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:32,853
- Oh!
- What up?

1785
01:17:32,897 --> 01:17:34,333
Trina!

1786
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:35,551
You know, since I'm
on the run and everything,

1787
01:17:35,595 --> 01:17:37,858
I figured I might as well
go with this look.

1788
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:39,207
And take it down to Mexico,

1789
01:17:39,251 --> 01:17:41,166
and start life all over again
as a white man.

1790
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:42,384
How's it feel so far
being a white man?

1791
01:17:42,428 --> 01:17:43,298
Oh, it's cooler
than a motherfucker

1792
01:17:43,342 --> 01:17:44,473
being a white man.

1793
01:17:44,517 --> 01:17:46,388
I'm living
my best motherfucking life.

1794
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:47,650
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

1795
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:48,695
I got to walk
right in this motherfucker,

1796
01:17:48,739 --> 01:17:50,349
didn't nobody stop me
from shit.

1797
01:17:50,392 --> 01:17:51,567
Let me grab your pussy.

1798
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:54,570
I mean, I'm sick of this

1799
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:56,050
boring-ass ballroom
dancing bullshit.

1800
01:17:56,094 --> 01:17:57,922
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1801
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,271
Anybody tell you
you look like a turtle?

1802
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:01,403
Whatever.

1803
01:18:06,234 --> 01:18:08,062
Hey, I need you to leave.

1804
01:18:08,106 --> 01:18:10,238
I need you to get
the fuck outta here!

1805
01:18:10,282 --> 01:18:12,066
Cut this music off.

1806
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:13,589
Go!

1807
01:18:13,633 --> 01:18:16,810
I said
get the fuck off the stage!

1808
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:18,420
This is my party.
All right, come on, bitches.

1809
01:18:18,464 --> 01:18:20,814
Let's do this!

1810
01:18:20,858 --> 01:18:23,556
Oh, shit.
We gotta do it, man.

1811
01:18:25,863 --> 01:18:27,212
I hope
you motherfuckers ready.

1812
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:30,432
Y'all gonna
Make me lose my mind

1813
01:18:30,476 --> 01:18:32,913
Up in here, up in here

1814
01:18:32,957 --> 01:18:37,918
Y'all gonna make me go all out Up in here, up in here

1815
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:42,444
Y'all gonna make me act a fool Up in here, up in here

1816
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:44,838
Y'all gonna make me
Lose my cool

1817
01:18:44,882 --> 01:18:46,405
Up in here, up in here

1818
01:18:46,448 --> 01:18:49,408
Go, go, go, go, go.

1819
01:18:56,371 --> 01:18:58,939
Here we go, nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga

1820
01:18:58,983 --> 01:19:01,594
Fuck that nigga
Suck my dick, nigga

1821
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,165
Nigga

1822
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:13,519
Get off me.

1823
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:17,871
Motherfuckers! Yeah!

1824
01:19:17,915 --> 01:19:19,525
Whoo! We did it!

1825
01:19:22,702 --> 01:19:25,661
Yo, that shit was disgusting,
but we got it all on camera.

1826
01:19:27,272 --> 01:19:29,274
Are you fucking kidding me?

1827
01:19:29,317 --> 01:19:32,190
I thought I needed
to help somebody.

1828
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:34,627
You see that box right there?
There's a camera guy in there.

1829
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,934
Yeah, but your throw up
is nasty, man.

1830
01:19:36,977 --> 01:19:37,978
Yeah, it's gross.

1831
01:19:38,022 --> 01:19:39,937
Hey, Adam,
wave to the people, Adam.

1832
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,025
Wave to them. Say hi.

1833
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:45,377
- Hell yeah!
- Oh, my God!

1834
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,987
You guys know you're wrong
for that, seriously.

1835
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:48,162
Lord have mercy.

1836
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:50,643
Man! Y'all is playing.
This the worst.

1837
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:51,992
Give him that moment.

1838
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:53,037
Hold that for me.

1839
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,168
There's a camera right there.

1840
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:57,171
Oh, my God.
I still don't see it.

1841
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:58,912
Clap it shut.
Watch your fingers. Slam it.

1842
01:19:58,956 --> 01:20:01,045
What did you think
was up with the vacuum?

1843
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,656
I was like, "Oh, shit."

1844
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,527
- Here's your...
- I got pranked.

1845
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:06,702
Oh, God.

1846
01:20:06,746 --> 01:20:07,965
Scalpel.

1847
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:10,010
Oh, how many fingers
can you fit in there?

1848
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:11,185
I think we gotta
go in the hole.

1849
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:12,404
Get the fuck out.

1850
01:20:12,447 --> 01:20:14,406
No, no. You gotta
knot it up and put it in.

1851
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:16,277
I trust you back there.
I do not trust him back there.

1852
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:19,324
Sorry, man. Shit.

1853
01:20:19,367 --> 01:20:21,369
Five-second rule, right?

1854
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:23,371
What if I drive like this?

1855
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,944
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

1856
01:20:30,988 --> 01:20:31,989
And action.

1857
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:35,035
Oh! What the fuck?

1858
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:36,080
Who are you?

1859
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,603
I'm a plumber.

1860
01:20:37,646 --> 01:20:39,997
That was amazing. He's like,
"I'm a plumber."

1861
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:44,001
Oh, shit!

1862
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:46,090
- Who are you?
- What the fuck?

1863
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:47,221
What time is it?

1864
01:20:47,265 --> 01:20:48,570
- Yo.
- What time is it?

1865
01:20:53,445 --> 01:20:54,663
- What the hell?
- What?

1866
01:20:54,707 --> 01:20:56,013
I need my clothes.
I'm late for work.

1867
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:57,188
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1868
01:20:57,231 --> 01:20:59,320
What the fuck
is going on right now?

1869
01:20:59,364 --> 01:21:00,495
Hey.

1870
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:10,549
Stop! Stop!

1871
01:21:10,592 --> 01:21:12,116
All right, Eric,
let's set test the rig.

1872
01:21:13,117 --> 01:21:14,379
Squeeze it.

1873
01:21:14,422 --> 01:21:16,207
And the safe word
is "popcorn", right?

1874
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,338
If somebody attacks me?

1875
01:21:17,382 --> 01:21:19,732
Uh, excuse me.
Where's the bathroom?

1876
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,430
Oh, God.

1877
01:21:22,474 --> 01:21:23,997
I thought that was the urinal.

1878
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,390
I'm gonna tell you
somethin' right now.

1879
01:21:25,433 --> 01:21:26,565
I don't care where you piss,

1880
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:28,262
but get away from me, okay?

1881
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:30,090
Because I don't wanna
smell your piss.

1882
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:33,050
I'll shower and play
pool with you if you want.

1883
01:21:34,138 --> 01:21:35,356
I guess he don't understand.

1884
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,792
No, okay, all right.

1885
01:21:36,836 --> 01:21:39,230
All right, goose bumps
or whatever.

1886
01:21:39,273 --> 01:21:40,535
Popcorn. Popcorn.
Popcorn. Popcorn.

1887
01:21:47,151 --> 01:21:49,283
You've got the coolest beard
I've ever seen in my life.

1888
01:21:50,415 --> 01:21:51,764
You just look like an artist

1889
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,549
that never sells his paintings
and I love it.

1890
01:21:54,593 --> 01:21:57,161
You just keep
all that art to yourself.

1891
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:58,553
You don't make a dime,

1892
01:21:58,597 --> 01:22:00,294
your girlfriend left
because you don't pay rent.

1893
01:22:00,338 --> 01:22:02,731
'Cause you won't sell
any of your pieces.

1894
01:22:02,775 --> 01:22:04,646
That's the beard you got.
You look amazing.

1895
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:06,605
That's so specific.

1896
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:08,520
Hey. I'm Chris Carey,
nice to meet you.

1897
01:22:08,563 --> 01:22:09,782
- Hi.
- Hey.

1898
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:12,350
A champagne toast
to my best friend, Bud.

1899
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:14,439
To the birthday boy.

1900
01:22:14,482 --> 01:22:15,875
What are you doing, man?

1901
01:22:15,918 --> 01:22:17,529
- Do you guys wanna hit this?
- I do not. Thank you.

1902
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:19,357
Are you sure?

1903
01:22:22,534 --> 01:22:24,666
You're in a movie!

1904
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:29,193
What were you thinking?

1905
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:31,064
I was thinking somebody
was coming after him,

1906
01:22:31,108 --> 01:22:32,544
and they was gonna come
after me right away.

1907
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:34,415
I'm like, "Oh, I have to hide
under the table."

1908
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:40,378
I'm just
a typical white chick.

1909
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:42,684
Got the number and the name

1910
01:22:42,728 --> 01:22:43,859
of a honky-tonk bar.

1911
01:22:43,903 --> 01:22:46,297
Shit. You scared
the shit outta me, dude.

1912
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,516
Make sure
it reads as face-fucking.

1913
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,691
Yeah.

1914
01:22:49,735 --> 01:22:51,345
And then, Adam,
look around to me.

1915
01:22:51,389 --> 01:22:52,520
Like whip your head around.

1916
01:22:52,564 --> 01:22:55,393
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Great.

1917
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:57,656
Right, yeah,
you just, like,

1918
01:22:57,699 --> 01:22:59,527
fuck his face while
you're making eye contact.

1919
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:02,356
Like, you're just like,
"Who's next."

1920
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,229
You guys are in a movie.

1921
01:23:07,492 --> 01:23:10,103
You guys are in a movie.

1922
01:23:10,147 --> 01:23:11,670
I had no idea
y'all was shooting a movie.

1923
01:23:12,932 --> 01:23:16,631
I ought to beat your butt.
Oh, my God.

1924
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:18,329
Hey, man, you're a hero.

1925
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:19,852
Hey, man, I was just trying
to make sure everything's...

1926
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:21,332
You're a goddamn hero.
You're a goddamn hero.

1927
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:23,725
Thanks for doing
the movie, buddy.

1928
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:24,944
They should've
probably put, like,

1929
01:23:24,987 --> 01:23:26,728
a towel over this
when we ain't filming.

1930
01:23:26,772 --> 01:23:28,382
It's a buddy film.

1931
01:23:28,426 --> 01:23:29,427
Thank you.
Thank you, folks.

1932
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,558
Hey!

1933
01:23:30,602 --> 01:23:32,125
- Hey, girl!
- Thank you.

1934
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:33,561
You are so good.

1935
01:23:33,605 --> 01:23:37,174
- You're an angel.
- I didn't know what to do.

1936
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:38,566
You was doing
a good job.

1937
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:39,828
But y'all just standing there,

1938
01:23:39,872 --> 01:23:41,395
y'all weren't even trying
to help or nothing.

1939
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:42,788
Because y'all scared as hell.

1940
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:43,702
Y'all just
standing there like...

1941
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,748
- I know.
- That ain't right.

1942
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,272
You ain't right.

1943
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,231
You was gonna let me
kill this black man.

1944
01:23:51,275 --> 01:23:52,841
I always wanted to talk
to her, you know what I...

1945
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:54,626
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1946
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:56,889
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

1947
01:23:57,759 --> 01:23:58,760
What the fuck?

1948
01:23:59,718 --> 01:24:00,719
What happened?

1949
01:24:02,286 --> 01:24:04,418
What in the fuck happened?

1950
01:24:04,462 --> 01:24:06,420
- What did you do?
- Okay. You're naked, man.

1951
01:24:06,464 --> 01:24:07,769
Hey, Craig.

1952
01:24:07,813 --> 01:24:09,423
You're selling it, woman.

1953
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:11,512
You're selling it.

1954
01:24:11,556 --> 01:24:13,775
That is awesome.

1955
01:24:13,819 --> 01:24:15,821
That blew my mind.

1956
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,607
They've caught us on film.

1957
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:21,827
Good job, guys.

1958
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:24,612
I just saw this girl
snatch a door off a cop car.

1959
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,225
And I was wondering.
I was like, "She's strong."

1960
01:24:29,487 --> 01:24:32,446
That's wrong. You better
get my good side too.

1961
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,752
Did you think
I was, like...

1962
01:24:33,795 --> 01:24:35,623
Did you think I was,
like, schizophrenic?

1963
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,321
I thought you were fucked up.

1964
01:24:38,931 --> 01:24:39,801
Three...

1965
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:44,458
Four...

1966
01:24:47,408 --> 01:24:52,408

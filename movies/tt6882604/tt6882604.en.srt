3
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,422
<i>Passing tower 8.
You copy?</i>

4
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:09,013
<i>Look at that. It's...
it's like an empty vegetable.</i>

5
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,580
<i>It grows in the forest.</i>

6
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,854
<i>I don't know maybe,</i>

7
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:19,991
<i>maybe... maybe I should just...</i>

8
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:22,459
<i>give it a go,
set up my own shop.</i>

9
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,494
<i>Yeah.
Take your own team.</i>

10
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,899
<i>Yeah. I would need
my whole team</i>

11
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:29,901
<i>but that would
gut the whole department.</i>

12
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,368
<i>What do you think,
they'd come?</i>

13
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,114
<i>Welcome to engineering.</i>

14
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,850
<i>Please beware
of your surroundings.</i>

15
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,065
<i>Come in.</i>

16
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,969
Coming up on your 40.
Can you see me?

17
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:40,004
<i>Welcome back
employee George Almore.</i>

18
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:43,473
Have a safe and productive day.

19
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,112
Did you pick me up on anything?

20
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,547
Area 19 through 22,

21
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,818
and the infrared grid
was showing some heat in places.

22
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,086
Okay.

23
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:58,756
All right let's get this power
rerouted. I got stuff running.

24
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,790
All right, on my count.

25
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,861
Three, two, one, now.

26
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,631
<i>Power rerouted.</i>

27
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,935
You now, if anyone asks you to
reactivate a mothball facility

28
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:13,671
by yourself, you say no.

29
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:15,605
You say no and then
you go get a burger.

30
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,009
Come on.

31
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,544
I'd like to try a burger.

32
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,854
All right.

33
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,823
Today's review is gonna be
same as always, just...

34
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,192
stay out of sight while we have
a conference call, okay?

35
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:43,067
Morning.

36
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,538
Want the TV?

37
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,720
I had that dream
again last night.

38
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:05,156
Yeah?

39
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,725
Is it the same as last time?

40
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,927
We were in a car driving.

41
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,233
We were in car?

42
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,235
Where were we going?

43
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,502
I don't know.

44
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,672
Just driving.

45
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:25,542
Okay, well...
Was it nice driving or...

46
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,477
or not nice driving.

47
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,114
Just driving.

48
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:36,253
Was there anything else you might remember?
Anything at all?

49
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,992
No.

50
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:44,627
Just sitting in the car
watching the things go past.

51
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,797
It was pretty,
but when I woke up,

52
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,033
- I felt sad.
- Yeah, well...

53
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,569
dreams can do that, you know.

54
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,024
She wants to talk to you.

55
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,293
George.

56
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:18,129
- She wants to talk to you.
- I know, I know.

57
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,197
I know she does, it's okay.
Thank you though.

58
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,138
Okay, can you get her
ready for the evaluation?

59
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,207
Thanks.

60
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,686
<i>Hello?</i>

61
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,190
Hey. I'm here.

62
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,025
<i>Hey.</i>

63
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,161
<i>How's my man?</i>

64
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,964
You know, missing you, a bit...

65
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,033
a lot.

66
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,734
Same as usual.

67
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,237
<i>Missing you too.</i>

68
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,076
<i>So, not going out?</i>

69
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:42,012
<i>All work no play, huh?</i>

70
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,150
You know me.

71
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,154
<i>Yeah. I do know you.</i>

72
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:51,222
Hey, hey, Jules?

73
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,824
Jules can you hear me?

74
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,327
- Hello?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

75
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,035
<i>I really hope
you're happy there.</i>

76
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,771
You know, it's beautiful here.

77
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,779
<i>I've always...</i>

78
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,349
Hey, don't...

79
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,851
- I just can't do this anymore.
- Don't say that.

80
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:22,686
<i>Talk like this it,</i>

81
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,355
<i>it's just too hard.</i>

82
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,422
Jules, listen to me.

83
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,160
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

84
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:34,965
<i>Goodbye, George.</i>

85
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:39,470
- Hey, don't, don't...
- <i>I love you.</i>

86
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,857
- <i>Come on, tell me.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

87
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,091
- Give them back.
- No.

88
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,393
- No, come on.
- No.

89
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,561
Give them back.

90
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:06,797
No. No, babe I'm fine.
Once they're on, they are mine.

91
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,799
Come on,
just put it in auto.

92
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,768
I don't want to.
It's my car. It's our car.

93
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,336
I'm gonna drive it, not a robot.

94
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:15,239
But what's the point of having this
car if you're just going to drive it.

95
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:19,910
Because it's being driven
by something I didn't design.

96
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:22,746
Mmm. For someone who likes
robots so much...

97
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,416
I like robots,

98
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,318
just my own, you know.
That's why I build them.

99
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,941
<i>George.
Are you hearing me?</i>

100
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:53,477
Yeah, yeah. I'm hearing you.

101
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,380
Where is everybody?

102
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,315
- I thought we were supposed to be doing a review.
- <i>Cancelled.</i>

103
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,252
<i>Very busy over here.
Big security review.</i>

104
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,254
Just file what you're doing
and get it over.

105
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,389
If I stop to file
everything I'm doing

106
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:06,624
I'm never gonna get
any work done.

107
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:08,959
<i>How are you doing getting those
security systems back up?</i>

108
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,495
Well, no great.

109
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,830
There's still lot to do.

110
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,064
You really let this place
go to seed.

111
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,332
<i>Oh, just get it done.</i>

112
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,234
Is this really necessary?
I don't have time...

113
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,936
<i>Very necessary.</i>

114
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,005
<i>Things are getting hot
with Otaku.</i>

115
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,207
<i>We got a few of them
in custody.</i>

116
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,142
<i>Off the record of course.</i>

117
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:28,312
Wow.
So we're kidnapping people now.

118
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,247
<i>It's the cost of
doing business.</i>

119
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,349
<i>They'd do the same to us.</i>

120
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,286
<i>We're assigning armed response
details to all our facilities</i>

121
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,121
<i>Nobody even knows
where this place is.</i>

122
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:39,023
<i>I don't need
an armed response unit.</i>

123
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,125
<i>Don't worry, George.
I've got some good news.</i>

124
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,394
<i>Hollins is out.</i>

125
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:45,362
<i>Gone.</i>

126
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,931
<i>I'm the new V.P.
of internal development.</i>

127
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:51,602
<i>We are thinking of folding
everything into my program.</i>

128
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,871
No, no, no.
I have a three-year contract.

129
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,139
You can't just shut me down.

130
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,908
<i>Two and a half and we haven't
really seen anything yet,</i>

131
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,511
<i>except for that ugly thing.</i>

132
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,813
<i>But it would be such a pity
if you couldn't deliver.</i>

133
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,017
How's, uh... How's your
pet project going, Simone?

134
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:10,387
<i>My pet project will define
the future of robotics</i>

135
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,324
<i>for at least the next 20 years.</i>

136
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:17,494
<i>Artisan robotics research isn't
really the future of this company.</i>

137
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:20,364
- Oh.
- <i>Oh, come on, George.</i>

138
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:23,567
<i>My prototype sailed through
the Halderman tests.</i>

139
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,870
<i>I mean that thing doesn't even speak.</i>

140
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:31,008
Congratulations, Simone.
That's great.

141
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,210
Uh, is that it?
I'm trying to conserve energy.

142
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,211
<i>Oh no,
we're not doing this again.</i>

143
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:36,013
<i>There is no way
you're getting a new line.</i>

144
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,147
<i>Out of the question.</i>

145
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,615
I'm talking about my own energy.

146
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:40,217
This is a waste of my time.

147
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,253
<i>Get those security systems
back up.</i>

148
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,621
<i>I want this place secure.</i>

149
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:49,426
Yeah.

150
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,566
- <i>Call terminated.</i>
- I don't like her

151
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,202
She's a bitch.

152
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:00,938
Yeah, you're right.

153
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,541
She is a very smug lady

154
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:08,379
and she loves herself very much.

155
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,547
The less she knows
about you two the better.

156
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:13,417
If she knew about you,
she would pull your brain out

157
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,254
and take it apart
piece by piece.

158
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:20,457
She'd realize what and idiot she'd
been for marginalizing my research.

159
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,962
Because she wouldn't be able to
put you back together, would she?

160
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:38,409
You're not ugly.

161
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:39,643
<i>Take your own team.</i>

162
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,646
<i>Yeah. I would need
my whole team,</i>

163
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,716
<i>and that would gut
their whole department.</i>

164
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:46,984
<i>What do you think,
they'd come?</i>

165
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,721
<i>Well, I'm pretty sure I could
appeal to their sensibilities.</i>

166
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,388
<i>I know
what they're getting paid.</i>

167
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,987
<i>Oh, screw this
boundary line thing.</i>

168
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,992
<i>Stop filming me.
Come on, come on.</i>

169
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:48,045
<i>Come on. Stop.</i>

170
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,480
<i>Come on. Let's go have a drink.</i>

171
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:21,178
I swear this thing's
got ghosts in it.

172
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:32,055
You okay?

173
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,190
You're being very quiet.

174
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,794
This about you dream?

175
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,597
No.

176
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,165
I know it's just a dream.

177
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,434
Do you have the ten?

178
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,514
You're welcome.

179
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:06,791
Why haven't you asked me to help
you in your workshop lately?

180
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,727
Is that it? Are you getting
bored out here with me?

181
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,296
- I thought we were a team.
- Yeah, of course we are.

182
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:16,199
I know what
you're doing in there.

183
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:19,771
We talked about this, okay?

184
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:22,239
I'm not replacing you.

185
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,642
You made another like me...

186
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,578
but better.

187
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,379
- Different.
- Better.

188
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,683
Just like I'm better
than my sister.

189
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,318
Different, okay?

190
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,254
Look, can you get back to
the house? You're getting wet.

191
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:40,390
I need to check this module
see if she triggered the system.

192
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:42,619
I know you can hear me.

193
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,588
I put you into
a hibernation state, okay?

194
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,390
Just... It's just like sleeping.

195
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,226
You'll be fine,
and when you wake,

196
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,461
I'm gonna be here
to take care of you.

197
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:54,498
Everything's gonna be fine.

198
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:28,800
<i>Subject J1 showing me where
she could win an egg and spoon race.</i>

199
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,836
<i>I'm kidding...</i>

200
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,672
Get you running in no time.

201
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,480
<i>Why don't you
stop filming me?</i>

202
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,716
<i>I'm documenting
your career trajectory</i>

203
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,686
<i>and by the sounds of it we're
going to need this in court...</i>

204
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:50,848
<i>Welcome
to vehicle storage.</i>

205
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:53,283
<i>Have a safe and productive day.</i>

206
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,738
It's okay.

207
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:17,875
What're you doing in here, boy?

208
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,816
Go, go. Come on. Go. Go, go.

209
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,955
House, close the door.

210
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:35,059
- <i>Unable to execute command.</i>
- Close it.

211
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,594
- Did you open the door?
- <i>Security system error</i>

212
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:40,064
<i>identified in vehicle storage.</i>

213
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,703
Have you been into
the security systems?

214
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:47,038
No.

215
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,107
What's happening?

216
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,043
Get the orange bag,
meet me outside.

217
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,822
Thanks.

218
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,024
Can you check the shutters?
I think the runners are jammed.

219
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:17,702
Hey, I'm gonna need your help
again soon. Is that okay?

220
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,903
What is it?

221
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,503
Uh, I just wanna take
a look at your legs.

222
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:22,707
Why?

223
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,409
Um, check the wear.

224
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,578
- They're fine.
- Yeah, I know they're fine.

225
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,514
But I'm gonna have to build
another pair soon,

226
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:33,117
and I want the diagnostics
driving the design.

227
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,819
Do you understand?

228
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,565
Do you know anything about this?

229
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:51,002
Somebody's been in here and
changed components. What is this?

230
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:53,704
- It wasn't me.
- Don't lie to me.

231
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:56,874
We only have a few of these spare and
we need them for the security cameras.

232
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,746
Look, what we're doing here,

233
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,215
is very, very important,
all right?

234
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:06,951
Limited resources.
Don't second guess me.

235
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:10,821
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything. Yeah.

236
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,601
<i>Vehicle approaching.</i>

<i>We're here to see your wife.</i>

243
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,184
Girls, listen up.

244
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:15,618
Back in your base. All right,
back in your base. Come on.

245
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:16,854
Come on,
there's some people here,

246
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:19,890
and I need you to play dead
until they're gone, all right?

247
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:22,293
You too. All right, come on.
Back up, back up.

248
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:23,995
It is very, very important.

249
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,696
Come on, there you go,
there you go.

250
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,865
Very important you do not move
until I come and get you,

251
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,066
do you understand?

252
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:50,254
Thank you, Mr. Almore.

253
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:55,726
We received the notifications of
your wife's transition to Somnolence.

254
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,094
She's not ready to go yet.

255
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,563
Of course.

256
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,933
Do please excuse our machines.

257
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:06,337
It's just standard
company procedure.

258
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,774
We need to check the conditions are
optimal for your remaining usage.

259
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:11,909
Mmm-hmm, sure.

260
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:14,045
Mr. Melvin will run a few tests.

261
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:22,086
Sir.

262
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,089
Subject is Almore, Julie Alice.

263
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:28,359
Term time so far two years,
eight months, four days.

264
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:29,626
That's right.

265
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,829
Any problems with the line?

266
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,832
Uh, well, um,

267
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:37,168
I can't connect with her
when I call.

268
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,103
She can call me,
but I can't call out.

269
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:41,205
- The line is clear when she call you?
- Yeah.

270
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:43,741
It's clear enough,
but it's getting weaker.

271
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:47,078
Well, that's to be expected
near somnolence

272
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:49,612
No cut outs though?

273
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,816
No, she, uh...

274
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,285
She has no idea
what's happening to her.

275
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:56,087
It's always a shame when we
lose a client that way.

276
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:00,124
Right.

277
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,931
It's getting worse.
A lot of static,

278
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,232
is that supposed to
happen?

279
00:24:08,265 --> 00:24:10,868
Well, the archive experience

280
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:13,204
often ends with audio calls

281
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:16,140
only as the signal
begins to fade.

282
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:20,643
Mind you, you know all about
these units, don't you?

283
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:22,847
We're working on
some new technologies

284
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,949
but they're not available
to the public yet.

285
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,020
Beautiful view.

286
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:33,924
Yeah, well, uh...

287
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,360
it's one of the benefits of
being out of the way, you know

288
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:41,065
And you live here on your own?

289
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,235
Yeah, that's right.

290
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,107
So very peaceful.

291
00:24:58,816 --> 00:24:59,817
Sir.

292
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:06,123
The security seals
in this unit have been broken.

293
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:07,925
The environmental system's
been patched.

294
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,026
What're you talking about?

295
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:11,896
Right here, on my system.

296
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,931
Well, it's wrong.
Check it again.

297
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:16,267
Home use of the archive

298
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,803
legally constitutes storage
of the deceased user's remains.

299
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:23,207
If it is opened in any way
we have a legal obligation

300
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,876
to remove that unit
and prepare it for burial.

301
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,278
Fuck you,
she's not going anywhere.

302
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,446
- I gonna have to ask you to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

303
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,348
We are deputized.

304
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:32,449
and obliged to act

305
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:36,854
under the Post Death
Internment Act... with force.

306
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:39,323
If necessary.

307
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:45,062
You know, you're standing on
corporate sovereign territory.

308
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:46,931
This would be considered
an armed incursion

309
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,899
by Archive Systems Incorporated.

310
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:51,202
Are you sure you wanna start that?

311
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:56,140
This simple misunderstanding
is completely my fault.

312
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:59,143
I failed to give Mr. Melvin...

313
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:03,214
the relevant information.

314
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:06,483
Sure.

315
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:08,953
Get out.

316
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,367
Hey.

317
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,835
How are you feeling?

318
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,804
Confused.

319
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,240
Yeah, I bet.

320
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:05,843
Look, I'm sorry I haven't been
here to explain any of this to you.

321
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,845
Well explain it to me now,
George.

322
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:09,880
You remember me?

323
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:12,850
It's pretty confusing actually.

324
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:17,021
Well it, is any of it, uh,
any of it real?

325
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,223
Any of it feel solid?

326
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:23,060
Some of it feels...
Some of it feels very real. I...

327
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:26,297
- Hold on.
- No. No!

328
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,965
No.

329
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:30,601
- All right, it's okay.
- Please.

330
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,003
When I did it before it was just
for your own good, okay?

331
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:37,341
I just need you
to relax into it, okay?

332
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:40,444
I'm trying to minimize your trauma
before I bring you fully online.

333
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:43,981
I...

334
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:45,015
it's easily reversible.

335
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,284
Don't do it again.

336
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,287
Okay...

337
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,192
How, uh, how did you...

338
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:58,128
Ah, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right, it's all right.

339
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:00,230
Look at me, it's okay.
It's all right.

340
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,532
It's all right.

341
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,568
It's okay, it's okay.

342
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:11,175
How does your skin feel?
It... It's a prototype.

343
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:14,178
Why can't I remember things?

344
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:18,015
It's, uh... It's just your consciousness,
uh, rebuilding itself, that's all.

345
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,983
I hate being like this.

346
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:22,052
These machines...
It's, it's just...

347
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:24,955
It's alright. Look you need to calm down.
You need to trust me.

348
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:27,291
Just relax. Calm down.

349
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,126
It's your software.
It's finding patterns,

350
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,961
trying to piece things together.
It...

351
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:33,297
It's not a tidy process
but it is working.

352
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,331
It's working.

353
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:36,567
Okay?

354
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,438
I don't even know
how I got here.

355
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:43,107
I don't even know
what here is...

356
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:47,978
I want to go home.

357
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:50,514
This is home.

358
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,361
It hurts, George.

359
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,164
Being like this.

360
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:27,110
<i>Now, for taste.</i>

361
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:28,645
<i>Vanilla.</i>

362
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,214
Do you like it?

363
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,684
- Who doesn't like vanilla?
- Hmm.

364
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:34,084
Number two.

365
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,321
Lemon.

366
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:40,357
Good. And finally?

367
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:43,393
Ugh.

368
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,730
- Lime.
- All right. Sorry about that.

369
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,299
Okay.

370
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,170
This might feel...
a little weird.

371
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:57,341
How does that feel?

372
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,176
- Fine.
- Yep. Any pain?

373
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:02,680
- No.
- Good.

374
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,081
Okay, give me the words again.

375
00:31:05,516 --> 00:31:08,285
Change. Control.

376
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:11,455
- Partner. Lives.
- Good.

377
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:12,790
All right.

378
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:14,491
Next up.

379
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:16,260
What's that?

380
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,628
This...

381
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:20,564
This is <i>Hello Puppy.</i>

382
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:22,032
What do I do?

383
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:25,168
You take it, you look through
it and then you play with him.

384
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:27,571
You'll do stuff together.
Puzzles, things like that.

385
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:35,279
What's the point
of these tests?

386
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:38,315
They're pretty basic. How are they
meant to test my intelligence?

387
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:40,517
They're not.
That's an empathy test.

388
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,353
You can tell a lot about a person by
the way they interact with animals.

389
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:49,593
He's asking me if I want to
watch him dance.

390
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:52,563
I like it.

391
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:55,165
This isn't the right component.
Where's the other one?

392
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:56,233
It's not ready yet.

393
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,568
No. I need the RK4.

394
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:58,602
Come on.

395
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:06,276
What was that machine?

396
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,781
Oh, that's J2, my second prototype.
She's...

397
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:10,815
She loves that thing.

398
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,720
We'll, uh,
pick this up tomorrow, okay?

399
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,390
So there are three of us.

400
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:29,433
What happened to you face?

401
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:33,103
Uh, it was an accident.

402
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:36,373
How's you, uh...
How's your throat feeling?

403
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,344
Tight. Sort of numb.

404
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,378
Okay. You'll get used to it.

405
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:44,716
You just have to keep talking
while it beds in.

406
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:45,817
You sleep last night?

407
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:48,920
Yes.

408
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:50,788
I've been dreaming a lot.

409
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,590
Last night I...

410
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:56,226
Well I don't know if
I'm dreaming or remembering.

411
00:32:57,695 --> 00:32:59,262
Dreams do that, don't they?

412
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,167
Hmm. Dreams do do that.

413
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,806
Your AI is doing everything
it can to understand the world.

414
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,241
To give it context.

415
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:12,275
Gelling things together.

416
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:15,646
Rough with the smooth, right?

417
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:20,852
Right.

418
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:23,855
You know I can hear you.

419
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,693
Come on,
come in, come say hi.

420
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:29,827
Meet our new house guest.

421
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:35,700
Come on, come in.
Come say hello.

422
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:37,200
I have to
help her out sometimes.

423
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,903
She has problems
with her mobility.

424
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:45,810
This is is J1.

425
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,748
Hello.

426
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:52,416
Sorry.

427
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,118
No, don't say sorry.
It's my fault.

428
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:58,388
Uh, work's been progressing so quickly I
didn't have time to fabricate her any arms.

429
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,524
But I don't think you mind,
do you, girl?

430
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:03,593
Are you going to
finish building me?

431
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:04,628
Yeah, of course I am.

432
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:07,765
- When?
- Well, um...

433
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:08,866
I'm working on something.

434
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,400
So, just give a couple of days,

435
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,704
and hopefully you'll be
fully independent.

436
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:15,405
No tethers, no battery, nothing.

437
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:20,343
Days?

438
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:22,412
Yeah, days. I promise.

439
00:34:26,283 --> 00:34:28,418
I wanna show you something.

440
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:32,322
They are not like normal
robots, are they?

441
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,927
They move differently.

442
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,629
Yeah. Well, you're all
an attempt at the same thing.

443
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:42,265
Deep tiered machine learning.

444
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,402
Artificial intelligence.
Human equivalent to the holy grail.

445
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:47,537
Now J1,

446
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:51,608
she stopped developing
around here.

447
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:54,311
Age five, maybe six max.

448
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,780
And I took that,

449
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:58,015
used it as a template
for version two, which is J2,

450
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,616
who you already met.

451
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,052
And this is her here.

452
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,954
She stopped developing

453
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:06,423
<i>around 15, maybe 16 at most.</i>

454
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:11,461
And finally, this...

455
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,699
This is you.

456
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:23,473
This is me.

457
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:08,552
Jesus Fucking Christ.

458
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:09,821
You scared the shit out of me.

459
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:13,991
- Sorry.
- Hi.

460
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:15,793
I thought you were out.

461
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:18,528
Yeah, well,
I was out and then I came back.

462
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:20,965
And, uh, you were snoring,
by the way.

463
00:36:20,998 --> 00:36:24,334
I only had three hours sleep,
so. And I don't snore.

464
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,138
Yeah, you do.

465
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:29,040
Ugh.

466
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:31,408
Ugh, if that's Fabian,
I'm gonna kill myself.

467
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,410
Ah, smiling today.

468
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:36,379
It's not his fault he's new and
he just doesn't know the systems.

469
00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:40,450
Just please don't do my section.
It's my favorite color.

470
00:36:40,483 --> 00:36:41,686
I won't.

471
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,159
Hey, when you're done with
the man-baby, let's make our own baby.

472
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:20,958
I'll be outside. You can get
ahold of me on this if you me.

473
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,695
The security systems aren't
going to fix themselves.

474
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,636
- You've got the day off.
- But I want to come with you.

475
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,771
I don't need
your help today, okay?

476
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:36,674
I just need you to stay home,
look after your sister

477
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:38,608
and make sure she doesn't
get into any trouble, okay?

478
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:55,820
<i>George, can you hear me?</i>

00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:06,097

00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,907
<i>George, get back here, please.</i>

489
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,210
Okay, I'm coming.

490
00:39:57,848 --> 00:40:01,819
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

491
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:07,158
15, 16, 17. Okay, it's 17.

I'm in bay three. Trip it...

493
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,267
One, two, three, four...

494
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,003
- I can help you count the modules.
- What?

495
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:22,073
I know I did it wrong last time,
but let me try again.

496
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:25,309
You just... You just made me
loose count, all right?

497
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:29,747
Look, can you please
take this, recharge it, okay?

498
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,915
All right, thank you.

499
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:48,666

00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:41,085
Yeah, I know. Okay, come on.

507
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,989
That's all right.

Good girl. Good girl.

Here you go, good girl.
That's it.

510

Now, I gotta go out
to a meeting, okay?

511
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,933
It's fine, I'll be straight

<i>He's got new security procedures for

Hi, I'm George Almore.

523
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,002
Take a seat.

524
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:47,144
So, what am I doing here?

525
00:43:50,614 --> 00:43:52,049
I'm a risk assessor.

526
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,185
I assess risk.

527
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:00,991
And you...
You are a risk.

528
00:44:06,463 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm sorry, sir.
You cannot smoke in here.

529
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,534
Really?

530
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:18,309
I hope, for your sake,

531
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:21,011
I don't need to use this
in the next couple of minutes.

532
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:26,050
Ah, I keep forgetting.

533
00:44:27,217 --> 00:44:28,419
You're new to all this.

534
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:36,360
Did you hear about Black Mesa?

535
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:38,562
No, I didn't.

536
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:39,997
Well, you should
read your circulars.

537
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,367
Two killed, one missing.

538
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:45,869
All research staff.

539

they were doing.

How to get in, who to target,

541
00:44:51,008 --> 00:44:52,076
what to take.

542
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,013
So, we're escalating.

543
00:44:57,414 --> 00:45:00,617
And we get to be best friends.

544
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:03,954
Well, I don't have time
for friends.

545
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:07,925
You're being watched.

546
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,427
- Yeah, I go that part.
- This involves her.

547
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:20,437
Hmm.

548
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:36,320
Two night ago.

549
00:45:38,055 --> 00:45:39,657
You were in my house?

550
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:41,291
- It was sent to me.
- Well, who took it then?

551
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:44,461
Who took the fucking picture?

552
00:45:45,963 --> 00:45:48,465
If I knew that

553
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:51,669
I would be talking to them
instead of you.

554
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:55,105
So what? This is some...
some kind of message?

555
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:01,211
Your new procedures.

556
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:05,015
Emergency use only.

557
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,686
- Do you understand?
- Mmm-hmm.

558
00:46:12,322 --> 00:46:14,692
Sleep tight, Mr. Almore.

559
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:24,635
Oh, and, uh,
stay away from the tuna fish.

560
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:50,688
<i>Oh, you're doing it?</i>

561
00:47:52,256 --> 00:47:54,358
<i>Oh, wow. Oh, shit.</i>

562
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:02,566
Wow.

563
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,702
That is very ladylike.

564
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:05,803
Thank you.

565
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:08,806
It is so good.

566
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,710
Tell me how it went.

567
00:48:12,744 --> 00:48:16,079
It went, um...
It went, um...

568
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:22,452
Three years of solid research with a
deliverable prototype at the end of it.

569
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,388
What? Whoa, what?

570
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:27,190
- Yes, they gave it to me.
- Oh, my God.

571
00:48:27,224 --> 00:48:29,326
- They... It happened.
- Oh, my God.

572
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,462
- Babe, that's amazing. Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

573
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:36,099
Oh, my God.
Okay, so, tell me everything.

574
00:48:36,133 --> 00:48:37,334
Are they
expanding your workshop?

575
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:39,136
Um...

576
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:41,538
Yeah, I mean, kinda.
It's off-site.

577
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,676
They gave you a shop at Mesa?

578
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,477
No. I wish. No.

579
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,781
It's the Yaminashi prefecture.

580
00:48:49,814 --> 00:48:52,282
- The what?
- The Yaminashi,

581
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:53,584
I think that's how you say it.

582
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:54,852
Yaminashi.

583
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:56,286
- Yaminashi.
- Yaminashi.

584
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,388
- Yaminashi.
- Yaminashi.

585
00:48:58,422 --> 00:48:59,489
What is that?

586
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:02,526
It's Japan.

587
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,595
Come on.

588
00:49:06,163 --> 00:49:08,231
It's Japan.

589
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:12,469
Look, it's thus, uh...
It's an amazing site.

590
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:14,438
It's this
old moth balled facility,

591
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:17,341
in the middle
of the forest. Beautiful.

592
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,376
I mean it has this
huge house attached to it,

593
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:22,412
with amazing view
and everything I need.

594
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:24,849
And they're just gonna
leave us to it for three years.

595
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,153
Right.

596
00:49:31,956 --> 00:49:33,290
Right.

597
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:37,227
Whoa.

598
00:49:41,264 --> 00:49:42,432
Japan?

599
00:49:45,535 --> 00:49:46,536
Yeah.

600
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:51,174
I know it's a lot.

601
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,479
No, no. Honestly, it's...

602
00:49:56,881 --> 00:49:58,615
It's great.

603
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:00,217

Yes, I opened it. I just
wanted to see what's inside.

617
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:01,699
Everything's fine,
open the doors.

No, there is no
emergency situation.

620
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,839
Open the doors. I've got
welding equipment running.

621
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:10,540
Open the fucking doors.

622

<i>If you open that case again,</i>

<i>Drones will not launch

628
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:59,216
I can't quite get my head
around it though.

629
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,518
Once you're gone,
you're gone, right?

630
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,988
Right. I mean you're dead,
but you're not gone, gone.

631
00:55:07,524 --> 00:55:09,026
Listen to this,

face to face interaction
with the deceased.

634
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,103
But then it must be some sort of
download or something, surely.

635
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:22,039
If there's a way of saving
consciousness after death?

636
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:23,908
Right, but it's analogue,
not digital.

637
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:26,177
That's why you only get
a certain amount of time.

638
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:30,047
I know it's new
technology and everything,

639
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,782
but it's just weird
as shit to me.

640
00:55:31,816 --> 00:55:35,019
Yeah, it's weird, but
it's also kind of amazing.

641
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:36,787
I mean, you get
to wrap up your affairs

642
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:37,855
after you're dead.

643
00:55:37,888 --> 00:55:39,522
You get to say
goodbye properly.

644
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,893
Rough with
the smooth, right?

645
00:55:45,129 --> 00:55:47,031
Why would you want to talk
to me if I was dead?

646
00:55:47,064 --> 00:55:48,833
Because
I would miss you.

647
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:49,867
Aw.

648
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:52,602
I'd miss you too,
I guess.

649
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:55,638
You know I wouldn't
know I was dead, right?

650
00:55:55,673 --> 00:55:56,807
How do you know
you would anyway?

651
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:01,812
- Fine, fine.
- Fine?

652
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:02,880
- Fine.
- Fine?

653
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:04,815
No, I don't want it,
I don't want it.

654
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:44,088
Jesus Christ.

655
00:56:49,927 --> 00:56:52,595
I don't really understand why
you're so fixated about this.

656
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,232
Because I don't
want it, George.

657
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:56,734
<i>All right,
you don't want it.</i>

658
00:56:57,634 --> 00:56:59,636
<i>You hate it that much.</i>

659
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:00,838
<i>Can we just think
about it? Can we...</i>

660
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:02,873
<i>No. I don't want
to think about it, George.</i>

661
00:57:02,907 --> 00:57:05,242
<i>I don't want it.
It's as simple as that.</i>

662
00:57:05,276 --> 00:57:06,944
<i>Look why don't you
just think about it a little...</i>

663
00:57:06,977 --> 00:57:08,012
<i>I don't want
to think about it!</i>

664
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:09,680
<i>Look, think about it.
It's free!</i>

665
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:10,714
I don't want to, George.

666
00:57:10,748 --> 00:57:12,950
I don't want to be trapped
in a box being dead.

667
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:15,219
<i>It's not like I went
behind your back to do it okay?</i>

668
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,287
<i>Well, it feels like it.</i>

669
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,354
<i>Well, I didn't.</i>

670
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:19,890
Are you gonna cancel it?

671
00:57:24,228 --> 00:57:25,262
Sure, I'll cancel it.

672
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:14,205
No, no, no.

673
00:59:15,406 --> 00:59:17,141
Come on. I told you
to stay inside.

674
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:20,110
Come on.
Inside, inside, inside.

675
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:21,512
Jesus Christ.

676
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:24,014
Come on. Here you go.
All right.

677
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:26,016
All right.

678
00:59:28,852 --> 00:59:30,020
Keep walking.

679
00:59:32,423 --> 00:59:33,724
Is she okay?

680
00:59:36,126 --> 00:59:37,828
You know you're not
supposed to get wet.

681
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:40,264
She wouldn't
come inside.

682
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:43,100
Did you find anything?

683
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:47,805
No. I didn't.
I need my night kit.

684
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,873
I'm going to have
to go back out.

685
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:52,009
I'm sorry,
I'm not enough like her.

686
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:54,845
Hey, hey, hey,
don't talk like that, okay?

687
00:59:54,878 --> 00:59:58,048
We're family and I'm gonna
look after you. Both of you.

688
00:59:58,082 --> 01:00:00,284
But right now,
I need you to help, okay?

689
01:00:00,317 --> 01:00:02,886
Now firstly,
do not let her outside

690
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,121
under any circumstances.

691
01:00:04,154 --> 01:00:05,556
I don't want anything
to happen to her

692
01:00:05,589 --> 01:00:08,492
or to you, all right?
Secondly, look at me,

693
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:10,294
if anyone tries
to get into the house,

694
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:11,328
and I mean anyone,

695
01:00:14,298 --> 01:00:16,233
I want you to contact me
on the radio.

696
01:00:16,267 --> 01:00:18,369
Channel 12,
same as always, okay?

697
01:00:19,169 --> 01:00:20,804
All right, good.

698
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,343
Out, come on, out.

699
01:00:26,377 --> 01:00:29,113
Let's go. Come on,
you too, let's go. Let's go.

700
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:31,815
I haven't got time
for this right now.

701
01:01:00,511 --> 01:01:01,512
Fuck.

702
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:07,418
You okay?
Can you hear me?

703
01:01:12,956 --> 01:01:15,159
You sick bastard!

704
01:01:15,192 --> 01:01:16,093
- I know about her.
- It's all right. It's okay.

705
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:17,895
- I know about her!
- Calm down. Calm down.

706
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:18,962
- I know what you've done.
- Listen.

707
01:01:18,996 --> 01:01:21,465
I know she's in that box
and she's not coming back.

708
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:22,466
Wait, wait, calm down.

709
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:25,035
- Why have you done this to me?
- Listen to me.

710
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:26,603
It's okay. It's all right.

711
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:28,138
Okay? It's okay.

712
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:32,343
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

713
01:01:34,345 --> 01:01:35,546
I just couldn't be
without her.

714
01:01:37,981 --> 01:01:39,550
Why didn't you tell me?

715
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:42,252
I wanted to,
but I couldn't.

716
01:01:43,587 --> 01:01:44,588
I couldn't.

717
01:01:48,592 --> 01:01:50,127
If you want me to trust you,

718
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,562
you have to be
straight with me.

719
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:57,368
Yeah. What do you need
to know?

720
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:00,871
Everything.

721
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,126
So...

722
01:02:23,695 --> 01:02:26,163
this is the data that
the computer has managed

723
01:02:26,196 --> 01:02:28,232
to pull out of the archives.

724
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:30,434
They've never managed to connect
a computer to one before.

725
01:02:32,102 --> 01:02:34,004
So just save her onto
a hard drive.

726
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:36,106
No.

727
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,575
Jesus, I wish
it were that simple.

728
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,013
Strictly speaking, your brain
is not a computer.

729
01:02:43,046 --> 01:02:46,183
There's a bio-chemical
element to it.

730
01:02:46,216 --> 01:02:48,653
And the technology in,
in the archive and your brain

731
01:02:48,686 --> 01:02:49,754
is extremely complex.

732
01:02:49,788 --> 01:02:53,257
There's a lot of valves,
transistors, a lot of glass.

733
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:55,559
But you did it.

734
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,361
Yeah.

735
01:02:59,129 --> 01:03:01,064
I did it.

736
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:04,101
One time I was
able to extract a...

737
01:03:04,134 --> 01:03:06,503
a form of analogue signal
from it.

738
01:03:07,772 --> 01:03:09,573
<i>And I tried to reconnect,
but I couldn't.</i>

739
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:12,009
<i>I thought it was
some kind of fluke so I,</i>

740
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,378
<i>I dumped the data
and put it into a piece of</i>

741
01:03:14,411 --> 01:03:16,113
<i>pattern recognition software.</i>

742
01:03:18,081 --> 01:03:19,383
I waited a long time,

743
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:21,251
over a year,

744
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:23,454
and then, I saw something.

745
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,390
It was her.

746
01:03:28,425 --> 01:03:33,163
So, I used that to create
a personality template

747
01:03:33,197 --> 01:03:35,365
and then, I started creating
a physical version.

748
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,601
J1.

749
01:03:37,634 --> 01:03:40,637
And with each one, it got
exponentially better.

750
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:42,306
J2, and...

751
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:45,976
finally you.

752
01:03:48,178 --> 01:03:49,413
What was she like?

753
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:54,752
She was perfect... for me.

754
01:03:59,056 --> 01:04:00,290
Do you think we'd get along?

755
01:04:01,391 --> 01:04:02,526
Well, you tell me.

756
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:05,462
You know her
better than anyone.

757
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:09,600
I feel like
she's my sister.

758
01:04:11,335 --> 01:04:14,371
Yeah. You all took on that
relationship to some extent.

759
01:04:14,404 --> 01:04:17,274
Are you going
to build a J4?

760
01:04:19,643 --> 01:04:20,644
No.

761
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:25,015
Now, I need you to tell me
what happened.

762
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,053
She took me
to the archive.

763
01:04:31,388 --> 01:04:33,791
She was holding me
and had me pinned,

764
01:04:33,825 --> 01:04:35,158
so I struggled.

765
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:37,060
She must have
overbalanced and...

766
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:40,063
I don't remember anything
after that.

767
01:04:41,532 --> 01:04:42,533
She?

768
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:54,645
- What the hell did you do?
- It was an accident.

769
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:57,147
What do you mean it was
an accident? Why?

770
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,684
I wanted to tell her
the truth.

771
01:04:59,717 --> 01:05:01,218
You wanted to tell her
the truth.

772
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:06,557
- You got jealous?
- Why do you need her?

773
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:08,525
Why can't you keep
working on me?

774
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:12,095
I want to be better.

775
01:05:15,198 --> 01:05:16,633
Did you do anything
to the archive?

776
01:05:16,668 --> 01:05:18,435
- Did you touch it?
- No.

777
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:21,238
I'd never hurt her.
It was an accident.

778
01:05:22,272 --> 01:05:24,141
Well, you went
too far this time.

779
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,175
You're staying here.

780
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,652
<i>Secure channel.</i>

781
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:39,389
<i>What's this all about?
I'm really busy.</i>

782
01:05:39,423 --> 01:05:43,861
<i>We had a visit.
from the archive company.</i>

783
01:05:43,895 --> 01:05:46,263
<i>They wanted to talk to you
about your wife.</i>

784
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,432
<i>That's got nothing
to do with you.</i>

785
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:50,702
<i>Well, the company
is paying for the service,</i>

786
01:05:50,735 --> 01:05:52,302
<i>so actually, it does.</i>

787
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:54,872
<i>They seem to think
your robots</i>

788
01:05:54,906 --> 01:05:58,475
<i>might somehow be based around
their archive technology.</i>

789
01:05:58,508 --> 01:06:01,612
<i>They're talking
patent infringement.</i>

790
01:06:01,645 --> 01:06:04,615
<i>They want to take
a good, close look at them.</i>

791
01:06:04,648 --> 01:06:05,850
<i>Of course, I told them</i>

792
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:08,251
<i>all our research
is confidential.</i>

793
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:11,154
<i>They're threatening
legal action against us.</i>

794
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:13,156

01:32:06,977 --> 01:32:09,213
I can't really explain
right now, but, um,

953
01:32:10,948 --> 01:32:13,117
you have to trust me, okay?

954
01:32:14,518 --> 01:32:15,953
Your signal's really weak.

955
01:32:17,454 --> 01:32:18,722
And I have to do this.

956
01:32:20,925 --> 01:32:22,059
I'll see you very soon.

957
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:36,941
See you very soon?

958
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,795
You're going to
put her in me...

959
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:00,931
aren't you?

960
01:33:02,866 --> 01:33:04,034
Just overwrite me.

961
01:33:06,804 --> 01:33:08,472
Like some sort of
software update.

962
01:33:12,409 --> 01:33:13,911
I built you to hold her, yeah.

963
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:19,783
I had to be absolutely sure

964
01:33:19,817 --> 01:33:21,785
that you could feel
the same emotions,

965
01:33:24,555 --> 01:33:26,123
same feelings that she had.

966
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,762
I'm sorry,
but it's the only way.

967
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:35,132
She's dead.

968
01:33:35,165 --> 01:33:37,201
Jules is fucking dead!

969
01:33:37,234 --> 01:33:40,204
<i>Warning.

<i>Emergency alert.</i>

971
01:34:02,893 --> 01:34:04,161
House, close the door.

01:34:04,194 --> 01:34:06,096
<i>Access denied.</i>

973
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:08,032

<i>Unable to comply.</i>

975
01:34:29,453 --> 01:34:31,889
<i>You are not
getting out of this, George.</i>

976
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:36,593
<i>System failure.
Imminent.</i>

977
01:34:38,663 --> 01:34:39,731
No.

<i>Security door one

980
01:35:03,053 --> 01:35:04,321
Let her go, George.

981
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:09,960
No.

982
01:35:11,595 --> 01:35:13,063
I have to try
and get her back.

983
01:35:13,698 --> 01:35:14,898
She's gone.

984
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:16,967
Just put the gun down, okay?

985
01:35:17,634 --> 01:35:18,635
<i>Area breached.</i>

986
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:22,306
Who are they?
What do they want?

987
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:25,576
They want you.

988
01:35:25,609 --> 01:35:26,610
<i>Emergency.</i>

<i>Area breached.</i>

990
01:35:29,546 --> 01:35:31,181
Hey, hey, hey,
don't do that. Come on.

991
01:35:32,983 --> 01:35:34,551
Come on. It's all right.

992
01:35:35,419 --> 01:35:36,453
It's okay.

993
01:35:40,124 --> 01:35:41,693
Come on. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

994
01:35:41,726 --> 01:35:43,560
It's all right. It's okay.

995
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:49,299
I'm sorry,
it won't work with you.

996
01:35:51,703 --> 01:35:53,036
I couldn't build you
well enough.

997
01:35:55,572 --> 01:35:57,141
I know. I know.

998
01:36:03,547 --> 01:36:04,548
Yeah.

999

<i>Security door two
has been breached.</i>

1000
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:15,592
I never stood a chance...

1001
01:36:17,762 --> 01:36:18,962
did I?

1002
01:36:19,563 --> 01:36:20,931
It's my fault.

1003
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:23,534
I killed her.

1004
01:36:24,635 --> 01:36:26,103
It was nobody's fault.

1005
01:36:26,136 --> 01:36:27,204
Yes, it was.

1006
01:36:29,006 --> 01:36:30,742
I was driving.

1007
01:36:30,775 --> 01:36:32,643
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

1008
01:36:32,677 --> 01:36:33,678
No, no, no, that's...

1009
01:36:35,179 --> 01:36:37,481
See, I wanted
to fix it, you know?

1010
01:36:39,149 --> 01:36:40,451
I wanted to make things right.

1011
01:36:41,653 --> 01:36:44,955
so that we could have a life
like we were supposed to have.

1012
01:36:52,463 --> 01:36:54,598
So that we could have
a future, together.

1013
01:36:58,402 --> 01:36:59,403
I'm sorry.

1014

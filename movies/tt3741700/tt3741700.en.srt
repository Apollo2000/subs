Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

169
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,954
Monarch was tasked

170
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:39,092
with finding and destroying
these radioactive monsters.

171
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:41,327
But you either can't
or won't tell us

172
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,897
how many there are
or why they're showing up.

173
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,867
So, maybe it's time for
the military to put them down.

174
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:49,934
[Serizawa] Killing them
would be a mistake.

175
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:52,104
They returned because of us.

176
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:56,409
It was our atomic testing
that awoke <i>Gojira.</i>

177
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,578
Other creatures like the MUTOs

178
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,646
from strip mining
and seismic surveys.

179
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,016
But these are not monsters.

180
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,019
They are animals
rising to reclaim

181
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,685
a world that was once theirs.

182
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,054
It almost sounds like

183
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:11,156
you're protecting them,
Doctor Serizawa.

184
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:12,657
As if you admire them.

185
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,761
I admire all forms of life.

186
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,897
Senators,
if we hope to survive,

187
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,601
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

188
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,870
With <i>Gojira.</i>

189
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:27,238
[Dr. Graham] A sort of
symbiotic relationship,

190
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,341
if you will.

191
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:30,977
Like the lion and the mouse.

192
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,578
Or the scorpion and the frog.

193
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,314
So you'd want to
make Godzilla our pet?

194
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,782
No.

195
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:39,550
We will be his.

196
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,121
[senators laugh]

197
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,157
[cell phone vibrating]

198
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,925
Uh... No. No, actually.
[chuckles nervously]

199
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,459
That's not what
Doctor Serizawa meant.

200
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:49,694
[whispers] We have to go.

201
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,229
No one is implying
that we would be

202
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:52,865
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.
- Sam, we have to go.

203
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,434
[Williams] Doctor Serizawa,
Doctor Graham,

204
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:55,767
this hearing is not adjourned.

205
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,103
Doctor Serizawa,
I hope you understand

206
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:01,806
the consequences
of walking out that door.

207
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:03,108
Uh, you know what, Senators,

208
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,609
while I confer
with my colleagues here,

209
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,011
I'm gonna set you up
with a very brief

210
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,612
and pretty fun documentary

211
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,348
on Titan reproduction.

212
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,150
I think this is the one where
the genitals are blurred out.

213
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:14,786
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

214
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,590
[birds chirping]

[helicopter blades whirring]

219
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:18,449
[Dr. Graham]
The feed cuts out there.

220
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:20,752
The survivors
haven't been able to give us

221
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:23,088
much more
than what the footage allows.

222
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,828
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

223
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,194
I'm sorry, Mark.

224
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:31,733
I should've been there
for her.

225
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,699
Who are they?

226
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:35,970
We don't know yet.

227
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:40,307
We believe
they were after this.

228
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,443
You didn't.

229
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,910
[Sam] It's the ORCA.

230
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,512
Uh, that's why we think
they need Emma.

231
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:50,049
She believed that
if we could somehow replicate

232
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,083
the biosonar the Titans
use to communicate...

233
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:54,254
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

234
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:56,955
Who is he?

235
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:59,290
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

236
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,961
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

237
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:03,396
I'm a big fan of your wife...

238
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,764
...'s work. And you.

239
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,431
That just came out so weird,
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,299
Emma and I destroyed
the prototype.

241
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:11,237
And then Emma decided
to rebuild it.

242
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,671
After San Francisco,
she went home to Boston,

243
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,140
spent years developing it.

244
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,541
She thought it could help...

245
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,943
Would help what? Play God?

246
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,978
[Dr. Graham] No.
Help prevent another attack.

247
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,545
ORCA was a grad school
science project.

248
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,649
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

249
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:25,883
Not so you could talk to your
little creatures out there.

250
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:29,054
Listen to me, they'll think
it's one of them.

251
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:32,024
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em

252
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:33,858
and you're
gonna be responsible

253
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,828
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

254
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,264
Which is why we need
to get it back.

255
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:41,833
Emma always said no one knew
the ORCA better than you.

256
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,035
It shouldn't even exist.

257
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:45,404
[Sam] That may be, Mark.

258
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,338
But it's fallen
into the wrong hands.

259
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,876
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

260
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,612
keeping
Emma and Madison alive.

261
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,613
Mark, we know you're hurting.

262
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:58,152
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

263
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,155
I promise.

264
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:11,697
[Dr. Graham]
<i>When was the last time</i>

265
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:12,901
<i>you spoke to Emma?</i>

266
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,470
About three years ago.

267
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:18,002
After San Francisco,

268
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,008
we went back home to Boston.

269
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,642
Tried to put
the pieces back together.

270
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:28,881
Emma dealt with it by doubling
down on saving the world

271
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,785
and I started drinking.

272
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,987
I can't tell you
how much I hated myself

273
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,358
for letting Maddie see me
that way.

274
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,260
Uh, you mind
if we cut in here?

275
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:44,465
It's just,
you're gonna wanna see this.

276
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,032
Emma combined the bioacoustics

277
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:51,270
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

278
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:53,104
A sort of baseline frequency

279
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:55,174
that all the creatures
respond to.

280
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,142
Attracting them,
repelling them,

281
00:16:57,144 --> 00:17:00,111
even at times
calming them down.

282
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:02,114
It's pretty remarkable
actually.

283
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,214
[Dr. Graham] The problem is
we don't know

284
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,649
which Titans she combined.

285
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,185
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

286
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:09,655
we'll be able
to track the ORCA

287
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,924
and find Emma and Madison.

288
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,992
[Mark] Jesus!

289
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:15,927
How many of these things
are there?

290
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,264
Seventeen and counting
after <i>Gojira.</i>

291
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,598
Seventeen?

292
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,200
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

293
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,470
While others we've contained

294
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,071
at top secret sites
around the globe.

295
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:29,040
Cambodia, Mexico,
Skull Island.

296
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,476
We even found one in Wyoming.

297
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:32,744
They're everywhere.

298
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,979
Why don't you kill 'em?

299
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,713
The government wants to.

300
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:40,287
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

301
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:44,259
Don't kid yourself.

302

Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.

built to track and study
Godzilla on his own turf.

I thought he was missing.

316

Well, only if you don't know
where to look.

317
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:55,961
As you know,
at approximately 0700 hours,

our containment site

in China's Yunnan Rainforest
was raided.

320
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,536
The specimen,
code name Mothra, escaped.

321
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,905
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

322
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:09,308
While Doctor Emma Russell

323

and her daughter Madison
were taken hostage.

324

This is the man responsible,
Alan Jonah.

325
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,651
A former British army colonel
turned ecoterrorist.

326
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,819
Obsessed with restoring
natural order.

327
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,388
And to fund his operations,

328
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,625
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

329
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,393
Titan DNA.

330
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:30,361
What the hell is someone gonna
do with a giant worm?

331
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:31,963
[Rick] Are you kidding,
Martinez?

332
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,432
What can't you do with it?

333
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,501
Pharmaceuticals,
bioweapons, food...

334
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:38,604
Hell, there isn't a country
or a company on the planet

335
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:40,504
that doesn't wanna get its
hands on one of these suckers.

336
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:43,742
And remember,
this is just a larva.

337
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:44,976
That's a baby.

338
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,011
After it cocoons,

339
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,413
something else
is gonna crawl out.

340
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:51,183
Something bigger, meaner...

341
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,885
- We don't know that, Rick.
- [Rick] Oh, yeah?

342
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,921
Just wait for it, Chen.

343
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:57,356
Our intel indicates
that Jonah wants

344
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:58,790
to capture this specimen.

345
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,358
Alive.

346
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,528
Which means that he and his
mercs won't be far behind.

347
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,896
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

348
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,433
I wouldn't bother.

349
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:08,567
Excuse me?

350
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:10,269
[Mark] Sounds like
a duck hunt to me.

351
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:11,802
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

352
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:14,339
A decoy. A diversion.

353
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,107
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

354
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:18,476
Why would they want just this
one when they've got the keys

355
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:22,013
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

356
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:24,683
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra

357
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,918
so they can go
after a real prize.

358
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,753
Something bigger.

359
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,454
Right.

360
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,591
Mark,

361
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,092
this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

362
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:35,327
They know what they are doing.

363
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,761
[Mark] That's not
just a specimen.

364
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,396
I've got an ex-wife
and a daughter out there,

365
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,731
in case you forgot.

366
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:42,134
No. No one has
forgotten that, Mark,

367
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:43,335
but, uh, to remind you,

368
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,769
you were brought on here

369
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,404
to help track the ORCA,
and to advise us...

370
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:49,808
I advise you to kill
these things. All of 'em.

371
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,444
Especially him.

372
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:52,712
You wanna make sure
these things

373
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,280
don't fall
into the wrong hands?

374
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,114
You kill them
and the ORCA's useless.

375
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,783
Emma wouldn't have
wanted that.

376
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:00,219
Even to save her life.

377
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,552
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time

378
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,688
Emma put all of this
before herself

379
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,759
or her family, would it?

380
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,764
Dude hates Titans.

381
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:15,102
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

- No, we're good!

00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,975
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

489
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:33,611
You out of your goddamn mind?

490
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,482
Let him know
we're not a threat.

491
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,386
Open the shields.

492
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:44,958
Do it.

493
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,827
Hey, what's with
the light show?

494
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,896
It's an intimidation display.

495
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:27,531
Like a gorilla
pounding his chest.

496
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,567
[Sam] Consider us very

497
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,105
intimidated.

498
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,975
I don't think it's for us.

499
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:45,152
What are you doing, dude?

500
00:28:55,795 --> 00:28:57,797
[faint bellowing]

501
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,510
[all sigh with relief]

502
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:14,681
[Sam] Well,
that was interesting.

503
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:16,950
Jesus!

504
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,896
Can we maybe
close the shield now?

505
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,629
Show me
his territorial routes.

506
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,165
What? Why?

507
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,067
Because I wanna start
a boat tour. Just show me.

508
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,235
- [Rick] Okay. Coming up.
- [typing]

509
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,271
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

510
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:42,206
[Mark] When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

511
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,242
it's usually because
it's threatened by something.

512
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:45,711
Run a course projection.

513
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,211
[Mark] We gotta go after him.

514
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:49,282
He's looking for something
out there.

515
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,685
It could be the ORCA.

516
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,988
Doctor Stanton,
what's your projection?

517
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,060
[Rick] All paths have him
landing in the same place.

518
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,060
Antarctica.

519
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,428
Good, then.

520
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,167
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

521
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,469
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

522
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,569
[Foster] Barnes,

523
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:14,771
contact the <i>Argo.</i>

524
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,010
Yes, ma'am.

525
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,320
[Dr. Graham]
<i>The specimen at this site</i>

526
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:31,222
has been kept
entirely off-book.

527
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:33,524
And since it's
a more recent discovery,

528
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:35,793
our data is limited.

529
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:38,529
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

530
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:41,098
Emma called it Monster Zero.

531
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,467
[Dr. Graham] It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

532
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,303
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

533
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,772
Doctor Chen?

534
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:50,340
I've been scouring through
thousands of years

535
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:51,876
of myths and legends.

536
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:54,479
But it's almost as if
people were scared

537
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,047
to even write about it.

538
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,648
As if it was meant
to be forgotten.

539
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,850
Sorry, I hate to crash
a party,

540
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:01,118
but I got some bad news.

541
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,753
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

542
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:04,155
We lost Godzilla.

543
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:06,190
He dropped off the scan
near Venezuela.

544
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:07,291
Dropped off?

545
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,626
I'm telling you,
Doctor Brooks was right.

546
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:09,927
It's a Hollow Earth.

547
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:11,829
That's how he moves around
so fast

548
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:15,000
using these underwater tunnels
like wormholes.

549
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,934
Just zippin' around.

550
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,536
[Foster] Everyone look sharp.

551
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:20,374
We're approaching the base.

552
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:24,744

00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:33,184

00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:37,291

Got the green light!

558
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:03,682
they'll be here
in the bio labs.

559
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:05,183
[Barnes]
All right, two minutes!

560
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:07,186
Check your equipment,
stand by the door.

561
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:27,907
Come on, Ash.
Make it snappy.

562
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,709
- [Asher] Detonator ready.

Come on, Maddie.

564

All due respect, Colonel,
you saw wrong.

Okay? She wouldn't
have done it.

to start a mass awakening.

737
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,210
Well, it's just too bad
that no one tried

to warn you that
that was gonna happen.

[Sam] Hang on, guys.

740
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:31,549
Why the hell would she
want to release them?

741
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:33,183
And why would she
team up with Jonah,

742
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:35,186
of all people, to do it?

743
00:46:35,188 --> 00:46:36,286
We'll ask her

744
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:38,190
when we find her.

745
00:46:39,324 --> 00:46:42,661

I'm sorry?

00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:13,657
The people. The people
down there in that village

they're gonna be

they were here for a reason.</i>

<i>And that despite all the years</i>

<i>that we spent
trying to stop them,</i>

<i>we never dared
to confront the truth.</i>

Which truth?

792
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,980
Humans have been the dominant
species for thousands of years

793
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:45,581
and look what's happened.

<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

797

<i>And we are the cause.</i>

798

<i>We are the infection.</i>

799
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:03,500
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

800
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:06,904
<i>the earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

801
00:49:06,906 --> 00:49:10,940
<i>Its original
and rightful rulers,</i>

<i>They are part of the earth's
natural defense system.</i>

<i>A way to protect the planet,
to maintain its balance.</i>

805
00:49:20,052 --> 00:49:24,188
<i>But if governments are allowed
to contain them, destroy them,</i>

806
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,188
<i>or use them for war,</i>

807

<i>the human infection will only
continue to spread.</i>

<i>And within our lifetime,
our planet will perish,</i>

No, Doctor Stanton,

814
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:49,413
<i>the exact opposite.</i>

815
00:49:49,415 --> 00:49:52,315
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil</i>

816
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:54,918
<i>or how a volcano
creates new land,</i>

817
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,654
<i>we have seen signs that these
creatures will do the same.</i>

818
00:49:57,656 --> 00:50:01,491
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

819
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:05,195
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

820
00:50:05,197 --> 00:50:07,364
<i>They are the only thing
that can reverse</i>

821
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:09,233
<i>the destruction
that we started.</i>

822
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:13,369
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

823
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:16,605
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

824
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,375
You are murdering the world.

825
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:19,610
[Emma] <i>No.</i>

826
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:21,710
<i>Because as difficult
as this will be,</i>

827
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:24,614
<i>I promise
humanity will not go extinct.</i>

828
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:29,219
<i>Using the ORCA, we will return
to a natural order.</i>

829
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:31,755
<i>A forgotten order,
where we coexisted</i>

830
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:33,523
<i>in balance with the Titans.</i>

831
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:35,458
<i>The first gods.</i>

832
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,094
This is a dangerous path.

833
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:41,331
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

834
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,366
Gambling with
the lives of billions!

835
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:45,701
<i>And what are you gambling
with, Serizawa?</i>

836
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:47,404
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

837
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:49,373
<i>It's on the verge of being
shut down by a government</i>

838
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,808
<i>whose only objective is to
eradicate the creatures.</i>

839
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,844
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

840
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:56,612
You are out
of your goddamn mind!

841
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:58,482
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger,</i>

842
00:50:58,484 --> 00:51:00,215
<i>and now you get to
decide the fate of the world.</i>

843
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:02,719
- That's rich, Emma!
- I couldn't be more sane,

844
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,922
<i>and Madison
couldn't be stronger.</i>

845
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:07,891
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

846
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:11,128
<i>And at least now, she will
have a fighting chance.</i>

847
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,297
A fighting chance? Why don't
you listen to yourself?

848
00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:15,465
<i>It's not all math, Emma.</i>

849
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:17,300
<i>Some things,
you can't control.</i>

850
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:19,938
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

851
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,810
This won't bring him
back to us.

852
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,060
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

853
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,659
<i>Over the last 60 years,</i>

854
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:46,329
<i>Monarch has prepared bunkers
around the world</i>

855
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:48,965
<i>to save
and restart civilization.</i>

856
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:50,936
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

857
00:51:58,143 --> 00:51:59,476
That bitch.

858
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:01,978
How long
until this thing lands?

859
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,313
Three minutes.

860
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:04,882
[Rick] You might
want to rethink that.

861
00:52:04,884 --> 00:52:06,250
[Foster] Why?

862
00:52:06,252 --> 00:52:08,150
Something's not right.
Check this out.

863
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:10,453
Emma's not at Isla de Mara.

864
00:52:10,455 --> 00:52:13,123
I mean, the signal's too weak
to be local.

865
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,891
She's bouncing it off
our satellites.

866
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,293
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

867
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:19,094
She could be anywhere.

868
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:22,632
- [alarm beeping]
- What is that?

869
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:26,670
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

870
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:28,007
How much time do we have?

871
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:30,773
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

872
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:32,578
- [Jonah] Hmm.
- Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

873
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:36,248
Doctor?

874
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:51,395
[Madison] Mom, don't!

875
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:54,496
I'm sorry, did a child
just tell you what to do?

876
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:56,233
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

877
00:52:56,235 --> 00:52:57,933
By all means, Doctor Russell,

878
00:52:57,935 --> 00:52:59,501
let's reconsider
our entire plan.

879
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:01,204
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

880
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,040
Madison, we talked about this.

881
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:04,507
No, you said you were
gonna help people,

882
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:05,942
that you would let them
find shelter.

883
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:09,279
We don't have time for this!

884
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:11,215
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

885
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:12,815
Painless?
Is that what you told her?

886
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,317
Leave her out of this.

887
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,985
Why? You're the one
who pulled her into it.

888
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:20,023
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

889
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:21,525
Some grand utopia?

890
00:53:21,527 --> 00:53:23,393
Man and monster,
living together

891
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:24,927
- in blissful harmony?
- [alarm beeps]

892
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,230
[Winston] Sir, they're
attempting to lock us out.

893
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:28,632
It's now or never.

894
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:33,304
Emma, you came to me.
This is your plan.

895
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:35,239
We both want
to save the planet,

896
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,473
but everything is going to die

897
00:53:36,475 --> 00:53:38,507
if we don't see it through.

898
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:42,415
Please, at least let them
get to safety.

899
00:53:44,116 --> 00:53:47,286
Ma'am, our window's closing.

Rodan, the fire demon.

that Monster Zero thing

01:09:41,572 --> 01:09:43,104
and kill the Titans.
I didn't have a choice.

1132
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:44,942
Bullshit!

1133
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:51,583
You said we were
doing this for Andrew.

1134
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:59,391
Do you really think
he would've wanted this?

1135
01:10:01,892 --> 01:10:03,024
[mouthing silently]

1136
01:10:03,026 --> 01:10:04,395
[sniffles]

1137
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,998
Exactly.

1138

[creature screeching]

1142
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,990
[Dr. Chen] Any luck?

1143
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,657
No.

1144
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:38,226
Whatever Emma used
to create the ORCA signal,

1145
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:39,827
I've never heard it.

1146
01:10:39,829 --> 01:10:40,997
How are you doing?

1147
01:10:40,999 --> 01:10:42,797
[speaking Mandarin]

1148
01:10:42,799 --> 01:10:44,100
How's that?

1149
01:10:44,102 --> 01:10:46,635
[In English]
"Myth is our compass."

1150
01:10:46,637 --> 01:10:48,737
It's something
my mom used to say.

1151
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:51,439
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

1152
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:54,542
could help us find the Titans

1153
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:56,412
and restore
our connection to nature.

1154
01:10:56,414 --> 01:10:57,912
[Mark] Wait, your mother?

1155
01:10:57,914 --> 01:10:59,515
You're second-generation
Monarch?

1156
01:10:59,517 --> 01:11:01,149
Third.

1157
01:11:01,151 --> 01:11:03,418
It runs in the family.

1158
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,186
[Mark] That's incredible.

1159
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:06,488
I don't suppose
your family has any tips

1160
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,857
on slaying dragons, do they?

1161
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:10,592
Slaying dragons
is a Western concept.

1162
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:12,594
In the East, they are sacred.

1163
01:11:12,596 --> 01:11:16,534
Divine creatures who brought
wisdom, strength,

1164
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:19,137
even redemption.

1165
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:23,206
[Foster]
This oxygen destroyer,

1166
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,506
why wasn't
Monster Zero affected?

1167
01:11:24,508 --> 01:11:25,808
[Barnes] I mean,
I'm no scientist,

1168
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,341
but I think
it has something to do

1169
01:11:27,343 --> 01:11:28,676
with his goddamn head
growing back.

1170
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,445
Well, I've never seen
anything like it.

1171
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:32,948
It violates everything we know
about the natural order.

1172
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,850
Unless he's not
part of the natural order.

1173
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:37,153
What do you mean?

1174
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:40,790
I was able to
piece this together.

1175
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:43,692
[Sam] Well, he looks
vaguely familiar.

1176
01:11:43,694 --> 01:11:45,760
[Dr. Chen] It tells
of a great dragon

1177
01:11:45,762 --> 01:11:47,363
who fell from the stars.

1178
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:51,900
A Hydra whose storm swallowed
both men and gods alike.

1179
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:53,402
What, you mean an alien?

1180
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:56,005
[Dr. Chen] Yes. He's not
part of our natural order.

1181
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,872
And he's not meant to be here.

1182
01:11:57,874 --> 01:11:59,475
A false king.

1183
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:01,176
An invasive species.

1184
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:03,746
That could explain how he's
creating these massive storms

1185
01:12:03,748 --> 01:12:06,448
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

1186
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,216
It's almost like
he's reshaping the planet

1187
01:12:08,218 --> 01:12:09,585
to his own liking.

1188
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:11,220
These legends,
what did they call him?

1189
01:12:11,222 --> 01:12:14,626
Ghidorah.
"The one who is many."

1190
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:16,257
Ghi-what?

1191
01:12:16,259 --> 01:12:17,460
She said, "Gonorrhea."

1192
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:18,927
- Huh?
- Ghidorah!

1193
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:21,663
Doctor Serizawa, we're
approaching Castle Bravo,

1194
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:24,198
but there's something
you should see.

1195
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,736
[beeping]

1196
01:12:27,004 --> 01:12:28,637
[thunder rumbling]

1197
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:32,408
[Mark] I'm guessing you weren't
expecting these guys.

1198
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:36,778
[Admiral Stenz] Moscow,
London, Washington, D.C.,

1199
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,546
all under attack.

1200
01:12:38,548 --> 01:12:40,783
On every continent,
the Titans are triggering

1201
01:12:40,785 --> 01:12:43,752
earthquakes, wildfires,
tsunamis,

1202
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:47,322
and disasters we don't even
have names for yet.

1203
01:12:47,324 --> 01:12:49,859
Now as before,
we have been trying to lure

1204
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:51,527
the creatures
with nuclear materials,

1205
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:54,197
but they are not
taking the bait this time.

1206
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,931
Their behavior
has become random.

1207
01:12:56,933 --> 01:12:58,400
Erratic.

1208
01:12:58,402 --> 01:13:00,868
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

1209
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:03,973
and these things
roaming the globe unimpeded,

1210
01:13:03,975 --> 01:13:06,174
we are running out of options

1211
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,576
and time.

1212
01:13:07,578 --> 01:13:10,112
Excuse me,
do you have something to add?

1213
01:13:10,114 --> 01:13:12,247
Yeah. You're wrong.

1214
01:13:12,249 --> 01:13:15,885
Their behavior
is not random or erratic.

1215
01:13:15,887 --> 01:13:16,985
If I may, sir.

1216
01:13:16,987 --> 01:13:19,488
As amazing as this sounds,

1217
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,723
they're moving like a pack.
They're hunting.

1218
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:25,461
All packs, from wolves
to killer whales,

1219
01:13:25,463 --> 01:13:28,064
they all respond
directly to an alpha.

1220
01:13:28,066 --> 01:13:29,732
And this Ghidorah
is the new alpha.

1221
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:32,266
And all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

1222
01:13:32,268 --> 01:13:34,703
They're an extension of him.

1223
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:38,239
We stop him, we stop them all.

1224
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:39,574
[Foster]
Is there another creature

1225
01:13:39,576 --> 01:13:40,975
that might stand
a chance against him?

1226
01:13:40,977 --> 01:13:42,711
[Serizawa] No.

1227
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:46,549
Ghidorah and <i>Gojira's</i> rivalry
was ancient and unique.

1228
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,516
Right, so we killed
our best shot

1229
01:13:48,518 --> 01:13:50,318
at beating this thing?

1230
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,288
[Emma] <i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

1231
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,723
<i>With Godzilla gone,</i>

1232
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:55,890
<i>Monster Zero
isn't using the Titans</i>

1233
01:13:55,892 --> 01:13:57,692
to restore the planet.

1234
01:13:57,694 --> 01:14:00,429
He is using them
to destroy it.

1235
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:02,730
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

1236
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:05,067
Listen, while you were
sitting comfortably

1237
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:06,335
in some laboratory,

1238
01:14:06,337 --> 01:14:08,336
we've been fighting
for decades

1239
01:14:08,338 --> 01:14:10,840
in one dirty war
after another.

1240
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:12,875
I've seen
human nature firsthand

1241
01:14:12,877 --> 01:14:13,943
and I'm here to tell you

1242
01:14:13,945 --> 01:14:15,077
that it doesn't
get any better.

1243
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:16,412
It just gets worse.

1244
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:18,814
So, I'm sorry
that Monster Zero

1245
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:21,750
isn't exactly
what we were expecting.

1246
01:14:21,752 --> 01:14:27,458
But we opened Pandora's Box
and there's no closing it now.

1247
01:14:29,392 --> 01:14:30,759
Maybe there is.

1248
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,493
[Jonah] Oh, don't be stupid.

1249
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,697
You broadcast again,
and you will expose us all.

1250
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:38,065
[Emma] These creatures
communicate like whales, okay?

1251
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:40,601
[on speaker] <i>They can hear
sonar for thousands of miles,</i>

1252

1253

<i>Let's broadcast the ORCA

<i>It's just a few miles
from here.</i>

1255
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:49,511
I could use the stadium
to amplify a signal

1256
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:51,212
that might stop these attacks.

1257

That's kind of

You never took that watch

You told me five years ago,

I'd be trying to save

Sometimes,

1345
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,931
the only way to heal
our wounds is to make peace

Isn't that why you are here?

There are some things beyond
our understanding, Mark.

1351
01:20:27,316 --> 01:20:31,220
We must accept them
and learn from them,

1352
01:20:31,222 --> 01:20:33,188
because these moments
of crisis

01:26:45,395 --> 01:26:47,394
[Rick] 'Cause I still wanna
have kids one day.

1447
01:26:47,396 --> 01:26:50,163
Preferably without flippers.

1448
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:52,369
All stop. Hover the ship.

1449
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:03,013
[Rick] Whoa.

1450
01:27:03,946 --> 01:27:06,581
We got O2, CO2, and methane.

1451
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:09,286
It looks like there's some
sort of air pocket in there.

- And goodnight, Gracie.
- Pull up the last frame.

1456
01:27:28,137 --> 01:27:29,503
- [Rick] Yup.
- [Serizawa] There.

1457
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,271
The source of the radiation.

1458
01:27:31,273 --> 01:27:33,140
[Dr. Chen] That's why
he returned here.

1459
01:27:33,142 --> 01:27:35,010
He's feeding,

1460
01:27:35,012 --> 01:27:36,647
regenerating.

1461
01:27:37,713 --> 01:27:39,682
This is his home.

1462
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:43,885
This is how
he's survived for so long.

1463
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:47,153
Always adapting, evolving.

1464
01:27:47,155 --> 01:27:48,389
It's incredible.

1465
01:27:48,391 --> 01:27:51,059
[Rick] So,
dude's got this covered.

1466
01:27:51,061 --> 01:27:52,827
Right?
He just needs a little nap.

1467
01:27:52,829 --> 01:27:53,929
[Dr. Chen] No.

1468
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,930
This process could take years.

1469
01:27:55,932 --> 01:27:57,564
We have to proceed as planned.

1470
01:27:57,566 --> 01:27:58,632
Hang on.

1471
01:27:58,634 --> 01:28:01,068
We're gonna launch
a nuclear torpedo

1472
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,503
in order to revive
a giant monster.

1473
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:05,305
Okay, this is...
This is not like

1474
01:28:05,307 --> 01:28:06,908
we're just jump-starting
a car.

1475
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,609
[Commander Crane]
We have another complication.

1476
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:11,177
Our weapons systems were
damaged during the crash.

1477
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:12,247
We can't launch.

1478
01:28:12,249 --> 01:28:14,114
Can it be repaired?

1479
01:28:14,116 --> 01:28:15,817
I'm afraid not.

1480
01:28:15,819 --> 01:28:19,386
[Dr. Chen] Okay. What if
we go inside, set a timer,

1481
01:28:19,388 --> 01:28:21,055
and blow up
the warhead manually?

1482
01:28:21,057 --> 01:28:24,926
No way. If the heat doesn't
fry you, the radiation will.

1483
01:28:24,928 --> 01:28:26,497
[Dr. Chen sighs]

1484
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:29,631
I'll go.

What the hell does that mean?

1486
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:33,000
There must be another way.

There's no time for debate.

1488

That's why Ghidorah

[Foster] What do you mean "us"?

1576
01:38:05,574 --> 01:38:07,841
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

1577
01:38:07,843 --> 01:38:09,643
That's how she made
the signal for the ORCA.

1578
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:11,746
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

Not with my men, you're not.

1593
01:38:43,612 --> 01:38:46,113
Emma, you said this was about
the greater good.

1594
01:38:46,115 --> 01:38:49,516
That the planet deserved
a clean slate.

1595
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:50,751
But now you're prepared

1596

to put all our lives in danger

1597
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:53,054
because your little girl
is missing.

1598
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,287
The ORCA is with...

1599
01:38:54,289 --> 01:38:55,890
[Jonah] The ORCA
no longer matters.

01:53:13,681 --> 01:53:15,084
To do what?

1774
01:53:17,886 --> 01:53:19,152
You sure about this?

1775
01:53:19,154 --> 01:53:20,886
[Mark] It's the only way
to save him.

1776
01:53:20,888 --> 01:53:22,588
We fix it, get on the osprey

1777
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:24,190
and draw that thing away
from Godzilla.

1778
01:53:24,192 --> 01:53:26,227
Buy him time to get back
on his feet.

1779
01:53:26,861 --> 01:53:28,163
[powering up]

1780

[pained roaring]

1781
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:39,305
Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

1782
01:53:39,307 --> 01:53:42,110
I know. It'll be tight, but
we have to take that chance.

1783
01:53:48,984 --> 01:53:50,250
Are you good to go?

1784
01:53:50,252 --> 01:53:51,318
Yes.

1785
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,152
All right. One, two,

1786
01:53:53,154 --> 01:53:54,220
three.

1787
01:53:54,222 --> 01:53:55,924
[powering up]

1788
01:53:58,192 --> 01:53:59,391
That's it.

1789
01:53:59,393 --> 01:54:00,560
That's it!

1790
01:54:00,562 --> 01:54:02,665
[aircraft whirring]

1791
01:54:06,433 --> 01:54:08,036
Come on, Griff. We got you.

1792
01:54:10,704 --> 01:54:12,372
[Mark] Come on, Emma. Let's go.

1793
01:54:12,374 --> 01:54:13,706
Okay. Take her. Take her!

1794
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:15,140
I still have to activate it.

1795
01:54:15,142 --> 01:54:16,009
[Mark] What?

1796
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:17,646
I'm right behind you. Go!

1797
01:54:18,547 --> 01:54:19,679
[Godzilla groaning]

1798
01:54:19,681 --> 01:54:21,650
[pained screeching]

1799
01:54:23,183 --> 01:54:26,088
[high-pitched pulsing
over speakers]

1800
01:54:27,288 --> 01:54:28,824
[shrieks]

1801
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:31,891
[Barnes] Let's go, let's go!

1802
01:54:31,893 --> 01:54:33,094
[Madison] Mom!

1803
01:54:34,362 --> 01:54:35,427
Mom!

1804
01:54:35,429 --> 01:54:36,863
[Dr. Chen] Come on, Maddie!

1805
01:54:36,865 --> 01:54:38,867
[Barnes] Go, go, go!

1806
01:54:42,904 --> 01:54:44,604
You got any pain anywhere
besides your leg?

1807
01:54:44,606 --> 01:54:46,241
[screeching]

1808
01:54:51,579 --> 01:54:52,677
We gotta lift off, now!

1809
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:54,115
[Mark] Wait!

1810
01:54:58,486 --> 01:54:59,855
[powering up]

1811
01:55:03,758 --> 01:55:05,692
[Mark] Emma, let's go!
Come on!

1812
01:55:05,694 --> 01:55:07,062
Mom!

1813
01:55:15,704 --> 01:55:17,039
Mom.

1814
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:19,538
I love you.

1815
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:21,643
No.

1816
01:55:22,744 --> 01:55:24,644
- [shouts] No!
- Emma!

1817
01:55:24,646 --> 01:55:26,945
Mom!

[snarling]

1822
01:56:03,517 --> 01:56:04,719
No.

1823
01:56:06,554 --> 01:56:07,755
No.

1824
01:56:20,869 --> 01:56:22,071
[screams]

1825
01:56:25,373 --> 01:56:27,910
Mom!

01:56:53,901 --> 01:56:57,438
Long live the king.

[electricity pulsating]

1842
01:59:15,543 --> 01:59:17,842
Jesus.

1843
01:59:17,844 --> 01:59:20,012
Good thing he's on our side.

1844
01:59:20,014 --> 01:59:21,950
For now.

1845
01:59:23,484 --> 01:59:24,652
Look.

It's a brave new world,
my friend.

1852
02:10:41,762 --> 02:10:43,328
Such things as this

1853
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:46,799
become much more valuable
since the rise of the king.

1854
02:10:46,801 --> 02:10:48,567
My men,
they don't ask for much.

1855
02:10:48,569 --> 02:10:50,568
Can't fish here anymore.

1856
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:52,306
Everything's dead.

1857
02:11:10,891 --> 02:11:13,094
[flies buzzing]

1858
02:11:25,705 --> 02:11:27,909
We'll take it.

02:11:32,898 --> 02:11:34,921

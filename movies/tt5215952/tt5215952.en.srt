1
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:04,001
They were startled and frightened,
thinking they saw a ghost.

2
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:07,060
He said to them, "Why are you troubled,
and why do doubts rise in your minds?"

3
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:09,084
Look at my hands and my feet.
It is I myself!

4
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,935
Touch me and see; a ghost does not have
flesh and bones, as you see I have.

It's still dawn. What is it?

13
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,126
Somebody died.

14

15

You know Cho, the ginseng grower?

17
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,251
Yeah.

18
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:01,167
His wife died.

19
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,084

Hey, where are you off to?

22
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,292
Somebody died.

23
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:14,084
Who?

24
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,167

00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,501
But she's so young.

28
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,334
You said it.

29
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:28,292
- Don't go without eating.
- I gotta hurry.

30
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,917
Just a bite!

31
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,310
Hurrying won't bring back the dead.

Hurry up!

58
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,084
We've got two corpses here.

59
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,417
Where's the Captain?

60
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,667
He went to Seoul, remember?

61
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,709
Right.

62
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,251

Look at me, Heung-guk!

67
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:32,126
Let go of me!

68
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,917
I'm his uncle!

69
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,042
Jong-gu!

70
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,917
Heung-guk, how could you do this?

71
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,042
Sergeant.

72
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:04,251
Did it with this, I guess.
Stabbed him, like, 20 times?

73
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,667
Holy shit.

74
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:11,792
What's that?

75
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:16,459
Looks like the body was moved here
after the murder.

76
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,334
What a mess.

77
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,709
That's Cho-the husband?

78
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,126
Looks that way.

79
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,959
I'll be damned.

80
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,584
And the kid?

81
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,292
We took him to a relative

82
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:38,792
Why'd he do it?

83
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,709
I don't smell booze on
him, but he's not talking.

84
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:46,501
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?

85
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,292
What the hell happened?

86
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,667
How's it going, Sergeant?

87
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,876
I'm his uncle! Let go of me!

88
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,959
Rotten bastard.

89
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:11,876
Couldn't he use GPS? Why
do I have to take him?

90
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,667
Ain't that it?

91
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,084
Get the wire cutters.

92
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,001
Pull it back.

93
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,626
What's that stink?

94
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:39,542
So. Cho was killed here.

95
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,834
What the fuck is all this?

96
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:48,751
So he invited Cho over, killed him,

97
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:53,126
put the body in a sack, dragged it to
his house, and then killed his wife?

98
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,001
Crime of passion.

99
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,876
Make sure you photograph everything.

100
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:03,292
Here, there, that stuff over there.

101
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,292
Jong-gu!

102
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,542
Get over here!

103
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,626
Sergeant, come over here.

104
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:46,959
Shit!

105
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,417
Oh god...

106
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,126
That cocksucker.

107
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,751
What kind of twisted freak is he?

108
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:23,542
<THE WAILING GOKSUNG>

109
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,167
Is that scary, or what?

110
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,084
Scary, my ass.

111
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:27,209
Anyway, the whole town's talking about it.

112
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:31,084
Who told you that story?

113
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,334
Byeong-gyu.

114
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,251
That goddamned bastard...

115
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,751
Now he's spreading those
stories to you, too?

116
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,001
Well, from what I hear,

117
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:46,464
there's definitely something
off with that guy.

118
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,376
Like what?

119
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,876
The corner store owner went crazy,

120
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,751
The guy at the mill dropped dead,

121
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,501
and then Heung-gu turns
up dead two days ago.

122
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,542
So?

123
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,376
All this happened after
that Japanese man arrived.

124
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:12,292
Quit talking out of your
ass, you ignorant dope.

125
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,167
Who're you calling ignorant?

126
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:19,876
Look, the test results on Heung-guk
came back today.

127
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,751
Apparently, he ate some
fucked-up mushrooms.

128
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:24,709
What?

129
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:27,792
You know. The ones with the drugs
that make you go crazy.

130
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,584
His blood was full of that shit.

131
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,792
And there were tons
of dried mushrooms at his place.

132
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,501
You really believe that?

133
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,334
It's what the results said!

134
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,334
Didn't you ever try those
mushrooms as a kid?

135
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:41,584
Hell no.

136
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:44,376
All I know is, mushrooms
don't do that to you.

137
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,417
You saw that poor guy.

138
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,876
Mushrooms would never make you that way.

139
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,459
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.

140
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,334
If everyone's talking about him,

141
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:03,167
there's likely a good reason.

142
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,376
What the hell?

143
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,584
Power's gone out again.

144
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,917
Fuck.

145
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,501
I keep telling the Captain
to get that damn wiring fixed.

146
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,417
Never listens!

147
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,917
What the fuck!

148
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,209
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?

149
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,834
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?

150
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:36,542
- Outside, that... fuck!
- What's your problem?

151
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,959
What is it, man?

152
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,834
You check it out.

153
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,792
- Me?
- Yes, you! Dammit.

154
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,334
You want me to go out?

155
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:49,084
I'm telling you, asshole,
to get your ass out there!

156
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,167
For crying out loud...

157
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,251
Okay, I'll go.

158
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,126
Come on, hurry!

159
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,626
Shit.

160
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,501
Who the fuck are you? What the hell?

161
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,501
Stop, goddamn it!

162
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:23,417
Stop it, you dirty slut! You whore!

163
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:39,917
Eat this, too.

164
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:13,251
Man, you're heavy.

165
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,626
I'm getting too old for this.

166
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,126
Don't be ridiculous.

167
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:27,834
Old ladies tell me men can
still get it up after 70.

168
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:34,709
Then buy me some herbal supplements.

169
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,334
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.

170
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:39,584
What're you doing in there?

171
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,959
Oh hell. Shit!

172
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,917
Nothing! Get away from the car.

173
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,084
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?

174
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:48,417
For crying out loud!

175
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,334
Dad!

176
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,001
Dad?

177
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:05,959
Look.

178
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:10,709
How do I look?

179
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,209
Pretty.

180
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,417
Freakishly pretty.

181
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:43,834
How long were you watching?

182
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,584
How much did you see?

183
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:54,959
Don't worry, I won't tell.

184
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:01,001
So you saw everything.

185
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:05,001
No big deal. It's not the first time.

186
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,126
What?

187
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,834
Here.

188
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,167
What?

189
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,001
It's okay. Have a sip.

190
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,209
Hurry up!

191
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,542
Son of a bitch!

192
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,876
What took you so long? Ignoring my calls?

193
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:08,542
My mother-in-law got sick.

194
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,435
Now you're using your
mother-in-law as an excuse?

195
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,834
You were taking a nap, I can tell!

196
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:14,834
No, I wasn't. I swear.

197
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,792
Get to work.

198
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,334
Excuse me, ma'am?

199
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:33,959
What the hell?

200
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,667
What are you doing? Stop her.

201
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,126
Yes, sir.

202
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,584
Come with me, ma'am.

203
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,584
Get off me!

204
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,792
Sergeant, get her out of here.

205
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,042
Back off, people.

206
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,542
What's wrong with her?

207
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,209
Please, calm down.

208
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,084
That idiot...

209
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,334
Calm down, ma'am.

210
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:11,709
Jong-gu.

211
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,959
Get cleaned up, man.

212
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:17,501
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

213
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,667
It's not your fault...

214
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,667
that you're a little girly-man
with balls the size of peas.

215
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,834
Oh jeez.

216
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:26,126
Hello!

217
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:27,542
- Hey.
- Hi, Hyo-jin.

218
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:28,709
Hello, Captain.

219
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,792
- How are you?
- Good.

220
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:33,251
- You've got clean clothes for Daddy?
- Yeah.

221
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:42,792
Mom got you clean boxers and an undershirt.

222
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,501
Thanks, darling.

223
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,584
Take a shower.

224
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,334
I will. Go home.

225
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,459
You didn't even eat, did you?

226
00:21:56,501 --> 00:22:02,542
All right, get out of here.
Can't you see Daddy's working?

227
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,376
See you.

228
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,084
Goodbye, officers.

229
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,501
- Bye.
- See ya.

230
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,126
- Take care, sweetie.
- Oh, my.

231
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,667
That scatterbrain.

232
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,001
Seong-bok?

233
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,084
Yeah.

234
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:45,917
It just hit me.

235
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,709
What?

236
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,834
That woman...

237
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,584
What woman?

238
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:53,542
The one whose house burned down...

239
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,584
I knew I'd seen her before.

240
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,626
It's that naked woman from last night.

241
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:01,167
What?

242
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:06,126
The woman who was standing here last night.

243
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,626
Crazy fools.

244
00:23:56,876 --> 00:24:00,501
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.

245
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,584
All three of them?

246
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:02,792
Yeah.

247
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,251
Freaked the hell out of me, too.

248
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:13,334
Prime suspect is the
missus who hung herself.

249
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:20,959
What the heck happened?

250
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,084
Beats me.

251
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,334
Over here.

252
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:28,959
In here.

253
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,001
What?

254
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:33,084
Give us a hand.

255
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:35,751
A little more.

256
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:42,459
Found it.

257
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:46,792
Idiot! Don't touch it with your bare hands!

258
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:50,626
What the...?

259
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,167
Are you a moron?

260
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,584
That's evidence.

261
00:24:56,209 --> 00:25:00,501
He should've wrapped it in cloth
or something, right?

262
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,251
Gokseong Police Station

263
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:22,417
So, she killed everyone?

264
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,167
That's what they said.

265
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:28,917
I'll be damned.

266
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,251
So, that's what happened.

267
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,876
Why did you call me?
Things are crazy at work.

268
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,417
Because of this case.

269
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:42,834
Remember what I told you before?

270
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,042
What?

271
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,417
How the Jap raped a woman?

272
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,542
What about it?

273
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,167
You filthy slut.

274
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,792
That woman.

275
00:26:11,042 --> 00:26:12,334
It was her.

276
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:14,876
What the hell are you talking about?

277
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,376
That woman he raped-

278
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,709
it's the same woman whose
house burned down.

279
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,334
She went crazy after that,

280
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,501
and used to run around naked at night.

281
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:36,542
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.

282
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:40,792
She was totally covered
in rashes and boils,

283
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:45,584
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.

284
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,334
Are you out of your mind?

285
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,584
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.

286
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:57,876
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.

287
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:02,251
You worthless bastard. It was your theory.

288
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:04,834
I was just messing with you.

289
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:09,167
Who in their right mind
would believe crap like that?

290
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:13,376
No, I think you're right.

291
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:16,626
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.

292
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,542
Gimme a break.

293
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:25,167
What are you looking at?

294
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,876
Get outta here!

295
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:38,126
What?

296
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:42,001
Ignore her. She's been
doing that all morning.

297
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,501
What a nutjob.

298
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:50,751
So, how about you check
with the local dermatologist.

299
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:54,959
See if there's any medical records
on Heung-guk or that woman.

300
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,042
Stop it, you tramp!

301
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,626
I can't believe this.

302
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,251
It's important, you idiot!

303
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:08,542
The rash is the link here.

304
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,042
Come on, hurry.

305
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,792
Stop it! You could hurt somebody!

306
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:29,917
Community Health Center

307
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,417
Oh, my.

308
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,376
You're really getting on my nerves!

309
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:58,959
Where do you live?

310
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,709
Are you from this village?

311
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,126
Hey.

312
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:15,792
Don't come near me!

313
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:20,501
Dammit!

314
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,459
The lady killed them all.

315
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,251
What?

316
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:35,167
In there. In that room.

317
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,584
What are you talking about?

318
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:47,292
The old woman got a
shaman to do some ritual,

319
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:50,542
but the lady refused.

320
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,584
That's why they all got killed.

321
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,542
Are you a family member?

322
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,084
No, I'm not.

323
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,042
Then who are you?

324
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,459
Come with me.

325
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:07,876
Hey!

326
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:10,751
What the...?

327
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,959
You can't go in there.

328
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,126
It's all right.

329
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:20,542
Hey...

330
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,542
Come on.

331
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,459
She killed them here.

332
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,084
The old woman got it the worst of it.

333
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:47,001
Her head was smashed
open like a watermelon.

334
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:50,709
You saw with your own eyes?

335
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,292
Of course I did.

336
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:56,917
How?

337
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,292
The old woman tells me

338
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:04,042
the Jap is a ghost.

339
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:09,417
He was gonna suck her blood dry.

340
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:15,084
The Jap?

341
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,459
Yeah.

342
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,126
The Jap with the limp.

343
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:20,917
Oh, him!

344
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:23,792
You've seen him?

345
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,417
Yeah.

346
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:26,667
How many times?

347
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:29,167
Once or twice.

348
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:30,417
Be careful.

349
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:31,751
Why?

350
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:36,917
The old woman says, if you
keep seeing him around,

351
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:40,209
it's because he's stalking you.

352
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,417
To suck your blood dry.

353
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,334
Wait here for a second.

354
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,251
Okay.

355
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,792
Get your ass over here.

356
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,042
What?

357
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:04,667
Get over here now!

358
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:08,417
But I just found the dermatologist.

359
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,584
I found a witness.

360
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:13,834
So, get over here as fast as you can.

361
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,876
What the...?

362
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,209
Where'd she go?

363
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:31,292
What terrible sin did you commit,
to be yelling like that?

364
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,084
Are you feeling sick?

365
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:38,542
Keep having weird dreams.

366
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,209
Who's the medicine for?

367
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:46,084
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.

368
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,751
She's burning up.

369
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:01,584
And where were you while she was so sick?

370
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:02,959
I was getting her medicine.

371
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,876
What's with you? Take her to the hospital.

372
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,584
What on earth was that?

373
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:29,876
Turn off the hose first.

374
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,626
Moron...

375
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:37,667
Just coming into work now, are you?

376
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:41,626
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.

377
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:45,001
So now you're blaming your daughter?

378
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,334
I'm not making it up.

379
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,792
Did you find your witness?

380
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:49,459
No, sir.

381
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,334
After turning the whole town upside down.

382
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:53,751
You think this case is going
to be your big break?

383
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:57,459
Seong-bok's been calling around.

384
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,001
That's your excuse?

385
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:05,084
Look at him. He can't even wash the car.

386
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:07,042
Driving me up the wall.

387
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,167
Even the Chief heard about your witness.

388
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:14,334
Whether you lied, or let her get away-

389
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:16,876
you're screwed.

390
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,167
Yes, sir.

391
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:25,751
This is driving me up the wall.

392
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:29,126
Don't pay any attention
to the crazy girl's talk.

393
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:35,334
Not her. I'm talking about this.

394
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:39,959
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms

395
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:42,001
"Murdered by... wild mushrooms"?

396
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,376
What did the dermatologist say? Mushrooms?

397
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:50,126
He wasn't sure,
so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital.

398
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:53,626
Told you. It can't be the mushrooms.

399
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,001
It's not impossible.

400
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,209
Shut your hole.

401
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:06,459
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?

402
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,626
There are so many.

403
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,834
The one about the naked man
eating the deer carcass.

404
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:13,501
What's gotten into you?

405
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,376
At a crazy time like this?

406
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,667
It's because things are so crazy.

407
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:23,001
You know the guy who saw it, right?

408
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:28,709
"Herbs & Tonics"

409
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:29,917
Over here.

410
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,001
You may not believe it,

411
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,834
but I saw it with my own eyes.

412
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:41,751
Look at this.

413
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,084
Can you see it?

414
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,876
Sure.

415
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:48,751
I got 22 stitches.

416
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:53,001
From falling on your head
while you were drunk?

417
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:55,876
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:59,376
I'm too old to make shit up.

419
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,626
You got proof?

420
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,834
Proof?

421
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:04,501
Hell yes, proof!

422
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:08,001
I'm not the kind to talk
shit without backing it up.

423
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,292
Come look at this.

424
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,959
You ready?

425
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:17,959
Look.

426
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:23,042
You see?

427
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,334
Empty, right?

428
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:28,501
I stayed the hell away from
the mountains since that day.

429
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,876
Even put the store up for sale.

430
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,501
How is that proof?

431
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,251
What?

432
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:39,126
Damn you...

433
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,417
That's not the point.

434
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,917
The point is, when I opened my eyes,

435
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:50,334
there he was-stark naked
except for a diaper.

436
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:51,334
A diaper?

437
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:52,626
That's right.

438
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,542
A grown man?

439
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:54,542
I'm telling you.

440
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:57,376
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.

441
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,376
Bladder control problems
are surprisingly common in adults.

442
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:03,459
But why go into the woods
to treat incontinence?

443
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:07,917
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?

444
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:10,834
Anyway,

445
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:13,667
he had his face buried in the carcass,

446
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,501
his body covered in blood...

447
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,709
his eyes all bloodshot.

448
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:22,459
Then he looked up,

449
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,584
and all of a sudden...

450
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:32,876
I haven't slept since that day.

451
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:36,584
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.

452
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:40,417
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...

453
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:43,292
Wait, look here.

454
00:38:44,251 --> 00:38:46,834
See where the skin's broken?

455
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:51,584
Bastard even bit me.

456
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:53,667
Where does the guy live?

457
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,042
Why, you gonna go there?

458
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,376
I think I should.

459
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,417
Don't. You'll regret it.

460
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:02,417
It's just a suspicion, but...

461
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:06,917
You know how the villagers have been
dying out recently?

462
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,126
He's got something to do with it.

463
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,417
He's not human.

464
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,834
Give me his address.

465
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,876
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

466
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,334
You've gotta have a general idea.

467
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:23,334
It's hard to explain in words.

468
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:25,751
It's deep in the valley somewhere.

469
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:51,459
How much further is it?

470
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:53,834
Still a ways ahead.

471
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:25,959
Shit!

472
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,084
What's the matter?

473
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,584
It's there.

474
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:39,042
Over there.

475
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:40,292
I don't see a house.

476
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,042
Look.

477
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,084
Right over there.

478
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:47,751
Whoa, isn't that a deer?

479
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,084
So, you weren't making this up.

480
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:55,417
What did I tell you, dammit?

481
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,417
What in God's name...

482
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,876
What's happening?

483
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:05,626
Look.

484
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:06,917
You know...

485
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,959
What's going on?

486
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:16,126
That should do it, right?

487
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:19,417
What? You gotta show us the house.

488
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:22,084
It's just over that hill.

489
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,959
It's just the one house.

490
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:25,167
You can't miss it.

491
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:29,417
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.

492
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:31,376
Don't touch me, I gotta go!

493
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:34,667
Where do you think you're going?

494
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,334
I said let go!

495
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,334
Shit...

496
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,209
Hey!

497
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,876
Mister.

498
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,084
Mister?

499
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:54,251
Mister?

500
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,667
You all right?

501
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,792
You fucking bastards.

502
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,876
We're sorry.

503
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,751
Fuck off.

504
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:13,334
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.

505
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:15,834
We're real sorry, okay?

506
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,251
Fuck you.

507
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,667
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.

508
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:46,501
Where are you going?

509
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,251
You got hit by lightning.

510
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,417
Hey!

511
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,542
What's the point of taking

512
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,542
all those health tonics-

513
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:14,667
if it's lightning that kills you?

514
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:22,084
How can something like this happen?

515
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:29,709
What are the chances?

516
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:37,501
But they'll say, thanks
to all those tonics,

517
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,792
he survived.

518
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:46,126
Nurse! Nurse!

519
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,001
It's Park Heung-guk in 302!

520
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,667
You gotta come now. It's Park Heung-guk!

521
00:43:57,584 --> 00:43:59,126
It's an emergency!

522
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:14,251
Doctor!

523
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:33,501
What's going on?

524
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:27,626
Can anybody make sense

525
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,542
of what's happening here?

526
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:43,334
Let's go back to the Jap's house tomorrow.

527
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:51,417
There's definitely
something going on there.

528
00:46:29,334 --> 00:46:30,376
Hyo-jin?

529
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,167
Hyo-jin.

530
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,084
Baby!

531
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,209
Daddy's right here.

532
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:39,251
Daddy's right here, sweetie.

533
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:41,584
Look at Daddy.

534
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:43,251
Look at Daddy.

535
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:44,459
Hyo-jin!

536
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,251
Look at me.

537
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:47,751
Hyo-jin!

538
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:49,376
Look at me.

539
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,292
Look at Daddy.

540
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,084
Daddy's here.

541
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:55,792
Dad...

542
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:05,417
- I'm right here.
- Do something, Daddy!

543
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:09,167
What, sweetie?

544
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:13,667
Someone keeps banging on the door,

545
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,667
trying to get in.

546
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,792
Who?

547
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:23,709
A strange man. He's trying to get in.

548
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:30,959
It's okay, it's okay...

549
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,084
Hyo-jin.

550
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,334
Hyo-jin?

551
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:05,667
What is this?

552
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:09,876
You're all right?

553
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,959
Morning, Dad.

554
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:26,834
But she never eats fish...

555
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:28,459
Something's wrong with her.

556
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:33,084
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.

557
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:38,751
I asked the old lady next door
to recommend a good shaman.

558
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,167
I'm gonna consult with
him, just so you know.

559
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,209
Got that?

560
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,417
Okay.

561
00:48:51,126 --> 00:48:52,376
Good.

562
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:15,876
Hey.

563
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,042
Say hello.

564
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:20,251
This is my nephew.

565
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:25,876
What, a priest?

566
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:29,626
Not yet, he's in training. A deacon.

567
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,459
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.

568
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:39,792
You speak Japanese?

569
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:41,751
Just a little.

570
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:44,167
He lived in Japan when he was young.

571
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,792
What's that on your neck?

572
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:46,917
Nothing.

573
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,001
You've gotta be kidding me.

574
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:53,542
What's your name, son?

575
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:55,667
Yang E-sam. Two-three

576
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:58,084
Is that your real name?

577
00:49:58,167 --> 00:49:59,292
Yes, sir.

578
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:00,584
Let's go.

579
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:01,834
Get in.

580
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,667
Anybody home?

581
00:51:02,251 --> 00:51:03,292
What is it?

582
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:27,001
Goddamn perv.

583
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,917
Look at this. What does it say?

584
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:40,876
Uncle, this is illegal.

585
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:42,209
I know.

586
00:51:42,251 --> 00:51:45,084
Then why... We should stop.

587
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:46,435
If you won't help, wait outside.

588
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:47,126
But Uncle!

589
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,709
Okay, you wait outside.

590
00:52:04,042 --> 00:52:06,417
What are you staring at?

591
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,834
Go keep a lookout.

592
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:56,334
What the fuck?

593
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:38,501
- Son of a bitch!
- Get over here!

594
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,459
Get him off me!

595
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,959
What were you doing poking
around the doghouse?

596
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:37,334
Block the door!

597
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:39,542
Get over here!

598
00:54:41,584 --> 00:54:43,167
Shit!

599
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,209
Seong-bok, you bastard!

600
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:49,459
Fucking bastard!

601
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:54,126
Where is it?

602
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:55,751
Where did it go?

603
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:57,709
Over there.

604
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,292
Seong-bok.

605
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:06,959
I think it's the owner.

606
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:16,292
Seong-bok?

607
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:23,626
Excuse me.

608
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,501
Are you all right?

609
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:40,667
Yeah.

610
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:43,459
What's the matter with you?

611
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,584
Did you get bit?

612
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:46,084
Huh?

613
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:51,626
Say something, dammit.

614
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:54,126
He's the criminal.

615
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:56,959
You're scaring me, man.

616
00:56:58,459 --> 00:56:59,584
Snap out of it.

617
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,751
It wasn't just one or two people.

618
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:05,292
He took pictures of them
when they were alive-

619
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:10,334
and then went back for more
when they went crazy and died.

620
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:13,126
What the hell are you going on about?

621
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:16,876
He's the criminal.

622
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:20,292
That's enough. I'll deal with you later.

623
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:21,584
I'm sure of it.

624
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:24,209
He...

625
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,417
He took his victims' belongings

626
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,167
and did something with them.

627
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,126
What did you see?

628
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,167
Tell me!

629
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:50,959
Jeon Hyo-jin

630
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,459
You're getting all wet!

631
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:02,501
Where is Hyo-jin?

632
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:03,792
In the living room.

633
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:12,584
Hyo-jin.

634
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:17,501
You're home early.

635
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:19,209
Did you lose your trainer?

636
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:22,292
No, why?

637
00:58:31,834 --> 00:58:33,126
What's this, then?

638
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,209
It's not mine.

639
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:38,126
Isn't this your handwriting?

640
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:40,584
I said, it's not mine.

641
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:49,334
You know anything about
a Japanese man living in the village?

642
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,084
You're dripping water all over the place.

643
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:59,209
Answer me. Do you know him or not?

644
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:05,334
Did you meet him?

645
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:10,167
Answer me.

646
00:59:11,209 --> 00:59:13,084
You're scaring her.

647
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:14,459
Get out for a sec.

648
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,709
Come on, this is serious. It's you and me.

649
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:29,626
Daddy is a policeman. I'll know if you lie.

650
00:59:31,626 --> 00:59:33,459
Did you meet this man?

651
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:41,542
Tell me.

652
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,001
Tell you what?

653
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:46,459
Everything.

654
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:48,876
Where you met, what you did.

655
00:59:50,084 --> 00:59:51,709
Why should I tell you?

656
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:53,251
Because it's important.

657
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:54,876
What's so important?

658
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:57,084
Answer me, girl!

659
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:02,792
I said, what's so important?

660
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:09,584
What's so damn important?

661
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:12,001
What the hell...

662
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,251
is so damned important?

663
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:20,501
You don't even know what's important.

664
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:23,751
Stop grilling me, goddamn it!

665
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,459
Fuck!

666
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:03,751
What are you doing?

667
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:09,042
I thought you were sleeping.

668
01:02:09,084 --> 01:02:10,292
What the hell?

669
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:17,834
Yanking up your daughter's skirt
in the middle of the night?

670
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:26,917
Speak, will you?

671
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:32,292
Tell me, asshole!

672
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,876
Tell me, you fucking shithead!

673
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:38,792
Fuck you!

674
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:46,209
Stop staring, motherfucker!

675
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:48,501
Don't call your daddy that!

676
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,834
Don't you look at me!

677
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:56,084
Stop it! Daddy said he was sorry.

678
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,292
I'm gonna kill all of you.

679
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,626
How could you?

680
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,042
I met the shaman today.

681
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,626
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.

682
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:25,751
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.

683
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:29,792
And if we don't act,
there'll be dead bodies.

684
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:32,917
He's supposed to be the best.

685
01:03:46,001 --> 01:03:47,834
Why didn't you answer my calls?

686
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:52,459
Come with me, and don't give me any crap.

687
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:09,461
Ask him where he stashed
the stuff from in there.

688
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:14,084
The things in there... where are they now?

689
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:20,834
What things?

690
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:23,376
He asks what things.

691
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:25,792
The stuff we saw before.

692
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:29,792
Things we saw... before.

693
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:31,126
The photographs?

694
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:32,917
You mean the pictures?

695
01:05:32,959 --> 01:05:34,792
Yeah, the pictures. And the other stuff.

696
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:36,042
Yes.

697
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:41,459
I burned them.

698
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:42,584
Sorry?

699
01:05:44,751 --> 01:05:46,251
I burned them.

700
01:05:48,876 --> 01:05:50,667
He burned them.

701
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:53,876
Where?

702
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,626
Where?

703
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:01,250
In the kitchen.

704
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:19,792
Bastard!

705
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:23,251
You!

706
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:27,292
What did you come here to do?

707
01:06:30,126 --> 01:06:32,834
What did you come here to do?

708
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,542
Ask him again.

709
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:42,417
What did you come here to do?

710
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:49,459
To travel.

711
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:51,959
To travel, he says.

712
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:56,334
Tell him I'll throw him in jail
if he doesn't fess up.

713
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:01,667
Tell us the truth.

714
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:10,584
Even if I told you,

715
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,251
you wouldn't believe me.

716
01:07:12,501 --> 01:07:16,001
He says you wouldn't believe him.

717
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,459
Look, you translate everything I say,

718
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:22,292
- word for word.
- Yes, sir.

719
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:23,834
You fucking prick!

720
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:24,709
Oh...

721
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:27,626
You loose-assed, dog-fucking
son of a whore!

722
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:28,917
So, uh...

723
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:32,001
What kind of tourist hangs pictures
of dead people on his wall?

724
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:34,376
Travel... the dead...

725
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,876
Why was this in your house?

726
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:37,251
How did this...?

727
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:39,459
Who the fuck are you?

728
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:41,292
Who are you?

729
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:44,709
I know what you're doing in this village.

730
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:47,084
I saw that room.

731
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:51,959
And I know what the fuck
you're doing to my daughter!

732
01:07:55,709 --> 01:07:57,001
I want you...

733
01:07:57,876 --> 01:08:02,084
to stop what you're doing,
and leave this village quietly.

734
01:08:02,709 --> 01:08:03,709
I mean it.

735
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:05,667
Leave.

736
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:07,792
Quietly.

737
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,417
This is Gokseong. My turf.

738
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:13,001
Don't mess around

739
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:16,167
and get yourself killed. Just leave.

740
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:19,376
If you don't leave, you'll die.

741
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:27,042
If you heard me, say something.
Or at least nod your fucking head!

742
01:08:27,084 --> 01:08:28,917
Please answer.

743
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:38,209
So, you're...

744
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:40,626
Shut up, bitch!

745
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,667
You're blowing me off?

746
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:45,292
Oh, I'm just not worth answering.

747
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:49,459
Is that it?

748
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:55,251
You're not even gonna listen, right?

749
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:56,959
Ain't that right?

750
01:08:57,709 --> 01:08:59,917
I'm trying to speak to you,

751
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:02,084
but you're not listening!

752
01:09:04,084 --> 01:09:05,251
What's this?

753
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:06,667
What the fuck is this?

754
01:09:07,626 --> 01:09:09,667
What the hell is all this?

755
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:12,126
What the...

756
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:16,917
What the fuck are these
rituals you're doing?!

757
01:09:19,084 --> 01:09:21,251
What the fuck are you doing in my town!

758
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,542
Do you know whose daughter
you're messing with?

759
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:27,917
Son of a bitch!

760
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:30,042
Look out!

761
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:09,917
Jong-gu?

762
01:10:35,626 --> 01:10:36,792
Now what?

763
01:10:41,209 --> 01:10:42,501
Starting to see the light?

764
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:47,876
I'll give you three days.

765
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:53,417
Get out, or you'll end up
like your goddamned dog.

766
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,292
Translate.

767
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:00,251
Translate what I said.

768
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,501
How long has it been like this?

769
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,584
Just a few days.

770
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:13,376
So?

771
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:15,709
The symptoms-

772
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:17,167
they're the same as the others'.

773
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,584
There's gotta be an explanation
for what she has.

774
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:24,876
They say they don't know.

775
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:52,501
What is it?

776
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:53,709
Oh God!

777
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,251
Who the fuck did this?

778
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,334
What?!

779
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,501
You okay?

780
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:11,292
Get your husband.

781
01:13:11,876 --> 01:13:13,376
Who did this?

782
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:16,001
Who the fuck did this?

783
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:17,834
Jong-gu!

784
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:21,959
Jong-gu!

785
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:24,376
What's the matter!

786
01:13:32,584 --> 01:13:34,167
Does he drink a lot?

787
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:37,042
It's nothing to worry about.

788
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:40,459
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.

789
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,251
Cut back on the drinking.

790
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:48,542
Yeah.

791
01:13:52,251 --> 01:13:56,542
It's started. You better brace yourself.

792
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:02,584
What I said the other
day-we'll do it tomorrow.

793
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,417
Where is Hyo-jin?

794
01:14:05,459 --> 01:14:09,167
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.

795
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:10,834
Where is she?

796
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:12,792
At home. Where else would she be?

797
01:14:12,834 --> 01:14:14,959
I asked the old lady
next door to watch her.

798
01:14:15,001 --> 01:14:17,126
You left her alone with a stranger?

799
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,792
Are you out of your minds?

800
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:21,626
Don't move.

801
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:28,584
Hyo-jin.

802
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:32,751
Baby.

803
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:43,459
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!

804
01:14:45,334 --> 01:14:46,376
Hyo-jin!

805
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,084
Hyo-jin!

806
01:14:48,376 --> 01:14:49,959
Hyo-jin!

807
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:52,292
Drop that, baby.

808
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:56,459
Don't cry. It's okay.

809
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,334
It's okay.

810
01:14:58,376 --> 01:14:59,584
It'll be okay.

811
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:05,209
Quick! Call 911!

812
01:15:33,084 --> 01:15:35,376
This is all the work of that Jap.

813
01:15:37,626 --> 01:15:39,584
Ever since we went to his house,

814
01:15:40,292 --> 01:15:42,042
my body's been in pain.

815
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:45,334
I'm burning up. I'm seeing things.

816
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:50,292
A man's face comes out of the wall.

817
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,709
I don't think he's alive.

818
01:15:57,709 --> 01:15:59,334
We've gotta do something,

819
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:05,167
or that bastard will get us first.

820
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:10,209
Shut the damn door!

821
01:18:04,751 --> 01:18:06,126
What's in that jar?

822
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:08,667
Which one?

823
01:18:09,001 --> 01:18:11,001
The one with the red lid.

824
01:18:11,126 --> 01:18:13,376
It's just soy sauce.

825
01:18:15,376 --> 01:18:18,126
Bring it over.

826
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,626
What, are you deaf?

827
01:18:30,626 --> 01:18:33,209
Out of the way, come on.

828
01:18:36,626 --> 01:18:37,751
Stand back.

829
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:51,459
What is that?

830
01:18:52,126 --> 01:18:54,251
I'll be fucked...

831
01:18:57,501 --> 01:19:00,417
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.

832
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:28,542
You don't want to leave, do you?

833
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,376
Let's go!

834
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:07,792
Stop it!

835
01:20:41,084 --> 01:20:42,251
Hyo-jin!

836
01:20:49,709 --> 01:20:51,459
Come here, you!

837
01:21:15,084 --> 01:21:16,542
You met up with something recently

838
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:18,709
you weren't supposed to?

839
01:21:23,626 --> 01:21:26,126
I don't follow you.

840
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:32,292
Did you disturb someone?

841
01:21:35,834 --> 01:21:41,376
Of all the evil I've seen,
this is the strongest.

842
01:21:42,626 --> 01:21:44,542
You disturbed it.

843
01:21:44,959 --> 01:21:48,001
Oh, God! What do we do now?

844
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:50,084
Who is it?

845
01:21:54,251 --> 01:21:56,084
Who did you disturb?

846
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:57,834
Tell him.

847
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:06,834
A Japanese man...

848
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:14,292
I knew it.

849
01:22:15,751 --> 01:22:19,251
That's no man.

850
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:23,167
That's a ghost.

851
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:50,001
All the things happening
around here are his doing.

852
01:22:53,376 --> 01:22:57,042
If nothing is done, it's
not just your daughter,

853
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:02,084
but everything that walks
on two feet will perish.

854
01:23:08,626 --> 01:23:10,042
Sir!

855
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:13,376
This is Park Chun-bae. He owns this house.

856
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:17,709
He killed his wife, too?

857
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:19,167
It appears so.

858
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:21,376
What's that bastard's name?

859
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:23,292
Park Chun-bae.

860
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,626
Then what?

861
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:30,334
What do you mean, what?
Gotta get rid of it.

862
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:35,459
Either banish it, or kill it.

863
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:50,667
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow
at the hour of the dog.

864
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:55,459
Yes, sir.

865
01:23:56,042 --> 01:23:57,292
You got the money?

866
01:23:58,042 --> 01:23:59,417
How much?

867
01:23:59,459 --> 01:24:01,417
About 10 grand, don't you think?

868
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:06,126
I'll have it ready.

869
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,459
Good.

870
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:16,209
Listen.

871
01:24:16,876 --> 01:24:18,917
What I'm doing tomorrow-

872
01:24:20,376 --> 01:24:21,834
it's no ordinary ritual.

873
01:24:22,584 --> 01:24:24,584
I'll be casting a death hex.

874
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:27,626
It's incredibly dangerous.

875
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:31,042
So you can't do anything
that would taint it.

876
01:24:32,459 --> 01:24:37,167
No intercourse. Watch
what you eat and drink.

877
01:24:39,376 --> 01:24:41,042
Or the spell will backfire.

878
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:43,126
Yes, sir.

879
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:47,167
Okay then. You can go.

880
01:24:56,084 --> 01:24:59,584
Can I ask you something?

881
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,167
What?

882
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:05,792
That Japanese guy.

883
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:09,876
You said he's a ghost.

884
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:11,834
So?

885
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:16,376
I don't get how a living
person can be a ghost.

886
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,792
It's not a living human.

887
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,084
He died a long time ago.

888
01:25:35,251 --> 01:25:37,667
He must have been human once.

889
01:25:38,751 --> 01:25:40,334
But not anymore.

890
01:25:44,209 --> 01:25:45,334
So then,

891
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:49,751
the ghost got inside him?

892
01:25:49,792 --> 01:25:51,917
Well, that's how it started.

893
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:01,376
Not everything that moves,
breathes, and talks is alive.

894
01:26:02,834 --> 01:26:06,084
Countless people have perished
because they didn't understand that.

895
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,167
If it's not stopped...

896
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:16,501
that demon will destroy this village.

897
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,626
Demon?

898
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:20,209
An evil ghost!

899
01:26:20,584 --> 01:26:24,084
Even among other demons,
he's a master of evil.

900
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:32,167
If that's true,

901
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:36,292
why did it have to be...

902
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:37,751
your daughter?

903
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:40,959
What sin did that young girl ever commit?

904
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:42,917
Yes.

905
01:26:44,626 --> 01:26:50,001
If you go fishing, do you
know what you'll catch?

906
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:52,126
No.

907
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:56,167
He's just fishing.

908
01:26:57,417 --> 01:27:00,834
Not even he knows what he'll catch.

909
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:08,501
He just threw out the bait,
and your daughter took it.

910
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:13,084
That's all it was.

911
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:24,126
Park Chun-bae

912
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:45,917
- This one?
- No.

913
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:50,042
Money. Yes, money.

914
01:27:50,334 --> 01:27:52,792
21 dollars more.

915
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,209
- No!
- That's okay.

916
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:57,626
Oh, come on.

917
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:31,542
Tell him to stop.

918
01:32:10,376 --> 01:32:11,751
Stop!

919
01:32:13,251 --> 01:32:14,542
Stop!

920
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:19,542
I said stop!

921
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:00,125
Jong-gu!

922
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:01,626
Jong-gu!

923
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:10,834
What's the matter?

924
01:33:57,417 --> 01:33:58,417
Look at me.

925
01:34:29,292 --> 01:34:30,292
Baby?

926
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:32,959
Baby?

927
01:35:12,209 --> 01:35:13,417
Hyo-jin!

928
01:35:50,334 --> 01:35:52,084
Please make him stop...

929
01:35:53,459 --> 01:35:55,084
Please...

930
01:35:57,667 --> 01:35:59,876
Please make him stop.

931
01:36:24,834 --> 01:36:26,042
Dad!

932
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:31,959
Dad...

933
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:33,334
Hyo-jin.

934
01:36:33,376 --> 01:36:34,834
We shouldn't do this...

935
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,917
Stop, you bastards!

936
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:47,167
Stop!

937
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:49,251
Fucking bastards!

938
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:52,209
Stop right now.

939
01:36:54,292 --> 01:36:55,584
Stop!

940
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:57,584
Stop.

941
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:00,417
I said stop!

942
01:37:00,626 --> 01:37:01,792
Stop.

943
01:37:01,876 --> 01:37:04,626
I'm gonna smash your heads in!

944
01:37:05,626 --> 01:37:06,959
Stop, I said.

945
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:08,876
Get out.

946
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:11,042
Now!

947
01:38:32,584 --> 01:38:35,542
Everything started on that day?

948
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:47,751
I'll try speaking to the Father.

949
01:38:51,542 --> 01:38:55,626
What you're telling me is true?

950
01:38:56,751 --> 01:38:57,834
Yes.

951
01:39:04,542 --> 01:39:08,001
And you said the shaman told you this.

952
01:39:08,751 --> 01:39:11,167
From their perspective,

953
01:39:11,667 --> 01:39:15,667
a ghost is the spirit of a dead man.

954
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:19,584
But that man is alive.

955
01:39:21,251 --> 01:39:24,334
I've heard about this man, too.

956
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:27,959
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.

957
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:30,917
And there are darker,
more disturbing rumors-

958
01:39:31,876 --> 01:39:33,834
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.

959
01:39:34,042 --> 01:39:38,917
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?

960
01:39:38,959 --> 01:39:43,001
No, Father. They're definitely not rumors.

961
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:47,126
You sound terribly sure.

962
01:39:50,709 --> 01:39:53,334
Did you see it with your own eyes?

963
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:59,542
How can you be sure without
seeing for yourself?

964
01:40:01,459 --> 01:40:07,667
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.

965
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:11,959
There's nothing the Church
can do for you now.

966
01:40:17,626 --> 01:40:19,709
Come with me to the Jap's.

967
01:40:20,501 --> 01:40:21,917
Sorry?

968
01:40:21,959 --> 01:40:23,834
I gotta see for myself

969
01:40:25,001 --> 01:40:27,084
if he's really a ghost or not.

970
01:40:30,376 --> 01:40:31,876
If he is,

971
01:40:33,709 --> 01:40:35,626
then I won't be able to kill him.

972
01:41:11,251 --> 01:41:12,667
Where is he?

973
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:13,876
Is everyone here?

974
01:41:13,917 --> 01:41:15,001
Yeah.

975
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:17,167
Why'd you call us so early?

976
01:41:17,209 --> 01:41:19,334
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.

977
01:41:21,959 --> 01:41:23,292
What's with your face?

978
01:41:41,709 --> 01:41:45,667
This ain't a joke?

979
01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:50,876
You're serious, right?

980
01:41:52,126 --> 01:41:53,376
Yeah.

981
01:41:53,417 --> 01:41:55,501
Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?

982
01:41:56,251 --> 01:41:57,876
You prick!

983
01:41:59,126 --> 01:42:00,876
This is no time for jokes.

984
01:42:00,917 --> 01:42:02,626
What a fucking loser.

985
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:14,251
Go!

986
01:42:34,876 --> 01:42:36,334
- Nothing?
- No.

987
01:42:36,376 --> 01:42:38,876
Don't just stand around. Check the back.

988
01:43:25,876 --> 01:43:27,001
What's that?

989
01:43:28,667 --> 01:43:30,376
Fucking bastard...

990
01:43:31,459 --> 01:43:34,584
Byeong-gyu! Over here.

991
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:38,626
Hurry up.

992
01:43:38,751 --> 01:43:39,667
Is that him?

993
01:43:39,709 --> 01:43:40,792
Over there.

994
01:43:40,834 --> 01:43:42,709
Where? Follow me.

995
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:44,126
Where?

996
01:43:51,251 --> 01:43:52,334
What the...?

997
01:43:53,251 --> 01:43:54,501
Who's that?

998
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:58,376
What is that thing?

999
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:03,126
Don't come any closer.

1000
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:04,209
Back off.

1001
01:44:22,126 --> 01:44:23,167
Back off.

1002
01:44:28,126 --> 01:44:29,334
Stop it.

1003
01:44:29,542 --> 01:44:32,042
That's enough, man!

1004
01:44:33,626 --> 01:44:36,751
Sorry, man. You all right?

1005
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:45,584
Stop it!

1006
01:44:46,501 --> 01:44:48,709
What are you doing to him?

1007
01:44:48,792 --> 01:44:50,001
He's not... right...

1008
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:51,876
Put it down.

1009
01:44:51,917 --> 01:44:54,084
- Let go!
- We can talk this out.

1010
01:44:54,126 --> 01:44:55,126
E-sam!

1011
01:47:13,917 --> 01:47:15,626
Dad...

1012
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:19,251
Look.

1013
01:47:20,959 --> 01:47:22,376
There's another one!

1014
01:47:36,876 --> 01:47:38,042
That's him.

1015
01:47:38,501 --> 01:47:39,584
That's him!

1016
01:47:40,251 --> 01:47:41,626
Get him!

1017
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:46,334
Get him!

1018
01:47:46,542 --> 01:47:47,667
Where?

1019
01:47:49,417 --> 01:47:50,501
Son of a bitch!

1020
01:47:50,542 --> 01:47:52,084
There he is.

1021
01:47:53,209 --> 01:47:54,334
Over there.

1022
01:47:57,126 --> 01:47:58,126
Son of a bitch!

1023
01:48:09,001 --> 01:48:10,084
Where is he?

1024
01:48:10,209 --> 01:48:11,292
Over there.

1025
01:48:12,001 --> 01:48:13,126
Where?

1026
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:10,417
What's wrong?

1027
01:49:12,209 --> 01:49:14,001
- Come over here.
- What? Why did you stop?

1028
01:49:16,667 --> 01:49:17,751
What's the matter?

1029
01:49:18,917 --> 01:49:20,209
Come over here!

1030
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:22,584
Jong-gu.

1031
01:49:27,834 --> 01:49:28,917
Where'd he go?

1032
01:49:29,001 --> 01:49:30,292
Where is that bastard?

1033
01:49:32,792 --> 01:49:34,001
Hey, man!

1034
01:49:34,042 --> 01:49:36,292
Get down here.

1035
01:49:36,334 --> 01:49:37,334
Do you see him?

1036
01:49:37,376 --> 01:49:38,376
Hey!

1037
01:49:38,584 --> 01:49:40,001
Where did he go?

1038
01:49:42,126 --> 01:49:43,251
Jong-gu!

1039
01:49:47,459 --> 01:49:48,626
I gotta catch him.

1040
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:52,334
Gotta catch that bastard.

1041
01:49:54,126 --> 01:49:55,376
Catch that bastard.

1042
01:49:59,209 --> 01:50:00,126
I can't believe this...

1043
01:50:00,167 --> 01:50:02,209
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.

1044
01:50:02,251 --> 01:50:02,917
Let's go down.

1045
01:50:02,959 --> 01:50:04,292
I gotta save my little girl.

1046
01:50:04,334 --> 01:50:06,667
- We'll get him.
- I've gotta find him, and save my baby.

1047
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:08,626
- Don't worry, we will.
- Okay?

1048
01:50:10,584 --> 01:50:12,542
Get your act together, man.

1049
01:50:12,626 --> 01:50:16,251
We gotta save her.

1050
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:18,209
I know, man.

1051
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:20,167
I know.

1052
01:50:20,751 --> 01:50:23,709
I have to save my daughter...

1053
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:25,584
Come on, man.

1054
01:50:29,959 --> 01:50:33,167
I have to catch that bastard.

1055
01:50:34,334 --> 01:50:36,126
Don't cry, man.

1056
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:41,417
Dammit, Jong-gu!

1057
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:51,584
- Wife
- Please, pick up.

1058
01:53:28,251 --> 01:53:32,751
Shit! Was that a person?

1059
01:56:11,501 --> 01:56:14,667
Wife

1060
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:30,376
The rat fell into the trap.

1061
01:57:24,334 --> 01:57:25,834
You all right, baby?

1062
01:57:31,626 --> 01:57:32,917
You okay?

1063
01:57:33,126 --> 01:57:34,917
I'm okay.

1064
01:57:37,584 --> 01:57:38,876
Come here.

1065
01:57:50,959 --> 01:57:52,334
You're okay now?

1066
01:57:55,334 --> 01:57:56,626
You're okay now?

1067
01:58:16,584 --> 01:58:17,959
Drink up.

1068
01:58:18,667 --> 01:58:20,001
Good girl.

1069
01:58:50,501 --> 01:58:51,876
Leave it.

1070
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:54,001
I want to tidy up a little.

1071
01:58:54,042 --> 01:58:57,792
Leave it. We've got the shaman
to thank for everything.

1072
01:58:58,501 --> 01:59:01,042
Get some rest. You must be exhausted.

1073
01:59:04,792 --> 01:59:06,417
Shaman

1074
01:59:14,417 --> 01:59:15,917
Damn fool.

1075
01:59:29,334 --> 01:59:34,126
Suspect arrested in the
mushroom-tonic case...

1076
01:59:40,459 --> 01:59:44,042
Victims have developed
severe mental derangement...

1077
01:59:50,292 --> 01:59:51,626
Mr. Yang E-sam?

1078
01:59:51,667 --> 01:59:52,751
Yes.

1079
01:59:58,501 --> 02:00:00,542
The landlady was a victim.

1080
02:00:01,501 --> 02:00:03,501
Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too.

1081
02:00:04,334 --> 02:00:06,459
It's turned the town upside down.

1082
02:00:08,251 --> 02:00:09,917
We've gotta bring him in.

1083
02:00:10,334 --> 02:00:13,709
You should get a lawyer.

1084
02:00:14,792 --> 02:00:16,167
After all,

1085
02:00:17,667 --> 02:00:19,334
he's a victim, too.

1086
02:00:48,834 --> 02:00:50,917
What the fuck?

1087
02:01:12,209 --> 02:01:13,917
What are you doing here?

1088
02:01:31,042 --> 02:01:32,251
Get out.

1089
02:01:54,001 --> 02:01:56,209
Missed calls - Shaman

1090
02:03:53,167 --> 02:03:54,626
What the hell?

1091
02:03:58,417 --> 02:03:59,667
What the...?

1092
02:04:58,751 --> 02:04:59,501
Hello.

1093
02:04:59,542 --> 02:05:01,001
It's me.

1094
02:05:01,542 --> 02:05:02,834
Where are you?

1095
02:05:02,959 --> 02:05:04,209
What about you?

1096
02:05:04,251 --> 02:05:05,917
Don't ask me anything.

1097
02:05:06,126 --> 02:05:09,376
You need to get to your daughter. Now.

1098
02:05:09,417 --> 02:05:11,376
Tell me what's going on?

1099
02:05:11,417 --> 02:05:13,334
I'm at your place.

1100
02:05:13,376 --> 02:05:18,001
Get back to your house, now.

1101
02:05:18,042 --> 02:05:21,501
First tell me what's going on.

1102
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,959
I...

1103
02:05:26,251 --> 02:05:29,917
I misread the divination.

1104
02:05:31,251 --> 02:05:32,834
It's not him.

1105
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:36,084
What are you talking about?

1106
02:05:37,501 --> 02:05:39,584
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.

1107
02:05:40,626 --> 02:05:43,126
I saw a woman in front of your house.

1108
02:05:43,709 --> 02:05:47,126
I made a grave mistake.

1109
02:05:47,834 --> 02:05:50,209
A terrible, terrible mistake.

1110
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,417
It's not the Japanese man.

1111
02:05:55,542 --> 02:05:57,376
That woman is the evil spirit.

1112
02:05:58,251 --> 02:05:59,959
It was all her doing.

1113
02:06:00,334 --> 02:06:02,167
So, go home now.

1114
02:06:02,209 --> 02:06:03,792
I'm on my way there, too.

1115
02:06:04,584 --> 02:06:05,876
Then...

1116
02:06:08,251 --> 02:06:09,501
Who's the Japanese man?

1117
02:06:09,542 --> 02:06:13,084
He was trying to kill that woman

1118
02:06:14,084 --> 02:06:17,167
in order to save people from her.

1119
02:06:17,584 --> 02:06:18,834
Understand?

1120
02:06:19,417 --> 02:06:21,209
That Japanese man-

1121
02:06:23,292 --> 02:06:24,876
he's a shaman, like me.

1122
02:06:32,667 --> 02:06:34,001
Was the woman...

1123
02:06:34,834 --> 02:06:35,917
wearing white?

1124
02:06:40,084 --> 02:06:41,417
Did you see her?

1125
02:06:46,459 --> 02:06:47,792
A young woman?

1126
02:06:49,459 --> 02:06:51,042
That's her.

1127
02:06:59,626 --> 02:07:01,959
Defend us in battle.

1128
02:07:02,959 --> 02:07:06,209
Be our safeguard against the wickedness

1129
02:07:07,709 --> 02:07:09,417
and snares of the devil.

1130
02:07:30,542 --> 02:07:31,667
Where is she?

1131
02:07:34,292 --> 02:07:35,959
Where's Hyo-jin?!

1132
02:08:31,001 --> 02:08:32,292
Hyo-jin!

1133
02:08:42,542 --> 02:08:43,626
What is it?

1134
02:08:47,501 --> 02:08:49,501
Where are you headed in the dark of night?

1135
02:09:01,209 --> 02:09:02,584
I'm asking you.

1136
02:09:04,042 --> 02:09:05,459
Where is my daughter?

1137
02:09:08,209 --> 02:09:09,584
Where is she?

1138
02:09:14,876 --> 02:09:16,376
Girl about this tall?

1139
02:09:17,209 --> 02:09:18,376
Yeah.

1140
02:09:24,417 --> 02:09:25,709
Hyo-jin?

1141
02:09:27,126 --> 02:09:28,167
That's right.

1142
02:09:28,876 --> 02:09:31,292
She's possessed by an evil spirit.

1143
02:09:32,376 --> 02:09:36,001
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.

1144
02:09:37,417 --> 02:09:38,727
He's trying to suck her blood dry...

1145
02:09:38,751 --> 02:09:40,292
Shut the fuck up!

1146
02:09:41,459 --> 02:09:43,126
Answer me, bitch!

1147
02:09:44,126 --> 02:09:45,667
Where is Hyo-jin?

1148
02:09:47,292 --> 02:09:50,251
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?

1149
02:09:51,417 --> 02:09:53,667
At your home, where else?

1150
02:09:53,709 --> 02:09:54,959
She's not home.

1151
02:09:55,001 --> 02:09:56,292
She is.

1152
02:09:57,626 --> 02:09:58,917
She just got back.

1153
02:10:04,042 --> 02:10:05,459
Don't go now-

1154
02:10:07,584 --> 02:10:09,084
or you'll all die.

1155
02:10:09,667 --> 02:10:12,251
If you go now, your whole
family will perish.

1156
02:10:20,334 --> 02:10:21,834
What are you talking about?

1157
02:10:44,834 --> 02:10:47,501
The Jap is waiting for you...

1158
02:10:48,209 --> 02:10:51,667
to annihilate your family.

1159
02:10:54,126 --> 02:10:55,751
He's dead.

1160
02:10:56,042 --> 02:10:57,209
He's not dead.

1161
02:10:59,667 --> 02:11:01,417
Death cannot touch him.

1162
02:11:05,376 --> 02:11:09,042
The demon will soon enter your home.

1163
02:11:11,542 --> 02:11:13,209
You've seen the demon?

1164
02:11:15,834 --> 02:11:19,209
At the house of the hanged woman.

1165
02:11:25,959 --> 02:11:27,084
It was a dream.

1166
02:11:27,792 --> 02:11:28,792
It was no dream.

1167
02:12:02,167 --> 02:12:04,042
I laid a trap for it.

1168
02:12:05,042 --> 02:12:06,917
Wait here, until he's caught.

1169
02:12:08,042 --> 02:12:09,084
That's all you need to do.

1170
02:12:12,334 --> 02:12:16,334
What are you?

1171
02:12:20,376 --> 02:12:22,084
A woman or a ghost?

1172
02:12:22,917 --> 02:12:24,334
Why do you ask?

1173
02:12:25,001 --> 02:12:26,417
I need to know...

1174
02:12:28,084 --> 02:12:29,501
If I can put my faith in you.

1175
02:12:30,376 --> 02:12:31,584
Just believe,

1176
02:12:32,417 --> 02:12:33,792
and your family will be saved.

1177
02:12:33,834 --> 02:12:35,501
What are you?

1178
02:12:52,001 --> 02:12:54,084
Someone trying to save your daughter.

1179
02:12:57,251 --> 02:12:58,501
A woman.

1180
02:13:01,167 --> 02:13:04,792
I called all her friends...

1181
02:13:10,126 --> 02:13:11,334
Hyo-jin?

1182
02:13:11,584 --> 02:13:12,834
Hyo-jin!

1183
02:13:15,584 --> 02:13:16,709
Baby.

1184
02:13:17,126 --> 02:13:18,376
Baby...

1185
02:13:33,417 --> 02:13:36,501
When will the demon come?

1186
02:13:38,376 --> 02:13:39,917
It's already there.

1187
02:13:50,667 --> 02:13:51,792
Hyo-jin.

1188
02:13:53,126 --> 02:13:55,626
It's already there?

1189
02:14:06,751 --> 02:14:08,251
Let me ask you one thing.

1190
02:14:10,834 --> 02:14:14,334
What is your true form?

1191
02:14:57,709 --> 02:14:59,709
What do you think is my true form?

1192
02:15:00,292 --> 02:15:01,542
The devil.

1193
02:15:02,876 --> 02:15:04,542
You're the devil.

1194
02:15:08,292 --> 02:15:09,584
Why can't you answer?

1195
02:15:10,209 --> 02:15:12,417
You've already said it.

1196
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:16,834
I'm the devil.

1197
02:15:19,042 --> 02:15:21,251
Shaman

1198
02:15:30,876 --> 02:15:31,876
I'm almost there.

1199
02:15:31,917 --> 02:15:33,417
Where are you? Are you home?

1200
02:15:34,334 --> 02:15:37,792
I'm with the woman now.

1201
02:15:38,876 --> 02:15:42,417
You mustn't let her tempt you.

1202
02:15:42,584 --> 02:15:43,709
Never.

1203
02:15:43,751 --> 02:15:45,501
Whatever she tells you,

1204
02:15:45,626 --> 02:15:48,376
you must go to your daughter now.

1205
02:15:48,417 --> 02:15:50,001
Do you understand me?

1206
02:15:50,167 --> 02:15:51,167
Understand?

1207
02:15:53,292 --> 02:15:54,667
Do you?

1208
02:15:58,876 --> 02:16:00,167
Is that your shaman?

1209
02:16:05,167 --> 02:16:06,959
Don't believe what he tells you.

1210
02:16:07,876 --> 02:16:09,251
They're in on it together.

1211
02:16:10,209 --> 02:16:11,417
Isn't that right?

1212
02:16:13,084 --> 02:16:17,584
You're already certain I'm the devil.

1213
02:16:18,626 --> 02:16:20,376
That's why you came here...

1214
02:16:21,334 --> 02:16:22,917
carrying that sickle.

1215
02:16:32,626 --> 02:16:38,001
My words, whatever I say-

1216
02:16:38,042 --> 02:16:40,001
they won't change your mind.

1217
02:16:40,042 --> 02:16:41,167
No.

1218
02:16:42,167 --> 02:16:43,542
That's not true.

1219
02:16:44,459 --> 02:16:46,292
There's no doubt.

1220
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:52,917
You came here
to confirm your suspicions about me.

1221
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:54,126
That's not true!

1222
02:16:57,126 --> 02:16:58,126
If you say

1223
02:16:58,917 --> 02:17:02,667
you're not the devil,

1224
02:17:03,501 --> 02:17:06,042
and reveal your true form to me-

1225
02:17:08,542 --> 02:17:10,209
I'll leave you alone.

1226
02:17:12,876 --> 02:17:14,959
When the demon is snared,

1227
02:17:16,376 --> 02:17:19,292
the rooster will cry three times.

1228
02:17:22,834 --> 02:17:24,251
Wait until the third cry.

1229
02:17:30,292 --> 02:17:36,292
You'll leave me alone?

1230
02:17:38,376 --> 02:17:39,501
Yes.

1231
02:17:44,292 --> 02:17:45,834
Two more.

1232
02:17:51,209 --> 02:17:52,459
Do not waver.

1233
02:17:57,542 --> 02:17:59,334
You'll leave?

1234
02:18:00,001 --> 02:18:01,209
Yes.

1235
02:18:01,959 --> 02:18:03,626
I'll leave you alone.

1236
02:18:24,001 --> 02:18:26,792
Who said I'd let you leave?

1237
02:18:31,876 --> 02:18:36,126
Then let me ask you one thing.

1238
02:18:36,459 --> 02:18:37,584
What?

1239
02:18:37,626 --> 02:18:42,251
Why in God's name is he doing this?

1240
02:18:43,084 --> 02:18:46,959
Because her father has sinned.

1241
02:18:47,501 --> 02:18:48,501
What sin?

1242
02:18:51,376 --> 02:18:52,792
What sin did I commit?

1243
02:18:53,542 --> 02:18:57,584
Her father suspected another.

1244
02:18:58,251 --> 02:19:02,167
He tried to kill him,
and finally succeeded.

1245
02:19:03,001 --> 02:19:07,126
But my daughter...!

1246
02:19:08,709 --> 02:19:10,084
My daughter...

1247
02:19:10,667 --> 02:19:13,417
My daughter got sick first!

1248
02:19:14,042 --> 02:19:15,459
How can that...

1249
02:19:23,667 --> 02:19:24,709
How can that possibly...

1250
02:19:24,792 --> 02:19:28,292
One more, now.

1251
02:19:36,417 --> 02:19:37,584
How can that be...?

1252
02:19:59,292 --> 02:20:00,542
Don't do it.

1253
02:20:02,876 --> 02:20:04,376
What are you saying?

1254
02:20:06,001 --> 02:20:10,042
Whether you walk out of here or not
is completely up to you.

1255
02:20:18,917 --> 02:20:20,584
Touch me and see.

1256
02:20:25,501 --> 02:20:30,417
A ghost does not have flesh and bones,

1257
02:20:30,667 --> 02:20:37,667
and you see I have both.

1258
02:21:02,876 --> 02:21:04,667
Park Chun-bae

1259
02:21:06,459 --> 02:21:07,542
No.

1260
02:21:08,834 --> 02:21:10,209
That's not it.

1261
02:21:13,376 --> 02:21:14,542
It's you.

1262
02:21:14,834 --> 02:21:15,917
No.

1263
02:21:16,167 --> 02:21:17,876
This is all your doing.

1264
02:21:23,459 --> 02:21:24,417
Don't do it.

1265
02:21:24,459 --> 02:21:25,626
Hyo-jin...

1266
02:21:27,667 --> 02:21:28,876
Don't do it.

1267
02:21:29,084 --> 02:21:30,209
Hyo-jin...

1268
02:21:31,334 --> 02:21:34,626
No!

1269
02:21:44,376 --> 02:21:45,626
What are you doing?

1270
02:21:47,917 --> 02:21:49,042
Don't!

1271
02:21:49,501 --> 02:21:51,876
Why are you troubled?

1272
02:22:17,667 --> 02:22:18,751
Hyo-jin.

1273
02:22:31,417 --> 02:22:32,626
Honey...

1274
02:22:36,167 --> 02:22:37,376
Mother...

1275
02:24:33,709 --> 02:24:35,875
Look at me.

1276
02:24:36,459 --> 02:24:39,001
Look at me!

1277
02:24:39,751 --> 02:24:41,001
Please.

1278
02:24:41,042 --> 02:24:44,876
Look at me.

1279
02:24:46,709 --> 02:24:47,959
Please...

1280
02:24:48,751 --> 02:24:50,709
Please!

1281
02:25:10,834 --> 02:25:12,626
Hyo-jin!

1282
02:25:13,667 --> 02:25:16,292
Hyo-jin...

1283
02:25:24,084 --> 02:25:25,209
Hyo-jin.

1284
02:25:30,876 --> 02:25:32,292
Hyo-jin.

1285
02:25:35,167 --> 02:25:36,876
Hyo-jin...

1286
02:25:40,084 --> 02:25:42,792
Hyo-jin!

1287
02:25:58,542 --> 02:26:02,792
Why is there doubt in your heart?

1288
02:26:16,376 --> 02:26:19,584
See my hands, and my feet.

1289
02:26:36,084 --> 02:26:37,876
You can see it is I.

1290
02:26:46,459 --> 02:26:47,917
Myself.

1291
02:27:04,834 --> 02:27:06,459
Oh Lord...

1292
02:29:15,251 --> 02:29:16,709
Hyo-jin...

1293
02:29:56,001 --> 02:29:57,709
It's okay.

1294
02:30:02,917 --> 02:30:05,334
My baby.

1295
02:30:10,084 --> 02:30:13,792
You know Daddy's a policeman.

1296
02:30:18,167 --> 02:30:23,501
I'll take care of everything.

1297
02:30:30,626 --> 02:30:32,709
Daddy will.

{19060}{19128}They want $5,000.
{19130}{19174}Won't the church pay?
{19204}{19279}They would if they were|interested in keeping the place.
{19315}{19370}But they aren't.
{19372}{19476}The archbishop wants to sell this|building to the Board of Education.
{19478}{19516}What will happen to you?
{19518}{19583}I'll be sent to the missions--
{19585}{19689}Africa, Latin America...
{19691}{19730}- Korea.|- Forget it!
{19732}{19817}Five grand? No problem. We'll have it|for you in the morning. Let's go.
{19848}{19931}I will not take|your filthy, stolen money!
{19994}{20089}Well, then.|I guess you're really up shit creek.
{20141}{20193}I beg your pardon.|What did you say?
{20221}{20267}I offered to help you.
{20301}{20371}You refused to take our money.
{20400}{20479}Then I said,|"I guess you're really up shit creek."
{20501}{20547}- Christ, Jake, take it easy, man.|- Elwood!
{20549}{20624}- Ow! Shit!|-Jesus Christ!

{20965}{20988}Fuck this!
{21298}{21364}You are|such a disappointing pair.
{21366}{21440}I prayed so hard for you.
{21442}{21489}It saddens and hurts me...
{21491}{21550}that the two young men|whom I raised...
{21552}{21604}to believe|in the Ten Commandments...
{21606}{21680}have returned to me|as two thieves...
{21682}{21796}with filthy mouths|and bad attitudes.
{21798}{21847}Get out!
{21849}{21910}And don't come back...
{21912}{22012}until you've|redeemed yourselves.
{22167}{22260}Boys, you gotta learn|not to talk to nuns that way.
{22364}{22407}Curtis!
{22409}{22471}- You look fine!|- Good to see you!

{22604}{22685}Boys, things are bad.
{22687}{22760}They gonna sell this place|to the Board of Education...
{22762}{22810}and I'll be out on the street.
{22851}{22950}That money's got to be in the Cook|County Assessor's Office within 11 days.
{23021}{23066}They wouldn't turn you out,|would they?
{23097}{23213}Shit. What's one more old nigger|to the Board of Education?
{23254}{23336}Curtis, you and the Penguin|are the only family we got.
{23338}{23412}You're the only one|that was ever good to us...
{23414}{23525}singing Elmore James tunes and|blowing the harp for us down here.
{23527}{23645}Well, the sister was right. You boys|could use a little churching up.
{23647}{23713}Slide on down|to the Triple Rock...
{23715}{23775}and catch Reverend Cleophus.
{23777}{23847}You boys listen|to what he's got to say.
{23952}{24000}I don't want to listen|to no jive-ass preacher...
{24004}{24059}talking to me|about heaven and hell.
{24085}{24161}You get wise.|You get to church!
{24561}{24604}All I'm saying is,|we got to figure out...
{24606}{24666}some way|to get that money honestly.
{24693}{24743}That could be a problem.
{24745}{24777}Like the Penguin says.
{24779}{24867}We got to move toward redemption.|We got to go to church.
{24869}{24953}"We got to move toward redemption.|We got to go to church."
{24955}{24988}Bullshit.
{24990}{25042}Come on.
{25529}{25579}And now, this week's sermon...
{25581}{25656}is from our beloved,|the Reverend Cleophus James!
{25844}{25900}And now, people--
{25932}{25978}And now, people--
{26004}{26134}When I woke up this morning,|I heard a disturbing sound.
{26177}{26254}I said,|when I woke up this morning...
{26256}{26314}I heard a disturbing sound!
{26346}{26432}What I heard|was the jingle-jangle...
{26434}{26482}of a thousand lost souls!
{26509}{26595}I'm talking about the souls|of mortal men and women...
{26597}{26644}departed from this life!
{26679}{26718}Wait a minute!
{26720}{26832}Those lost, anguished souls|roaming unseen over the earth...
{26868}{26920}seeking a divine light...
{26922}{27009}they'll not find|because it's too late!
{27050}{27149}Too late! Yeah! Too late|for them to ever see again...
{27151}{27264}the light they once chose|not to follow! All right!
{27266}{27342}Don't be lost|when the time comes!
{27344}{27433}For the day of the Lord cometh...
{27435}{27499}as a thief in the night!
{27501}{27571}Amen
{27597}{27643}Say amen!
{27833}{27870}- Let us all|-All go back
{27872}{27911}- To the old|- Old landmark
{28063}{28139}As we stay|in the service of the Lord
{28141}{28211}- Let us preach|- Preach the word
{28213}{28298}- Got to preach|- Preach the word all the way
{28374}{28424}Do it, know it, feel it
{30379}{30440}Jake, are you all right?
{30767}{30853}Alleluia
{30909}{30962}The band.
{31030}{31073}Do you see the light?
{31201}{31235}What light?
{31237}{31285}Have you seen the light?
{31287}{31415}Yes!|Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!
{31417}{31487}I have seen the light!
{32017}{32051}The band!
{32289}{32393}- Praise God!|- And God bless the United States!
{33916}{34052}Stay in the service|of the Lord

{34949}{35031}We'll put the band back together,|we do a few gigs...
{35033}{35112}we get some bread.|Bang-- five thousand bucks!
{35114}{35222}Well, getting the band|back together might not be that easy.
{35224}{35294}- What are you talking about?|- They split.
{35296}{35347}They all took straight jobs.
{35349}{35401}Yeah? So you know|where they are.
{35403}{35454}You said you were|keeping in touch with them.
{35487}{35594}I got a couple of leads,|a few phone numbers.
{35596}{35669}But, I mean, how many of them|visited or even wrote you?
{35671}{35751}They're not the kind of guys|who write letters.
{35753}{35821}You were outside.|I was inside.
{35823}{35904}You were supposed to keep|in touch with the band.
{35906}{35976}I kept asking you|if we were gonna play again.
{35978}{36073}What was I gonna do,|take away your only hope?
{36099}{36171}Take away the very thing|that kept you going in there?
{36173}{36241}I took the liberty|of bullshitting you. Okay?
{36243}{36356}- You lied to me.|- It wasn't lies. It was just bullshit.
{36671}{36713}- Shit.|- What?
{36715}{36761}- Rollers.|- No.
{36763}{36802}Shit.
{37695}{37792}- What? What did I do?|- You failed to stop at a red signal.
{37794}{37850}The light was yellow, sir.
{37852}{37910}May I see your license, please?
{38070}{38104}God dam it!
{38106}{38191}I haven't been pulled over|in six months.
{38193}{38248}I bet those cops|have got SCMODS.
{38311}{38425}State County Municipal Offender|Data System.
{39039}{39121}Elwood, we show your license|currently under suspension.
{39123}{39181}Step out of the car, please.
{39688}{39769}First you trade the Cadillac|for a microphone.
{39771}{39825}Then you lie to me|about the band.
{39827}{39881}Now you're gonna put me|right back in the joint!
{39883}{39951}They're not gonna catch us.|We're on a mission from God.
{40370}{40460}We are in high-speed pursuit|northbound on Courtland Avenue.
{40462}{40545}Black-and-white 1 974 Dodge sedan|with Illinois plates.
{40547}{40600}Request assistance.
{41178}{41248}We'll be all right if we can|just get back on the expressway.
{41290}{41350}This don't look|like no expressway to me!
{41398}{41445}Don't yell at me.
{41447}{41501}What do you want me to do,|motor head?
{41503}{41553}Try not to be so negative|all the time.
{41555}{41626}Why don't you offer|some constructive criticism?
{41729}{41836}You got us into this parking lot, pal.|Now you get us out!
{41838}{41907}You want out|of this parking lot?
{41968}{42023}- Will there be anything else?|- Do you have Miss Piggy?

{55069}{55138}I gotta hit the sack.
{55140}{55208}Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

{58670}{58705}I don't want trouble.
{58707}{58791}Tell us where they are,|and there'll be no trouble.
{59146}{59182}Stand back.
{60250}{60324}It's almost 9:00.|We've gotta go to work.
{61675}{61760}Hello, Elwood. Sit down.|What's on your mind?
{61781}{61815}I gotta quit.
{61834}{61899}Why is that, Elwood?
{61901}{61977}I'm going to become a priest.
{62200}{62275}I'll call payroll and have them get|your severance pay ready.

{63131}{63202}The Lord works in mysterious ways.
{64276}{64342}- Mrs Toronto?|- Tarantino.
{64344}{64454}Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone|or Louis Marini living here?
{64486}{64560}Not any more.|They moved out a long time ago.
{64562}{64620}I don't take in boarders any more.
{64657}{64737}- May we come in, ma'am?|- Please.
{64992}{65078}Did they leave a forwarding address?|A phone number?
{65080}{65150}Did they live quietly?|What were their personal habits?
{65152}{65205}They were good boys...
{65207}{65287}but they made|a lot of racket at night.
{65289}{65335}Are you the police?
{65337}{65393}No, ma'am.|We're musicians.
{65446}{65480}Mr Man!
{65619}{65728}- Yes, ma'am?|- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.
{66042}{66090}Thanks.
{67497}{67549}Thank you. You're marvellous.
{67612}{67679}Thank you. I'm Murph,|and these are the Magic Tones.
{67681}{67738}Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,|Donald "Duck" Dunn...
{67740}{67815}Willie "Too Big" Hall|and Tom "Bones" Malone.
{67817}{67866}We'll be back with the Magic Tones|for the Armada Room's...
{67868}{67928}two-hour disco swing party|after this short break.
{67930}{68009}Till then, don't you go changing.
{68092}{68192}So you're out. You're free.|You're rehabilitated.
{68194}{68266}What's next? What's happening?|What you gonna do?
{68268}{68322}You got the money you owe us,|mother-fucker?
{68324}{68385}Let's get something|straight here.
{68387}{68444}The reason he got locked in the slam|in the first place...
{68446}{68517}was for sticking up a gas station|to cover you guys.
{68519}{68558}You're kidding.
{68560}{68630}He pulled that job to pay|for the band's room-service tab...
{68632}{68694}from that Kiwanis gig|in Coal City.
{68696}{68742}- You did?|- That's right.
{68744}{68824}So I don't want to hear|any more of this small-change shit.
{68826}{68872}We're putting the band|back together.
{68978}{69090}Who here at this table|can honestly say...
{69092}{69191}that they played any finer|or felt any better than they did...
{69193}{69241}when they were|with the Blues Brothers?
{69314}{69367}You were the backbone...
{69369}{69459}the nerve centre|of a great rhythm-and-blues band.
{69461}{69566}You can make that live,|breathe and jump again.
{69568}{69619}Murph and the Magic Tones?
{69621}{69697}Look at you in those|candy-ass monkey suits.
{69699}{69761}And I thought|I had it bad in Joliet.
{69763}{69817}At least we got|a change in clothes.
{69819}{69881}You're wearing the same shit|from three years ago.
{69883}{69931}Jake ain't lying, though.
{69933}{70014}We had a band powerful enough|to turn goat piss into gasoline.
{70016}{70095}We'll never get that fat sound again|without more horns.
{70097}{70143}We'll never get Mr Fabulous.
{70145}{70195}- Where is he?|- Forget it.
{70197}{70255}Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'|at the Chez Paul.
{70257}{70307}He's pullin' down|six bills a week.
{70309}{70391}- Matt Murphy got married.|- Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?
{70393}{70443}He opened a restaurant with his old lady|on Maxwell Street...
{70445}{70495}and he took Blue Lou with him.
{70497}{70611}You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous|out of them high-paying gigs.
{70613}{70679}Oh, yeah?
{70681}{70743}Well, me and the Lord...
{70745}{70801}we got an understanding.
{70803}{70855}We're on a mission from God.
{71157}{71220}Mainly French cuisine.
{71222}{71315}No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer|dines here. He's dead, sir.
{71344}{71407}Private dining rooms|are available.
{71433}{71493}Oh, no. It was supposed to be|five years.
{71495}{71563}Didn't you get five years?|No, sir, not you.
{71565}{71611}And your name, sir?
{71613}{71719}Rizzolo, for eight at 11:30.|Thank you.
{71765}{71846}Mr Fabulous,|how marvellous it is to see you.
{71848}{71919}- You're looking younger than ever.|- Wait. You guys can't come in here.

{146763}{146908}Hey, folks, here?s a story|'bout Minnie the Moocher
{146910}{147026}She was a low-down hoochie coocher
{147028}{147122}She was the roughest, toughest frail
{147124}{147188}But Minnie had a heart
{147190}{147236}As big as a whale
{147726}{147841}She messed around|with a bloke named Smokey
{147843}{147931}She loved him|though he was cokey
{147962}{148035}He took her down to Chinatown
{148049}{148166}And he showed her how|to kick the gong around
{149161}{149247}She had a dream|about the King of Sweden
{149277}{149369}He gave her things|that she was needin '
{149371}{149485}He gave her a home|built of gold and steel
{149487}{149596}A diamond car|with the platinum wheels
{150997}{151068}This is glue. Strong stuff.
{151245}{151290}What the hell are you doing?

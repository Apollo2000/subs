Okay, I work just as hard
as any ranch hand that gets paid...

I'm sorry for runnin' out on you.
I'm gonna finish chopping up that wood...

174
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:07,517
I rounded up this morning, then reinforce
the pen, all like I was suppose to.

175
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:12,652
Uh, Jonas?

176
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:19,094
Forget the pen.

177
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,362
It'll be there tomorrow.

It's not far enough.

My mom used to say
how beautiful the coast is.

Said she felt trapped by the land.

188

Told me the ocean is freedom.

Thought you said your mama died
when you were a baby.

190
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,850
That was a lie.

Why?

192
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,628
Guess it...

193

just hurts too much to remember her.

00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,868
You lie a lot?

I think God's also a lie.

Just something someone made up
to keep people from being bad.

201

506
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,562

509
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:11,511
but, I think I got around
four hundred and thirty thousand.

510
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:14,881
I've got about five hundred
and fifty thousand.

511
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:16,010
So that's...

512

nine hundred and eighty, total.

513
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:20,387
It's almost a million dollars.

514
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:24,724
- Do you know what that means?
- It means we're rich.

515

No, Jonas, this is not our money.

I stole from him just like
he stole from them...

518
00:51:32,502 --> 00:51:35,472
so we got as much right to it as he does.

He wasn't too concerned with beating her up.

563

He used to say she could take it.

564

I tried, you know, like...

565
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:38,972
I tried convincing her to run away with me.

He... he had been drinking.

571
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:07,128
So... so, she got on his case
about it and started yelling.

572
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:14,176
He lost control...

573
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:20,640
and the car crashed.

574
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:31,023
I watched her die.

575
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:40,827
And then, uh... the cops came.

576
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:48,241
But they were his friends, you know, so...

577
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:51,008
they made sure nothing bad
would happen to him.

around to get angry at.

he wouldn't lose control again.

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,888
Bella Brown...

4
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:32,263
Well, what can I say?

5
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:34,722
There was nothing normal
about the girl.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,013
It's a miracle she survived at all
after her arrival in the world.

7
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:44,846
They say she would have perished
if it hadn't of been for the ducks.

8
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:48,805
Sat on her like an egg,
they did.

9
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:50,513
Treated her as one of their own.

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,763
She was finally discovered by
one of those ancient lunatics

11
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:05,388
who frequent
the parks of our city

12
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,680
and seem to
enjoy hypothermia.

13
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,804
She grew into
the oddest of oddballs,

14
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:18,388
terrified by the
unpredictability of nature

15
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:21,138
and flora, in particular.

16
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,471
Where on earth that came from,
I dread to think.

17
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:33,096
She's always had a
preoccupation with order

18
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,263
that would have tried
the patience of a saint,

19
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,846
never mind the nuns
at Saint Fedelma's.

20
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,679
Bella Brown!

21
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:45,596
It's an insular and solitary
world for Miss Brown,

22
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:49,012
just her and her books.

23
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:53,262
Hers was a story
just waiting to be told

24
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:57,471
but the obsessive little world
she created

25
00:01:57,637 --> 00:02:00,596
meant that this was
one book that remained

26
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:02,471
firmly shut.

27
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,804
I'm not a religious man

28
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,637
but I believe someone
sent her here

29
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:12,804
to test us.

30
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,178
Today,

31
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:42,678
I'm going to make a difference.

32
00:03:56,553 --> 00:04:00,719
Why am I waasting your time with
all this worthless titter-tatter?

33
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:05,594
Because through some misguided
care in the community scheme,

34
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:09,302
this strange creature has
become my next door neighbor.

35
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,344
May I remind you,

36
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,052
on you indicated days,

37
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,677
you are to arrive here by 9 o'clock
and work until 4:30,

38
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:33,094
with an hour for lunch and
two 15 minute breaks for tea.

39
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:38,727
This morning you are to tend
to oceanography, A thru to J,

40
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,437
which is, quite frankly, all at sea.

41
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,469
Hello.

42
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:54,260
I'm looking for
Leonardo di SerPiero Da Vinci.

43
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,135
Please, I'm technical drawings
and the like,

44
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,343
You, be so kind.

45
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,343
Leonardo da Vinci, Civil Engineering,
in brackets European history,

46
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,302
on back wall, bottom left.

47
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,718
Marvelous!
Are you a member?

48
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:11,552
No, I'm not going to take them, anyway.
I'd only lose them. Where would that get us?

49
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:15,343
May I remind you, no eating
or drinking in the library

50
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,635
and we expect
absolute silence at all times.

51
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,510
Of course you can.
Absolute!

52
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,093
Absolutely.

53
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,427
Hello. Sorry.

54
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,218
Thank you, once again.

55
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,635
Yes, sorry, don't mind...

56
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,176
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.
Absolutely!

57
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:22,259
The library will be closing
in 3 minutes, exactly.

58
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,759
Please return your books
from whence they came

59
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:29,592
and make your way to
the exit, immediately, thank you.

60
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,882
Look what I found.

61
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,132
Ahh, yes!

62
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,757
Our very own
horticultural terrorist.

63
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:05,257
That place has gone to rack and ruin
since she's moved in.

64
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:08,674
Wiil you please calm down
and leave the poor girl alone.

65
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,007
Leave her alone?
Have you seen what she's done?

66
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,132
It's nothing less than
a wanton, criminal neglect.

67
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,799
I'm Milly Wilton,

68
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:17,882
Mr. Stephenson's
long suffering daughter.

69
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,299
You took a tumble.

70
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,340
the garden fought back,
that's what.

71
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:23,632
You'll survive,
no harm done.

72
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,757
No harm done? I think harms
had an absolute bloody field day!

73
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,049
Blunt pressure!

74
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,882
Don't worry,
tea is on it's way.

75
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:41,423
Vernon!

76
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,090
Where is that damn tea?

77
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:48,215
So, young lady, what is it you do
when you're not murdering plants?

78
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,382
I work in the library.
Filing, mostly, but

79
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,632
but really, I'm a writer.

80
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,507
Oh, a writer! I see. Yes, well, that
keeps you out of the garden, doesn't it?

81
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,632
Sorry for the inconvenience.

82
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,965
Inconvenience!
What about sorry

83
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:05,382
for the unmitigated
eco-apocalypse you created?

84
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,923
Vernon, the tea!

85
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:12,590
Textbook!

86
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:16,840
Great! I hope you
enjoy making me ill.

87
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:20,131
There's only one person
responsible for your health.

88
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,298
Yes, you!

89
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Vernon!
Tea, please.

90
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,090
Ok, alright, alright,alright.
Here it is. I'm sorry.

91
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,548
Hello, Milly.

92
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,548
Alright, stop shouting.

93
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,423
Here.

94
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,840
A cup of tea.

95
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,631
Go on, they're homemade.

96
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:44,714
Right...

97
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,089
I've got to go.

98
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,131
Delicious!
Thank you.

99
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,423
85% cocoa,
that's the trick.

100
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,048
and I make them with oat bran, something
that's not so bad for His Lordship.

101
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:57,214
You look repellant in that apron
and you've been wearing it too long.

102
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:59,381
See the abuse that
I have to put up with?

103
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:02,006
If he wasn't so sick, I
wouldn't let him get away with it.

104
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:05,464
Don't speak to me like that. If you continue
speaking to me like that, I'm going to quit.

105
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,256
Oh, ho, ho! Quite the Celtic Braveheart,
aren't we, when we've got an audience!

106
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,589
He doesn't realize how important
this job is to him.

107
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:14,756
Anyway, you can start cleaning the carpet,
thanks to our unwanted guest.

108
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,506
Anytrime in the next 30 seconds.

109
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:20,131
No, no, no. I've got to go. I've
got to let the babysitter go.

110
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,839
Well, you better start
straight away, hadn't you?

111
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:52,380
For God's sake, stop

112
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,214
that Gaelic gibberish.

113
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,838
I'll do it.

114
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,255
No, it's OK, it's my job...
Go on, you'll be late.

115
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:07,672
Don't be ungracious, Vernon.
Thank the girl.

116
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:12,130
Oh, sorry, thank you. It's just that
my kids will be really worried.

117
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:19,463
Slavery was abolished in 1834,

118
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,005
just so you know.

119
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:24,047
And this country's been going
down the drain ever since.

120
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,921
Hi, Bella.

121
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,505
This is Sinead.
this is Niamph.

122
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,380
Say hi, girls!
Hi!

123
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:56,796
We've come
to cook you breakfast.

124
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,921
Well, it's the least
we can do after last night.

125
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,546
Come on, girls, Come on.
Here we go.

126
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:03,546
Here we go.

127
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:06,588
Ok, girls, will you help me
take out the ingredients?

128
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,588
Oh, it's dark in here.
Do you mind if I open these.?

129
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:13,213
Well, that's very thoughtful of you, Vernon
but there's really no need.

130
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:14,421
What, have you eaten?
No.

131
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,038
Well, it's really not a problem.

132
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,379
I'm going to get the girls picked up
here after breakfast, anyway.

133
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:22,338
So, ah, ok, let's see what
we're working with.

134
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,671
Food prison.

135
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:31,337
I really need to get ready for work.
Don't let us stop you.

136
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,796
We got it covered.
Good to go.

137
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,379
Ok, girls, you cook that up.

138
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:39,962
You take that one.

139
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:05,087
Girls, there's Bella!

140
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,712
So, what do we got here?

141
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,170
Enjoy!

142
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:19,545
You don't have to eat it all.

143
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:23,795
I do make big portions
for the big man next door.

144
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,462
Ok, there's your lift, girls.

145
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:28,378
We're out of time.
Ok.

146
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:36,962
And don't fall. Slow down!
Thanks, Jean.

147
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,962
Bye!

148
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:47,337
Does their mum
take them to school?

149
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:52,086
No, my wife passed away, so...

150
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,753
The breakfast is delicious.
Thank you.

151
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,878
Well, it's a long time
since I heard that.

152
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:02,920
You're welcome.

153
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:07,711
Your employer's a bully.
I don't know why you put up eith it.

154
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:10,711
Well, you know, you get used to it
and it pays the rent.

155
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,961
Is that him in the garden?

156
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,878
No, I can't do it.
What do you mean you can't do it?

157
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,294
Do you mind?

158
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:37,461
You may have won the hearts
of my slow-witted staff

159
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:39,044
but not me.

160
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,961
I can't forgive this.

161
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:45,753
You have squandered
everything nature has given you.

162
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,294
Why are you doing this to me?

163
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:51,544
It's something everyone must learn,
Miss Brown. It's called responsibility.

164
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:55,794
Anathema to you, perhaps but it's
an important part of the human condition.

165
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,627
And you, spuds for brains,
are late!

166
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:00,169
No, I'm not!

167
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:08,169
You are now.

168
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:12,877
I cannot tolerate tardiness,
so I won't be paying you for today.

169
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:14,461
I've had enough of this!
What?

170
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:17,669
I'm warning you, Alfie, one more word
and you can shove your job. Hear?

171
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,210
You're fired.

172
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:23,960
Okay. Will that be my
first verbal warning, then?

173
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,377
You're sacked, Vernon,
end of story.

174
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:28,585
You've heard of the
3 stage dismissal process, have you?

175
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:29,285
What?

176
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,460
So, let me see, I've been
working for you for 5 years,

177
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,372
that's a minimum of 5 months paid notice.

178
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,635
I can get you a copy of the
Employment Act if you want.

179
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,304
You'd be better off rehearsing:
"Would sir like chips with that?"

180
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:41,627
Save you time.

181
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,502
He can work for me.

182
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,502
What?
What?

183
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:49,252
You could work for me,
if you wanted to.

184
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:51,252
I do,
I do want to.

185
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,460
Yeah, I do.

186
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:58,627
Ah, so, it looks like I'm working here now.
So, you are trespassing.

187
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,835
Well, make the most of it.

188
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:04,043
You deserve each other.

189
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:09,377
We'll keep my usual payday,
first of the month, thank you.

190
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:15,751
Good!

191
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,793
I may have been
a little hasty.

192
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,751
No, no, no!
That's good, that's good.

193
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,626
It'll be a new, fresh start.

194
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,043
I don't know
how I'll pay you.

195
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,626
It's ok, he'll pay me,
so you don't have to.

196
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:41,418
I'll show that mean old man
what he's missing.

197
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:44,709
Have you already
got a cleaner?

198
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:46,668
Just me.

199
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:48,709
Alright

200
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,793
There's cleaning and
there's cleaning.

201
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,168
Eh, please don't do that.

202
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,668
There's only some things that

203
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:58,876
a professional

204
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:00,543
can spot.

205
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:04,709
Oh, my god!

206
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,334
I can't be late for work again.

207
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,251
Please don't touch anything.

208
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,126
Good.

209
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:32,834
Let's go.

210
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,375
Hello!

211
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,959
Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

212
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,125
Sculpture or architecture?

213
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,375
Oh, Sculpture, of course,
every time.

214
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,042
It's the 4th aisle
on your right, top left shelf.

215
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,167
Top left. Thank you.

216
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,708
Do you know the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa?

217
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,792
Yes, I've seen pictures.

218
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,125
You must see it in the flesh.

219
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,250
It's incredible.

220
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,417
He makes tons of marble
simply float.

221
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,875
It defies gravity with beauty.

222
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,458
It destroys logic with emotion.

223
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,041
Horticulture.

224
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,875
Sorry.

225
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,374
How is it?

226
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,374
It's wonderful.

227
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,083
Well, the vegetables haven't
been tinned for two decades, so

228
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,708
you'll actually be able to taste them.

229
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:15,083
Where did you learn
to cook like this?

230
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,624
My mum, God rest her.

231
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,083
She was a cook?
No, she couldn't cook for toffee.,

232
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:23,833
So, I had to take matters into my own hands
as soon as I could reach the stove.

233
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,708
Bella, look, there's something
I have to tell you...

234
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,749
I did your laundry today and
I threw in some of the girls' stuff

235
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:36,849
and, uh,

236
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:48,541
I think it was
this little fella to blame.

237
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,374
I'm so sorry.

238
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,999
It's ok.

239
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,499
I'll put them over here.

240
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,957
I...Sorry!

241
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,082
Give me back my cook.

242
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:16,540
Who is this?

243
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,332
Your nemesis.

244
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:22,332
Alfred Stephenson,
your next door neighbor.

245
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:25,540
Oh, hello. I'm sorry

246
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:26,832
for the inconvenience...

247
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,207
Give me back my cook!

248
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:51,873
Miss Brown?

249
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:56,748
I haven't got all day, Miss Brown!

250
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:00,040
I wasn't expecting you til the
start of the month, Mr. O'Brien.

251
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:03,206
I'm here on urgent business, Miss Brown,
a matter of great importance!

252
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:20,706
Now then, let me see,

253
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,040
Flat 2, 6 Primrose Gardens.

254
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:25,498
I have the appropriate paperwork
pertaining to the property

255
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:28,081
and the relevant
photographic documentation.

256
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,664
Ah, this is all shipshape, Miss Brown,
very soothing on the eye.

257
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:37,539
Of course.
But I've received a complaint.

258
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,914
What? From whom?

259
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,081
Oh, my word!

260
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:52,706
This is worse than I expected!

261
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,622
You agreed to keep the property
in sond repair, Miss Brown.

262
00:22:57,747 --> 00:23:00,414
This property, Miss Brown,
includes the garden.

263
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,331
I know.

264
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:07,622
I'm not much for the great outdoors,
I'm more of a...

265
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:10,122
I'm a fair man but
I am bound by the law,

266
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,164
as detailed in the contract
signed by your good self.

267
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:14,789
I have a dislike...

268
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:16,872
more of a distaste of...

269
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,831
You see, plants and I don't really
get along, so it's not really

270
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:23,289
neglect. It's more of a
fear and loathing but I

271
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:26,955
I promise you, I can fix that.
Everything will go back to normal.

272
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:29,539
The laws are there to
provide boundaries, Miss Brown.

273
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:32,747
This wanton level of neglect falls
well within your legal obligations

274
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:34,955
and you are, therefore, in breach.

275
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,039
Good morning.

276
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:39,747
I'm Vernon.
I'm Miss Brown's

277
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,247
partner.

278
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:46,489
Eugene O'Brien, landlord. We were just
discussing the spectacular level of neglect

279
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,997
relating to the
29ft north-facing garden

280
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,663
with lawns and
well stocked borders.

281
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,632
Alright, yeah, we were just
about to get into the garden.

282
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,122
Yeah, that's a major priority.
That's top of the list.

283
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:56,330
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

284
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:59,080
I shall have to ask you to
vacate by the end of the month.

285
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:02,913
Were you expecting
Mr. O'Brien this morning?

286
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:04,372
I wasn't.

287
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,788
Alright.
And you made an appointment?

288
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:09,330
I beg your pardon?
Section 34 of the Property Act:

289
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:12,497
A landlord must give clear warning
if he wants to inspect the property.

290
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:15,330
Very well, we'll come back later, then.
Too late, it's not convenient.

291
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,996
A convenient date must be mutually agreed
That's Section 17C.

292
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,080
Tomorrow then.
Tomorrow's no good.

293
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:23,163
Friday?
Friday...

294
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:25,080
No, can't do Friday.

295
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,121
Next Monday?
Next Monday's no good.

296
00:24:27,288 --> 00:24:28,288
Alright then, when?

297
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:30,871
One calendar month's notice,

298
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,746
Section 17C.

299
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:35,580
You know that.

300
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:40,121
There will be repercussions,
Miss Brown!

301
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:44,121
If this garden's not fixed,
you're out on the street.

302
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,413
You have exactly
1 month from today.

303
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,996
What's the matter?

304
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,246
I'm kidding myself. I'm no writer
and I'm certainly no gardener.

305
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,329
What are you talking about?
Of course, you're a writer.

306
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,079
No, I'm not.

307
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:11,538
And...I know I'm to be evicted and then
I'll be homeless and you'll be unemployed

308
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:13,329
and it's all my fault.

309
00:25:13,663 --> 00:25:14,787
Oh, I see.

310
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:17,121
You're feeling sorry for yourself.
No!

311
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:22,687
I mean, you have to look at the facts.
You have to weigh it out.

312
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,987
What?

313
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,621
Stand up.

314
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:29,454
Come on.

315
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:36,954
Just stay still.
I won't hurt you.

316
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:53,204
When was the last time
you were hugged?

317
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:56,870
It's been a while.

318
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,704
Alright, get on with it.

319
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,661
Lonicera aureoreticulata.

320
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,536
Honeysuckle, to you.

321
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:49,744
Though personally, I think they look better
when they're attached to the plant itself.

322
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:53,536
And look right next to it,
delphinium.

323
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:58,369
Great big iridescent blue flowers,
before you cut them up into little pieces.

324
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:04,660
I think they were the last living things
in your horticultural graveyard.

325
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,702
I was just trying
to tidy up a bit.

326
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,827
I think that's what Hitler
said about Europe.

327
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,410
Anyway, enough
of this smalltalk.

328
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:13,994
Give me back my cook!

329
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,285
What?

330
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,535
No!

331
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:19,244
Give him back,
I need him!

332
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,994
Well, you should have thought about that
before you treated him like dirt.

333
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,494
Stop... Don't act like a little girl,
give me my cook back!

334
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,910
Give him back!
I can't hear you.

335
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,327
What is wrong with you?

336
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,452
You could come
and help, you know.

337
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:40,618
Oh, I'm sorry.
I would but...hay fever,

338
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:44,827
chronic allergies.
My head swells up like a pumpkin.

339
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:47,410
I'm no use to man or beast,
I'm sorry.

340
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:48,785
There you go.

341
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,582
It may look like a
simple quiche and salad

342
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:54,535
but the balsamic reduction
and the onion glaze elevate it

343
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:58,035
to something
altogether more satisfying.

344
00:28:58,743 --> 00:28:59,910
Enjoy!

345
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,743
I didn't want to have to
spell it out to you but

346
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,784
I'm a dying man.

347
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:36,993
Unlike you,
I don't have long left.

348
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,326
Time is my enemy.

349
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:41,576
i mourn every minute.

350
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:45,951
Every precious second marks
my life draining away.

351
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,034
That's dreadful,
I had no idea.

352
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:52,701
I don't have much to give me comfort,
no friend, no family, no one to love

353
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,993
I only have the beauty of nature

354
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,326
and the promise of
a hearty last meal.

355
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:02,784
I beg you,
send Vernon home to me

356
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,326
and we can put all this
silly mess behind us.

357
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:09,326
I had no idea you were so ill,
I'm so sorry but I can talk...

358
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:12,492
What are you doing?
Don't listen to that.

359
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,451
He's dying!
Why didn't you tell me?

360
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,826
The old coot's been dying
for the last 10 years.

361
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:18,951
Vernon!

362
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,617
Ok, let me guess.
Was it, ehm...

363
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:24,992
"Time is my enemy,

364
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,450
I mourn every minute,
I mourn every second", or

365
00:30:29,617 --> 00:30:33,075
was it: "I have no friends,
I have no family,

366
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:35,159
I have nothing...nothing."?

367
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:37,575
He used both.

368
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:40,325
Oh, hey, so
he's getting desperate.

369
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,033
Perfect.

370
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:23,491
It's shut.

371
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:25,450
It's bloody shut!

372
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:55,574
Sorry, Miss Bramble. Problem
with the buses this morning...

373
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:58,908
I think the problem is with you,
not with public transport

374
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:03,449
and I wouldn't be making this point if
your tardiness was not pathological.

375
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,366
So sorry!
I hate to interrupt.

376
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,408
Looking Hercu Lampana.

377
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:09,783
Lamparna.

378
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:14,116
Architecture, back wall
on your right, third shelf down.

379
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:15,366
Thank you.

380
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:17,824
We also have a book
on his early illustrations.

381
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:19,866
That's exactly
what I'm looking for.

382
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:21,282
Thank you so much.

383
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:22,741
You're welcome.

384
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,991
Goodbye, Miss.
Thank you again for earlier.

385
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,074
It's nothing, really.

386
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,574
What's your name, by the way?
I don't know what to call you.

387
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:43,866
Bella.

388
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:45,407
Bella Brown.

389
00:32:45,574 --> 00:32:49,324
Well, I'm William, William Tranter
but everyone calls me Billy.

390
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,115
See you soon, Bella.

391
00:32:57,282 --> 00:32:58,324
Billy.

392
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,199
Billy Tranter.

393
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:18,698
Excuse me, young lady.

394
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:26,323
Would you be so kind as to point me to
the section that deals with home cookery?

395
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:31,407
Certainly, sir. It's the 3rd aisle on
your left, lower 2 shelves on your right.

396
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:32,823
Thank you, very helpful.

397
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,115
We have recently received
Walker Owen's latest:

398
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,240
"Dinner for one",

399
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:42,907
A simple joy and classic
simple recipes for solo dining,

400
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:45,365
which is always popular.

401
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:46,823
Thank you, very helpful.

402
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,490
We do try to
be of assistance.

403
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:52,073
Well, the best assistance would be
to give me back my bloody Irishman,

404
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,031
you heartless...

405
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:56,906
This library is a
refuge for learning

406
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,240
and requires silence
at all times!

407
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,115
Oh, learning!? Well then,
how is it that your employees

408
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:05,406
have learned nothing of
compassion for their starving fellow man?

409
00:34:05,573 --> 00:34:07,487
For the hungry, aging, decrepit,

410
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:10,090
the forgotten generation
that made this country great!

411
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,198
Get out!

412
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:14,114
Get out immediately or
I am calling the police.

413
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:15,948
Excellent!
Have her arrested.

414
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:18,948
She murders flora that
keep this planet alive.

415
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:20,156
Be silent and leave!

416
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:46,072
I'd stick to writing
if I were you.

417
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,906
Well, just tell me what I should be doing,
you horrid, wretched old man!

418
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:52,781
Why should I furnish you
with that advice?

419
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:55,031
I've got 3 weeks to
turn this garden round

420
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:57,447
or I'll wind up
sleeping in the park!

421
00:34:57,614 --> 00:34:58,531
Everything ok?

422
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:03,447
I am trying my best here.
I want to make a difference

423
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:05,058
and if you had
an ounce of humanity,

424
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,697
you wouldn't just stand there gloating,
you would help me!

425
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,072
Alright, I'll help.

426
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,447
You will?
Yes, while you give me back my cook.

427
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:16,647
No!
Yes!

428
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,989
He's not a slave!
He's not mine to give.

429
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:21,447
If you had treated him
like a person...

430
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:24,989
Ok, ok, ok, I'll cook your meals,
you vituperative old bastard!

431
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,197
Excellent.

432
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:30,364
And 5 syllables, Vernon!
I didn't know you had it in you.

433
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,697
But I won't set foot
inside the house.

434
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,905
But I'm not going to eat scraps
out of a plastic container

435
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:38,363
like some trainspotter on
a windy platform in Runcorn.

436
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,697
I'll cook your meals. You help her
fix up the garden. That way, we all win

437
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,072
Take it or leave it, Alfred.

438
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:48,572
I'll take it.

439
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:13,946
Ok, house rules: breakfast at 8,
lunch at 1, dinner at 8.

440
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:16,613
Meals will be left here
at exactly those times

441
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,446
and then I'm going to ring this bell twice,
so you know you can retrieve them.

442
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,260
I'll leave serving instructions,
if necessary,

443
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,363
so I don't have to hear
your voice or see your face.

444
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,863
Yes but what if...

445
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,113
Creating a garden
starts as an interest

446
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:43,446
and soon becomes
a lifetime's obsession.

447
00:36:44,238 --> 00:36:47,071
One that can be engaged
on a moment's notice,

448
00:36:49,196 --> 00:36:51,988
by simply stepping outside.

449
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:25,154
"A true gardener can
create more happiness

450
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:30,445
propogating life in one seed
and seeing that single flower unfold,

451
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:35,279
than a rich man could ever get
from his perfect, rolling lawns."

452
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:39,445
I've never known him to let
that book out of his sight before.

453
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:49,987
Thank you so much
for the book.

454
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:52,112
I love the illustrations.

455
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,404
You read it?
Every word.

456
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,320
So what are you talking
to me for?

457
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:58,862
Get to work or
O'Brien will have you out.

458
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,445
What now?

459
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:21,653
Now, you dig.

460
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,070
Vernon!

461
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,820
Can you hear me?

462
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:47,945
What?

463
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,403
No black pudding with my breakfast,
this morning, my Irish friend.

464
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:55,861
Yeah, fine!

465
00:39:06,403 --> 00:39:07,903
Did you read the book?

466
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:09,319
I did.

467
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,736
What's this?

468
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,194
Soil.

469
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:19,361
If you leave the roots
of the weeds in the soil,

470
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,028
they'll grow back before
you even finish digging.

471
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,569
They'll strangle the life
out of your new creation.

472
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:28,319
It's just like a time bomb
waiting to go off.

473
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,652
Dig it all again

474
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:32,861
and sieve out the roots.

475
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,110
I need my bed.

476
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:30,193
About bloody time, a man
could die of starvation in this place.

477
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:50,326
Billy!
Bella!

478
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:52,068
Silence!

479
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:54,068
Sorry.

480
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,860
You know, I believe
those things you said.

481
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:15,235
Why would you say that?

482
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:19,776
Vernon told me how many times
he's heard the exact same stories.

483
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:22,026
Shame on you.

484
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,276
You should doubt only a
man who changes his story.

485
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,734
I only repeat myself in
the vague hope that one day,

486
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:33,943
somebody will actually hear me.

487
00:41:39,526 --> 00:41:41,234
Breathtaking, isn't it?

488
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:43,484
Come. Come, come.

489
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:49,651
Like sparks falling
from a giant furnace.

490
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:54,026
In some countries, they hold parties
when it starts to rain.

491
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:58,692
But here, we just scurry around
and run for cover.

492
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:04,234
It's the most important
currency in the world.

493
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:09,151
and yet in our green and pleasant land,
where we take so much for granted,

494
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:14,275
we see it only as a means
of ruining expensive hairdos

495
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:17,109
and making taxi drivers rich.

496
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,025
You're odd.

497
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,150
Says she.

498
00:42:26,317 --> 00:42:27,275
Here.

499
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:32,692
Helianthus.

500
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:34,567
Giant sunflower.

501
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:38,650
Start off with them,
they're incredibly beautiful.

502
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:42,150
They need a lot of light and heat.

503
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:47,025
They follow the arc of
the sun from dawn until dusk,

504
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:50,692
extracting maximum energy
from every day.

505
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,108
It's a very...
a very clever flower.

506
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:58,025
Think about that.

507
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:40,024
I think there might
be a garden here, after all.

508
00:43:41,941 --> 00:43:45,941
Arthur's book, it's gripping.
Where did you get it?

509
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,733
He was a friend of mine.

510
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:52,566
Dear old Arthur showed me the path
to true enlightenment

511
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:55,108
and then took me on
an incredible journey.

512
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:58,066
Look after it, it's
the only one I've got.

513
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:01,858
i am amazed you trust me with it.
So am I.

514
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,191
I bet even Arthur would have
been daunted by this garden.

515
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:08,441
No, he would
have relished it.

516
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:13,691
A totally blank canvas, a chance
to create your own masterpiece.

517
00:44:15,149 --> 00:44:16,316
Come.

518
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:18,191
Come on, follow me.

519
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,774
How do we make a garden?

520
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:32,232
How do we
build a color palette?

521
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:34,857
How do we create
depth and texture?

522
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:37,690
How do we keep interest
from April to October?

523
00:44:37,857 --> 00:44:39,649
Well, we start with these

524
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:44,357
stunning foxgloves
and these alliums.

525
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:46,482
Come on.
Come, come, come.

526
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:54,190
And run to these camas,

527
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:57,524
and dahlias, so colorful,
it hurts your eyes

528
00:44:58,107 --> 00:45:00,982
and these gloriously
purple salvias

529
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:04,523
that go on flowering until
the frost claims them.

530
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,398
Then the verbascum

531
00:45:07,565 --> 00:45:09,982
and the evening primrose,

532
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:13,773
and those deliciously green
shuttlecock ferns.

533
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,732
Look, clambering,
climbing clamatis.

534
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:22,648
Sweet rocket and look,

535
00:45:24,398 --> 00:45:25,523
these monkswood,

536
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,148
so beautiful and poisonous,
they'll kill a man.

537
00:45:29,315 --> 00:45:31,815
That's an interesting contradiction,
isn't it?

538
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,940
That lily, golden splendor.

539
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,356
Persicaria.

540
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:40,523
Nicotiana.

541
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,731
Hollyhocks. Come.

542
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:49,231
The pogonias.

543
00:45:50,023 --> 00:45:52,148
Magnificent agapanthus.

544
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:53,481
and well,

545
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:55,231
the list

546
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:57,273
is endless.

547
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:00,023
It's a world of

548
00:46:01,356 --> 00:46:03,481
beautifully ordered chaos.

549
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:06,273
No, no, that's chaos,
not calamity, Miss Brown.

550
00:46:06,439 --> 00:46:10,564
because if you don't understand the
difference, we won't go very far.

551
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:12,356
We?

552
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:14,648
What?

553
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,273
You said "we".

554
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:17,856
That's ridiculous.

555
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:24,313
2 weeks to turn this
into a garden.

556
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:50,397
Bella?

557
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:53,105
Is everything all right?

558
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:55,855
Yes, of course.
I'm just burning some steam.

559
00:47:56,188 --> 00:47:57,438
I see.

560
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,855
So, what brings you here?

561
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:05,146
I come here every Sunday.

562
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:08,896
I see. To scream and shout
for next whole week.

563
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:13,730
Yes and to feed Sid.

564
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:15,730
Which one's Sid?

565
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,313
The scruffy one.

566
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:22,188
Well, I bet he was a looker
in his day.

567
00:48:22,771 --> 00:48:23,938
Mm, he was.

568
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:29,104
Do you just work?

569
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:34,521
No, goodness, no. I just come to
sketch, doodle, think, work things out.

570
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:38,021
I invent things.
I'm a designer.

571
00:48:38,188 --> 00:48:40,646
Numbers and working parts,
that's my specialty.

572
00:48:40,813 --> 00:48:43,479
My ideas, they sort of come out
faster than I can cope, sometimes.

573
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:45,479
A pure left-brainer.

574
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:47,021
I'm more of a no-brainer.

575
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:49,437
I don't believe that
for a second.

576
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:53,937
You seem to know so much,
every book, every author of every shelf.

577
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:56,937
I'm really working there
until my book is published.

578
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:00,062
Oh, how exciting!
What's it about?

579
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,062
It's a childrens' book
but it doesn't really

580
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:07,146
well, what I mean is

581
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,771
it doesn't really have a story
at the moment.

582
00:49:11,146 --> 00:49:12,479
A novel?

583
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:17,229
Eh, sorry. Tea?

584
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:20,979
Thank you.

585
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,270
I like your mechanical bird thing.

586
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,145
How on earth
do you know about that?

587
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:39,687
The other day in the library,
you left a piece of paper.

588
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,229
Right. Yes, I see.

589
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:45,145
My mechanical bird thing, yes.

590
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,937
well, I really ought to...

591
00:49:49,103 --> 00:49:50,770
Would you like to see it?

592
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:53,978
My bird thing.

593
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:56,953
Well, I only live a few minutes away.
It's not far. Well, I really shouldn't.

594
00:49:57,023 --> 00:49:59,862
No one else has seen it yet.
No one else has been invited

595
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:00,962
No, I really shouldn't.

596
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:03,437
It would be rude to say no.

597
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:08,687
I suppose I...
Excellent!

598
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:10,145
Come on.

599
00:50:10,395 --> 00:50:12,103
I'm just down here.

600
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,311
Here we are!
Wow!

601
00:50:32,436 --> 00:50:34,353
After my parents died,

602
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,895
They left George the townhouse.
Edward got the cottage, and I got this.

603
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:39,395
It's incredible.

604
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:42,978
Part of the joy's being the eldest.
I got first pick.

605
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:45,978
Here we go.

606
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:51,269
Now...

607
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:56,936
This is Sergis,
he's particularly interesting.

608
00:50:57,103 --> 00:51:01,269
I made the body of a tortoise
but with the engine of a hare.

609
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,561
Still needs some work, though.

610
00:51:07,394 --> 00:51:08,353
And over here...

611
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:15,227
Now for the main event!

612
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:18,269
This.

613
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:21,519
This is Luna.

614
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:38,310
She's powered by light.

615
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:41,477
Solar powered?
Even moonlight.

616
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,394
Hence, Luna.

617
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,727
Hence, Luna.

618
00:51:56,977 --> 00:51:58,310
I love her!

619
00:51:58,685 --> 00:52:00,144
I'm so glad.

620
00:52:01,644 --> 00:52:05,269
well, you're the writer better.
Tell me a story about Luna.

621
00:52:11,685 --> 00:52:13,602
Luna couldn't always fly,
you know.

622
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:16,602
Well, why not?

623
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:19,643
Well,

624
00:52:20,643 --> 00:52:23,477
long ago, before
the world was round,

625
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:28,643
Luna and the rest of her species
inhabited a remote forest.

626
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:30,727
They had...

627
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:32,977
tiny little wings

628
00:52:33,727 --> 00:52:35,768
but were flightless.

629
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,101
They foraged around
on the forest floor

630
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:43,976
and kept themselves
very much to themselves.

631
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:51,685
Luna lost her parents
at a very early age.

632
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:58,060
They were taken from Luna

633
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,226
just like that,

634
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,768
no explanation.

635
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:09,934
Barely out of the nest,
she was too young to know anything.

636
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:14,809
She was such a worrier.

637
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:20,151
only coming out for food briefly when
all the other animals had gone to sleep

638
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:25,934
and the forest floor
was bathed in moonlight.

639
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:31,434
She was such a
scrawny little thing,

640
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:34,767
a loner

641
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:41,184
Well, life was passing by

642
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,226
until one day
Luna saw a kindly traveler

643
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:52,517
holding a thing of great
wonder and beauty and...

644
00:53:55,642 --> 00:53:56,892
Then what?

645
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,725
and that's it, for now.

646
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,434
But I'd like to know
what happens next.

647
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,434
So do I.

648
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,892
Are you kicking me,
Mr. Stephenson?

649
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:25,392
No.

650
00:54:25,684 --> 00:54:28,433
I'm encouraging
you to get up.

651
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:32,475
If you ignore my encouragement,
then I'll start kicking you.

652
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:35,475
This garden is taking forever.

653
00:54:36,642 --> 00:54:39,475
everything that matters
takes time.

654
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,808
You can speed read but
you can't speed garden.

655
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:45,100
try telling that to O'Brien.

656
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,392
Look at that.
Look!

657
00:54:52,683 --> 00:54:53,933
What's that?

658
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,683
It's called
fragaria virginiana.

659
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:58,725
It's a wild strawberry.

660
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:05,225
Life, nature, it's just waiting to
burst out anywhere it can,

661
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:08,808
seeking the light and
getting on with it.

662
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:10,391
It's very simple.

663
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,850
It must have been buried
under a ton of rubbish.

664
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:18,100
Isn't it always like that?

665
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:10,849
I should have warned you,
laundry was never Vernon's strong point.

666
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:13,849
I've got something for you.

667
00:56:14,016 --> 00:56:16,341
Queen Victoria wore
more color than you.

668
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,807
I always feel I'm at a funeral
when you are around.

669
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:20,141
Charming.

670
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:23,432
So, have you given
this much thought?

671
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,765
well, it should get about
5 hours of sunlight a day.

672
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:28,390
and given at the
minimum depth of 2ft, the lilies

673
00:56:28,557 --> 00:56:32,640
and other aquatic plants were the ones
filled out and all the way around

674
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,932
and Vernon's going to help
with the filter and the pump.

675
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,015
what's he going to do,
cover them in puff pastry?

676
00:56:37,932 --> 00:56:40,265
How quickly do you think
we can put the fish in?

677
00:56:40,432 --> 00:56:43,057
Well, personally, I would wait
until there was water in there.

678
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:44,974
Approximately how soon?

679
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,640
Miss Brown! Yes?
Just dig.

680
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,223
Well, you're much better.

681
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,348
Yes, well, that's because I take
all that unnecessary medication

682
00:57:02,515 --> 00:57:04,182
that you force-feed me.

683
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:06,382
Aha!

684
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:08,515
What is that?
Room service.

685
00:57:08,682 --> 00:57:11,182
Breakfast is in the shed.
Come on, hurry.

686
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:18,765
Oh, hello, Milly.

687
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:21,681
This is the most bizarrething
I've ever seen.

688
00:57:21,848 --> 00:57:24,348
Well, it's the only way
he's going to eat my food.

689
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:28,681
His Lordship would like to know
if there's any black pudding.

690
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:29,723
No.

691
00:57:30,473 --> 00:57:32,473
Tell him we ran out

692
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,181
And it's bad for his
cholesterol, anyway.

693
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:37,640
You, of all people,
should know that.

694
00:57:39,348 --> 00:57:41,348
But don't you dare
tell him I said that.

695
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:51,973
Are you going to explain what's
going on? No!

696
00:58:08,306 --> 00:58:09,848
Mr. Stephenson.

697
00:58:10,014 --> 00:58:10,889
Yes?

698
00:58:11,056 --> 00:58:13,556
May I ask you a personal question?
No.

699
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,472
Please.
No.

700
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:17,806
Ask me one, then.

701
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,597
Definitely not.

702
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:20,639
Why not?

703
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:23,431
I don't want to trod around in
your little obsessive little world

704
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:25,347
any more than I have to.

705
00:58:25,514 --> 00:58:26,722
I'm speechless.

706
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:29,722
If only that were true.
Now, shut up and dig.

707
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:31,806
I can't.

708
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:33,181
Why not?

709
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:36,222
It's done.

710
00:58:39,347 --> 00:58:40,347
Well?

711
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:42,139
Well what?

712
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,847
Aren't you going to thank me
for all my hard work?

713
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:49,222
You'll come for tea at 4 o'clock.

714
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,222
This is beautiful.

715
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,347
Fantastic.

716
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,680
When I was younger, I
did a lot of travelling.

717
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,680
I collected seeds

718
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,888
from the most spectacular plants.

719
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:25,388
Each one is from
a different country.

720
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:29,013
A different color,
a different smell

721
00:59:31,472 --> 00:59:33,763
and most importantly,

722
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:36,222
different memory.

723
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:39,680
I spend my days breathing life

724
00:59:39,846 --> 00:59:42,138
into these wonderful things.

725
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:50,263
Where are these from?
Iran.

726
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:53,180
I found them
on a mountainside

727
00:59:53,346 --> 00:59:54,513
overlooking the sea.

728
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,263
Will you tell me about them?

729
00:59:58,305 --> 00:59:59,680
Ah, here, here!

730
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,680
Take these.

731
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:04,305
They're rather old, fine quality.

732
01:00:04,471 --> 01:00:05,471
Do them justice.

733
01:00:05,971 --> 01:00:07,263
But I...
I don't really know how...

734
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,804
Don't think. Just do.

735
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:14,054
So, where was I?

736
01:00:15,596 --> 01:00:17,929
Iran.
Oh, yes!

737
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:23,721
In the province of Mazandaran,
on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea.

738
01:00:23,888 --> 01:00:26,221
Which is, in fact, the
world's biggest lake.

739
01:00:26,388 --> 01:00:29,721
Which is, in fact, your last
interruption, young lady.

740
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:33,721
I was walking through a field
that seemed endless,

741
01:00:33,888 --> 01:00:35,304
all around was this

742
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:39,179
blanket of deep red peonies.

743
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,221
Well, anyway,
let me go back.

744
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:47,762
It was July when I arrived in Tehran.
It was bloody hot.

745
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:51,596
It was very grand
in those days, Tehran.

746
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:12,137
This is disgraceful.

747
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:15,054
I'm so sorry.
Very rude of me.

748
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:18,054
Ham and piccalilly.
It's delicious.

749
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,220
I don't want your sandwich.
No?

750
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,095
Oh, then, really?
You must have a pickled egg!

751
01:01:24,262 --> 01:01:26,095
You can gather your things
together and get out.

752
01:01:34,553 --> 01:01:35,553
Leave the book!

753
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:41,928
Don't think I can't see what's going on
between you two. Disgusting.

754
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:44,535
Thank you so much for those
art recommendations, really.

755
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,345
Inspiring stuff, especially the bird...

756
01:01:46,512 --> 01:01:48,428
Get out! Get out!

757
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:58,595
Bella, hello,

758
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:01,220
Just wanted to say I'm sorry
if I caused you trouble

759
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:02,886
with the old windbag.

760
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,928
It's a pity you got
chucked out when you did.

761
01:02:06,095 --> 01:02:09,261
I found some fantastic
Viking drawings

762
01:02:09,428 --> 01:02:11,136
which I thought
would be great for Luna.

763
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:13,261
Well, you can
always show me now.

764
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:16,553
No!

765
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:23,636
No, I couldn't. Fraternizing
with the enemy is bad enough

766
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:25,345
but I, eh, no, I...

767
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:34,219
Pink wafers!

768
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:37,844
They're Miss Bramble's biscuits.

769
01:02:39,678 --> 01:02:41,178
Delicious.

770
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:45,678
So, what happens to Luna?

771
01:02:55,428 --> 01:02:59,927
Mesmerized, Luna couldn't
help but think about the peony.

772
01:03:00,094 --> 01:03:03,386
Luna asked the traveler where
he got the beautiful flower.

773
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:06,427
"There are many," the traveler said.

774
01:03:07,136 --> 01:03:09,177
"From the top
of the mountain,

775
01:03:09,344 --> 01:03:11,761
you can see thousands,

776
01:03:13,594 --> 01:03:15,636
"A sea of petals.

777
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:21,177
It will make your heart sing,
for it's a beautiful sight"

778
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:26,802
But how will I get
to the top of the mountain?

779
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,344
I can't fly and
I only come out at night.

780
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,802
But the traveler
had heard this before.

781
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:36,010
"You seek the rarest flower

782
01:03:36,177 --> 01:03:38,969
from the top of the
tallest mountain in the world.

783
01:03:39,844 --> 01:03:42,927
If you want to see them enough,

784
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:45,969
you will."

785
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:48,760
Luna was scared

786
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:51,427
and excited,
in equal measure.

787
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,968
I think I will find my
mother and father there.

788
01:03:58,552 --> 01:04:02,302
The traveler smiled.
"You have much to learn, child.

789
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:06,218
Are you sure want to
continue on this perilous quest?"

790
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:13,260
Keep going.

791
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:17,635
I don't know
what happens next.

792
01:04:18,135 --> 01:04:20,093
But I must know the ending.

793
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:31,760
You will have tea
with me tomorrow?

794
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,426
After work.

795
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:36,135
Yes, please.

796
01:04:37,426 --> 01:04:38,926
That would be lovely.

797
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:52,509
Well, til tomorrow,
Bella Brown.

798
01:04:53,259 --> 01:04:56,634
Under the old cedar tree
in the park, 6 o'clock.

799
01:05:12,843 --> 01:05:14,593
Bella, wake up.

800
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:17,926
Billy...

801
01:05:18,842 --> 01:05:21,134
It's not Billy, it's bliss.

802
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:22,426
It's Vernon.

803
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:27,676
Come on.

804
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:34,217
I have work at 9.

805
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:40,717
Billy is his name, yeah?

806
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:43,759
He's wonderful, Vernon.

807
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:45,259
I seeing him again, tonight.

808
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:49,592
What does Mr. Wonderful do?

809
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:52,175
He invents mechanical animals

810
01:05:52,342 --> 01:05:55,050
and he makes me
feel like I can fly.

811
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:56,967
So, he's got prospects, then.

812
01:05:57,467 --> 01:05:58,800
See you later!

813
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,508
What?

814
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:32,550
You're fired.

815
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,842
But Luna knew

816
01:06:39,008 --> 01:06:43,092
that whatever obstacle stood in her way,
her quest could not fail.

817
01:06:43,925 --> 01:06:45,925
She had been
greatly inspired

818
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,466
by the words of the
wonderful traveler.

819
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:51,133
He would stand by her.

820
01:07:43,007 --> 01:07:44,882
Come on, Bella.
What's wrong?

821
01:07:45,382 --> 01:07:47,049
I don't feel well.

822
01:08:00,924 --> 01:08:02,091
Ah, my son,

823
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,716
how long since
your last confession?

824
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,174
Bella's ill.

825
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:08,632
What's wrong with her?

826
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:09,965
I don't know.

827
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,465
She should snap out of it.

828
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:17,007
Alright. Well, I'll be sure to pass on
your words of sympathy and support.

829
01:08:21,132 --> 01:08:23,007
Come on, Bella,
what's wrong?

830
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:30,882
Come on, whatever's happening
with Mr. Mechanical Genius,

831
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:33,715
you've got to get
this garden finished.

832
01:08:34,382 --> 01:08:36,674
O'Brien's going to be here Monday.

833
01:08:39,382 --> 01:08:43,923
Ok Bella, I've got a pan au chocolat here
and I'm going to eat it here without a plate

834
01:08:45,173 --> 01:08:47,882
Yeah, there is no plate here.

835
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,423
Ok, well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

836
01:08:52,048 --> 01:08:55,257
The plate's gone warm
on the carpet here.

837
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,798
Leave me alone, please.

838
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:05,340
How's the patient?

839
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:12,590
It's more than medicine can fix unless
you've got something for a broken heart.

840
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:16,548
I can have a word with her
if you think it might help.

841
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:20,431
But gently does it, yeah?

842
01:09:20,673 --> 01:09:21,881
Yes, of course.

843
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:25,381
Bella, open the bloody door!

844
01:09:26,673 --> 01:09:29,465
Don't make me ask you again!

845
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:42,339
You look a mess!

846
01:09:42,506 --> 01:09:43,631
Alfie!

847
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:47,506
Vernon, give us a
couple of minutes.

848
01:09:47,923 --> 01:09:49,048
Why don't you go and

849
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:53,714
rustle up some of that nonexistent black
pudding that I saw in the kitchen just now.

850
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:56,589
Okay then.

851
01:10:02,047 --> 01:10:04,172
I brought you a present.

852
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:18,006
Ask me that personal question.

853
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:21,881
Anything you like.

854
01:10:27,672 --> 01:10:29,797
Have you ever been in love?

855
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,297
She was called Rose.

856
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,089
She was a free spirit.

857
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:43,547
She said I was a stuffed shirt.

858
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,255
You fell in love?
Yes.

859
01:10:49,339 --> 01:10:51,505
It took about 20 minutes.

860
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:54,380
It took her a bit longer.

861
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,214
You were happy together?

862
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,463
As happy as two people can be,
I think.

863
01:11:06,047 --> 01:11:08,797
She well and truly
unstuffed the shirt.

864
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:13,297
Then we traveled everywhere.

865
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:15,630
We shared everything.

866
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:18,880
She was a horticulturist.

867
01:11:19,047 --> 01:11:20,422
The best.

868
01:11:23,505 --> 01:11:25,213
She wrote the book?

869
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,838
Yeah, she did.

870
01:11:27,546 --> 01:11:32,088
She thought that Arthur Mildmay
sounded more credible than Rose Milton.

871
01:11:32,546 --> 01:11:35,880
In those days,
it was impossible to publish

872
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,838
a female horticulturist.

873
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:39,588
But

874
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:45,296
she was a bright spark and
if she believed in something,

875
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:47,755
she gave it all she had.

876
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,546
She taught me

877
01:11:51,713 --> 01:11:53,755
how to live..

878
01:11:57,588 --> 01:11:58,963
and then...

879
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:02,254
she died, all of a sudden,
in childbirth.

880
01:12:04,713 --> 01:12:07,088
It was many years ago

881
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:10,629
but with no warning,

882
01:12:11,713 --> 01:12:14,504
just gone. Both of them.

883
01:12:16,963 --> 01:12:20,171
But the garden soon
helped me to cope.

884
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:26,462
Rose had a passion for life

885
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,837
and I see the seeds of that in you

886
01:12:31,087 --> 01:12:34,879
and it upsets me greatly
to see you lying here,

887
01:12:35,046 --> 01:12:37,129
withering on the vine.

888
01:12:37,462 --> 01:12:39,671
So, I say,

889
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:43,587
I say grasp the metal,
you stupid girl

890
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:46,629
and stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

891
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,129
You're right.

892
01:12:48,296 --> 01:12:49,796
I am stupid.

893
01:12:51,087 --> 01:12:54,712
Stupid enough to fall for
a liar and a cheat.

894
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,545
I had thought
he actually cared.

895
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,087
Did you know

896
01:13:16,254 --> 01:13:19,087
I represented my country
at clay pigeon shooting?

897
01:13:20,587 --> 01:13:21,712
No.

898
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:25,462
Well, this boy
you're talking about,

899
01:13:26,045 --> 01:13:27,837
this robot builder,

900
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:31,712
I think I may
have to shoot him.

901
01:13:42,712 --> 01:13:44,253
Then one night,

902
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,295
alone in the forest,

903
01:13:48,378 --> 01:13:51,961
Luna resolved to find
the magic flowers herself,

904
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:55,961
even if it meant
confronting terrifying demons.

905
01:13:56,336 --> 01:13:59,503
She had nothing
left to lose.

906
01:14:23,294 --> 01:14:25,544
What the hell is she doing?

907
01:14:50,294 --> 01:14:52,294
Everything else is wrecked.

908
01:14:54,711 --> 01:14:57,377
We'll never fix it in time.

909
01:15:04,002 --> 01:15:08,461
I don't care about your hay fever.
We've got work to do.

910
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:10,336
Here she comes.

911
01:15:11,877 --> 01:15:16,044
You know, I told you that in some parts
of the world, they celebrate when it rains.

912
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:21,335
Well, we think it would be healthy if
we celebrated this little storm too.

913
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:23,710
Celebrate?

914
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,210
The garden's ruined.
I'm ruined.

915
01:15:26,377 --> 01:15:28,544
Oh, it's been
the making of you, Bella.

916
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:30,661
Trees blew down,
hedges blew down

917
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:33,710
but you saved the one thing
that needed to be saved.

918
01:15:34,085 --> 01:15:37,210
Anyway, enough of this!
We think you should have a day off.

919
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:39,377
Yeah, our treat.

920
01:15:40,919 --> 01:15:42,877
I'm not exactly in the mood.
Oh, come on,

921
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:44,627
have the day to yourself.
Cheer yourself up.

922
01:15:45,335 --> 01:15:46,460
So, off you go.

923
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,868
You're both mad.

924
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:50,627
People in glass houses bad.

925
01:15:51,252 --> 01:15:54,127
Well, that's settled, then. So,
off you go. Milly will go with you.

926
01:15:54,293 --> 01:15:56,752
Anything to keep that doctor
away from me.

927
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,501
To the left.
<i>You'll always hear me</i>

928
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:18,101
<i>singing a song.
Show me the way to go home</i>

929
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,418
Oh, perfect!

930
01:16:19,793 --> 01:16:22,126
It's very dark in here.

931
01:16:32,543 --> 01:16:33,751
What's this?

932
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:41,168
Hello, Bella.

933
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:43,168
Hi, Bella!
Hi, Bella!

934
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:46,334
What a new day to get
the pond ready for the fish.

935
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,834
It's wonderful.
Come on, come on.

936
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:52,834
Alright, look at this. Some of these
for you and some for you.

937
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:56,959
Some for you, if you want.
Alright, now just feed the fish.

938
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:00,459
Make sure they don't
bite your hands off.

939
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:08,042
Oh, they're just beautiful!

940
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,251
She been drinking?
Yes.

941
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:15,126
Be nice to her.
Of course.

942
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:16,667
Ok, alright, come on.
Sit down, everybody.

943
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,751
Who else wants a drink?

944
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:20,951
Oh, please!

945
01:17:21,151 --> 01:17:22,151
Here we go!

946
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:45,792
You didn't have to do this.

947
01:17:46,054 --> 01:17:47,642
Thank you, again.

948
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:51,000
The pleasure, Miss Brown,
is all mine.

949
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,500
I am so honored you gave me
that book. Now I know the story.

950
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:56,709
No, I only lent it to you.

951
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,542
When I'm pushing up the daisies,
then you can have it.

952
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:01,334
In that case,
I don't want it.

953
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,417
Care to dance?

954
01:18:05,917 --> 01:18:07,542
Oh, don't be stupid!

955
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,583
Do you think
this is good enough?

956
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:45,875
We're about to find out,
Miss Brown.

957
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,791
Excuse me!

958
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,583
Eugene O'Brien, the landlord.

959
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:03,291
Miss Brown is popular with
the male of the species.

960
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:05,583
Bella!

961
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,999
Ah, Mr. O'Brien!
Welcome. Come on through.

962
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,374
Vernon Kelly, the
tenant's boyfriend.

963
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:20,124
What?

964
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:24,183
I'm impressed and
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

965
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:27,958
Obviously, I received no written request
for the insertion of a water feature

966
01:19:27,973 --> 01:19:29,207
and the keeping of livestock

967
01:19:29,374 --> 01:19:30,999
but I'm prepared to overlook it,

968
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,291
given the estimated work on the table.
Ok, great! Well, I'll overlook that

969
01:19:34,582 --> 01:19:38,124
and that only leaves one matter
outstanding, the rent increase.

970
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:39,249
What are you talking about?
What rent increase?

971
01:19:39,332 --> 01:19:41,582
If she wants to stay,
she'll have to pay an increased figure

972
01:19:41,749 --> 01:19:45,374
in line with the new market value,
Section 23 of the contract, watertight.

973
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:49,249
That's why our legal system is
revered the world over.

974
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:50,957
I can forward you
the same paperwork, if you like.

975
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:53,749
This is her home now. She's done all
this work. You can't just do that.

976
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:56,374
Allow me to talk to Mr. O'Brien.
What are you doing here?

977
01:19:56,832 --> 01:19:58,124
Come on.

978
01:20:06,624 --> 01:20:08,290
He won't be
bothering Bella again.

979
01:20:08,832 --> 01:20:10,707
Why?
What did you say to him?

980
01:20:11,915 --> 01:20:13,207
Who are you?

981
01:20:13,665 --> 01:20:15,874
I'm Billy.
I'm looking for Bella.

982
01:20:16,124 --> 01:20:18,582
She's not expecting me,
I'm a few days late.

983
01:20:21,665 --> 01:20:25,540
Married? Of course not I'm not married.
Why does she think that?

984
01:20:25,707 --> 01:20:28,165
She saw you
all over some woman.

985
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:30,332
Yes, you stood her up,
you weasel.

986
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:33,873
I told you
I had an accident.

987
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,415
That's why I couldn't be there.
I've been in hospital.

988
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,957
I couldn't get her number.

989
01:20:39,123 --> 01:20:40,915
You got her address.

990
01:20:41,082 --> 01:20:43,832
I got it this morning
from the...

991
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,957
from the
Adopted Duck Society.

992
01:20:50,873 --> 01:20:53,123
The Adopted Duck Society?

993
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:55,415
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend, alright?

994
01:20:57,123 --> 01:20:58,373
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

995
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,998
Why didn't you call her?

996
01:21:00,706 --> 01:21:02,581
He's already answered that.

997
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:07,540
I know that. I'm trying to test him out
to see if he changes his answer.

998
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,790
What are your intentions
toward Bella?

999
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:14,498
I like her very much.

1000
01:21:14,706 --> 01:21:17,540
I appreciate that
you two are close family,

1001
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,783
but really, I think I'd rather
tell Bella to her face

1002
01:21:19,827 --> 01:21:21,581
before you two
interrogate me any further.

1003
01:21:22,373 --> 01:21:23,789
William Tranter!

1004
01:21:24,623 --> 01:21:27,039
You have embarrassed
and humiliated me.

1005
01:21:27,998 --> 01:21:29,206
Now leave

1006
01:21:29,373 --> 01:21:31,373
before I let Vernon
loose on you.

1007
01:21:37,623 --> 01:21:40,289
Bella, we've had a word
with young Billy.

1008
01:21:40,581 --> 01:21:45,081
He says he isn't married and
for what it's worth, I believe him.

1009
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:48,498
I saw him with someone else
the day we were supposed to meet.

1010
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:54,081
But Bella, I was hit by a bus that day.
That's why I wasn't there.

1011
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:55,872
I know what I saw.

1012
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:59,081
It must have been George!

1013
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,956
I know your face, Billy.
It wasn't your brother, it was you.

1014
01:22:03,122 --> 01:22:06,206
He's only 7 minutes younger, Bella.
We're identical.

1015
01:22:06,372 --> 01:22:07,539
You're a twin?

1016
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:09,414
Triplet, actually.

1017
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:12,956
Each of us all separated
by a whole 7 minutes.

1018
01:22:13,122 --> 01:22:16,122
He's quite the ladies' man, George!

1019
01:22:20,497 --> 01:22:23,039
You know, I would
never lie to you, Bella.

1020
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:29,580
Well, actually, I've just been telling your
father and your grandfather here that...

1021
01:22:29,747 --> 01:22:32,205
I'm not her father!
Grandfather?

1022
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,997
You must believe me, Bella.

1023
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:39,664
I've got a couple of friends
playing in the park tonight.

1024
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,872
I was rather hoping
you might be my guest.

1025
01:22:48,622 --> 01:22:49,997
Bella, are you there?

1026
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,580
I'm here.

1027
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,372
You're a bit accident prone.

1028
01:22:57,788 --> 01:23:00,080
I do seem to be
around you.

1029
01:23:03,038 --> 01:23:04,538
So the concert?

1030
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:10,622
I'll come and get you
at half past six

1031
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:13,538
and I'll be sure not to hit
any buses on my way.

1032
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,663
Promise?

1033
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:53,121
Perfect.

1034
01:23:53,288 --> 01:23:54,621
I love it!

1035
01:23:54,788 --> 01:23:55,996
Brilliant.

1036
01:23:56,704 --> 01:23:58,954
Why didn't you
show me before?

1037
01:24:04,383 --> 01:24:09,783
Hello?
Right, yes.

1038
01:24:10,204 --> 01:24:11,246
Of course.

1039
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:17,222
Hello?

1040
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:01,662
Come on, girls.

1041
01:25:10,912 --> 01:25:12,495
My dear Bella,

1042
01:25:12,662 --> 01:25:15,703
As per my somewhat
pedantic instructions,

1043
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:18,203
I assume that you
are all in your garden,

1044
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,745
which I hope is looking
as good as I expect.

1045
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,620
Vernon should be planting
a rather splendid Japanese maple.

1046
01:25:27,162 --> 01:25:30,870
Make sure that he packs the earth down
and gives it a proper drink.

1047
01:25:31,245 --> 01:25:32,662
regularly.

1048
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,995
The reason for planting the tree is,
I admit, a selfish one.

1049
01:25:39,703 --> 01:25:40,953
I quite like the idea

1050
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,411
of you telling your progeny

1051
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:47,578
of this objectionable old fool who
used to putter around the garden.

1052
01:25:49,078 --> 01:25:53,620
So, it is planted for you
and future generations

1053
01:25:53,953 --> 01:25:57,203
of spectacularly dysfunctional artists.

1054
01:26:00,328 --> 01:26:04,536
The boring details are, as ever,
in the hands of solicitors

1055
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:09,828
but he bare fact is that
my home is now Vernon's.

1056
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:14,786
He and the girls need the space
far more than I ever did.

1057
01:26:15,161 --> 01:26:17,591
You'll be able to keep
an eye on the daft bugger

1058
01:26:17,691 --> 01:26:19,411
because I'm giving you your flat.

1059
01:26:19,661 --> 01:26:21,494
I owned it.

1060
01:26:21,661 --> 01:26:25,703
The unfortunate Mr. O'Brien was
only acting on my behalf.

1061
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:29,994
Or should I say,

1062
01:26:30,744 --> 01:26:33,536
on behalf of the old Alfie.

1063
01:26:35,077 --> 01:26:37,327
You were a wonderful pupil

1064
01:26:37,827 --> 01:26:40,369
and a dearly treasured friend.

1065
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:44,744
You helped me remember
the good things.

1066
01:26:44,911 --> 01:26:48,494
Yours sincerely,
Alfred Stephenson.

1067
01:27:09,369 --> 01:27:11,577
And as Lun
drank in the view,

1068
01:27:11,869 --> 01:27:15,119
she was filled with
something quite magical.

1069
01:27:15,285 --> 01:27:19,535
In the distance, she could see the
southern shore of the Caspian Sea,

1070
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:21,952
which isn't a sea at all

1071
01:27:22,202 --> 01:27:24,744
but actually the
biggest lake in the world.

1072
01:27:25,702 --> 01:27:26,827
Luna thanked the traveler.

1073
01:27:26,994 --> 01:27:28,577
"Oh, it's nothing.

1074
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,493
You haven't done
the hard part yet."

1075
01:27:31,702 --> 01:27:33,660
"Really?" said Luna,

1076
01:27:33,827 --> 01:27:37,160
"Now, you must believe."
said the traveler.

1077
01:27:37,327 --> 01:27:39,785
And he pushed Luna
off the mountain.

1078
01:27:39,952 --> 01:27:40,952
Luna screamed to the traveler:

1079
01:27:41,118 --> 01:27:44,410
"Why did you do that?
I can't fly."

1080
01:27:44,952 --> 01:27:47,660
"Says who?" He replied.

1081
01:27:48,077 --> 01:27:52,952
And the wind lifted Luna
off the mountain and she soared.

1082
01:27:53,577 --> 01:27:56,660
"Can you see them now?"
yelled the traveler.

1083
01:27:56,826 --> 01:27:58,868
"Yes."
said Luna,

1084
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:02,785
gliding through the air with
the wind whistling between her wings.

1085
01:28:03,326 --> 01:28:06,493
"I can see
thousands of them."

1086
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:10,368
And for the first time
in a hundred years,

1087
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:14,285
the traveler allowed himself a smile.

1088

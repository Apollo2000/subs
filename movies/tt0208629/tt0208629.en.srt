2
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,455
Okay, guys. Come on.

3
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,789
Separate the officers
for interrogation.

4
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,799
I'll be damned.

5
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:50,334
General Spaatz, we meet at last.

6
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:54,306
Reichsmarschall Göring.

7
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,376
My wife. My daughter.

8
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,503
Your Eighth Air
Force has destroyed

9
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:01,050
my beautiful Luftwaffe and...

10
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,950
levelled our beautiful cities.

11
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:06,889
Even so, I prefer to surrender
to a fellow airman.

12
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:14,590
Gentlemen.

13
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:15,966
May I?

14
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,776

20
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,903
Unbelievable.

21
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:01,070
Unbelievable.

22
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,538
Those pictures were on
every wire service.

23
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:08,650
American officers throwing a party
for Hitler's Number Two man.

24
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,817
What was the commander thinking?

25
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,630
I'm told that it's
a code of honour

26
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:14,518
among airmen that
transcends politics.

27
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:18,259
- And brains, apparently.
- The commander was reprimanded.

28
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:20,405
Ike has ordered that
Göring be treated

29
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,364
no differently than
any other prisoner.

30
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,426
Excuse me.

31
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,769
I finagled some real coffee from
the Chief Justice's office.

32
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:34,810
Elsie's the best scavenger
in the entire building.

33
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,074
You shouldn't have
gone to such trouble.

34
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:41,585
Coffee's no trouble. Now a set
of tyres, that's another story.

35
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,682
I still can't believe he's gone.

36
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,862
For me, it was like
losing a father. Truly.

37
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,726
Whatever I have, whatever I am...

38
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,827
it's because of Roosevelt.

39
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,907
I was in London, seeing
Churchill, when the news came.

40
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,909
With the end of the
war in sight, the

41
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,878
President sent me
as his confidant...

42
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,608
to discuss a rather
tricky subject.

43
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,241
What to do with
captured Nazi leaders?

44
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,720
What was Churchill's opinion?

45
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:18,822
He said:

46
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:22,516
"They should be summarily shot
for crimes against humanity."

47
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:26,386
What's your opinion?

48
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:30,231
If it's a crime for the Nazis to
shoot people without a trial...

49
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:33,100
how could it be less so for
us to do the same thing?

50
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,105
That's Truman's feeling, exactly.

51
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:37,568
And Churchill now
shares that view.

52
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,834
Surprisingly enough,
so does Stalin.

53
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:42,072
You're talking about a
war crimes trial...

54
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,899
which they attempted
after the last

55
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,605
war, and it completely unravelled.

56
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,375
Because it had no weight.

57
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,583
This will be an
international tribunal,

58
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,183
comprised of the four powers:

59
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,584
America, England,
France and Russia.

60
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,520
President Truman wants the best
prosecutor in the country.

61
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:01,588
One with a reputation for
being tough, but impartial.

62
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,932
He wants you, Bob.

63
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,437
I haven't prosecuted
a case in years.

64
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:13,296
Roosevelt chose you
for the Supreme Court

65
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,570
because of your integrity
as a prosecutor.

66
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,009
That's why Truman picked you for

67
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,906
this. Because he
wants a fair trial.

68
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,509
Not a legal lynching.

69
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,545
I like it right here, Sam.

70
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,748
This would mean I would
have to step down.

71
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:28,054
A temporary leave
of absence. You'd

72
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:30,085
be back in six
months, maybe seven.

73
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:32,621
Is the President aware of the fact

74
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,928
that I'm opposed to
the death penalty?

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,924
Yes. But he's not
concerned, because

76
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,902
he knows you'll do
whatever is right.

77
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:42,305
As you know, a fair trial
means an uncertain outcome.

78
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,535
If we don't prove the
defendants' guilt...

79
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:47,772
they'd walk, even if we could
smell the blood on their hands.

80
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,004
Do the Allied powers
understand that?

81
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:51,005
Truman does.

82
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,810
You'll have a chance to
make it clear to them.

83
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,377
The trial is yours to create, Bob.

84
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:01,448
You get to set the rules, hire
the staff, find the setting.

85
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,322
You even get to pick
the defendants.

86
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,365
This trial could unravel, too...

87
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,666
like the last attempt, if
it is poorly planned...

88
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:18,166
if it is unsound,
legally or morally.

89
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,341
Or it could establish a basis
for conduct among nations...

90
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:29,286
that would alter history
for generations to come.

91
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,986
The trial will be held in Germany.

92
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:42,830
That's where the defendants
are, the evidence, witnesses.

93
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:45,496
Are there any decent
hotels still standing?

94
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,498
I don't relish the
idea of spending

95
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,267
months in some dreary army base.

96
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,869
You won't have to
worry about that.

97
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:56,404
No wives allowed at Army's
request. Bad for morale.

98
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,949
All those men over there
for years without their...

99
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,780
You don't want me there, fine.

100
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:03,343
I'll be downstairs,
whenever you're ready.

101
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,657
Eighteen minus three.

102
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,199
Fifteen.

103
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,371
Fifteen plus seven.

104
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,041
Twenty-two.

105
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:30,137
Nine minus nine...

106
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:37,144
Good morning, General Spaatz.

107
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,022
I'm afraid I have to ask you to
get dressed and pack for travel.

108
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,789
Where are you moving us?

109
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:47,297
Only the Reichsmarschall.

110
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,326
You're being transferred
to Bad Mondorf.

111
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,499
Well, you know, it's
a very pleasant

112
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,201
spa, but why must I go alone?

113
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,944
Because that's where they're
rounding up German war criminals.

114
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:01,979
No.

115
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:06,483
No.

116
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:08,742
I'm sorry about that.

117
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,514
Get dressed, please.

118
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,489
You must be brave.

119
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,253
Very, very brave.

120
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:18,359
Edda, you will?

121
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:36,978
We know who you are, Mr
"Jew Butcher of Krakow."

122
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,040
And we've seen the camps,
too. Nazi bastard.

123
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:46,650
I must say that I was lucky
when the Arms Ministry...

124
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:48,885
was destroyed in an
air raid in 1943.

125
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,428
It rid me of useless paperwork
and pencil pushers.

126
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,131
Sir.

127
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,243
What do you think
was the single most

128
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,292
effective thing you
did during the war?

129
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:01,130
When Hitler appointed me his
Minister of Armaments...

130
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:04,539
I threw out the military chiefs
and turned to the professionals.

131
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,509
Industrialists and engineers.

132
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,479
Then I borrowed the ideas
of Walter Rathenau...

133
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:12,012
the great Jewish chief of the

134
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:13,881
German economy
during the last war.

135
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:15,749
Standardisation of parts...

136
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:19,451
the division of labour, and the
maximum use of the assembly line.

137
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:21,653
Thank you, Dr Speer.

138
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:23,660
Gentlemen, we'll now
break for lunch.

139
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:28,997
Dr Albert Speer.

140
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:31,293
Obviously.

141
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:34,264
You're under arrest
for major war crimes.

142
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:44,747
Move aside. Pay attention.
The orders are in.

143
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:49,514
Listen up. You'll all be taken to
different places of detention.

144
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,021
The following prisoners
will go to Bad Mondorf...

145
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,923
as defendants in future war
crimes trials. Step forward.

146
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,327
Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel.

147
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,560
Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz.

148
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,664
Colonel General Alfred Jodl.

149
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,258
Follow me.

150
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,194
I haven't left Washington
since the war.

151
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,132
I couldn't even
remember how to pack.

152
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,235
I was so worried about bringing
the things for the office.

153
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:16,337
I forgot half the
things that I need.

154
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:18,437
I've one set of
nylons for the entire

155
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,248
time and they already have a run.

156
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:23,716
I even traded ration coupons with
my friend so I could buy nylons.

157
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:27,019
You are as jittery as a hen.
What is the matter with you?

158
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,587
I've never been up in
an aeroplane before.

159
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:44,836
- Good morning, Robert.
- John.

160
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,035
- Bob.
- Tom.

161
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:48,368
Robert, good morning.

162
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,744
This is my chief
secretary, Elsie Douglas.

163
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,682
Elsie, this is Tom Dodd,
who'll be Deputy Prosecutor.

164
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,279
It's nice to finally
meet you, Miss Douglas.

165
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Pleasure.

166
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,589
Colonel John Harlan Amen,
Head of Interrogations.

167
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:00,657
Miss Douglas.

168
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,458
Colonel Telford
Taylor, our liaison

169
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,128
with the other prosecuting teams.

170
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,662
- Pleasure.
- All mine.

171
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:08,923
And Colonel Robert Storey,
Head of Documents Division.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,490
Pleased to meet you, madam.

173
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:12,365
Now that we're all here, let's go.

174
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,661
So who are we really
after? Military leaders?

175
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:45,828
Political leaders?

176
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,145
What about the bankers and

177
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:48,963
industrialists who
funded the Nazis?

178
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,848
What about the
soldiers and civilians

179
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,373
who carried out the atrocities?

180
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,411
We can't put the whole
country on trial.

181
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,640
We need to suggest the
scope of the crimes.

182
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,875
I want this trial to
be the first of many.

183
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,851
How about choosing a symbolic
figurehead from each category?

184
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,580
We cover the whole spectrum.

185
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,740
That way no one group
gets off scot-free.

186
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:06,741
Makes sense.

187
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:10,927
If we win, we can keep prosecuting
Nazis till the cows come home.

188
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,395
Remember, we may also fail
to win convictions...

189
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:16,831
in which case, some or all of
the defendants could go free.

190
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,836
I'm still wrestling with the
validity of this trial.

191
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:23,735
Crimes committed during war
have never been called crimes.

192
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,711
Let's focus on existing law. What
existing laws did the Nazis break?

193
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,359
Well, they broke peace
and border treaties,

194
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,648
certainly Geneva and
Hague Convention.

195
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:33,717
Right.

196
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:36,178
Every time they invaded a
country, they broke a law.

197
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:39,690
My fear is that at the end of the
day, when all is said and done...

198
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:42,439
this trial will be
perceived as nothing

199
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,490
more than triumph
of superior might.

200
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:47,490
The winners exacting
punishment on the losers.

201
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,258
Our task is to make
sure that this is

202
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:52,330
not the triumph of
superior might...

203
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:54,825
but the triumph of
superior morality. We're

204
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,863
in a very interesting
position here.

205
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,338
We are in a position to fashion a
future in which aggressive war...

206
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,811
will be dealt with as a crime.

207
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:04,907
Here, here.

208
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,772
Move it. Let's go.

209
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,782
Over there. Line them over
there. Come on, let's go.

210
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:48,992
Corporal.

211
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:52,228
New arrivals, identify yourselves.

212
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:56,133
- Fritz Sauckel, sir.
- Head of Labour Conscription.

213
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,427
Former head.

214
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:00,198
- Julius Streicher.
- Publisher of...

215
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:02,339
- I can't pronounce it.
- Der Strümer.

216
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:03,406
It's filth.

217
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,372
You bankers are all Jews, you
think I don't know that?

218
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:07,444
Shut up.

219
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:09,106
Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht...

220
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,028
formerly President
of the Reichsbank

221
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,479
and Minister of the Economy.

222
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,144
I do not understand why I
have been accused here.

223
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:18,279
I'm your jailer, not your lawyer.
You'll get your day in court.

224
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,516
Hans Fritzsche.

225
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,889
Chief of Radio Operations in
the Nazi Propaganda Ministry.

226
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:27,224
Rudolf Hess, former Deputy Führer.

227
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:28,431
Hess.

228
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,293
- You.
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.

229
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,762
Nazi Foreign Minister.

230
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:36,706
You.

231
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,937
Colonel, this is Dr Robert Ley,
head of the German Labour Front.

232
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,740
- You're Albert Speer.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:42,921
What's wrong with him?

234
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,679
His mind's not what it used to be.

235
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:47,327
He's a drunk, it finally
caught up with him.

236
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:48,480
I said, "Shut up."

237
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,186
Colonel.

238
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,849
This man, Streicher,
is a disgusting

239
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,320
person. A pornographer
and a Jew-baiter.

240
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,567
I do not wish to be
housed with him.

241
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,820
We make no distinctions.

242
00:16:58,896 --> 00:16:59,896
Colonel.

243
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,998
We respectfully
protest our arrest.

244
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,692
We were only following
orders, nothing more.

245
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,867
As a fellow soldier, surely
you must understand.

246
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:22,776
Now you're no longer a soldier.

247
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,248
You are all war criminals.

248
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:27,453
All of you. Lock them up.

249
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,659
Nazi bastards.

250
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:32,695
Where's the guard?

251
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,546
Reichsmarschall Hermann
Göring at your service, sir.

252
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,247
You are in the United States
Army Stockade at Bad Mondorf.

253
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,479
Did they tell you why you're here?

254
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:01,616
Because we lost the war. I
assume, to be shot or hanged.

255
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:02,920
It's up to the Court.

256
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:05,792
I've heard of this Court. Its
opinion doesn't concern me.

257
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,798
The opinion of the German
people is what really matters.

258
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,265
- Is that so?
- It is so.

259
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:12,416
History will show
that everything I

260
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,228
did was for the
greater German Reich.

261
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,041
There will be statues of Hermann

262
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,105
Göring all over
Germany in 50 years.

263
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,507
Little statues, perhaps,
but one in every home.

264
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,640
You're fat as a house.

265
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,512
Starting right now, I'm
putting you on a diet.

266
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:29,246
You will be mentally and
physically fit to stand trial.

267
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:48,004
Captain.

268
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,539
Colonel.

269
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,432
- Who is it?
- Hans Frank, sir.

270
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,473
Tried to cut his
wrists and throat.

271
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:55,910
They stopped him before
he could do any damage.

272
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,777
"The Jew Butcher of Krakow."

273
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:00,706
Take him to the infirmary,
have him checked out.

274
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,219
I want a four-man watch
on him around the clock.

275
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,016
- On the double.
- Yes, sir.

276
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:07,583
Good work, Captain.
What's your name?

277
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:08,584
Gilbert, sir.

278
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:10,765
You and your men want
to chow with us?

279
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:11,766
Thank you, sir.

280
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,665
- You a surgeon?
- Psychologist.

281
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,772
What we are faced with,
or so it appears...

282
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:33,483
is the secular equivalent of
drafting the Ten Commandments.

283
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,220
Each nation has its
criminal statutes,

284
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,721
but for the world at
large, none exist.

285
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:40,256
None are necessary.

286
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,640
We're trying war
criminals whose guilt

287
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,656
is unquestioned by
our governments.

288
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,881
If we're going to
have a trial, it must

289
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,927
be based on law. It
must be a fair...

290
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:52,162
It must only determine degree of
guilt and appropriate punishment.

291
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:55,137
A completely fair trial
with opposing counsel...

292
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:57,470
direct examination and
cross-examination.

293
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,541
Precisely.

294
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,251
Before judges that
act as referees.

295
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:01,444
As in a sporting match?

296
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:02,570
Pain in the butt.

297
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:04,714
That's not how it's
done in my country.

298
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:05,715
Nor in France.

299
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,143
Lawyers merely help the
accused prepare a defence.

300
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:10,750
They have little role
in the court itself.

301
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,048
In the US, a defendant
is entitled to his

302
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,224
lawyer's most aggressive
representation.

303
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,486
Yes. As in Britain.

304
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:20,497
You would allow a man such
as Ernst Kaltenbrunner...

305
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:23,493
responsible for the Gestapo,
concentration camps...

306
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,132
for killing millions
of innocent people...

307
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:29,331
to stand before a court of law
and declare himself not guilty?

308
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,105
That is precisely
what we would allow.

309
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:37,375
Twenty million of my people were
killed by these fascist criminals.

310
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:41,416
Half of them civilians,
killed without mercy.

311
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:47,655
How many died in Washington
this way, Mr Justice Jackson?

312
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,494
It occurs to me that
perhaps separate trials...

313
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:05,064
might be the most satisfactory way
to reconcile our differences.

314
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:08,804
The US And the British along with
the French, if they choose...

315
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,684
will conduct a trial
with the Nazis

316
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,542
that we currently
have in captivity.

317
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:15,915
Kaltenbrunner, Frank,
Speer, Göring...

318
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:19,207
The Russians, of course,
would be free to

319
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,481
hold their own trial
with the ones that...

320
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,753
you have on hand.

321
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,333
There is no need to
be so impulsive.

322
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:38,832
We are, after all, allies.

323
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,505
We must try to bridge
our differences.

324
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,104
At least the prosecution
is a unified group now...

325
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:45,847
even if we did compromise with the

326
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,810
French and let the
judges be the jury.

327
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,881
I must say, your neat
little trump card

328
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:51,878
turned Comrade General
into a pussycat.

329
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:53,661
I didn't enjoy
playing it. I didn't

330
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,084
want to sandbag the poor guy.

331
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,093
I would've preferred
to convince him.

332
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,994
The old boy was quite convinced
by your subtle reminder...

333
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,293
that we've got most
of the big Nazi fish,

334
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:04,524
while they only have
a couple of minnows.

335
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,634
Nonetheless, I couldn't
argue with his point.

336
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:16,142
My country was spared the worst
of it. No bombed-out cities.

337
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:19,814
No slaughtered children. I
couldn't begin to know.

338
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:23,650
How can you look at all this...

339
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:26,986
and still want to guarantee
these men a vigorous defence?

340
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,218
I want to put National
Socialism on trial.

341
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,754
So they'll incriminate themselves.

342
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,860
Besides, I don't want
this to happen again.

343
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:42,504
There's no question, you're the
undisputed leader in this.

344
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:43,972
Today proved that.

345
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,582
When we finish our
work here, go to

346
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,578
Germany, find a place
for the trial.

347
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,507
If anything still exists, that is.

348
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,990
Robert, I can't believe this.

349
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,873
My brother came here as
a college student. I

350
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,087
still have the picture
book he brought me.

351
00:23:40,164 --> 00:23:43,031
It was nothing like this. This
isn't even the same city.

352
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,194
There were mediaeval bridges
and gingerbread houses.

353
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:49,802
This was also the site of some
of Hitler's biggest rallies.

354
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:52,933
Nuremberg was the spiritual
centre of the Third Reich.

355
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:56,054
What are the odds of
finding the housing

356
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:58,047
we'll need for the
thousands of people...

357
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,582
who'll attend the trial?

358
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,015
Army guarantees it.

359
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:04,277
Parts of this city were
untouched by the bombings.

360
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:06,585
There's hundreds of fine
houses. Some vacant.

361
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,989
Others whose owners are
desperate for money.

362
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,458
What's that smell?

363
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,528
There's still around 30,000
bodies trapped under the rubble.

364
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:16,227
- Ready?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,392
Follow me.

366
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:27,209
The grand old Palace of Justice.

367
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:29,370
A landmark in more ways than one.

368
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,313
It took five bomb hits, but
just shrugged them off.

369
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,679
Attention.

370
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:41,749
The courtroom's upstairs.
Offices, that whole wing there.

371
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:45,095
And behind that wall, all
the jail cells you'll need.

372
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,366
Right this way.

373
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:56,462
Justice Jackson, the courtroom.

374
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:04,578
This is a mess.

375
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:06,949
It'll take a lot of work.

376
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:09,042
- A lot of work.
- But it's doable.

377
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:10,887
Bob?

378
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,283
The Ten Commandments.

379
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:22,121
The Ten Commandments,
in the place where

380
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,793
the Nuremberg Laws were decreed...

381
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,665
that deprived all German
Jews of their rights.

382
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:31,174
This is it.

383
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:33,473
This is the place
to hold the trial.

384
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,417
Give me the word.
I'll have General

385
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,344
Patton move in 15,000
German POWs...

386
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:39,541
and start cleaning
up the whole city.

387
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:41,447
I'm giving you that
word right now.

388
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,251
Captain Kiley, what do you think?

389
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:49,049
I'll need to double the
size of the courtroom.

390
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,257
I'll have to take out
that rear wall and cut

391
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,153
into the attic for a
visitor's gallery.

392
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,456
I saw some terrific seats
in an old theatre.

393
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:56,457
Great.

394
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,360
The chandelier has got to go.
Fluorescent's more practical...

395
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:02,894
The Palace of Justice is going
to see justice once again.

396
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:06,003
Sir, this was just
forwarded from the base.

397
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:08,190
Thank you very much, Sergeant...

398
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,540
Fuchs. Morris Fuchs,
Brooklyn, New York.

399
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:12,460
Well, I knew it wasn't Wisconsin

400
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,480
with that accent,
Fuchs. Thank you.

401
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,958
President Truman wants to
appoint Francis Biddle...

402
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,890
as the US Judge for the trial.

403
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,155
Are you serious?

404
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:28,263
He fired Biddle as Attorney
General. Why would he do that?

405
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:30,095
Guilt, maybe. Probably.

406
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,654
I guess, it's this
instead of a gold watch.

407
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:34,168
How do you feel about that?

408
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:37,364
Read Truman's wording: "Unless
you have a problem with this."

409
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:38,441
Which means...

410
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:39,875
"Don't have a problem with this."

411
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:42,776
I've got to go back to Washington
and brief Truman anyway.

412
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:45,542
I can stop in Philadelphia
along the way and...

413
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,117
try to cajole Biddle to
become a team player.

414
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:49,550
When do we leave?

415
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,330
I need you to stay
here, set up our

416
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,326
office, and find us
a place to stay.

417
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:00,883
Make those decisions without you?

418
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,860
That'll be fine. I trust you.

419
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:14,343
Bob?

420
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:22,008
When your name is called,
get your ass on the truck.

421
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:29,588
When you board the plane, get a
seat by the window, dear boy.

422
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:33,792
It maybe the last view we
have of the fatherland.

423
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:48,574
I couldn't face going back
into private practise.

424
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:51,119
Not after all those
years in Washington at

425
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,374
the nerve centre of
the country, the war.

426
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,952
What is the current
status in Nuremberg?

427
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:01,450
We're gathering evidence,
choosing defendants.

428
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,526
We've settled on 22 men.

429
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:06,096
We've narrowed our
targets to those

430
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,659
who ran the concentration camps.

431
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:09,198
Good thinking, splendid.

432
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,162
The ones who gathered
the slave labour,

433
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:12,633
as well as those that used it.

434
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,170
Absolutely right.

435
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:16,594
The judges have a great
deal of work ahead

436
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,673
of them with the
pretrial discoveries.

437
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,238
Well, of course, you'll be
there to guide me through it.

438
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:25,807
I'm thrilled, Bob. It's an honour.

439
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,313
This means a great deal to me.

440
00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:34,558
Am I safe in calling
the President and

441
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,586
telling him you've
signed off on me?

442
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,593
That I'm approved as
Chief American Judge?

443
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,226
I'll arrange your
flight this week.

444
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,965
We need you there as quickly as
possible. We need to gear up fast.

445
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:49,471
The trial's in one month.

446
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:52,567
We'll have dessert in Nuremberg.

447
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,846
All right, all right, okay.
Slow down. Take it easy.

448
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:20,661
I've got to say...

449
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:22,770
I find it a little
unnerving walking

450
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,969
past 300 German POWs
carrying pickaxes.

451
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:28,305
You've got a bodyguard. Just let
one of them try to mess with you.

452
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:29,902
You want the desk sideways?

453
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,210
No, light from the side
gives him a headache.

454
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,341
You really take good
care of this guy.

455
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:35,680
That's my job.

456
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:36,752
That's fine?

457
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:39,285
Perfect. Could you please
find Captain Kiley?

458
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:41,650
I wonder if the filing
cabinets are ready.

459
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:42,651
Sure thing.

460
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:00,723
The first thing you
must understand about

461
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,806
these men is that they
are war criminals.

462
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,608
Their rank means nothing.

463
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:06,838
There is to be no
exchanging of salutes

464
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,674
or any other military courtesies.

465
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:12,453
Now, I know most of
you men saw combat.

466
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,285
You lost friends, companions.

467
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:18,590
We've all seen the bodies
at the side of the road.

468
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:21,495
Men who gave their lives in the
service of their country...

469
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:23,979
so that we might
have the opportunity

470
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,332
to bring these
criminals to justice.

471
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:30,529
Our job is to make sure that these
criminals survive long enough...

472
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:32,665
to have that justice served.

473
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:36,572
To make sure that our friends, our
companions, did not die in vain.

474
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,078
That'll be all.

475
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:40,341
Attention.

476
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:10,273
On your feet.

477
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,214
Swab your cell.

478
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:16,684
I beg your pardon?

479
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:20,421
Der bucket.

480
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,224
And der mop.

481
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:23,692
Use them.

482
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:26,787
Pick it up.

483
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,131
Pick them up. Now.

484
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:33,395
Pick them up.

485
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,432
Lieutenant.

486
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:42,745
Back off.

487
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:47,744
Easy. Okay.

488
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,211
Put him down.

489
00:31:58,662 --> 00:31:59,662
Colonel.

490
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:05,601
Doctor?

491
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,667
He'll rest now.

492
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:12,830
His heart rate was up to almost
three hundred beats per minute.

493
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:15,139
It could've led to heart failure.

494
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:18,706
That's just great.
That's just what I need.

495
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,411
To lose the biggest
bull in the roundup.

496
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:22,952
- Lieutenant?
- Wheelis, sir.

497
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:24,808
I'm making this man your personal

498
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,251
responsibility. He is
not to exert himself.

499
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,642
As God is my witness,
he'll be in the

500
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,317
best of health when they hang him.

501
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:33,662
Yes, sir.

502
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,567
Lieutenant.

503
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,163
Lieutenant Wheelis.

504
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:43,998
With your permission,
I shall call you:

505
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:45,967
Leutnant.

506
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:49,339
- That's fine, sir.
- Good.

507
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:08,896
- Thanks for the ride, Fuchs.
- No problem.

508
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,166
Robert.

509
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:14,063
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to be back.

510
00:33:14,938 --> 00:33:17,065
It's really good to have you back.

511
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:19,808
So...

512
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,578
Quite a job you've done here.

513
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:24,677
You should see the
inside. Come on.

514
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:39,286
Excellent. Excellent
work, Captain...

515
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:40,362
Kiley.

516
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,761
Kiley. What's your
background, Kiley?

517
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,527
A couple of architecture
classes. Never got a degree.

518
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:46,864
Neither did I.

519
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:48,869
Are you serious?

520
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:51,605
You're a justice of
the Supreme Court.

521
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:53,754
I practised law for
20 years with only a

522
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,734
single year of law
school under my belt.

523
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:57,404
Things were easier back then.

524
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,367
You shouldn't give
away your secrets.

525
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:00,972
I won't tell if you won't tell.

526
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:04,418
How are we doing with the gizmos
for the simultaneous translation?

527
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,634
IBM's inventing the
process as we go, sir.

528
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,583
But we'll be ready
for you, I promise.

529
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:10,254
I don't doubt that.

530
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:11,419
Excuse me.

531
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,496
Question is, "Will we be ready?"

532
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:18,230
The whole team's waiting in our
office. They'll fill you in.

533
00:34:20,003 --> 00:34:21,061
I missed you.

534
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,538
I missed you, too.

535
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:29,176
When I was home, I couldn't
find a phone number.

536
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:30,837
I couldn't find a document.

537
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:33,508
Now you won't have
to worry about that.

538
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:36,450
I'll take Göring.

539
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:38,115
Should be fun.

540
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:40,756
Tom, I'd like you to do Speer.

541
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:42,016
My pleasure.

542
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:45,528
I'd also like you to take
von Schirach and Funk.

543
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:46,629
Good.

544
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,314
Are the indictments
ready to be served?

545
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,499
I say we hold off
till the last moment.

546
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:53,665
As it is, we get to
treat them like POWs.

547
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,503
We can interrogate
them all day long.

548
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,865
Once indicted, they're entitled
to have their lawyers present.

549
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:00,739
This is going to be a fair trial.

550
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,914
Let's serve them as
soon as possible. Let

551
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:04,769
the British deliver
the indictments.

552
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:07,180
It's not right for us
to hog the whole show.

553
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,083
- What if they want Nazi lawyers?
- Hell, no.

554
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:12,377
What crazy example would that set?

555
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,378
Free speech.

556
00:35:13,423 --> 00:35:15,357
For crying out loud, boys.

557
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:18,550
Nazis defending Nazis. They ought
to be on trial themselves.

558
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:19,652
We have to pay them?

559
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:23,028
I wonder what these fellows would
do if the situation was reversed.

560
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,727
We don't have to answer
that question in this room.

561
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:27,984
The judges will be here
in one week. We'll

562
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:29,863
let them decide.
Will you excuse me?

563
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,771
This just arrived from Biddle.

564
00:35:36,312 --> 00:35:37,939
He's decided not to fly.

565
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:40,227
He's coming over on
the Queen Elizabeth.

566
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:41,848
He'll be here in three weeks.

567
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:49,992
I'm a bit surprised at Biddle.

568
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,854
I'd never seen a man so
hungry for approval.

569
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:56,063
Well, yeah, but then
you approved him.

570
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,331
I did learn a lesson
there, didn't I?

571
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,427
And how I hate learning lessons.

572
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:07,770
Don't you think this
is a bit excessive?

573
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:09,937
I got it for a really good price.

574
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,179
Thank you.

575
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:23,523
Justice Jackson, meet Frau
Hassel and Herr Hassel.

576
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:24,827
Willkommen.

577
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,763
How do you do? I have lived
five years in America.

578
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,369
Well, it's a pleasure to
meet you, Frau Hassel.

579
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:35,102
Please, come in.

580
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:40,503
Follow me, bitte.

581
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:44,641
I will prepare dinner. Something
light, perhaps, at this hour.

582
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:45,806
Thank you.

583
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,979
"Light" means five pounds of lard
in the dumplings instead of six.

584
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:53,678
Who owns this place?

585
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:56,562
Some banker who no
longer owns a bank. I

586
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:58,693
think we're his only
source of income.

587
00:36:58,762 --> 00:36:59,762
Come on.

588
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,931
Thank you, Herr
Hassel. I'll do that.

589
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:08,397
Thank you very much.

590
00:37:16,513 --> 00:37:18,105
So where is your room?

591
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:19,608
Upstairs.

592
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:22,713
It's a cute little
attic-apartment type thing.

593
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:24,183
Is it all right?

594
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:27,223
Well, it's nicer than what
I have in Washington, Bob.

595
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:30,148
I haven't seen what you
have in Washington.

596
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:33,955
Oh God, I am so bushed.

597
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,828
Just hold on till dinner.
Would you like a drink?

598
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,567
No, maybe later on.

599
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:41,565
Don't do that.

600
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:46,102
I've arranged a breakfast meeting
with the team tomorrow morning.

601
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,234
Good.

602
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,437
Just to go over some finer points.

603
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,978
You sure pack well, Bob.

604
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:05,494
Bob.

605
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,679
Thanks.

606
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:33,617
Start with this one.

607
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,899
I hope I shan't
make a balls of it.

608
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,122
You'll be just fine,
old chap. Open up.

609
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:46,896
Good morning.

610
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,135
I am Major Neave.

611
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:51,219
I am the officer appointed by the

612
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,364
International Military
Tribunal to...

613
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,610
Wait.

614
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:57,239
- You're British?
- I am.

615
00:38:57,847 --> 00:38:59,838
Finally, a civilised man.

616
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:02,618
Neave.

617
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,583
What is your given name?

618
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:08,056
Airey.

619
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,156
Major Airey Neave.

620
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:13,629
I have heard this name before.

621
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,893
Airey, like the wind.

622
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,397
Why would I have heard this name?

623
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:24,539
I was captured, tortured by the
Gestapo, and escaped twice.

624
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:27,439
I see. Then you've
earned your given name.

625
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:31,703
I am the officer appointed by the
International Military Tribunal...

626
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,147
to serve upon you a copy
of the indictment...

627
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,816
in which you are
named as defendant.

628
00:39:36,986 --> 00:39:39,887
I'm also here to advise you
as to your rights to counsel.

629
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:42,290
I care nothing for lawyers.

630
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:46,326
You can find one for me,
Major Airey of the wind.

631
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:48,759
We're men of culture.

632
00:39:48,998 --> 00:39:50,625
We both know the truth.

633
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,200
The victors will
always be the judges.

634
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:55,867
The vanquished,
always the accused.

635
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:56,972
Yes?

636
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:21,355
Open it up.

637
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:27,149
Until I've studied this,
I cannot speak to

638
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,398
the accuracy of the
charges against me.

639
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:33,609
But I acknowledge the necessity
of this trial and accept...

640
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,807
my inclusion in it.

641
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:38,244
How can you say that before
reading the charges?

642
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:41,249
There's a common responsibility
for the crimes committed...

643
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:44,445
in the name of the Third
Reich. No one is blameless.

644
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:46,578
Apart from the victims.

645
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:48,487
But we were just following orders.

646
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:50,856
I know nothing about
crimes against humanity.

647
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:52,792
- Here's a list of lawyers.
- Jews.

648
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:54,628
They're all Jew names.

649
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:57,131
I want to be defended by
a German naval officer.

650
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,226
I was a lawyer myself,
full of ideals.

651
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:04,065
Why don't you just shoot us now?

652
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,468
Why don't you shoot us now?

653
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:54,986
I want a guard posted at the
porthole of every cell.

654
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:58,316
They are to be watched
around the clock.

655
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:04,725
I will not have them
taking the easy way out.

656
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:18,345
- I need to pick up a document.
- I'll meet you in the office.

657
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:26,399
Find any directives on
Polish slave labour?

658
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Take your pick.

659
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,418
There's something peculiar
about the German character.

660
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:33,519
Makes them keep detailed
records of everything they do.

661
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,063
It's downright perverse.

662
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:39,898
The Nazis put into writing every
criminal thought they ever had...

663
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:42,266
and every criminal
act they ever did.

664
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,108
In this room is enough evidence
to hang half the country.

665
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:49,270
I'll settle for 21
clean convictions.

666
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:01,022
- Get what you need?
- More than.

667
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:05,889
I've arranged all your random
notes for the opening statement...

668
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:07,758
into something less random.

669
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:12,256
Legal, Thematic, Anecdotal,
Precedent, Theory.

670
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:15,360
You're really something.

671
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:18,606
When you decide what, let me know.

672
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:24,440
Oh, my God.

673
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,484
I don't believe this.

674
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:51,131
I've noticed that this case has
inspired the orator in you.

675
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:59,309
I tried to capture a tone, a
mood, for the entire case.

676
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:04,919
A melancholy grandeur,
if you will.

677
00:44:05,888 --> 00:44:08,083
Well, it's all here.

678
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:15,123
You have a...

679
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,498
something right here.

680
00:44:26,943 --> 00:44:29,411
We only have two days
to finish the speech.

681
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:32,544
Maybe you should start dictating.

682
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:36,084
Right.

683
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:58,239
This simultaneous
translation business is

684
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,441
like taking a room in
the Tower of Babel.

685
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,846
I can assure you, whoever designed
those electronic earmuffs...

686
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:06,381
Earphones, Sir Geoffrey.

687
00:45:06,682 --> 00:45:09,161
Earphones. Whoever
designed them did

688
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:11,642
not try them over a
barrister's wig.

689
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:14,221
Not to worry. On you,
they'll be most becoming.

690
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,619
That'll change my style...

691
00:45:16,993 --> 00:45:18,324
Who's that over there?

692
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:22,959
He's a psychologist. The army
transferred him here to consult...

693
00:45:23,032 --> 00:45:25,330
on the suicide risks
among the prisoners.

694
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,373
I had arranged for a
flight to pick you up.

695
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,506
You were meant to be
here two weeks ago.

696
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:43,416
What happened? You developed
a craving for shuffleboard?

697
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:46,812
I just I needed time
to get up to speed.

698
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:48,816
I worked the whole way over.

699
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,456
I'm fully prepared.

700
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:54,095
Any of my colleagues here?
I'd like to meet them.

701
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:57,131
Perhaps later on. I need to
talk to you about something.

702
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,899
- You must take some vodka.
- No, thank you.

703
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,030
- Try it. It makes it strong.
- I am content with the cognac.

704
00:46:05,141 --> 00:46:07,701
- We do it all the time in Russia.
- You can't mix it.

705
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:10,245
- We do it in Russia all the time.
- Not in France.

706
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:11,911
Thank you. Thank you.

707
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:15,973
Look at this, Bob.

708
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,578
It was a gift from my family.

709
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:22,072
After the trial I
will donate this,

710
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:24,055
along with my papers,
to my alma mater.

711
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:26,424
- I think future generations...
- Francis...

712
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:31,296
On the subject of who will serve
as President of the Court...

713
00:46:32,134 --> 00:46:34,967
the British are prepared
to support you, but...

714
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:37,404
Yes?

715
00:46:37,406 --> 00:46:39,772
It's not in the best
interests of the trial.

716
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:43,537
The Americans are far too
dominant in this thing already.

717
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:45,944
The trial must be viewed
as a joint effort.

718
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:48,139
I really do have the
qualifications.

719
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,140
I know you do.

720
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:53,316
If not me, then who?

721
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:54,989
Sir Geoffrey Lawrence.

722
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:58,091
The British share
our sensibilities.

723
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,821
That's a lot better than having de
Vabres or, God knows, Nikitchenko.

724
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:04,730
I think I can sell the
French on this idea too.

725
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:10,064
Everyone back home assumes that
I will be head of the Court.

726
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:13,869
Francis, your role here will
be of incredible importance.

727
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:19,613
This is probably the last
appointment of my career, Bob.

728
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:21,512
This is how I'm going out.

729
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:25,884
With great honour. Francis,
you'll be capping your career...

730
00:47:26,322 --> 00:47:27,687
with great honour.

731
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,438
Now that Ley's done himself in...

732
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:46,339
who should we get to
replace him in the dock?

733
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:49,934
It's not a Broadway show. We don't
just bring out an understudy.

734
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:52,606
We've still got 21 left.
It's a good number.

735
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:54,372
Boys, they are coming back.

736
00:47:57,353 --> 00:48:00,015
- Biddle doesn't look too happy.
- Can you blame him?

737
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:03,120
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce
Judge Francis Biddle.

738
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:05,090
Hello, sir. Pleased to see you.

739
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,304
Ladies and gentlemen.

740
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:20,165
Please.

741
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,878
A salute to my
colleagues in the law.

742
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,518
How fortunate we are to be in a

743
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:28,876
profession where we
may speak our minds.

744
00:48:29,852 --> 00:48:32,821
Not like diplomats who must
behave like dogs on a leash.

745
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,786
To the law.

746
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,858
I was wondering if you'd
care to dance with me?

747
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:49,832
I'm not much of a dancer.

748
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:53,030
Well, let's go
embarrass ourselves.

749
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:30,235
It's my opinion head-shrinking
has no place in this man's army.

750
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:32,547
But you've been assigned
to me, Captain,

751
00:49:32,548 --> 00:49:34,276
and I plan to make
full use of you.

752
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,080
You'll help me stop losing
any more of my prisoners.

753
00:49:37,253 --> 00:49:39,448
From what I know of
your set-up here...

754
00:49:39,522 --> 00:49:42,389
I can say that you've created
the perfect suicide ward.

755
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:44,015
What are you talking about?

756
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:47,324
These men have nothing to do all
day but think about their faith.

757
00:49:47,463 --> 00:49:48,657
They should.

758
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:50,426
To keep them alive and sane...

759
00:49:50,499 --> 00:49:53,161
they need to be occupied,
mentally and physically.

760
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:55,396
- A small library, for instance.
- Library?

761
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:57,632
Would make all the
difference in the world.

762
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:59,196
So would an exercise yard.

763
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:01,434
I had something quite
different in mind.

764
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,205
Put you in their lives.

765
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,543
Give them somebody to
talk to, open up with.

766
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,578
They'll surely jump
at the chance...

767
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,288
to jibber-jabber with somebody as

768
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,177
bright and enthusiastic
as yourself.

769
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:13,915
They'll tell you what they're
thinking and planning.

770
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,856
You'll report everything
you hear to me.

771
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:18,358
Colonel...

772
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,794
I will not hear anything
about morals and ethics.

773
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:23,888
These men are
prisoners. Criminals.

774
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,326
Not patients.

775
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:29,568
That's the deal, Captain.
Take it or leave it.

776
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:34,032
The library and the
exercise yard, sir?

777
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,237
You got it.

778
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:44,384
This place is worse than I
expected. What a nightmare.

779
00:50:44,453 --> 00:50:46,314
Where do we pick up
our press passes?

780
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:47,479
The Palace of Justice.

781
00:50:48,524 --> 00:50:51,015
What's the metal bar on
the front of the jeep do?

782
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:54,324
It cuts the wires that Germans
string across the road at night.

783
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:56,591
Several GI's have already
been decapitated.

784
00:50:56,665 --> 00:50:57,665
Lovely.

785
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,426
Here we are, gentlemen. I'll
take your bags to the hotel.

786
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,036
All right. Thanks a lot,
buddy. See you around.

787
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,054
Have press credentials
ready to show.

788
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:08,769
You will be given press passes...

789
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:13,104
and transferred to assigned
lodging. Get in line, gentlemen.

790
00:51:14,617 --> 00:51:15,914
Check this out.

791
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:23,118
Nice and tight, please.

792
00:51:47,249 --> 00:51:48,773
We better go sign in.

793
00:52:02,531 --> 00:52:05,004
Rudolf, you put it
on the wrong foot.

794
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:06,005
What?

795
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:07,094
The shoe.

796
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:09,037
Na ja.

797
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:11,235
Hess seems completely mad.

798
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:14,508
It is an act. He is being clever.

799
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:17,397
If he was so clever,
he wouldn't have spent

800
00:52:17,398 --> 00:52:19,837
the last four years
in an English prison.

801
00:52:28,123 --> 00:52:31,615
I turned my diaries over to
the Americans, voluntarily.

802
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:37,096
That proves that I tried to resign
as Governor-General of Poland.

803
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:41,827
I did not approve of the
persecution of the Jews.

804
00:52:43,172 --> 00:52:47,165
Anyone reading my diaries, they
will know what was in my heart.

805
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,076
They will understand that those
things I wrote about the Jews...

806
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:54,407
the orders I signed...

807
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:57,445
they were not sincere.

808
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:01,413
I believe you, Herr Frank.

809
00:53:04,593 --> 00:53:08,620
And yet, you did do those things.

810
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:11,699
How do you explain it?

811
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:15,426
I don't mean legally. I'm
not a lawyer or a judge.

812
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:18,838
I mean, how do you
explain it to yourself?

813
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,239
I don't know.

814
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:33,053
It's as though I am two people.

815
00:53:35,357 --> 00:53:39,259
The Hans Frank you see here, and
Hans Frank, the Nazi leader.

816
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,322
I wonder how that other Frank
could do those things.

817
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,468
This Frank looks at
that Frank and says:

818
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:54,375
"You are a terrible man."

819
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,210
And what does that Frank say back?

820
00:53:57,412 --> 00:53:58,412
He says:

821
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,340
"I just wanted to keep my job."

822
00:54:05,554 --> 00:54:07,044
Friends.

823
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:11,056
When we begin this grotesque
farce tomorrow, my friends...

824
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,493
never forget that we're
here for one reason.

825
00:54:14,863 --> 00:54:16,728
And one reason only.

826
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,964
We lost the war.

827
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,438
But someday, a grateful
German nation...

828
00:54:25,874 --> 00:54:28,274
will honour our legacy.

829
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:33,038
Doctor.

830
00:54:34,383 --> 00:54:36,544
What do you have if
you have one German?

831
00:54:37,886 --> 00:54:39,444
You have a fine man.

832
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:41,946
Two Germans, a Bund.

833
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:45,851
Three Germans? A war.

834
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:51,457
Are you really in such a
good mood, Herr Göring?

835
00:54:52,134 --> 00:54:54,068
Or is this your way
of handling fear?

836
00:54:58,874 --> 00:54:59,874
Fear?

837
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:02,637
What do I have to be afraid of?

838
00:55:03,812 --> 00:55:06,838
I've ordered thousands of men
into battle knowing full well...

839
00:55:06,915 --> 00:55:08,542
that not many would return.

840
00:55:09,718 --> 00:55:11,668
Why should I, their
leader, tremble

841
00:55:11,669 --> 00:55:13,620
when called upon
to face the enemy?

842
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:19,392
I know that I'm a condemned
man. That is of no consequence.

843
00:55:19,962 --> 00:55:22,499
There is still work
to be done. And,

844
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,695
mark my words, it will be done.

845
00:55:28,637 --> 00:55:31,128
One Englishman? An idiot.

846
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:33,875
Two Englishmen? A club.

847
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:37,138
Three Englishmen, an empire.

848
00:55:46,989 --> 00:55:49,116
I spoke with the
translators today...

849
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,692
to get a sense of the pace
you need to maintain.

850
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,921
It's tricky. It's not
just about pace.

851
00:55:54,196 --> 00:55:57,029
It's about rhythm, pausing
at the end of phrases.

852
00:55:57,099 --> 00:55:58,964
We should rehearse
a little tonight.

853
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:01,535
Not the whole speech. You
need to save your voice.

854
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:08,834
This is unbelievable.

855
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:51,549
Open them up.

856
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:58,186
- Good morning, Leutnant Wheelis.
- Good morning, sir.

857
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,423
It's time to go, Reichsmarschall.

858
00:57:02,597 --> 00:57:03,689
How do I look?

859
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:08,760
You look fine, sir.
How do you feel?

860
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:13,068
Excited. I have waited many
months. Many months of silence.

861
00:57:13,675 --> 00:57:15,472
Now at last I'm being heard.

862
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,578
- Shall we?
- I'm not allowed to do that, sir.

863
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,307
Yes, of course.

864
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:25,113
Bring them out.

865
00:57:32,027 --> 00:57:33,221
Hitch them up.

866
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:42,131
Pull them out.

867
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:51,811
All right, Sergeant,
search the cells.

868
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:50,390
Sir Geoffrey.

869
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:54,399
With my respects.

870
00:59:57,272 --> 00:59:58,466
Bless you, Biddle.

871
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:02,202
After you.

872
01:00:07,249 --> 01:00:08,511
All rise.

873
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,754
This trial, which
is now to begin...

874
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:58,489
is unique in the annals
of jurisprudence.

875
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:02,720
The defendants, all
having been served

876
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:04,830
with copies of the indictments...

877
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:07,138
are now to enter their pleas.

878
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:10,603
Hermann Göring.

879
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:14,410
I have a statement which I
will now read to the court.

880
01:01:14,749 --> 01:01:17,411
The defendants are not
to make a speech.

881
01:01:17,652 --> 01:01:19,313
They are only to enter a plea.

882
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:23,500
I declare myself,
in the sense of the

883
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:25,619
indictment, nicht
schuldig. Not guilty.

884
01:01:25,994 --> 01:01:27,188
Rudolf Hess.

885
01:01:27,796 --> 01:01:29,229
Nein, nein.

886
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:31,796
Record that as "not guilty."

887
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:36,769
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.
- Nicht schuldig.

888
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:39,963

889
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:44,076

890
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:47,306

891
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:51,275
- Hans Frank.

892
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:54,449
- Wilhelm Frick.
- Nicht schuldig.

893
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,553
- Julius Streicher.
- Nicht schuldig.

894
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:00,895
- Walther Funk.
- Nicht schuldig.

895
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:04,027
- Hjalmar Schacht.
- Nicht schuldig.

896
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:06,961
- Karl Dönitz.
- Nicht schuldig.

897
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:09,831
- Erich Raeder.
- Nicht schuldig.

898
01:02:09,904 --> 01:02:12,202
- Baldur von Schirach.
- Nicht schuldig.

899
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:14,671
- Fritz Sauckel.
- Nicht schuldig.

900
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:16,711
- Alfred Jodl.
- Nicht schuldig.

901
01:02:16,811 --> 01:02:19,302
- Franz von Papen.
- Nicht schuldig.

902
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:22,145
- Arthur Seyss-Inquart.
- Nicht schuldig.

903
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:24,817
- Albert Speer.
- Nicht schuldig.

904
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,420
- Konstantin van Neurath.
- Nicht schuldig.

905
01:02:28,523 --> 01:02:31,014
- And Hans Fritzsche.
- Nicht schuldig.

906
01:02:33,028 --> 01:02:35,394
All the pleas have
now been entered.

907
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,556
Justice Jackson.

908
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,124
Your opening address, please.

909
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:51,072
May it please your honours.

910
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:55,045
The privilege of opening the
first trial in history...

911
01:02:55,116 --> 01:02:57,914
for crimes against the
peace of the world...

912
01:02:58,553 --> 01:03:00,487
imposes a grave responsibility.

913
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:04,482
The wrongs which
we seek to condemn

914
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:06,761
and punish have been
so calculated...

915
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:09,228
so malignant, and
so devastating...

916
01:03:09,898 --> 01:03:12,765
that civilisation cannot
tolerate their being ignored...

917
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:15,701
because it cannot survive
their being repeated.

918
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:20,488
That four great
nations, flushed with

919
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,472
victory and stung with injury...

920
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:25,013
stay the hand of vengeance
and voluntarily

921
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,703
submit their captive enemies...

922
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:28,578
to the judgement of the law...

923
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,351
is one of the most
significant tributes

924
01:03:31,352 --> 01:03:33,243
that Power has ever
paid to Reason.

925
01:03:34,656 --> 01:03:37,317
If these men are the
first war leaders

926
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:40,117
of a defeated nation
to be prosecuted...

927
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,687
in the name of the law...

928
01:03:43,331 --> 01:03:47,233
we agree that here they must be
given a presumption of innocence.

929
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:50,063
We accept the burden...

930
01:03:51,005 --> 01:03:53,269
of proving criminal acts...

931
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,541
and the responsibility...

932
01:03:55,944 --> 01:03:59,778
of these defendants
for their commission.

933
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,914
We have no purpose here...

934
01:04:04,419 --> 01:04:06,819
to incriminate the
whole German people.

935
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,182
Hitler did not achieve power by
majority vote, but seized it...

936
01:04:12,827 --> 01:04:15,887
by an evil alliance
of revolutionists...

937
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:18,198
reactionaries...

938
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:20,266
and militarists.

939
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:23,274
You will hear today
and in the days

940
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:25,838
ahead of the enormity
and the horror...

941
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:27,640
of their acts.

942
01:04:28,376 --> 01:04:31,072
The prosecution will give
you undeniable proofs...

943
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,577
of these incredible events.

944
01:04:34,048 --> 01:04:36,863
I count myself as one
who received, during

945
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:39,680
this war, atrocity tales
with suspicion...

946
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:43,655
or scepticism. No more.

947
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:49,626
The catalogue of crimes will omit
nothing that could be conceived...

948
01:04:49,697 --> 01:04:53,929
by their pathological pride,
cruelty, and lust for power.

949
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:58,633
You will hear of the repression
of organised labour.

950
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:02,506
The harassment of the Church,
the persecution of the Jews.

951
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:04,835
The conversion of
mere anti-Semitism

952
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:06,240
into the deliberate...

953
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:09,477
extermination of the
Jews of Europe.

954
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:13,648
You'll hear of the long series
of German aggressions...

955
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:16,417
and conquests and broken treaties.

956
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:19,156
The terror that
settled over Germany.

957
01:05:19,394 --> 01:05:22,329
The havoc wrought on the
occupied territories.

958
01:05:22,497 --> 01:05:26,207
And you'll know that
the real complaining

959
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:29,300
party at your bar is Civilisation.

960
01:05:30,505 --> 01:05:33,018
Civilisation asks
whether law is so

961
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:35,602
laggard as to be
utterly helpless...

962
01:05:35,877 --> 01:05:38,641
to deal with crimes
of this magnitude...

963
01:05:39,013 --> 01:05:42,847
by criminals of this
order of importance.

964
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:49,988
It does not expect that you
can make war impossible.

965
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:53,814
It does expect that
your juridical action

966
01:05:53,815 --> 01:05:56,492
will put the forces of
international law...

967
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:05,028
its precepts, its prohibitions
and, above all, its sanctions...

968
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:08,741
on the side of peace.

969
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:14,606
So that men and women of good
will in all countries...

970
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:23,085
may have leave to live by no
man's leave, underneath the law.

971
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,760
The court is now adjourned.

972
01:06:49,017 --> 01:06:51,703
Jackson's speech?
Pedantic. Tiresome

973
01:06:51,704 --> 01:06:54,319
lot of nothing. I
nodded off twice.

974
01:06:54,522 --> 01:06:56,418
The food is better
today. Do you think

975
01:06:56,419 --> 01:06:58,219
they'll feed us like
this every day?

976
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:00,761
They always feed you well
before they hang you.

977
01:07:00,828 --> 01:07:01,852
That's so true.

978
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:06,264
They can't hang us. We're
soldiers. They have to shoot us.

979
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:11,596
Stop this talk. We must
concentrate on our defence.

980
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:20,175
If you are not going to
eat, Frank, give it to me.

981
01:07:20,615 --> 01:07:23,106
It's a crime to waste
such good food.

982
01:07:25,987 --> 01:07:28,649
Look what they have done
to your beautiful city.

983
01:07:28,756 --> 01:07:31,054
- Nuremberg is not mine.
- But it was.

984
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:33,536
Was anything ever more
extraordinary than

985
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:35,729
the Parteitagen you
staged in September?

986
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:38,785
The night skies lit up
like a bonfire as we

987
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:40,795
carried our torches
through the streets.

988
01:07:40,868 --> 01:07:43,962
A quarter million of us on our
way to the Zeppelin Fields.

989
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:46,559
I remember standing
there for hours,

990
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,866
basking in the radiance
of the Führer.

991
01:07:50,845 --> 01:07:53,837
Then I would take a group of my
Hitlerjugend to the river...

992
01:07:53,915 --> 01:07:55,746
where we'd would bathe together.

993
01:07:57,518 --> 01:08:00,817
We'd cool off from the fires
that were burning within us.

994
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:05,818
But now that just
seems like a dream.

995
01:08:06,494 --> 01:08:10,487
A strange, wonderful,
frightening dream.

996
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:13,230
It was not a dream,
it was a nightmare...

997
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:16,664
of our own making. And it's
time to wake up from it.

998
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:20,768
The look in Hitler's eyes was
not radiance, it was madness.

999
01:08:28,182 --> 01:08:30,309
Is the British prosecution ready?

1000
01:08:30,385 --> 01:08:32,444
Yes. Indeed we are.

1001
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,278
Your Honours, with
permission I wish

1002
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,924
to read from a sworn affidavit...

1003
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,585
by one Hermann Friedrich Graebe.

1004
01:08:39,727 --> 01:08:43,629
A German construction manager
who, in a civilian capacity...

1005
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:46,170
was employed by the German Army in

1006
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:48,863
occupied Ukraine
from 1941 to 1944.

1007
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:54,297
On several occasions
he observed...

1008
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:59,680
the mass murders of local
Jews committed by the SS...

1009
01:09:00,014 --> 01:09:06,510
or Schutzstaffel, the Nazi party's
police and security organisation.

1010
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:08,049
One such occasion...

1011
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:13,019
he writes, took place
on October 5, 1942...

1012
01:09:13,628 --> 01:09:15,323
near the city of Dobno.

1013
01:09:16,397 --> 01:09:19,332
That morning, Herr
Graebe was informed...

1014
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:24,762
that all 5,000 Jews
from that city...

1015
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,371
were to be taken by SS trucks to a
place near his building site...

1016
01:09:32,146 --> 01:09:33,875
where they were to be shot...

1017
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:37,378
and buried in large pits.

1018
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,555
He continues.

1019
01:09:41,856 --> 01:09:47,260
"Thereupon I drove to the site and
saw near it great mounds of earth.

1020
01:09:48,062 --> 01:09:51,054
"Several SS trucks stood
in front of them.

1021
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,167
"I heard rifle shots,
in quick succession...

1022
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:57,295
"coming from behind one
of the earth mounds.

1023
01:09:57,872 --> 01:10:00,688
"Those who had just
got off the trucks,

1024
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:03,435
men, women and children
of all ages...

1025
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:09,445
"had to undress upon the order of
an SS man, who carried a whip.

1026
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:11,915
"All these people
had the regulation

1027
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,519
yellow patch on their clothes...

1028
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:16,614
"and thus could be
recognised as Jews.

1029
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:20,116
"And without screaming
or weeping...

1030
01:10:21,028 --> 01:10:25,362
"these people undressed, stood
around in family groups...

1031
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:30,597
"kissed each other,
said their farewells.

1032
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:34,899
"I watched a family of about
eight, a man and a woman...

1033
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:37,510
"with their children and
two grown-up daughters.

1034
01:10:37,678 --> 01:10:40,371
"An old woman with
snow-white hair was

1035
01:10:40,372 --> 01:10:43,412
holding the youngest,
perhaps a year old...

1036
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:46,937
"in her arms and singing
to it, tickling

1037
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:50,456
it, and the child was
cooing with delight.

1038
01:10:51,726 --> 01:10:54,214
"All the people
around were looking

1039
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:56,220
on with tears in their eyes.

1040
01:10:57,265 --> 01:11:00,393
"The father was holding the hand
of a boy about 10 years old...

1041
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:05,799
"and speaking to him softly. The
boy was fighting his tears.

1042
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:11,142
"The father pointed to the
sky, stroked the boy's head...

1043
01:11:12,914 --> 01:11:15,314
"seemed to explain
something to him.

1044
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:21,647
"At that moment, the SS man at
the pit shouted to his comrades.

1045
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:26,490
"The latter counted off about 30
persons and instructed them...

1046
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:28,528
"to go behind the earth mound.

1047
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:31,289
"Among them was the family
that I have mentioned.

1048
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:35,360
"I well remember a girl, slim
and with black hair, who...

1049
01:11:35,436 --> 01:11:39,839
"as she passed close to me,
pointed to herself and said:

1050
01:11:41,008 --> 01:11:42,600
"'Twenty-three.'

1051
01:11:43,144 --> 01:11:45,959
"I then walked around
the mound, and

1052
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,776
was confronted by
an enormous grave.

1053
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:52,138
"People were closely
wedged together and

1054
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:53,950
lying on top of each
other so that...

1055
01:11:54,388 --> 01:11:56,219
"only their heads were visible.

1056
01:11:56,757 --> 01:11:59,487
"Nearly all had blood running
over their shoulders.

1057
01:12:00,194 --> 01:12:04,187
"Some of the people
shot were still moving.

1058
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:08,131
"Some were lifting their arms
and turning their heads...

1059
01:12:08,202 --> 01:12:10,261
"to show that they
were still alive.

1060
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:13,907
"The pit was at least
two-thirds full.

1061
01:12:14,575 --> 01:12:16,611
"I estimated that it already

1062
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:19,376
contained about one
thousand humans.

1063
01:12:19,847 --> 01:12:22,372
"The victims, completely naked...

1064
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:24,750
"went down some steps
which were cut

1065
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:26,718
out of the clay wall
of the pit and...

1066
01:12:27,088 --> 01:12:30,114
"clambered over the heads of
the people lying there...

1067
01:12:30,892 --> 01:12:34,919
"to the place where the
SS man had directed them.

1068
01:12:35,062 --> 01:12:39,897
"They lay down in front
of the dead or injured.

1069
01:12:41,168 --> 01:12:44,035
"Some caressed those who
were still alive...

1070
01:12:44,372 --> 01:12:46,863
"and spoke to them in low voices.

1071
01:12:47,108 --> 01:12:50,134
"Then I heard a series of shots.

1072
01:12:50,645 --> 01:12:52,710
"I looked back into
the pit and saw

1073
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:54,547
that the bodies were twitching.

1074
01:12:55,983 --> 01:12:58,412
"The heads lying
already motionless

1075
01:12:58,413 --> 01:13:00,977
were on top of the
bodies that lay...

1076
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:04,288
"beneath them.

1077
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:07,410
"When I walked back,
around the mound, I

1078
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:10,029
noticed another
truckload had arrived.

1079
01:13:10,331 --> 01:13:13,425
"This time it included
the sick and the infirm.

1080
01:13:14,435 --> 01:13:18,098
"An old, very thin,
very frail woman...

1081
01:13:18,272 --> 01:13:21,002
"with terribly thin
legs, was undressed

1082
01:13:21,003 --> 01:13:23,733
by the others who
were already naked...

1083
01:13:23,811 --> 01:13:25,574
"while two people held her up.

1084
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:27,677
"The woman was
obviously paralysed.

1085
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,877
"The naked people...

1086
01:13:32,653 --> 01:13:34,484
"carried the old woman...

1087
01:13:35,456 --> 01:13:37,321
"around the mound...

1088
01:13:41,162 --> 01:13:45,064
"and the shooting continued."

1089
01:13:50,237 --> 01:13:54,298
Signed, Friedrich Graebe.

1090
01:14:02,016 --> 01:14:05,008
Did any of you ever
hear of this Graebe?

1091
01:14:40,221 --> 01:14:41,813
Rough day, Reichsmarschall?

1092
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:43,081
On the contrary.

1093
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:46,126
We had an excellent lunch,
a nice view of the city.

1094
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,752
And in the courtroom, we had
the best seats in the house.

1095
01:14:49,964 --> 01:14:51,295
Cuffs off.

1096
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:55,892
They go on about this Graebe
person. It doesn't concern us.

1097
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:57,528
We were not even mentioned.

1098
01:14:57,605 --> 01:15:00,574
They must have very little
evidence against us.

1099
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:03,023
I always suspected the
British prosecutor

1100
01:15:03,024 --> 01:15:04,839
was a Jew. Now I am sure of it.

1101
01:15:04,912 --> 01:15:07,642
- Shut up, Streicher.
- Please, don't be so naïve.

1102
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:09,339
We are on trial.

1103
01:15:10,351 --> 01:15:12,842
Of course they'll say
terrible things about us.

1104
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,514
- They have not even begun.
- Lock them up.

1105
01:15:18,259 --> 01:15:19,886
Happy dreams, Leutnant.

1106
01:15:20,961 --> 01:15:22,451
Good night, Reichsmarschall.

1107
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:31,630
Your Honours, I would like to read
into the record Document 294-PS...

1108
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:34,156
which describes
manpower initiatives

1109
01:15:34,157 --> 01:15:35,936
and how they were directed.

1110
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:39,464
You have already read
into record eight

1111
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:41,908
nearly identical documents
on this subject.

1112
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,711
Do you really feel it's
necessary to introduce a ninth?

1113
01:15:45,786 --> 01:15:47,777
Yes, your honour, I do.

1114
01:15:47,855 --> 01:15:50,688
Very well. Please continue.

1115
01:15:51,926 --> 01:15:54,986
Document 294-PS
begins as follows...

1116
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:01,142
I have come to the conclusion the

1117
01:16:01,143 --> 01:16:03,532
sentences are already
being carried out.

1118
01:16:03,838 --> 01:16:06,582
Justice Jackson means
to bore us to death

1119
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,935
and is succeeding
beyond his hopes.

1120
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:15,246
Now the Führer, what a speaker.
At a rally, here in Nuremberg...

1121
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:19,477
he held an audience of 250,000
people in the palm of his hand...

1122
01:16:19,553 --> 01:16:21,612
for an entire afternoon.

1123
01:16:22,523 --> 01:16:23,990
As legal strategy...

1124
01:16:24,058 --> 01:16:27,289
your documentary approach
has been unassailable.

1125
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:31,622
But as drama, it is, I regret
to say, absolutely stultifying.

1126
01:16:32,266 --> 01:16:34,067
As you know, it's not meant to be

1127
01:16:34,068 --> 01:16:36,362
entertainment. It's
meant to be a trial.

1128
01:16:36,437 --> 01:16:40,430
- And it's ours to lose.
- A trial is a show, Robert.

1129
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,941
Like it or not, it's a show.

1130
01:16:43,978 --> 01:16:46,776
And those four learnt men
sitting on the bench...

1131
01:16:46,847 --> 01:16:49,315
are as impressionable
as any audience.

1132
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:53,911
You're pushing for witnesses?

1133
01:16:54,555 --> 01:16:57,422
Witnesses will give this
trial a human face.

1134
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,850
One compelling
witness can outweigh

1135
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,587
a tonne of documentary evidence.

1136
01:17:08,402 --> 01:17:12,702
Mr Pachelogg, while you were
imprisoned in Dachau...

1137
01:17:13,107 --> 01:17:14,563
were you at one time asked to

1138
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:16,474
participate in a
medical experiment?

1139
01:17:16,676 --> 01:17:17,676
Yes.

1140
01:17:17,678 --> 01:17:20,806
And the Nazi doctor who supervised
that experiment, Dr Rascher...

1141
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:23,850
did he ever explain
to you its purpose?

1142
01:17:24,418 --> 01:17:26,613
He said the Luftwaffe
had a problem.

1143
01:17:26,687 --> 01:17:30,521
That its pilots shot down
over the North Sea...

1144
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:33,903
often survived a crash
in freezing waters

1145
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:36,995
only to die later,
after being rescued.

1146
01:17:38,265 --> 01:17:43,396
The purpose of the experiment
was to prevent these deaths.

1147
01:17:44,505 --> 01:17:46,939
And what experiment did he devise?

1148
01:17:50,077 --> 01:17:55,276
First, I helped to strip
other male inmates naked...

1149
01:17:55,349 --> 01:17:57,146
and put them into water tanks.

1150
01:17:57,218 --> 01:18:00,187
You were forced to do
this to fellow inmates?

1151
01:18:00,654 --> 01:18:01,654
Yes.

1152
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:03,848
And then?

1153
01:18:05,492 --> 01:18:09,019
Then we added large pieces of ice.

1154
01:18:14,034 --> 01:18:16,926
We put thermometers
into their rectums

1155
01:18:16,927 --> 01:18:19,597
to make sure the
men were freezing.

1156
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:24,610
Then, some of them we
plunged into hot water...

1157
01:18:24,678 --> 01:18:27,586
others in warm
water, others we put

1158
01:18:27,587 --> 01:18:30,173
next to naked female inmates...

1159
01:18:31,218 --> 01:18:35,416
so the doctor could learn which
method would best revive them.

1160
01:18:38,926 --> 01:18:41,656
Mr Pachelogg, would
you be so kind...

1161
01:18:42,396 --> 01:18:45,957
as to read this conclusion...

1162
01:18:46,367 --> 01:18:49,734
from Dr Rascher's
meticulous records.

1163
01:18:56,844 --> 01:18:59,294
"Rapid rewarming
was, in all cases,

1164
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:01,474
preferable to slow rewarming...

1165
01:19:01,815 --> 01:19:04,477
"because after removal
from the cold water...

1166
01:19:04,718 --> 01:19:08,051
"the body temperature
continued to drop rapidly.

1167
01:19:08,455 --> 01:19:12,016
"Rewarming by animal
warmth was too slow."

1168
01:19:15,496 --> 01:19:16,496
Thank you.

1169
01:19:17,831 --> 01:19:20,202
Mr Pachelogg, do you
recall whatever

1170
01:19:20,203 --> 01:19:22,063
became of the subjects of...

1171
01:19:22,269 --> 01:19:25,067
Dr Rascher's experiments
on behalf of...

1172
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,471
the Luftwaffe?

1173
01:19:32,646 --> 01:19:36,241
Most of them went into
convulsions and died.

1174
01:19:41,221 --> 01:19:42,552
Thank you.

1175
01:19:45,993 --> 01:19:49,030
In 1942, I was
arrested, interrogated

1176
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:52,228
and ordered to sign
a false confession.

1177
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,327
I refused.

1178
01:19:55,002 --> 01:19:56,867
The German officer threatened me.

1179
01:19:57,338 --> 01:20:00,796
I told him, "I am not
afraid of being shot."

1180
01:20:02,309 --> 01:20:04,822
He said, "We have
means at our disposal

1181
01:20:04,823 --> 01:20:07,212
which are far worse
than being shot."

1182
01:20:10,718 --> 01:20:12,310
Please continue, Madame.

1183
01:20:14,288 --> 01:20:16,473
Soon afterwards, I found myself

1184
01:20:16,474 --> 01:20:19,225
packed with 230 other
French women...

1185
01:20:19,293 --> 01:20:22,126
in a sealed train on
our way to Auschwitz.

1186
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:23,220
A sealed train?

1187
01:20:23,597 --> 01:20:26,031
No food, no water. Nothing.

1188
01:20:27,801 --> 01:20:29,932
At Auschwitz, the
trains ran almost

1189
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:31,828
all the way to the gas chamber.

1190
01:20:33,607 --> 01:20:35,302
They unsealed the cars...

1191
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:37,904
and the soldiers let everyone out.

1192
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:45,750
I saw men, women,
children, old couples...

1193
01:20:46,453 --> 01:20:48,318
forced to part from each other.

1194
01:20:49,656 --> 01:20:52,056
Mothers made to abandon
their children.

1195
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:57,462
None were aware of the
fate that awaited them.

1196
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:00,826
Those selected for
the gas chamber...

1197
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:03,699
were immediately driven
to a red brick building.

1198
01:21:04,805 --> 01:21:08,434
I saw my friend,
Annette, on that truck.

1199
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:10,910
She called to me.

1200
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:15,943
"Think of my little boy if you
ever get back to France."

1201
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:21,579
Then she put her arms around
another French woman...

1202
01:21:22,222 --> 01:21:24,713
and they began singing
I a Marseillaise.

1203
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:30,224
One night, we were awakened
by horrible cries.

1204
01:21:31,331 --> 01:21:35,392
The next day we learnt that the
Nazis had run out of gas...

1205
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:39,806
and the children had been
thrown into the furnaces alive.

1206
01:21:42,209 --> 01:21:45,610
Of the 230 women on that train...

1207
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:49,343
how many returned from Auschwitz?

1208
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,215
Forty-nine.

1209
01:21:52,986 --> 01:21:54,385
Thank you, Madame.

1210
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:56,050
You're excused.

1211
01:22:33,026 --> 01:22:34,254
There you are.

1212
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:37,210
The film came in
late last night, and

1213
01:22:37,211 --> 01:22:38,961
I was up until dawn watching it.

1214
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:41,559
Very few people have
seen this film.

1215
01:22:41,635 --> 01:22:44,604
You have got to enter this
into evidence this morning.

1216
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:47,270
What's the film?

1217
01:22:48,342 --> 01:22:50,105
You're not going to believe this.

1218
01:22:54,014 --> 01:22:55,572
May it please the tribunal.

1219
01:22:55,749 --> 01:22:58,377
The United States now offers
a film into evidence.

1220
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:01,397
It was compiled from
motion pictures taken

1221
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:03,586
by Allied military
photographers...

1222
01:23:03,657 --> 01:23:06,044
as their armies liberated
areas in which

1223
01:23:06,045 --> 01:23:08,026
concentration camps were located.

1224
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:17,670
Go.

1225
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:25,875
It was such a nice day,
laughing, joking...

1226
01:28:28,014 --> 01:28:30,642
and then they showed
that horrid film.

1227
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,245
Propaganda. Anyone can do it.

1228
01:28:35,388 --> 01:28:39,324
A little of this, a little of
that, and before you know it...

1229
01:28:42,495 --> 01:28:43,757
Still...

1230
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:47,689
Those films...

1231
01:28:48,235 --> 01:28:52,467
I've read any number of
affidavits, reports, statistics.

1232
01:28:53,773 --> 01:28:56,799
But I didn't really understand
until I saw those films.

1233
01:29:00,614 --> 01:29:02,047
I still don't understand.

1234
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:04,810
I don't think I ever will.

1235
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:09,028
How could civilised
human beings do

1236
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:11,290
that to other civilised
human beings?

1237
01:29:15,929 --> 01:29:17,954
Maybe civilisation's overrated.

1238
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:25,704
Good night, Leutnant.

1239
01:29:25,772 --> 01:29:27,399
Goodnight, Reichsmarschall.

1240
01:31:08,121 --> 01:31:09,952
Dr Speer, help me
understand what I

1241
01:31:09,953 --> 01:31:11,784
witnessed today in
the dining room.

1242
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:16,488
Göring's ability to dominate and
intimidate without possessing...

1243
01:31:16,563 --> 01:31:18,053
a real shred of power.

1244
01:31:18,632 --> 01:31:20,031
How do you explain that?

1245
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:23,963
Habit. Instinct.

1246
01:31:25,138 --> 01:31:28,403
Something in the German character
that responds to authority...

1247
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,432
real or imagined.

1248
01:31:30,543 --> 01:31:31,942
- That's all it is?
- Yeah.

1249
01:31:32,212 --> 01:31:34,073
What about the ideas
he expressed? The

1250
01:31:34,074 --> 01:31:35,841
words, thoughts,
they had no impact?

1251
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,543
What ideas? What thoughts?

1252
01:31:39,252 --> 01:31:40,913
There were only platitudes.

1253
01:31:40,987 --> 01:31:43,683
Nazi Germany was built
on empty platitudes.

1254
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:49,618
A man like you, you were
seduced by empty platitudes?

1255
01:31:51,765 --> 01:31:52,823
Of course.

1256
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:55,764
Because you can hear in
them any meaning you want.

1257
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:01,573
You said earlier you wanted
to tell me something.

1258
01:32:05,946 --> 01:32:09,404
I've been trying to encourage
some of the other defendants...

1259
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:13,849
to join with me in accepting
guilt and expressing remorse.

1260
01:32:14,521 --> 01:32:17,285
I made progress with Frank,
and I have had high hopes...

1261
01:32:17,357 --> 01:32:18,824
for young von Schirach.

1262
01:32:18,959 --> 01:32:21,826
But Göring means to bully
them into joining him.

1263
01:32:21,895 --> 01:32:24,159
And I fear now, he will succeed.

1264
01:32:24,931 --> 01:32:26,364
Unless someone stops him.

1265
01:32:28,368 --> 01:32:29,426
I understand.

1266
01:32:35,108 --> 01:32:36,268
All rise.

1267
01:32:58,331 --> 01:33:00,441
Herr Göring, do you
believe that the

1268
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:02,495
Nazi party came
into power legally?

1269
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:05,499
I do. And I am happy
to explain in detail

1270
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,699
the history of those
first elections.

1271
01:33:07,974 --> 01:33:10,147
But I will add that
once we came to power,

1272
01:33:10,148 --> 01:33:12,070
we were determined
to hold onto it...

1273
01:33:12,145 --> 01:33:13,840
under all circumstances.

1274
01:33:14,114 --> 01:33:16,674
We did not want to leave
this any longer to chance...

1275
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,048
to elections and
parliamentary majorities.

1276
01:33:19,285 --> 01:33:21,845
It had always been our plan
once we came to power...

1277
01:33:21,955 --> 01:33:24,116
that we would eliminate
the Reichstag...

1278
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:27,318
dissolve the regional parliaments,
end individual rights.

1279
01:33:27,994 --> 01:33:29,933
Where did the idea
come from to combine

1280
01:33:29,934 --> 01:33:31,486
the ceremonial head of state...

1281
01:33:31,831 --> 01:33:34,959
and the head of government
in one person, Adolf Hitler?

1282
01:33:35,935 --> 01:33:37,770
That's quite simple. We took our

1283
01:33:37,771 --> 01:33:40,065
example from the
similar dual roles...

1284
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,267
of the President of
the United States.

1285
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:47,713
And the idea for
concentration camps?

1286
01:33:47,847 --> 01:33:49,109
The idea was mine.

1287
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:55,054
It was a question
of removing danger.

1288
01:33:56,156 --> 01:33:58,021
Only one course was available.

1289
01:33:58,091 --> 01:33:59,490
Protective custody.

1290
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:02,793
How could the party rule until
it had established order?

1291
01:34:03,129 --> 01:34:06,155
And how could it maintain order
with its deadly enemies...

1292
01:34:06,232 --> 01:34:08,723
particularly the
Communists, running free?

1293
01:34:13,907 --> 01:34:15,135
No further questions.

1294
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:34,117
I don't get it. He's tightening
the noose around his own neck.

1295
01:34:34,194 --> 01:34:36,424
He doesn't care. He has
bigger fish to fry.

1296
01:34:36,496 --> 01:34:38,094
He's talking over the heads of the

1297
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:40,023
tribunal directly to
the German people.

1298
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,333
I suggest you isolate
him from the others

1299
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:44,196
when they're not in the courtroom.

1300
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:54,943
I don't understand. Why
are you doing this?

1301
01:34:55,381 --> 01:34:56,381
Inside.

1302
01:35:02,922 --> 01:35:04,981
Me? I'm just following orders.

1303
01:35:22,642 --> 01:35:23,666
During cross...

1304
01:35:23,743 --> 01:35:27,042
hit Göring quick and hard. Put
him on the defensive right away.

1305
01:35:27,113 --> 01:35:28,603
Never let him breathe.

1306
01:35:29,082 --> 01:35:30,802
I see no point in
that at all. He's

1307
01:35:30,803 --> 01:35:32,381
blatantly incriminating himself.

1308
01:35:32,952 --> 01:35:36,080
All I need to do is ask direct
questions and let him answer them.

1309
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:39,120
Be prepared with a tough
line of questioning.

1310
01:35:39,459 --> 01:35:40,653
In case it's needed.

1311
01:35:42,595 --> 01:35:44,062
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1312
01:35:48,001 --> 01:35:50,265
Why am I being punished
like a schoolboy?

1313
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:52,204
Speer?

1314
01:35:52,438 --> 01:35:53,803
Speer's behind this.

1315
01:35:54,007 --> 01:35:55,848
He must have talked
to Colonel Andrus,

1316
01:35:55,849 --> 01:35:57,738
persuaded him into
this line of action.

1317
01:35:57,810 --> 01:35:59,573
How do you know it wasn't me?

1318
01:36:00,413 --> 01:36:03,940
Why Dr Speer? Is there rivalry
between the two of you?

1319
01:36:04,017 --> 01:36:06,679
He is ashamed of being
a Nazi. I'm not.

1320
01:36:06,953 --> 01:36:09,217
He wishes to infect the
others with his shame.

1321
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:10,688
You have no shame?

1322
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:13,200
The world has now
seen proof of the

1323
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:15,057
horrors committed by Nazi Germany.

1324
01:36:15,161 --> 01:36:17,095
You are comfortable defending it?

1325
01:36:17,163 --> 01:36:20,291
I've seen so many horrors already.
The carnage of the First War...

1326
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:23,665
thousands of my countrymen
maimed, degraded, starved.

1327
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,561
No, my dear doctor.

1328
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:30,271
I am not an inhuman monster who
has no regard for human life.

1329
01:36:30,577 --> 01:36:33,341
These atrocities are
not indifferent to me.

1330
01:36:35,148 --> 01:36:38,515
You know, we are accused of
so many appalling acts...

1331
01:36:38,718 --> 01:36:40,208
it is hard to keep track.

1332
01:36:40,653 --> 01:36:43,019
- Did you try?
- My concern was war.

1333
01:36:43,523 --> 01:36:46,151
And in war, each nation has
its own selfish interest.

1334
01:36:46,826 --> 01:36:48,293
You have to be practical.

1335
01:36:48,795 --> 01:36:52,094
I am a practical man.
And I'm a soldier.

1336
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,858
And a soldier's code is obedience.

1337
01:36:56,536 --> 01:36:57,536
Obedience.

1338
01:36:57,570 --> 01:36:59,094
This amuses you?

1339
01:36:59,572 --> 01:37:01,836
Blind obedience without
responsibility.

1340
01:37:01,908 --> 01:37:03,705
Is there nobody in this country...

1341
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:07,746
that will take responsibility for
anything? Nobody who can say no?

1342
01:37:07,814 --> 01:37:11,045
Take a look at every cell in
this block. What do you see?

1343
01:37:11,484 --> 01:37:12,484
Yes men.

1344
01:37:13,019 --> 01:37:15,112
All the no men are six
feet underground.

1345
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:19,818
What is this?

1346
01:37:22,495 --> 01:37:24,190
You're not Jewish, are you?

1347
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,966
Yes. I am.

1348
01:37:37,076 --> 01:37:38,304
I see.

1349
01:37:41,714 --> 01:37:44,012
This is a very
interesting situation.

1350
01:37:44,951 --> 01:37:46,248
For both of us.

1351
01:38:01,301 --> 01:38:02,700
Good luck, old boy.

1352
01:38:06,072 --> 01:38:07,505
So, what's his plan?

1353
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:09,573
I haven't a clue.

1354
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:18,343
Will the witness repeat
this oath after me?

1355
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:22,888
"I swear by God the
Almighty and Omniscient..."

1356
01:38:23,589 --> 01:38:25,921
I swear by God the
Almighty and Omniscient...

1357
01:38:26,125 --> 01:38:28,491
"that I will speak
the pure truth...

1358
01:38:28,628 --> 01:38:30,755
"and will withhold
and add nothing."

1359
01:38:30,997 --> 01:38:34,694
That I will speak the pure truth
and will withhold and add nothing.

1360
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:38,469
Mr Chief Prosecutor?

1361
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,283
You are perhaps aware that you
are the only living man...

1362
01:38:57,657 --> 01:38:59,215
who can expound to us...

1363
01:38:59,292 --> 01:39:01,444
the true purposes of
the Nazi Party and

1364
01:39:01,445 --> 01:39:03,490
the inner workings
of its leadership.

1365
01:39:03,663 --> 01:39:05,221
I am perfectly aware of that.

1366
01:39:05,298 --> 01:39:06,959
You, from the very beginning...

1367
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:10,298
together with those who you
were associated with...

1368
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:13,566
intended to overthrow, and
later on did overthrow...

1369
01:39:13,973 --> 01:39:17,170
Germany's previous government,
the Weimar Republic?

1370
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:18,870
That was my firm intention.

1371
01:39:19,112 --> 01:39:20,854
And upon coming to power you

1372
01:39:20,855 --> 01:39:23,344
immediately abolished
parliamentary...

1373
01:39:23,683 --> 01:39:25,548
democratic government in Germany.

1374
01:39:26,152 --> 01:39:28,120
We found it no longer
to be necessary.

1375
01:39:28,521 --> 01:39:31,285
Is it not true that people
were subsequently thrown...

1376
01:39:31,357 --> 01:39:34,554
into concentration camps without
recourse from the courts?

1377
01:39:34,627 --> 01:39:37,187
You must distinguish
between two categories.

1378
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:40,733
Those who had committed a treason
against the new state...

1379
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:42,560
were turned over to the courts.

1380
01:39:42,635 --> 01:39:44,865
Others, of whom one might
expect such acts...

1381
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:46,700
but who had not yet
committed them...

1382
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:49,241
such as functionaries of
the Communist Party...

1383
01:39:49,308 --> 01:39:50,707
who were attacking us...

1384
01:39:50,777 --> 01:39:52,176
You answered the question.

1385
01:39:52,378 --> 01:39:53,845
I need to explain further.

1386
01:39:53,913 --> 01:39:56,040
You'll have the
opportunity to explain...

1387
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:58,379
under re-examination
from your own counsel.

1388
01:39:59,886 --> 01:40:04,016
Did you prohibit all court review
of the cause for taking people...

1389
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:06,684
into what you were calling
"protective custody"?

1390
01:40:06,759 --> 01:40:09,990
That I answered very clearly, but
I'd like to make an explanation...

1391
01:40:10,062 --> 01:40:11,290
about my answer.

1392
01:40:11,364 --> 01:40:13,855
Your counsel will see to
that. About the camps...

1393
01:40:13,933 --> 01:40:15,423
Mr Justice Jackson.

1394
01:40:15,501 --> 01:40:18,334
The Tribunal thinks the witness
must be allowed to make...

1395
01:40:18,438 --> 01:40:21,464
what explanation he thinks right
in answer to this question.

1396
01:40:28,247 --> 01:40:30,715
The Tribunal thinks that
you should be permitted...

1397
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:32,648
to explain your answer now...

1398
01:40:32,718 --> 01:40:35,278
and it will listen
to that explanation.

1399
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,983
I want to say that I
issued a decree...

1400
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:44,120
that those who were turned over
to the concentration camps...

1401
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:48,093
should be informed after
24 hours of the reason...

1402
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,929
and allowed an attorney
after 48 hours.

1403
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:54,461
This by no means rescinded my
order that a court review...

1404
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,599
of these measures
was not permitted.

1405
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,507
By "protective
custody" you mean...

1406
01:40:58,578 --> 01:41:01,672
taking people in custody who had
not yet committed a crime...

1407
01:41:01,747 --> 01:41:04,238
but you believed might commit
a crime in the future?

1408
01:41:04,317 --> 01:41:06,366
Yes, just as extensive
protective measures

1409
01:41:06,367 --> 01:41:08,083
are being taken in
Germany today...

1410
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,553
I didn't ask you
about Germany today.

1411
01:41:10,656 --> 01:41:11,953
Mr Justice Jackson.

1412
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:13,785
This is poor preparation.

1413
01:41:16,496 --> 01:41:19,090
The witness may finish
his explanation.

1414
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:36,813
You say that you were against
the attack on Soviet Russia.

1415
01:41:37,116 --> 01:41:40,017
Yet you gave no warning
to the German people.

1416
01:41:40,553 --> 01:41:42,817
You brought no pressure
to bear to prevent it.

1417
01:41:43,089 --> 01:41:45,717
You did not even resign to
protect your place in history.

1418
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:47,585
We were at war, and
such differences

1419
01:41:47,586 --> 01:41:49,283
of opinion could not be brought...

1420
01:41:49,362 --> 01:41:51,387
before the public during war.

1421
01:41:51,464 --> 01:41:53,295
This was the case in
your own country.

1422
01:41:53,366 --> 01:41:55,129
- Your second question...
- That'll suffice.

1423
01:41:55,201 --> 01:41:56,862
I'm not finished. Secondly...

1424
01:41:56,936 --> 01:41:57,936
Your Honour, please.

1425
01:41:57,937 --> 01:42:00,395
The witness must be
allowed to have his say.

1426
01:42:01,607 --> 01:42:03,575
As far as my resignation...

1427
01:42:03,643 --> 01:42:05,941
I do not wish even
to discuss that...

1428
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:08,543
for I was an officer, a soldier.

1429
01:42:08,948 --> 01:42:10,381
I served my country.

1430
01:42:10,449 --> 01:42:11,473
- I ask you...
- Thirdly...

1431
01:42:11,551 --> 01:42:12,551
Your Honour, please.

1432
01:42:12,618 --> 01:42:13,618
Thirdly...

1433
01:42:13,619 --> 01:42:16,044
I was not the man to
forsake someone...

1434
01:42:16,122 --> 01:42:18,352
to whom I had given
my oath of loyalty...

1435
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,688
every time he was not
to my way of thinking.

1436
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,760
Your Honour...

1437
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:24,758
It never, ever occurred to
me to leave the Führer.

1438
01:42:26,966 --> 01:42:29,434
The witness is adopting a
contemptuous attitude...

1439
01:42:29,502 --> 01:42:30,560
toward this Tribunal...

1440
01:42:30,636 --> 01:42:33,901
which is giving him trial that
he never gave a living soul...

1441
01:42:33,973 --> 01:42:35,372
nor dead ones either.

1442
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:37,170
Objection, Your Honour.

1443
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,878
I'm ready for the next question.

1444
01:42:56,062 --> 01:42:59,122
I think this is probably a good
point to adjourn for the day.

1445
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:26,382
Tough calls from the bench.

1446
01:43:26,993 --> 01:43:28,620
Well, it's only Round One.

1447
01:43:29,662 --> 01:43:32,426
If you think you need anything,
don't forget, I'm here.

1448
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:01,318
As the week ends, there's a
consensus among all present...

1449
01:44:01,494 --> 01:44:04,895
that Hermann Göring now appears
to be in control of the court.

1450
01:44:05,431 --> 01:44:09,197
Will Jackson? Will anyone
be able to stop him?

1451
01:44:13,305 --> 01:44:14,305
Yes, Bob?

1452
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:20,944
You know, Judge, I didn't leave
the Supreme Court to come here...

1453
01:44:21,013 --> 01:44:23,243
and be thwarted by a
fellow countrymen.

1454
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:26,681
That sounds like sour
grapes. Very unbecoming.

1455
01:44:26,986 --> 01:44:29,144
To an outsider, it
might appear like

1456
01:44:29,145 --> 01:44:31,013
you were trying to sabotage me.

1457
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:35,827
You gave Göring an open forum
during direct examination.

1458
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:38,090
I must be able to control
him during cross.

1459
01:44:39,632 --> 01:44:41,410
Just accept the fact
that you weren't

1460
01:44:41,411 --> 01:44:42,863
at the top of your game today.

1461
01:44:43,703 --> 01:44:46,171
You have the weekend to
prepare for the next round.

1462
01:44:46,872 --> 01:44:48,100
Make good use of it.

1463
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,901
- Not hungry, sir?
- I'm too excited to eat.

1464
01:45:25,411 --> 01:45:26,935
Did you hear what I said?

1465
01:45:27,179 --> 01:45:29,773
My reply when he asked
me why I did not resign?

1466
01:45:30,349 --> 01:45:31,941
I lectured him about loyalty.

1467
01:45:32,051 --> 01:45:34,144
You should have seen
Jackson's face.

1468
01:45:34,887 --> 01:45:37,378
It was a completely
foreign concept to him.

1469
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:40,323
If I didn't know better, I
would say Jackson was a Jew.

1470
01:45:41,594 --> 01:45:42,788
No. Keep it.

1471
01:45:44,497 --> 01:45:46,692
My initials, see? Engraved.

1472
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,062
It's real nice.

1473
01:45:50,669 --> 01:45:51,727
I'll never forget this.

1474
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,431
I know, Leutnant. I know.

1475
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,534
Sit down.

1476
01:45:56,809 --> 01:46:00,142
You know, my friends call me Tex.

1477
01:46:01,413 --> 01:46:03,005
All right, Tex.

1478
01:46:03,783 --> 01:46:05,978
Let me tell you something, Tex.

1479
01:46:06,051 --> 01:46:09,384
America will soon learn that they
are backing the wrong philosophy.

1480
01:46:09,455 --> 01:46:12,322
We should both be together
fighting the forces of Communism.

1481
01:46:13,092 --> 01:46:14,320
- You think?
- Yeah.

1482
01:46:15,161 --> 01:46:16,253
You think?

1483
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:17,621
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1484
01:46:18,297 --> 01:46:20,322
- I think we both agree, no?
- Yeah.

1485
01:46:26,138 --> 01:46:28,003
I'd like to dictate a telegram.

1486
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:39,815
President Truman, the White House.

1487
01:46:39,885 --> 01:46:41,881
"Please accept my
resignation as Chief

1488
01:46:41,882 --> 01:46:43,878
Prosecutor for the
Nuremberg trials...

1489
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:47,157
"and appoint a replacement
at the earliest possible..."

1490
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:50,253
I'm not writing this. I won't.

1491
01:46:53,566 --> 01:46:56,592
You saw today that I'm
not up to this task.

1492
01:46:56,902 --> 01:47:01,100
I could stay, out of pride,
and unravel everything...

1493
01:47:01,173 --> 01:47:04,370
we've all worked so hard
for. Or I can step aside...

1494
01:47:04,443 --> 01:47:06,070
Bob, you are this trial.

1495
01:47:06,412 --> 01:47:09,848
Everything it is, everything it
represents, is from inside you.

1496
01:47:09,915 --> 01:47:11,746
Your thoughts, your values.

1497
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:13,716
I tasted failure today...

1498
01:47:14,453 --> 01:47:17,251
and realised what it would
mean. Not only to myself...

1499
01:47:17,323 --> 01:47:19,348
but to everyone
connected with this.

1500
01:47:19,425 --> 01:47:21,825
The only way they can
triumph over you...

1501
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:24,192
is if their values are
stronger than yours.

1502
01:47:24,363 --> 01:47:27,662
If they believe in their ideals
more than you believe in yours.

1503
01:47:29,368 --> 01:47:30,528
Is that true, Bob?

1504
01:47:32,304 --> 01:47:34,864
Does Hermann Göring actually
believe in his ideals...

1505
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,033
more than you believe in yours?

1506
01:48:10,342 --> 01:48:11,673
You're right.

1507
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:14,946
And thank you.

1508
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:28,020
You're welcome.

1509
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:01,951
Now, look here. What happened
wasn't entirely your fault.

1510
01:49:03,128 --> 01:49:06,120
God knows, I'd be hard-pressed
to defeat a clever defendant...

1511
01:49:06,198 --> 01:49:09,690
who's allowed to say whatever he
wants for as long as he wants.

1512
01:49:10,302 --> 01:49:13,533
Now that you've finished with the
niceties, let's have the truth.

1513
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:17,566
Well, it was very
damaging, Robert.

1514
01:49:19,144 --> 01:49:22,272
You've introduced this trial from
a position of moral superiority.

1515
01:49:22,548 --> 01:49:25,142
And as a result, you've
become its chief symbol.

1516
01:49:25,918 --> 01:49:27,476
If you can't maintain that...

1517
01:49:27,553 --> 01:49:30,784
or if the balance shifts ever so
slightly it could be a disaster.

1518
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:33,783
Hermann Göring is
using this trial...

1519
01:49:33,993 --> 01:49:35,276
to present himself as a

1520
01:49:35,277 --> 01:49:37,622
philosopher-statesman
on Hitler's level.

1521
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,127
Do you see Göring as a statesman?

1522
01:49:40,466 --> 01:49:43,993
No, I do not. I see
him as reprehensible.

1523
01:49:44,837 --> 01:49:45,997
As inhuman.

1524
01:49:46,071 --> 01:49:47,402
Then treat him as such.

1525
01:49:47,673 --> 01:49:49,766
Treat him as the
vile, conniving...

1526
01:49:49,842 --> 01:49:52,174
bloody fascist bastard that he is.

1527
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,618
Where the hell is he?

1528
01:50:05,691 --> 01:50:06,885
He'll be here.

1529
01:50:33,352 --> 01:50:35,980
Mr Chief Prosecutor,
if you are ready.

1530
01:50:36,889 --> 01:50:38,705
From the very
beginning, you regarded

1531
01:50:38,706 --> 01:50:40,188
the elimination of the Jews...

1532
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:42,183
from the economic
life of Germany as

1533
01:50:42,184 --> 01:50:44,161
under your jurisdiction,
did you not?

1534
01:50:44,496 --> 01:50:46,530
Yeah. The elimination
from economic

1535
01:50:46,531 --> 01:50:48,227
life, that is partly correct.

1536
01:50:48,934 --> 01:50:52,961
Large industries, also armament
industries under Jewish directors.

1537
01:50:53,305 --> 01:50:56,172
Was that the first of your legal
measures against the Jews?

1538
01:50:56,241 --> 01:50:58,766
I believe removal from
office was first, in 1933.

1539
01:50:59,011 --> 01:51:02,879
Then, in 1936, you
personally drafted an act...

1540
01:51:03,315 --> 01:51:06,773
making it punishable by death
to transfer property abroad?

1541
01:51:06,919 --> 01:51:08,011
That is correct.

1542
01:51:08,087 --> 01:51:11,784
And another that all damage
caused to Jewish property...

1543
01:51:12,324 --> 01:51:14,792
by the anti-Jewish
riots of 1938...

1544
01:51:14,927 --> 01:51:17,418
must be repaired by Jews
at their own expense...

1545
01:51:17,996 --> 01:51:21,056
with their insurance claims
forfeited to the Reich.

1546
01:51:21,567 --> 01:51:24,661
I did sign a similar law. Whether
it was exactly the same, I...

1547
01:51:25,204 --> 01:51:27,695
And did you not say
about those riots...

1548
01:51:28,907 --> 01:51:30,670
I show you this transcript.

1549
01:51:32,277 --> 01:51:35,804
Did you not say, "I wish
you had killed 200 Jews...

1550
01:51:36,048 --> 01:51:38,209
"instead of destroying
such valuables"?

1551
01:51:38,484 --> 01:51:41,715
That was said in a moment of bad
temper and extreme excitement.

1552
01:51:41,954 --> 01:51:44,354
Spontaneous sincerity,
in other words.

1553
01:51:45,357 --> 01:51:48,952
Did you not also personally sign
a decree in September, 1940...

1554
01:51:49,128 --> 01:51:51,688
ordering seizure of all
Jewish property in Poland?

1555
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:53,693
I assume so, if the
decree is there.

1556
01:51:53,765 --> 01:51:56,928
And another, which provided that
Jews receive no compensation...

1557
01:51:57,002 --> 01:52:01,098
for damages caused by enemy
attacks or by German forces?

1558
01:52:01,173 --> 01:52:03,403
If the law bears my name,
then it must be so.

1559
01:52:06,578 --> 01:52:07,943
Is this your signature?

1560
01:52:09,748 --> 01:52:10,806
It appears to be.

1561
01:52:10,883 --> 01:52:13,681
Is it, or is it not,
your signature?

1562
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,160
It is.

1563
01:52:23,462 --> 01:52:25,089
Your signature...

1564
01:52:25,597 --> 01:52:29,829
on a decree dated July,
1941 asking Himmler...

1565
01:52:30,602 --> 01:52:33,093
and Heydrich and the
SS to make plans...

1566
01:52:33,338 --> 01:52:35,806
for the "final solution"
of the Jewish question.

1567
01:52:35,874 --> 01:52:37,933
That is not a proper translation.

1568
01:52:39,278 --> 01:52:41,746
I said "total" solution,
not "final" solution.

1569
01:52:41,813 --> 01:52:43,872
These are your words to Himmler:

1570
01:52:44,416 --> 01:52:47,715
"I charge you to send me before
long an overall plan concerning...

1571
01:52:47,819 --> 01:52:51,016
"the organisational, factual and
material measures necessary...

1572
01:52:51,356 --> 01:52:53,984
"for the desired solution
of the Jewish question."

1573
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:57,076
Is that an accurate
translation of this

1574
01:52:57,077 --> 01:52:58,994
order from you to
Heydrich and Himmler?

1575
01:52:59,064 --> 01:53:02,056
That had to do with emigration
and evacuation of the Jews.

1576
01:53:02,334 --> 01:53:04,131
You ordered all
government agencies

1577
01:53:04,132 --> 01:53:05,531
to cooperate with the SS...

1578
01:53:05,604 --> 01:53:07,868
in the final solution
of the Jewish question.

1579
01:53:08,273 --> 01:53:10,104
There's nothing in
there about the SS.

1580
01:53:10,175 --> 01:53:11,962
This document states
you personally

1581
01:53:11,963 --> 01:53:13,702
ordered all government agencies...

1582
01:53:13,779 --> 01:53:15,371
to cooperate with the SS.

1583
01:53:15,781 --> 01:53:18,306
You sent this letter to SS
Gruppenführer Heydrich.

1584
01:53:18,383 --> 01:53:19,937
That doesn't mean that the SS had

1585
01:53:19,938 --> 01:53:21,682
anything to do with
the solution...

1586
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:23,380
to the Jewish question.

1587
01:53:33,377 --> 01:53:34,844
I must say this clearly.

1588
01:53:38,349 --> 01:53:40,613
I did not know anything
that took place...

1589
01:53:41,518 --> 01:53:45,181
or the methods that were used in
the concentration camps later.

1590
01:53:45,956 --> 01:53:48,220
These things were
kept secret from me.

1591
01:53:49,693 --> 01:53:51,058
And I might add...

1592
01:53:51,795 --> 01:53:53,524
that in my opinion...

1593
01:53:53,697 --> 01:53:56,825
even the Führer did not know the
extent of what was happening.

1594
01:54:03,841 --> 01:54:06,275
Witness, there is evidence
before this court...

1595
01:54:06,343 --> 01:54:09,141
that nearly 10 million people
have been exterminated.

1596
01:54:10,281 --> 01:54:11,771
Murdered in cold blood.

1597
01:54:11,849 --> 01:54:13,648
You mean to say that
you did not, and

1598
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:15,307
in your opinion, Hitler did not...

1599
01:54:15,386 --> 01:54:17,854
know what took place in
the concentration camps?

1600
01:54:20,658 --> 01:54:21,658
Yeah.

1601
01:54:23,928 --> 01:54:26,294
Do you know that
Hitler said in 1943...

1602
01:54:26,964 --> 01:54:30,024
in a recorded meeting, I
read you his words now.

1603
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:33,126
Quote: "The Reich's Minister
of Foreign Affairs...

1604
01:54:33,237 --> 01:54:36,001
"declared that the Jews
should be exterminated...

1605
01:54:37,207 --> 01:54:39,175
"or taken to concentration camps.

1606
01:54:41,178 --> 01:54:43,078
"There is no other possibility."

1607
01:54:44,114 --> 01:54:47,083
The Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Ribbentrop...

1608
01:54:47,751 --> 01:54:49,912
talked with Hitler
about extermination.

1609
01:54:49,987 --> 01:54:52,581
And you were above Ribbentrop.

1610
01:54:52,723 --> 01:54:54,714
You were Hitler's
second-in-command.

1611
01:54:54,892 --> 01:54:57,588
You were in charge of the
economic Four Year Plan...

1612
01:54:57,661 --> 01:55:00,129
so you knew all about the
gold wedding rings...

1613
01:55:00,197 --> 01:55:02,382
the gold teeth and
the gold eyeglasses

1614
01:55:02,383 --> 01:55:04,065
that the victims left behind.

1615
01:55:04,368 --> 01:55:07,428
And you have heard that it
took five extra minutes...

1616
01:55:07,538 --> 01:55:10,598
to kill the women because they
had to cut their hair off...

1617
01:55:10,674 --> 01:55:13,040
to be used in making mattresses.

1618
01:55:13,677 --> 01:55:16,544
And nothing was told to you...

1619
01:55:16,613 --> 01:55:18,326
about this material that came from

1620
01:55:18,327 --> 01:55:20,242
these people that
had been murdered?

1621
01:55:20,484 --> 01:55:21,484
No.

1622
01:55:23,821 --> 01:55:24,821
No.

1623
01:55:26,357 --> 01:55:28,450
How can you imagine such a thing?

1624
01:55:31,495 --> 01:55:35,261
I was laying down the broad
outlines of the German economy.

1625
01:55:38,736 --> 01:55:40,897
- The witness is excused.
- I'm not finished.

1626
01:55:40,971 --> 01:55:43,201
- The witness is excused.
- I am not finished.

1627
01:55:43,941 --> 01:55:45,875
The witness is excused.

1628
01:56:23,514 --> 01:56:25,379
You know what would've
been a great touch?

1629
01:56:25,449 --> 01:56:27,883
Hermann Göring showing
up in a Santa outfit.

1630
01:56:28,919 --> 01:56:30,386
He'd probably do it.

1631
01:56:30,454 --> 01:56:33,321
After all, he was the Third
Reich's chief bon vivant.

1632
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:36,484
Did you ever see pictures of him
at Hitler's mountain retreat...

1633
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,462
dressed like a
Tyrollean chorus boy

1634
01:56:38,463 --> 01:56:40,155
out of some grotesque operetta?

1635
01:56:52,476 --> 01:56:53,476
Excuse me.

1636
01:56:58,282 --> 01:56:59,408
Leaving so soon?

1637
01:56:59,883 --> 01:57:02,374
Some of the defendants asked
me to come by tonight.

1638
01:57:02,453 --> 01:57:04,785
A little Christmas Eve
chat with their rabbi.

1639
01:57:07,858 --> 01:57:09,704
You know the trial
is about to enter

1640
01:57:09,705 --> 01:57:11,453
a new phase, a very important one.

1641
01:57:11,528 --> 01:57:13,586
The defendants will have to choose

1642
01:57:13,587 --> 01:57:15,828
between stonewalling
and evading...

1643
01:57:15,933 --> 01:57:18,265
or taking responsibility
for their actions.

1644
01:57:18,335 --> 01:57:23,796
Now, you are the best chance we
have to influence that choice.

1645
01:57:42,893 --> 01:57:43,893
Frau Hassel?

1646
01:57:44,862 --> 01:57:46,090
Is something wrong?

1647
01:57:46,396 --> 01:57:48,830
Do not ask me to serve
the Russians. Please.

1648
01:57:49,233 --> 01:57:50,427
They're our guests.

1649
01:57:51,502 --> 01:57:53,629
My son was killed on
the Russian front.

1650
01:57:55,606 --> 01:57:58,040
Okay. I'll take care of
this. Go to the kitchen.

1651
01:58:03,247 --> 01:58:05,511
Try these little sausage
things, General.

1652
01:58:05,582 --> 01:58:07,401
I forget what Frau
Hassel calls them,

1653
01:58:07,402 --> 01:58:08,983
but I hear they're mighty tasty.

1654
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,220
Madame.

1655
01:58:11,889 --> 01:58:14,983
20 million of my people
were killed by the Germans.

1656
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:19,293
Do you think I could be offended
by the snub of a Hausfrau?

1657
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:22,095
I don't know what
to think, General.

1658
01:58:22,166 --> 01:58:25,101
Frankly, I can't keep track of
all the politics in this room.

1659
01:58:39,049 --> 01:58:41,677
The Russians sure don't
disappear in a crowd, do they?

1660
01:58:41,818 --> 01:58:42,978
Politics.

1661
01:58:43,787 --> 01:58:47,052
They've suffered more in this
war than any other country.

1662
01:58:47,691 --> 01:58:51,024
Must be doubly painful to attract
such little sympathy for them.

1663
01:58:58,969 --> 01:59:02,097
And Jackson decreed no
wives could come along.

1664
01:59:05,742 --> 01:59:08,210
Worked out quite nicely for
him, wouldn't you say?

1665
01:59:54,891 --> 01:59:56,153
Merry Christmas.

1666
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:02,355
This was a very nice gesture.

1667
02:01:05,996 --> 02:01:08,464
I figured it's probably
their last Christmas.

1668
02:01:16,506 --> 02:01:18,064
Merry Christmas, Colonel.

1669
02:01:31,355 --> 02:01:33,220
- Field Marshal.
- Doctor.

1670
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:34,514
How are you?

1671
02:01:34,991 --> 02:01:36,720
I'm so glad that you are here.

1672
02:01:37,527 --> 02:01:41,224
Please, sit. You are the only
one I can really talk to.

1673
02:01:42,132 --> 02:01:45,693
But you don't talk to me,
Field Marshal. Not really.

1674
02:01:46,603 --> 02:01:48,496
I tell you everything
about my family.

1675
02:01:48,497 --> 02:01:49,497
Yes.

1676
02:01:49,498 --> 02:01:50,839
But not about you.

1677
02:01:52,509 --> 02:01:55,137
I would like to understand
how a man like you...

1678
02:01:55,212 --> 02:01:56,839
a man of your background...

1679
02:01:56,913 --> 02:02:00,280
could have drafted an instrument
like the Commando Order.

1680
02:02:00,884 --> 02:02:03,910
Allied soldiers found behind
enemy lines were shot...

1681
02:02:04,254 --> 02:02:05,653
rather than captured?

1682
02:02:05,856 --> 02:02:08,723
Or the Night and Fog Decree:
Suspected Resistance members...

1683
02:02:08,792 --> 02:02:12,057
were arrested in the middle of
the night and secretly murdered.

1684
02:02:14,631 --> 02:02:15,928
Because of you.

1685
02:02:19,636 --> 02:02:22,571
I know. I am dying of shame.

1686
02:02:26,109 --> 02:02:27,965
Don't you think it's
time you admitted

1687
02:02:27,966 --> 02:02:29,442
that to the rest of the world?

1688
02:02:57,674 --> 02:03:00,370
I'm not in the mood, all right.

1689
02:03:01,044 --> 02:03:02,136
Get off me.

1690
02:03:02,212 --> 02:03:03,212
Get off.

1691
02:03:21,164 --> 02:03:24,361
You were signing orders that broke
international laws and treaties.

1692
02:03:24,434 --> 02:03:26,561
How could you not question
what you were doing?

1693
02:03:26,636 --> 02:03:28,488
Does a lieutenant
say to his captain,

1694
02:03:28,489 --> 02:03:30,538
"Just a minute, sir,
I have to consult...

1695
02:03:30,607 --> 02:03:32,594
"the Hague Convention
to see if I am

1696
02:03:32,595 --> 02:03:34,475
allowed to carry out your orders?"

1697
02:03:35,145 --> 02:03:37,613
If we had disobeyed, we
would have been arrested.

1698
02:03:37,681 --> 02:03:38,681
Rightly so.

1699
02:03:38,682 --> 02:03:41,674
You realise without the support
of his generals, Herr Jodl...

1700
02:03:41,751 --> 02:03:43,651
Hitler could not have waged war.

1701
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,515
It is a soldier's duty
is to obey orders.

1702
02:03:48,358 --> 02:03:50,849
That is a code I have
lived by all my life.

1703
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:53,828
And that code extends to the
people who ran the death camps?

1704
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:28,254
I'm sorry, sir.

1705
02:04:29,065 --> 02:04:32,228
Tex, my friend. Come in.

1706
02:04:33,537 --> 02:04:35,232
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1707
02:04:35,305 --> 02:04:36,602
It's good to see you.

1708
02:04:38,308 --> 02:04:42,267
I know that Christmastime can be
a lonely thing away from home.

1709
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:45,543
Merry Christmas, Reichsmarschall.

1710
02:04:45,615 --> 02:04:48,641
My dear Tex, what luxury.

1711
02:04:52,589 --> 02:04:53,589
Prost.

1712
02:04:57,027 --> 02:04:58,358
- Cognac.
- Yeah.

1713
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:03,795
So what would you be
doing now back in Texas?

1714
02:05:05,168 --> 02:05:06,998
On Christmas morning,
we'd open our

1715
02:05:06,999 --> 02:05:08,626
presents and then go to church.

1716
02:05:09,272 --> 02:05:11,638
Then, we'd head over to
Grandma and Grandpa's...

1717
02:05:11,708 --> 02:05:13,608
for a big roast turkey dinner.

1718
02:05:14,077 --> 02:05:16,238
After that, Dad, Grandpa and me...

1719
02:05:16,913 --> 02:05:19,347
we'd go out back hunting
for pheasant, quail.

1720
02:05:20,216 --> 02:05:22,343
Hunting. Hunting was my passion.

1721
02:05:23,153 --> 02:05:25,178
I was Germany's chief gamekeeper.

1722
02:05:25,255 --> 02:05:26,279
No kidding.

1723
02:05:26,356 --> 02:05:29,291
The shooting around my estates
at Carinhall was wonderful.

1724
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:32,725
Did Hitler ever go
hunting with you?

1725
02:05:35,532 --> 02:05:39,491
I shouldn't tell you this, but
Hitler did not approve of hunting.

1726
02:05:40,136 --> 02:05:42,661
He felt that killing
animals was immoral.

1727
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,469
- He was a vegetarian.
- Yeah?

1728
02:05:45,709 --> 02:05:47,404
Yes. He was a vegetarian.

1729
02:05:49,913 --> 02:05:51,847
Yeah, but that did
not stop him from

1730
02:05:51,848 --> 02:05:53,940
being the most gracious
host in Europe.

1731
02:05:55,619 --> 02:05:57,676
His dinner parties
were legend. Always

1732
02:05:57,677 --> 02:05:59,419
the finest caviar and champagne.

1733
02:05:59,856 --> 02:06:02,791
Thought he did not partake,
he was not intolerant.

1734
02:06:03,226 --> 02:06:06,088
He would dazzle his
guests with every

1735
02:06:06,089 --> 02:06:08,425
view under the sun until dawn.

1736
02:06:10,066 --> 02:06:12,503
I remember once we
were celebrating

1737
02:06:12,504 --> 02:06:14,400
the triumph of Compiégne...

1738
02:06:15,038 --> 02:06:17,097
where we savoured the
sweet revenge...

1739
02:06:17,173 --> 02:06:20,836
of the French having surrendered
in the very same railway car...

1740
02:06:20,944 --> 02:06:23,708
that the Germans had
capitulated in, in 1918.

1741
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:25,338
That must've been something.

1742
02:06:25,615 --> 02:06:28,140
It was, believe me.

1743
02:06:29,552 --> 02:06:30,678
It was.

1744
02:06:33,423 --> 02:06:37,917
You know...

1745
02:06:37,994 --> 02:06:40,758
I have made my career
as a military man...

1746
02:06:42,265 --> 02:06:45,359
and I have to say you remind me...

1747
02:06:46,403 --> 02:06:49,895
of some of the finest young German
soldiers who served under me.

1748
02:06:53,810 --> 02:06:54,810
Thank you.

1749
02:06:56,446 --> 02:06:57,538
Merry Christmas.

1750
02:07:13,396 --> 02:07:14,658
Hello, America.

1751
02:07:15,398 --> 02:07:18,526
As Christmas descends upon
this sad and broken city...

1752
02:07:19,402 --> 02:07:22,235
I'm here, inside her
great Palace of Justice.

1753
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:25,608
And on this Christmas
Eve, as we're

1754
02:07:25,609 --> 02:07:27,906
filled with thoughts
of peace on Earth...

1755
02:07:28,812 --> 02:07:31,474
it is here that the
future of peace...

1756
02:07:32,048 --> 02:07:33,777
may well be determined.

1757
02:07:42,492 --> 02:07:45,586
Herr von Ribbentrop, would you
agree that as Foreign Minister...

1758
02:07:45,662 --> 02:07:48,495
you forced Czechoslovakia to
surrender its territory...

1759
02:07:48,565 --> 02:07:50,863
by the most intolerable
threats of aggression?

1760
02:07:50,934 --> 02:07:52,424
I do not agree.

1761
02:07:52,702 --> 02:07:54,636
You threatened to
send your army in.

1762
02:07:55,004 --> 02:07:56,437
In overwhelming strength.

1763
02:07:56,673 --> 02:07:58,470
And also bomb Prague.

1764
02:07:59,175 --> 02:08:02,042
What further pressure could you
possibly have put upon them?

1765
02:08:02,612 --> 02:08:04,011
War, for instance.

1766
02:08:04,447 --> 02:08:05,447
War?

1767
02:08:07,851 --> 02:08:09,409
What is that but war?

1768
02:08:12,789 --> 02:08:15,917
Ribbentrop should be
hanged for his stupidity.

1769
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:19,024
That is the greatest crime of all.

1770
02:08:25,001 --> 02:08:26,901
In your newspaper,
Herr Streicher...

1771
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:29,302
you wrote that the
Jews are "a nation

1772
02:08:29,303 --> 02:08:31,229
of bloodsuckers and
extortionists."

1773
02:08:32,008 --> 02:08:34,169
Do you think that's
preaching race hatred?

1774
02:08:34,244 --> 02:08:37,008
No. I do not think it's
preaching race hatred.

1775
02:08:37,213 --> 02:08:39,613
It is simply a statement of fact.

1776
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:44,720
Dr Funk...

1777
02:08:45,088 --> 02:08:48,057
you were President of the
Reichsbank during the war?

1778
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:49,182
I was, yes.

1779
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:52,453
And you accepted unusual deposits
into your bank, didn't you?

1780
02:08:52,996 --> 02:08:54,827
I do not know what you refer to.

1781
02:08:54,898 --> 02:08:57,204
I am referring to
deposits sent to you

1782
02:08:57,205 --> 02:08:59,335
by the SS from
concentration camps.

1783
02:08:59,502 --> 02:09:01,436
I have no knowledge of...

1784
02:09:01,504 --> 02:09:03,395
Inside the Reichsbank
vaults, there

1785
02:09:03,396 --> 02:09:05,235
were literally piles of jewellery.

1786
02:09:05,675 --> 02:09:09,611
Gold watches, gold earrings,
gold eyeglass frames.

1787
02:09:10,313 --> 02:09:11,678
And gold teeth.

1788
02:09:12,382 --> 02:09:15,180
Many people deposit
valuables in a bank...

1789
02:09:15,451 --> 02:09:17,919
and the bank is not
required to look into them.

1790
02:09:18,655 --> 02:09:21,852
Prior to 1939, exactly how
many of your customers...

1791
02:09:22,025 --> 02:09:24,425
deposited their teeth
into your bank?

1792
02:09:35,338 --> 02:09:38,432
You've heard a guard at Mauthausen
concentration camp testify...

1793
02:09:38,508 --> 02:09:40,435
that you watched while the gas

1794
02:09:40,436 --> 02:09:42,877
chamber was demonstrated
on inmates.

1795
02:09:43,413 --> 02:09:46,075
I never set foot in Mauthausen.

1796
02:09:46,316 --> 02:09:49,752
And we have heard eyewitness
testimony from three people...

1797
02:09:49,819 --> 02:09:51,980
that you were at
Mauthausen three times.

1798
02:09:52,055 --> 02:09:53,055
They are lying.

1799
02:09:53,056 --> 02:09:54,084
And before he died...

1800
02:09:54,157 --> 02:09:56,887
the commandant at Mauthausen
signed this statement...

1801
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,986
that you ordered him to put 65,000

1802
02:09:58,987 --> 02:10:01,192
Jews in a tunnel
and seal it off...

1803
02:10:01,264 --> 02:10:03,994
rather than allow them to
be liberated by the Allies.

1804
02:10:04,067 --> 02:10:05,067
He is lying.

1805
02:10:05,068 --> 02:10:06,777
Is it not a fact
that you are lying

1806
02:10:06,778 --> 02:10:08,231
to the Tribunal about this...

1807
02:10:08,304 --> 02:10:11,034
as you lied about everything
else in your testimony?

1808
02:10:11,107 --> 02:10:12,301
That is also a lie.

1809
02:10:19,849 --> 02:10:21,880
Kaltenbrunner has
asked the commandant

1810
02:10:21,881 --> 02:10:23,808
of Auschwitz testify
in his defence.

1811
02:10:24,954 --> 02:10:26,591
If that's a joke, I don't get it.

1812
02:10:26,592 --> 02:10:28,549
I don't get it either,
but it's no joke.

1813
02:10:28,625 --> 02:10:30,524
The British have
him in custody and

1814
02:10:30,525 --> 02:10:32,584
agree to transfer him
here to testify.

1815
02:10:32,795 --> 02:10:35,730
Maybe he just figures he'll
look better by comparison.

1816
02:10:36,332 --> 02:10:38,323
We're not going to
allow this, are we?

1817
02:10:38,401 --> 02:10:40,451
Let the guy walk in,
say God knows what on

1818
02:10:40,452 --> 02:10:42,360
the stand, give
Kaltenbrunner an alibi?

1819
02:10:43,306 --> 02:10:45,557
Might be a cheap
price to pay for the

1820
02:10:45,558 --> 02:10:47,572
opportunity to cross-examine him.

1821
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:53,877
During the entire time you were
commandant of Auschwitz...

1822
02:10:54,784 --> 02:10:58,117
did Ernst Kaltenbrunner
ever visit the camp?

1823
02:10:59,054 --> 02:11:00,054
No.

1824
02:11:00,056 --> 02:11:01,056
Not once?

1825
02:11:05,762 --> 02:11:06,762
Never.

1826
02:11:08,765 --> 02:11:09,765
Thank you.

1827
02:11:11,501 --> 02:11:13,025
One minute, please.

1828
02:11:22,979 --> 02:11:24,037
Mr Hoess.

1829
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,779
How long were you commandant of
Auschwitz concentration camp?

1830
02:11:28,584 --> 02:11:29,744
From the beginning.

1831
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:31,252
And what was its purpose?

1832
02:11:31,454 --> 02:11:32,751
At that time...

1833
02:11:32,822 --> 02:11:36,087
to house prisoners who were being
held in protective custody.

1834
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:37,984
And after that?

1835
02:11:38,494 --> 02:11:41,224
I was called to
Berlin by my boss...

1836
02:11:41,464 --> 02:11:44,058
Reichsführer Himmler, in 1941.

1837
02:11:44,834 --> 02:11:48,736
And he informed me that
the Führer had ordered...

1838
02:11:48,805 --> 02:11:51,433
the final solution of
the Jewish question.

1839
02:11:52,041 --> 02:11:54,805
I was not sure what I
was supposed to do.

1840
02:11:55,645 --> 02:12:00,412
So Adolf Eichmann advised me to
visit a camp at Treblinka...

1841
02:12:00,683 --> 02:12:02,344
to learn from its operation.

1842
02:12:02,418 --> 02:12:04,079
And what did you learn there?

1843
02:12:04,554 --> 02:12:06,647
Actually, I was not impressed.

1844
02:12:07,123 --> 02:12:10,149
It was taking the commandant
there six months...

1845
02:12:10,493 --> 02:12:14,293
to eliminate 80,000 Jews
using monoxide gas.

1846
02:12:15,264 --> 02:12:16,754
I had a better idea.

1847
02:12:17,166 --> 02:12:19,031
One of my Auschwitz guards...

1848
02:12:19,135 --> 02:12:21,585
had accidentally
sniffed a chemical

1849
02:12:21,586 --> 02:12:23,765
disinfectant called Zyklon B...

1850
02:12:24,741 --> 02:12:26,572
and had passed out immediately.

1851
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:31,106
It occurred to me, if a little
of this chemical killed lice...

1852
02:12:31,614 --> 02:12:34,481
enough, perhaps,
would kill a human.

1853
02:12:36,152 --> 02:12:38,166
I tested it on Soviet prisoners of

1854
02:12:38,167 --> 02:12:40,418
war locked in a room,
and it worked.

1855
02:12:40,990 --> 02:12:44,153
Within 3 to 15 minutes,
they were dead.

1856
02:12:46,128 --> 02:12:47,128
And then?

1857
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:49,164
I built gas chambers
to accommodate

1858
02:12:49,165 --> 02:12:50,691
2,000 inmates at a time...

1859
02:12:51,067 --> 02:12:53,194
compared to Treblinka's 200.

1860
02:12:53,603 --> 02:12:56,834
And I built four large ovens
to cremate the remains.

1861
02:12:57,306 --> 02:13:01,367
It became possible to eliminate
10,000 people in 24 hours.

1862
02:13:02,045 --> 02:13:05,742
But that was at peak operation,
which was exhausting for my staff.

1863
02:13:06,449 --> 02:13:09,009
On the average, we
would dispatch...

1864
02:13:09,085 --> 02:13:10,552
2,000 people a day.

1865
02:13:12,255 --> 02:13:16,214
How many men did it take to
dispatch 2,000 people a day?

1866
02:13:16,526 --> 02:13:19,586
I had a staff of
approximately 3,000 men.

1867
02:13:20,797 --> 02:13:23,231
And during your tenure
at Auschwitz...

1868
02:13:23,399 --> 02:13:26,027
how many people did you
dispose of in this fashion?

1869
02:13:26,335 --> 02:13:28,394
Approximately two
and a half million.

1870
02:13:36,979 --> 02:13:38,207
No further questions.

1871
02:13:38,281 --> 02:13:39,805
I wish to make this clear.

1872
02:13:41,217 --> 02:13:43,742
I did not tolerate
gratuitous cruelty.

1873
02:13:45,254 --> 02:13:48,246
My men were there to exterminate
people, not torment them.

1874
02:13:48,991 --> 02:13:51,357
Any misconduct by the
guards was punished.

1875
02:13:51,994 --> 02:13:53,052
I can assure you.

1876
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,661
The witness is excused.

1877
02:14:01,637 --> 02:14:04,504
Court is adjourned until
9:00 tomorrow morning.

1878
02:14:24,594 --> 02:14:26,687
My life was entirely normal.

1879
02:14:27,997 --> 02:14:30,761
Even while doing this
extermination work...

1880
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:34,858
I would say I led a perfectly
normal family life.

1881
02:14:35,571 --> 02:14:37,903
How would you describe that life?

1882
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:40,475
I've always been happiest alone.

1883
02:14:41,277 --> 02:14:44,678
I never had any real intimacy
with my parents, my sisters...

1884
02:14:47,083 --> 02:14:48,311
Do you feel...

1885
02:14:49,519 --> 02:14:52,579
that the Jews you murdered
deserved their fate?

1886
02:14:53,656 --> 02:14:57,387
I have always been taught that
the Jew was an enemy of Germany.

1887
02:14:58,027 --> 02:14:59,865
So when you were
ordered to turn your

1888
02:14:59,866 --> 02:15:01,463
prison camp into a death camp...

1889
02:15:03,166 --> 02:15:07,535
you never once thought what
you were doing was wrong?

1890
02:15:09,038 --> 02:15:10,335
I was an SS man.

1891
02:15:11,107 --> 02:15:13,598
We were trained to obey
orders without thinking.

1892
02:15:14,677 --> 02:15:17,942
Does a rat-catcher think
it is wrong to kill rats?

1893
02:15:38,801 --> 02:15:40,894
A rat catcher catching rats.

1894
02:15:41,971 --> 02:15:43,911
Is that the kind of
thinking it takes to

1895
02:15:43,912 --> 02:15:45,805
carry out state-sanctioned
mass murder?

1896
02:15:45,875 --> 02:15:47,891
Not just blind
obedience, but also a

1897
02:15:47,892 --> 02:15:50,073
belief that your
victims are not human?

1898
02:15:51,881 --> 02:15:54,907
Let me ask you this.
What was Hiroshima?

1899
02:15:55,751 --> 02:15:57,878
Was it not your
medical experiment?

1900
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:00,850
Would America have dropped
bombs as easily on Germany...

1901
02:16:00,923 --> 02:16:04,552
as it did upon Japan, killing
as many civilians as possible?

1902
02:16:05,294 --> 02:16:08,195
I think not. To an
American's sensibility...

1903
02:16:09,131 --> 02:16:12,692
a Caucasian child is considerably
more human than a Japanese child.

1904
02:16:12,768 --> 02:16:14,702
America was at war with Japan.

1905
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:17,603
A country that had attacked
it without provocation.

1906
02:16:17,673 --> 02:16:20,574
You murdered millions
of your own citizens.

1907
02:16:20,643 --> 02:16:23,373
What about the American citizens
of the Japanese race...

1908
02:16:23,446 --> 02:16:26,574
put into "protective custody" in
your own concentration camps?

1909
02:16:26,648 --> 02:16:27,648
That was wrong.

1910
02:16:27,650 --> 02:16:31,051
Why was this not done to Americans
of Italian and German descent?

1911
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:32,587
I said it was wrong.

1912
02:16:33,122 --> 02:16:35,647
What about the Negro
officers in your own army?

1913
02:16:36,058 --> 02:16:38,288
Are they allowed to
command troops in combat?

1914
02:16:38,361 --> 02:16:40,591
Can they sit on the same
buses as the whites?

1915
02:16:40,963 --> 02:16:43,989
Segregation laws in your country
and anti-Semitic laws in mine:

1916
02:16:44,066 --> 02:16:46,193
Are they not just a
difference of degree?

1917
02:16:46,269 --> 02:16:48,760
Let me tell you, from the
beginning of the century...

1918
02:16:48,838 --> 02:16:51,363
through the First War until
the rise of Hitler...

1919
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,670
the freemasonry of the
Jewish merchants...

1920
02:16:53,743 --> 02:16:56,234
consistently undermined
the German economy...

1921
02:16:56,312 --> 02:16:58,170
and the nationhood
of the fatherland.

1922
02:16:58,171 --> 02:17:00,078
That is why we made
anti-Semitic laws.

1923
02:17:00,149 --> 02:17:03,778
And why you, my friend, can never
understand anti-Semitism. Why?

1924
02:17:03,953 --> 02:17:06,922
Because you are a Jew.

1925
02:17:31,347 --> 02:17:33,645
Is defence counsel
ready to proceed?

1926
02:17:33,916 --> 02:17:35,577
Ready, Your Honour.

1927
02:17:36,085 --> 02:17:38,497
Herr Sauckel, from
March, 1942, you

1928
02:17:38,498 --> 02:17:41,045
were in charge of
procuring labour...

1929
02:17:41,157 --> 02:17:43,250
for the war effort. Is that right?

1930
02:17:43,793 --> 02:17:44,793
Ja.

1931
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:48,157
You are aware that it was a crime
under the Hague Convention...

1932
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:50,676
to forcibly deport
citizens of other

1933
02:17:50,677 --> 02:17:52,860
countries to Germany as workers?

1934
02:17:52,935 --> 02:17:53,935
Ja.

1935
02:17:53,936 --> 02:17:56,828
How many foreign workers came
into Germany during your tenure?

1936
02:17:57,306 --> 02:17:59,501
Approximately five million.

1937
02:17:59,675 --> 02:18:01,973
And how many of them
came voluntarily?

1938
02:18:02,278 --> 02:18:04,576
Perhaps 200,000.

1939
02:18:05,614 --> 02:18:07,238
Did you issue these directives

1940
02:18:07,239 --> 02:18:09,243
calling for their
decent treatment?

1941
02:18:09,952 --> 02:18:11,317
I did.

1942
02:18:11,987 --> 02:18:13,586
I ask that these be marked as

1943
02:18:13,587 --> 02:18:15,684
exhibits and accepted
into evidence.

1944
02:18:15,791 --> 02:18:17,156
So ordered.

1945
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:22,229
Herr Sauckel, who ordered you
to procure these workers?

1946
02:18:25,401 --> 02:18:26,401
Speer.

1947
02:18:27,136 --> 02:18:31,232
Albert Speer, Minister of
Armaments. He gave orders to you?

1948
02:18:31,307 --> 02:18:32,307
Ja.

1949
02:18:32,308 --> 02:18:34,175
- And you had to obey them?
- Ja.

1950
02:18:34,243 --> 02:18:37,906
Every worker you brought in,
it was under Speer's orders?

1951
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:39,174
It was.

1952
02:18:39,982 --> 02:18:41,779
No further questions.

1953
02:18:55,498 --> 02:18:57,493
I know this is
unorthodox, Mr Dodd,

1954
02:18:57,494 --> 02:18:59,434
to request an audience with you...

1955
02:18:59,502 --> 02:19:01,663
the man assigned to
cross-examine me.

1956
02:19:01,771 --> 02:19:05,537
There's nothing very orthodox
about this whole trial, Dr Speer.

1957
02:19:05,608 --> 02:19:08,736
My lawyer's trying to talk me out
of confessing to war crimes...

1958
02:19:08,811 --> 02:19:11,075
that might incur
the death penalty.

1959
02:19:11,213 --> 02:19:13,875
I do not wish to hide the
truth just to save my life...

1960
02:19:13,949 --> 02:19:16,383
only to hate myself for
the rest of that life.

1961
02:19:16,452 --> 02:19:18,826
I wish other defendants
shared that view.

1962
02:19:18,827 --> 02:19:19,853
Some of them do.

1963
02:19:19,955 --> 02:19:22,082
Many are still under
Göring's influence.

1964
02:19:22,158 --> 02:19:24,854
He's your chief rival for the
souls of other defendants...

1965
02:19:24,927 --> 02:19:26,758
if I may put it so dramatically.

1966
02:19:26,862 --> 02:19:28,457
Göring was cross-examined by the

1967
02:19:28,458 --> 02:19:30,354
chief prosecutor,
Justice Jackson...

1968
02:19:30,433 --> 02:19:32,993
while I am to be questioned
by you, a subordinate.

1969
02:19:34,003 --> 02:19:36,528
This difference was noticed
by the other defendants.

1970
02:19:36,605 --> 02:19:39,438
In their eyes, it puts me in
an inferior status to Göring.

1971
02:19:40,643 --> 02:19:43,806
That's a peculiar measure
of status, Dr Speer.

1972
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:46,614
Not to a German war criminal.

1973
02:19:48,484 --> 02:19:50,543
I hope you don't have
a problem with it.

1974
02:19:51,086 --> 02:19:53,680
No. I've got no ego
riding on this.

1975
02:19:54,089 --> 02:19:56,717
I'll present your request
to my superior, Mr Jackson.

1976
02:19:59,261 --> 02:20:02,856
Dr Speer, did you disapprove of
Sauckel's recruitment of labour?

1977
02:20:03,132 --> 02:20:04,690
On the contrary.

1978
02:20:04,767 --> 02:20:07,827
I was grateful to Sauckel for
every worker he provided.

1979
02:20:08,237 --> 02:20:10,296
When we failed to meet
armament quotas...

1980
02:20:10,406 --> 02:20:13,432
because of shortage of workers,
I would blame Sauckel.

1981
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:17,929
Do you wish to limit
your responsibility

1982
02:20:17,930 --> 02:20:20,010
to your own particular
sphere of work?

1983
02:20:20,115 --> 02:20:24,882
No. This war has brought an
inconceivable catastrophe.

1984
02:20:25,221 --> 02:20:28,019
As an important member of the
leadership of the Reich...

1985
02:20:28,090 --> 02:20:30,576
I share in the total
responsibility for

1986
02:20:30,577 --> 02:20:32,754
the disaster of the German people.

1987
02:20:32,828 --> 02:20:36,264
Dr Speer, near the end of the war,
did you not refuse to carry out...

1988
02:20:36,365 --> 02:20:38,925
Hitler's order to raze
Germany to the ground?

1989
02:20:39,001 --> 02:20:40,846
I've no intention
of using my actions

1990
02:20:40,847 --> 02:20:42,402
during that phase of the war...

1991
02:20:42,505 --> 02:20:44,803
to help me in my personal defence.

1992
02:20:45,474 --> 02:20:48,170
But I would like those who
sit in judgement of me...

1993
02:20:48,244 --> 02:20:49,871
to understand that period.

1994
02:20:50,713 --> 02:20:53,682
In March of 1945, Hitler
intended, deliberately...

1995
02:20:53,749 --> 02:20:56,075
to destroy the means
of life for his

1996
02:20:56,076 --> 02:20:58,152
own people if the war were lost.

1997
02:20:59,688 --> 02:21:02,748
He said, "Let the Allies
conquer nothing but ashes."

1998
02:21:03,192 --> 02:21:06,087
But you resisted his
wishes, sending

1999
02:21:06,088 --> 02:21:08,357
him instead this memorandum.

2000
02:21:08,964 --> 02:21:11,592
Would you read it to
the court, please?

2001
02:21:13,335 --> 02:21:16,964
"Nobody has the right to
destroy industrial plants...

2002
02:21:17,172 --> 02:21:21,438
"coal mines, electrical
plants, and other facilities.

2003
02:21:22,044 --> 02:21:24,375
"We have no right to
carry out destruction

2004
02:21:24,376 --> 02:21:26,708
which might affect the
life of the people.

2005
02:21:27,449 --> 02:21:29,144
"Signed, Speer."

2006
02:21:30,853 --> 02:21:33,181
We have heard here
that people were

2007
02:21:33,182 --> 02:21:35,381
shot for disagreeing with Hitler.

2008
02:21:36,859 --> 02:21:37,859
Is this true?

2009
02:21:39,028 --> 02:21:40,154
That did happen.

2010
02:21:40,229 --> 02:21:43,096
And yet, not only did you
disagree with him...

2011
02:21:43,165 --> 02:21:47,033
but early in 1945 you actually
made a plan to assassinate Hitler.

2012
02:21:47,269 --> 02:21:48,497
He what?

2013
02:21:53,943 --> 02:21:55,467
Is that not so?

2014
02:21:59,214 --> 02:22:00,306
Yes, it is so.

2015
02:22:00,382 --> 02:22:01,382
Traitor.

2016
02:22:02,751 --> 02:22:04,742
It is so...

2017
02:22:05,321 --> 02:22:08,813
because of what I viewed as
his insane destructiveness.

2018
02:22:09,825 --> 02:22:10,917
What did you do?

2019
02:22:10,993 --> 02:22:12,187
What was your plan?

2020
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:24,533
I knew of an air-intake shaft...

2021
02:22:25,441 --> 02:22:27,989
in the Reich Chancellery
garden that

2022
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:30,401
ventilated the Führerbunker below.

2023
02:22:31,213 --> 02:22:34,614
I went to the head of my
munitions department and said:

2024
02:22:35,918 --> 02:22:38,751
"There's only one way
to end this war."...

2025
02:22:39,622 --> 02:22:41,647
and asked him to get me...

2026
02:22:42,625 --> 02:22:46,288
a poison gas to drop into
the ventilating system.

2027
02:22:47,329 --> 02:22:48,832
But the next time I went there,

2028
02:22:48,833 --> 02:22:50,628
they had built a
12-foot chimney...

2029
02:22:50,699 --> 02:22:54,465
protecting the ventilator, and
SS guards were patrolling there.

2030
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:57,971
So it came to nothing.

2031
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:06,577
Mr Chief Prosecutor?

2032
02:23:09,685 --> 02:23:13,644
You acknowledge responsibility
for Germany's large policies...

2033
02:23:13,722 --> 02:23:16,384
but not for the details
occurred in their execution.

2034
02:23:16,458 --> 02:23:18,731
Is that a fair statement
of your position?

2035
02:23:18,732 --> 02:23:19,894
Yes, sir. Very fair.

2036
02:23:20,429 --> 02:23:22,177
May I ask the witness
a question in

2037
02:23:22,178 --> 02:23:24,024
order to clarify
this answer, please?

2038
02:23:24,433 --> 02:23:25,433
You may.

2039
02:23:26,969 --> 02:23:30,097
Do you want to acknowledge
guilt under criminal law...

2040
02:23:30,339 --> 02:23:33,968
or do you wish to record a
historical responsibility...

2041
02:23:34,209 --> 02:23:37,144
before your own people
and before history?

2042
02:23:49,191 --> 02:23:51,557
The question is a very
difficult one to answer.

2043
02:23:53,328 --> 02:23:57,321
It is actually one
which the Tribunal...

2044
02:23:58,534 --> 02:24:01,833
will decide in its verdict.

2045
02:24:25,027 --> 02:24:26,358
Cuffs off.

2046
02:24:27,162 --> 02:24:29,323
You would assassinate the Führer?

2047
02:24:29,631 --> 02:24:31,098
I tell you this, coward.

2048
02:24:31,166 --> 02:24:34,135
If you get out alive, we'll
put together our own court...

2049
02:24:34,203 --> 02:24:35,864
and execute you for treason.

2050
02:24:35,938 --> 02:24:36,996
Lock them up.

2051
02:24:45,214 --> 02:24:47,760
As a German officer,
I consider it my

2052
02:24:47,761 --> 02:24:50,174
duty to answer for
all I have done.

2053
02:24:51,787 --> 02:24:54,157
It will not always be
possible to separate

2054
02:24:54,158 --> 02:24:56,087
guilt from the threads of destiny.

2055
02:24:56,625 --> 02:25:00,584
But the men in the front lines
cannot be charged with guilt...

2056
02:25:00,996 --> 02:25:03,931
while the highest leaders
reject responsibility.

2057
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:05,758
That is wrong.

2058
02:25:05,834 --> 02:25:07,631
It was my guilt...

2059
02:25:08,604 --> 02:25:11,971
which I carry before God and
the entire German nation...

2060
02:25:13,475 --> 02:25:15,296
that I educated the
youth of Germany

2061
02:25:15,297 --> 02:25:17,070
for a man who I
considered to be...

2062
02:25:17,146 --> 02:25:20,343
an impeccable leader
and head of state.

2063
02:25:21,150 --> 02:25:23,584
But I educated the
youth of Germany...

2064
02:25:24,887 --> 02:25:28,755
for a man who committed
murder a millionfold.

2065
02:25:28,824 --> 02:25:32,521
And this guilt of Germany
will not yet be erased.

2066
02:25:43,806 --> 02:25:45,467
Good afternoon, Captain.

2067
02:25:47,976 --> 02:25:49,944
The prisoners aren't
allowed visitors.

2068
02:25:50,312 --> 02:25:52,746
I am the wife of R
eichsmarschall Göring.

2069
02:25:52,881 --> 02:25:54,371
This is his daughter.

2070
02:25:55,350 --> 02:25:57,147
No exceptions, madam.

2071
02:25:58,654 --> 02:26:00,121
Frau Göring.

2072
02:26:04,092 --> 02:26:06,526
- My name is Captain Gilbert.
- Hello.

2073
02:26:06,595 --> 02:26:10,224
Nice to meet you. Would you have a
moment to spend with me, to talk?

2074
02:26:10,299 --> 02:26:11,323
Yes.

2075
02:26:11,466 --> 02:26:13,263
- Very good.
- This is Edda.

2076
02:26:13,335 --> 02:26:16,793
Hello, Edda. I'm Captain
Gilbert. Do you like chocolate?

2077
02:26:22,377 --> 02:26:25,505
It must have been very difficult
for you these last few months.

2078
02:26:25,581 --> 02:26:27,674
Especially with your little girl.

2079
02:26:27,749 --> 02:26:30,254
It could have been
worse, I suppose.

2080
02:26:30,255 --> 02:26:32,152
Hitler could have survived.

2081
02:26:33,789 --> 02:26:36,189
You've obviously come to
terms with the truth.

2082
02:26:36,825 --> 02:26:38,850
I wish your husband
could do the same.

2083
02:26:38,961 --> 02:26:42,260
But he persists in remaining
loyal to Hitler's memory.

2084
02:26:42,331 --> 02:26:45,198
Yes, I cannot
understand it, either.

2085
02:26:45,801 --> 02:26:49,396
Such loyalty to a man
who wanted us dead.

2086
02:26:50,972 --> 02:26:51,972
I'm sorry?

2087
02:26:51,973 --> 02:26:54,071
Hitler ordered all
of us to be shot.

2088
02:26:55,244 --> 02:26:56,734
Hermann, myself...

2089
02:26:56,979 --> 02:26:58,503
our precious child.

2090
02:26:59,581 --> 02:27:02,379
That is why we surrendered
to the Americans.

2091
02:27:02,484 --> 02:27:04,543
Why else would we have
done such a thing?

2092
02:27:13,161 --> 02:27:15,356
I went through my
notes last night.

2093
02:27:15,731 --> 02:27:19,497
I've spent all these months trying
to find a way inside their minds.

2094
02:27:19,568 --> 02:27:21,704
Hoping to understand
how those people

2095
02:27:21,705 --> 02:27:23,504
could commit such atrocities...

2096
02:27:23,572 --> 02:27:25,665
against my people.

2097
02:27:27,376 --> 02:27:30,971
I believe there are a couple of
factors that explain a lot of it.

2098
02:27:31,313 --> 02:27:35,147
First, Germany is a country where
people do what they're told.

2099
02:27:36,051 --> 02:27:40,283
You obey your parents, teachers,
clergymen, superior officers.

2100
02:27:40,355 --> 02:27:43,984
You're raised from childhood
not to question authority.

2101
02:27:44,493 --> 02:27:47,860
When Hitler comes to power, he has
an entire nation that believes...

2102
02:27:47,963 --> 02:27:50,761
it's perfectly natural
to do whatever he says.

2103
02:27:51,733 --> 02:27:54,031
Second, propaganda.

2104
02:27:54,836 --> 02:27:58,294
For years, Germans have been
bombarded with ideas like:

2105
02:27:58,807 --> 02:28:01,320
"Jews are not real
human beings," or

2106
02:28:01,321 --> 02:28:03,767
"They're a corruption
of the race."

2107
02:28:06,081 --> 02:28:08,799
When the government
says it's permissible

2108
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:10,677
to deny Jews their rights...

2109
02:28:10,919 --> 02:28:16,824
and then says it's imperative to
kill these inferior people...

2110
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:20,489
they comply.

2111
02:28:22,164 --> 02:28:25,327
Even if they've been your
friends or neighbours.

2112
02:28:32,574 --> 02:28:33,768
Anything else?

2113
02:28:33,842 --> 02:28:36,936
I told you once that I was
searching for the nature of evil.

2114
02:28:37,946 --> 02:28:40,414
I think I've come
close to defining it.

2115
02:28:41,950 --> 02:28:43,417
A lack of empathy.

2116
02:28:43,785 --> 02:28:47,516
It's the one characteristic that
connects all the defendants.

2117
02:28:47,589 --> 02:28:51,548
A genuine incapacity to
feel with their fellow man.

2118
02:28:54,162 --> 02:28:59,429
Evil, I think, is the
absence of empathy.

2119
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:15,107
I call on the chief prosecutor
for his closing argument.

2120
02:29:24,793 --> 02:29:27,626
Mr President and members
of the tribunal.

2121
02:29:29,464 --> 02:29:31,860
It is impossible
in summation to do

2122
02:29:31,861 --> 02:29:34,458
more than outline
with bold strokes...

2123
02:29:35,037 --> 02:29:39,269
the vitals of this trial's
mad and melancholy record.

2124
02:29:39,341 --> 02:29:43,505
For no time has ever witnessed
slaughter on such a grand scale.

2125
02:29:44,746 --> 02:29:49,342
Such cruelties and inhumanities,
such wholesale deportations...

2126
02:29:50,252 --> 02:29:54,518
of peoples into slavery, such
annihilations of minorities.

2127
02:29:56,792 --> 02:30:01,252
Events which will live as
the historical text...

2128
02:30:01,329 --> 02:30:07,063
of the 20th century's
shame and depravity.

2129
02:30:07,936 --> 02:30:09,767
Terror was the order of the day.

2130
02:30:09,871 --> 02:30:11,401
Civilians were arrested without

2131
02:30:11,402 --> 02:30:13,329
charges, committed
without counsel...

2132
02:30:13,442 --> 02:30:16,309
executed without hearing.

2133
02:30:18,346 --> 02:30:21,713
Villages were destroyed, the
male inhabitants shot...

2134
02:30:23,118 --> 02:30:24,813
or sent to forced labour...

2135
02:30:24,986 --> 02:30:27,580
and the children scattered abroad.

2136
02:30:28,824 --> 02:30:31,290
The Nazi movement will
be of evil memory

2137
02:30:31,291 --> 02:30:33,818
because of its persecution
of the Jews...

2138
02:30:34,663 --> 02:30:38,258
the most far-flung and terrible
racial persecution of all time.

2139
02:30:40,035 --> 02:30:42,145
So thorough and
uncompromising was this

2140
02:30:42,146 --> 02:30:43,994
program that the Jews of Europe...

2141
02:30:44,106 --> 02:30:46,199
as a race, no longer exist.

2142
02:30:47,542 --> 02:30:49,647
Thus fulfilling the
diabolic "prophesy" of

2143
02:30:49,648 --> 02:30:51,706
Adolf Hitler at the
beginning of the war.

2144
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:54,772
Generations to come will
remember this decade.

2145
02:30:56,051 --> 02:30:58,485
If we cannot eliminate
the cause...

2146
02:30:59,121 --> 02:31:01,919
and prevent the repetition
of these barbaric events...

2147
02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:04,151
this century may yet succeed...

2148
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:07,660
in bringing the doom
of civilisation.

2149
02:31:10,232 --> 02:31:12,115
The time has come
for final judgement

2150
02:31:12,116 --> 02:31:14,100
and if the case I
present seems hard...

2151
02:31:14,202 --> 02:31:16,534
and uncompromising...

2152
02:31:17,172 --> 02:31:20,369
then it is only because
the evidence makes it so.

2153
02:31:21,943 --> 02:31:23,748
A glance at the
dock will show that

2154
02:31:23,749 --> 02:31:25,606
despite quarrels
among themselves...

2155
02:31:26,114 --> 02:31:29,345
each defendant played a part that
fitted in with every other...

2156
02:31:29,417 --> 02:31:31,942
and all advanced a common plan.

2157
02:31:33,788 --> 02:31:37,189
It was these men among millions of
others, and it was these men...

2158
02:31:37,325 --> 02:31:40,317
leading millions of others,
who built up Adolf Hitler.

2159
02:31:40,395 --> 02:31:41,726
They intoxicated him.

2160
02:31:41,796 --> 02:31:45,027
He, of the psychopathic
personality...

2161
02:31:45,133 --> 02:31:48,261
with power and adulation.

2162
02:31:49,771 --> 02:31:52,262
They fed his hates,
aroused his fears.

2163
02:31:53,241 --> 02:31:55,230
They put a loaded gun
in his eager hands.

2164
02:31:55,231 --> 02:31:57,268
It was left to Hitler
to pull the trigger.

2165
02:31:57,345 --> 02:31:59,279
When he did, they all...

2166
02:31:59,848 --> 02:32:02,146
at that time, applauded.

2167
02:32:03,251 --> 02:32:05,219
Hitler's guilt stands admitted...

2168
02:32:05,287 --> 02:32:07,619
by some defendants reluctantly...

2169
02:32:07,689 --> 02:32:09,554
by some, vindictively.

2170
02:32:10,125 --> 02:32:13,959
But Hitler's guilt is the
guilt of the whole dock...

2171
02:32:16,498 --> 02:32:18,523
and of every man in it.

2172
02:32:25,073 --> 02:32:27,297
These defendants now
ask this tribunal

2173
02:32:27,298 --> 02:32:29,009
to say they are not guilty...

2174
02:32:29,544 --> 02:32:32,980
of planning, executing, or
conspiring to commit...

2175
02:32:33,148 --> 02:32:37,642
this long list of
crimes and wrongs.

2176
02:32:40,589 --> 02:32:42,421
They stand before
the record of this

2177
02:32:42,422 --> 02:32:44,355
Tribunal as bloodstained
Gloucester...

2178
02:32:44,426 --> 02:32:46,951
stood by the body
of his slain king.

2179
02:32:49,197 --> 02:32:52,724
He begged the widow,
as they beg of you:

2180
02:32:54,236 --> 02:32:56,101
"Say I slew them not."

2181
02:32:57,339 --> 02:33:00,672
And the Queen replied, "Then
say they are not slain.

2182
02:33:03,345 --> 02:33:04,835
"But dead they are."

2183
02:33:06,548 --> 02:33:11,281
If you were to say of these men
that they are not guilty...

2184
02:33:12,921 --> 02:33:16,618
it would be as true to say
that there has been no war.

2185
02:33:18,460 --> 02:33:20,223
There are no slain.

2186
02:33:23,598 --> 02:33:25,498
There has been no crime.

2187
02:33:54,429 --> 02:33:55,657
Captain.

2188
02:33:56,631 --> 02:34:00,658
"Jews escalate fight for
homeland." It's ironic.

2189
02:34:01,803 --> 02:34:04,271
After all that's happened
over the past 10 years...

2190
02:34:04,339 --> 02:34:06,773
I don't blame the Jews
for wanting a homeland.

2191
02:34:06,841 --> 02:34:10,607
One of the many ripples we'll see
from this war and from this trial.

2192
02:34:11,913 --> 02:34:13,904
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

2193
02:34:15,116 --> 02:34:17,983
The defendants may now make
their final statements.

2194
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:20,911
Defendant Hermann Göring.

2195
02:34:35,303 --> 02:34:38,033
This has been a poor
excuse for a trial.

2196
02:34:41,409 --> 02:34:44,776
But firstly, I must reiterate
my lack of knowledge...

2197
02:34:45,046 --> 02:34:47,588
for these terrible
mass murders, which

2198
02:34:47,589 --> 02:34:49,676
I cannot begin to understand...

2199
02:34:50,585 --> 02:34:54,919
and furthermore, I
condemn wholeheartedly.

2200
02:34:55,957 --> 02:34:57,967
As to the trial, the
statements of the

2201
02:34:57,968 --> 02:34:59,825
defendants were
accepted as true...

2202
02:34:59,928 --> 02:35:02,556
only when they supported
the prosecution.

2203
02:35:03,298 --> 02:35:06,426
They were treated as perjury when
they refuted the indictment.

2204
02:35:06,835 --> 02:35:09,030
This is not a basis of proof.

2205
02:35:09,170 --> 02:35:13,231
Why am I in the dock being
treated as a common criminal?

2206
02:35:15,076 --> 02:35:18,671
I say to my judges,
have no illusions.

2207
02:35:19,547 --> 02:35:21,653
Since the three greatest
powers on earth,

2208
02:35:21,654 --> 02:35:23,711
together with other
nations fought us...

2209
02:35:23,785 --> 02:35:28,347
we finally were conquered by
tremendous enemy superiority.

2210
02:35:28,857 --> 02:35:33,487
Justice has absolutely nothing
to do with this trial.

2211
02:35:47,475 --> 02:35:49,534
Defendant Albert Speer.

2212
02:35:54,416 --> 02:35:59,251
How could so advanced,
so cultured...

2213
02:36:00,422 --> 02:36:03,289
so sophisticated a
nation as Germany...

2214
02:36:04,058 --> 02:36:06,720
have fallen under
Hitler's demonic sway?

2215
02:36:07,962 --> 02:36:11,090
The explanation is
modern communications.

2216
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:14,787
No longer does a leader
have to delegate

2217
02:36:14,788 --> 02:36:16,769
authority afar to subordinates...

2218
02:36:17,105 --> 02:36:19,369
exercising independent judgement.

2219
02:36:19,774 --> 02:36:22,060
Given modern
communications, a Hitler

2220
02:36:22,061 --> 02:36:24,108
can rule directly and personally.

2221
02:36:25,079 --> 02:36:28,014
Thus, the more technical
the world becomes...

2222
02:36:28,216 --> 02:36:30,844
the more individual freedom...

2223
02:36:31,286 --> 02:36:34,153
and the self-rule of
mankind becomes essential.

2224
02:36:35,690 --> 02:36:40,855
This war has ended on the note
of radio-controlled rockets.

2225
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:44,230
Aircraft approaching
the speed of sound.

2226
02:36:44,466 --> 02:36:47,560
Submarines and torpedoes which
can find their own targets.

2227
02:36:47,669 --> 02:36:49,000
Atom bombs...

2228
02:36:49,237 --> 02:36:52,172
and the horrible prospect
of chemical warfare.

2229
02:36:52,607 --> 02:36:55,048
In five to ten years,
this kind of warfare will

2230
02:36:55,049 --> 02:36:57,237
offer the possibility
of firing rockets...

2231
02:36:57,312 --> 02:37:00,748
from continent to continent
with uncanny precision.

2232
02:37:01,983 --> 02:37:04,076
Through the smashing
of the atom...

2233
02:37:05,119 --> 02:37:07,352
it will be possible to
kill 1 million people

2234
02:37:07,353 --> 02:37:09,488
in New York City in a
matter of seconds...

2235
02:37:09,557 --> 02:37:12,321
with a rocket serviced
by perhaps ten men.

2236
02:37:14,028 --> 02:37:18,431
A new large-scale war will
end with the destruction...

2237
02:37:18,566 --> 02:37:21,160
of human culture and civilisation.

2238
02:37:21,503 --> 02:37:24,529
That is why this trial
must contribute...

2239
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:28,238
to the prevention of
such wars in the future.

2240
02:37:30,078 --> 02:37:33,514
A nation believing in its
future will never perish.

2241
02:37:34,182 --> 02:37:37,811
May God protect Germany...

2242
02:37:39,587 --> 02:37:41,578
and the culture of the West.

2243
02:37:51,432 --> 02:37:53,845
We are agreed. Three
of four votes will

2244
02:37:53,846 --> 02:37:56,199
be required for the
finding of guilty.

2245
02:37:56,971 --> 02:37:58,268
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

2246
02:37:58,406 --> 02:38:02,365
Now, if the judgement is death,
might we not consider...

2247
02:38:02,443 --> 02:38:05,173
the firing squad for the
military defendants?

2248
02:38:05,246 --> 02:38:07,009
I disagree most strongly.

2249
02:38:07,148 --> 02:38:10,515
The bullet is for the honourable
adversary, not for butchers.

2250
02:38:11,486 --> 02:38:12,919
I say hanging.

2251
02:38:13,321 --> 02:38:14,982
- I agree.
- I agree.

2252
02:38:18,059 --> 02:38:21,460
We will take the defendants in
the order they were indicted.

2253
02:38:21,729 --> 02:38:22,729
Göring.

2254
02:38:31,039 --> 02:38:32,597
Bravo.

2255
02:38:43,117 --> 02:38:45,551
Go on, have some of
the lovely food.

2256
02:38:50,291 --> 02:38:53,021
There is talk that you
will all be hanged.

2257
02:38:53,828 --> 02:38:55,261
I won't be hanged.

2258
02:38:56,831 --> 02:39:00,494
That I assure you. That I pledge.

2259
02:39:02,070 --> 02:39:06,097
Perhaps the court will send
you to an island, like Elba.

2260
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:09,033
We could join you there.

2261
02:39:13,581 --> 02:39:15,071
Go on, eat.

2262
02:39:17,952 --> 02:39:20,304
Do you think that
we would be allowed

2263
02:39:20,305 --> 02:39:22,719
to take some of the
food home with us?

2264
02:39:29,998 --> 02:39:31,761
I don't see why not.

2265
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:35,769
The Charter clearly states
that following orders...

2266
02:39:36,304 --> 02:39:39,569
"may be considered in
mitigation of punishment."

2267
02:39:40,008 --> 02:39:42,340
"May be," not must be.

2268
02:39:46,547 --> 02:39:50,643
You have become such
beautiful young ladies.

2269
02:39:55,957 --> 02:39:57,982
When are they going
to shoot you, Papa?

2270
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:01,892
Hans Frank is a most
tragic figure...

2271
02:40:02,130 --> 02:40:03,154
in my view.

2272
02:40:03,231 --> 02:40:05,290
His penitence is obviously real.

2273
02:40:05,833 --> 02:40:09,064
It would be a meaningful gesture
for us to spare his life.

2274
02:40:09,936 --> 02:40:10,936
No.

2275
02:40:10,938 --> 02:40:11,996
He should hang.

2276
02:40:51,145 --> 02:40:52,806
Atten-hut.

2277
02:40:57,885 --> 02:40:59,147
All rise.

2278
02:41:38,326 --> 02:41:42,023
Each defendant will stand
as his name is called...

2279
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:45,891
to hear the judgements on the
four counts applicable to him...

2280
02:41:46,634 --> 02:41:50,195
and the sentence, if found
guilty on any of the counts.

2281
02:41:51,172 --> 02:41:54,733
The counts, numbered
one through four, are:

2282
02:41:55,543 --> 02:41:57,977
Conspiracy to commit aggression.

2283
02:41:58,713 --> 02:42:00,647
The commission of aggression.

2284
02:42:01,516 --> 02:42:03,882
Crimes in the conduct
of warfare...

2285
02:42:04,519 --> 02:42:06,510
and crimes against humanity.

2286
02:42:07,755 --> 02:42:09,780
Defendant Hermann Göring.

2287
02:42:14,862 --> 02:42:18,821
The Tribunal finds you
guilty on all four counts...

2288
02:42:19,267 --> 02:42:20,734
and sentences you...

2289
02:42:21,102 --> 02:42:22,763
to death by hanging.

2290
02:42:26,974 --> 02:42:28,373
Rudolf Hess.

2291
02:42:30,111 --> 02:42:32,636
On the charges of crimes
against humanity...

2292
02:42:32,914 --> 02:42:35,178
the Tribunal finds you not guilty.

2293
02:42:35,917 --> 02:42:38,909
But we find you guilty
on counts one and two...

2294
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:43,081
and thereby sentence you
to imprisonment for life.

2295
02:42:44,659 --> 02:42:46,559
Admiral Wilhelm Keitel.

2296
02:42:47,361 --> 02:42:49,261
Guilty on all four counts.

2297
02:42:49,664 --> 02:42:52,462
The Tribunal sentences
you to death by hanging.

2298
02:42:53,935 --> 02:42:55,835
Defendant Hans Frank.

2299
02:42:57,338 --> 02:43:00,865
The Tribunal finds you guilty
on counts three and four...

2300
02:43:01,642 --> 02:43:04,042
and sentences you to
death by hanging.

2301
02:43:04,278 --> 02:43:05,905
Julius Streicher.

2302
02:43:07,348 --> 02:43:10,613
Guilty on count four,
crimes against humanity.

2303
02:43:11,352 --> 02:43:12,478
Death by hanging.

2304
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:14,781
Defendant Schacht.

2305
02:43:15,556 --> 02:43:18,224
The Tribunal has come
to the conclusion

2306
02:43:18,225 --> 02:43:20,960
that evidence against
Hjalmar Schacht...

2307
02:43:21,529 --> 02:43:24,498
has not been established
beyond a reasonable doubt...

2308
02:43:24,632 --> 02:43:28,625
and therefore finds that Schacht
is not guilty on this indictment.

2309
02:43:30,938 --> 02:43:32,030
Quiet, please.

2310
02:43:36,043 --> 02:43:38,136
The Defendant Karl Dönitz.

2311
02:43:38,846 --> 02:43:40,837
Guilty on counts two and three.

2312
02:43:41,482 --> 02:43:45,213
The Tribunal sentences you
to ten years imprisonment.

2313
02:43:46,888 --> 02:43:49,220
Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop.

2314
02:43:50,091 --> 02:43:52,218
Guilty on all four counts.

2315
02:43:52,627 --> 02:43:55,528
The Tribunal sentences
you to death by hanging.

2316
02:43:58,165 --> 02:43:59,792
Ernst Kaltenbrunner.

2317
02:44:00,668 --> 02:44:02,636
Guilty on counts three and four.

2318
02:44:03,671 --> 02:44:06,572
The Tribunal sentences
you to death by hanging.

2319
02:44:06,741 --> 02:44:08,402
Balder von Schirach.

2320
02:44:08,809 --> 02:44:10,902
Guilty on count four.

2321
02:44:11,178 --> 02:44:12,702
Twenty years in prison.

2322
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:13,906
Alfred Jodl.

2323
02:44:14,348 --> 02:44:16,407
On all four counts, guilty.

2324
02:44:17,051 --> 02:44:18,177
Death by hanging.

2325
02:44:19,053 --> 02:44:20,543
Hans Fritzsche.

2326
02:44:22,657 --> 02:44:24,022
Not guilty.

2327
02:44:26,060 --> 02:44:27,652
Franz von Papen.

2328
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:30,995
Not guilty.

2329
02:44:32,199 --> 02:44:33,199
Walter Funk.

2330
02:44:34,068 --> 02:44:36,002
Guilty on counts
two, three and four.

2331
02:44:36,637 --> 02:44:39,936
The Tribunal sentences you
to imprisonment for life.

2332
02:44:40,574 --> 02:44:42,542
Defendant Fritz Sauckel.

2333
02:44:43,511 --> 02:44:45,775
Guilty on counts three and four.

2334
02:44:46,314 --> 02:44:47,440
Death by hanging.

2335
02:44:49,383 --> 02:44:51,044
Defendant Albert Speer.

2336
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:56,647
The Tribunal finds you not
guilty on counts one and two.

2337
02:44:57,491 --> 02:45:01,018
But you have been found guilty
on counts three and four.

2338
02:45:01,595 --> 02:45:03,825
Albert Speer, the Court
sentences you...

2339
02:45:03,898 --> 02:45:06,162
to 20 years imprisonment.

2340
02:45:12,673 --> 02:45:15,665
The work of this Tribunal
is now complete.

2341
02:46:34,722 --> 02:46:36,212
Lock them up.

2342
02:46:42,463 --> 02:46:45,796
Leutnant, my dear Tex,
why this long face?

2343
02:46:47,134 --> 02:46:48,976
Have I not told you
there's a special

2344
02:46:48,977 --> 02:46:50,626
place in Valhalla waiting for me?

2345
02:46:53,174 --> 02:46:54,641
I don't know.

2346
02:47:00,347 --> 02:47:02,815
I thought things might have
turned out differently.

2347
02:47:03,184 --> 02:47:05,648
Well, you know, they
might have done,

2348
02:47:05,649 --> 02:47:08,178
if it wasn't a very
unfortunate thing.

2349
02:47:10,157 --> 02:47:11,624
Those mass murders.

2350
02:47:12,893 --> 02:47:15,623
I must tell you, I could
not see their purpose.

2351
02:47:15,696 --> 02:47:17,994
They were absolutely unnecessary.

2352
02:47:18,065 --> 02:47:20,693
They made no sense from a
nationalistic point of view.

2353
02:47:20,868 --> 02:47:23,336
Our legacy has been
forever tainted.

2354
02:47:25,005 --> 02:47:26,529
But make no mistake.

2355
02:47:27,475 --> 02:47:29,298
Everything Hitler
did before the war

2356
02:47:29,299 --> 02:47:31,172
was right. The German
people knew it.

2357
02:47:31,245 --> 02:47:32,974
One day, they'll remember it.

2358
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:35,878
And you must remember
it too, my dear Tex.

2359
02:47:37,084 --> 02:47:39,484
When you remember
me, remember that.

2360
02:47:41,622 --> 02:47:42,622
Yeah.

2361
02:47:44,158 --> 02:47:46,023
Now, to practical matters.

2362
02:47:47,027 --> 02:47:49,074
There are a few things
I want to give you.

2363
02:47:49,075 --> 02:47:50,075
No, sir...

2364
02:47:50,331 --> 02:47:51,389
Please.

2365
02:47:54,835 --> 02:47:57,429
Where I'm going, I
must travel light.

2366
02:48:00,941 --> 02:48:04,206
It's inscribed, see,
with my name. Take it.

2367
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:07,208
Take it.

2368
02:48:15,289 --> 02:48:17,377
The few valuables I
have, they are in

2369
02:48:17,378 --> 02:48:19,521
my blue briefcase in
the baggage room.

2370
02:48:19,593 --> 02:48:22,426
Can you retrieve that
for me, my dear Tex?

2371
02:48:24,198 --> 02:48:25,198
Yes, sir.

2372
02:48:57,798 --> 02:49:00,198
Where are they building
those gallows?

2373
02:49:00,301 --> 02:49:02,826
Down in the back. Third
building on the right.

2374
02:49:31,498 --> 02:49:34,023
I have only one
question to ask you.

2375
02:49:35,769 --> 02:49:37,760
Is there absolutely
no possibility that I

2376
02:49:37,761 --> 02:49:39,705
may be allowed to face
a firing squad...

2377
02:49:39,773 --> 02:49:41,400
and die a soldier's death?

2378
02:49:41,475 --> 02:49:42,475
None.

2379
02:49:43,444 --> 02:49:47,107
Just as well. I hear the
Americans are very poor shots.

2380
02:49:48,983 --> 02:49:51,747
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must write a letter.

2381
02:50:02,329 --> 02:50:05,093
For the rest of my life,
Herr Reichsmarschall...

2382
02:50:05,466 --> 02:50:08,026
people will ask me what
your final thoughts were.

2383
02:50:08,235 --> 02:50:10,032
I'll have nothing to tell them.

2384
02:50:10,137 --> 02:50:11,832
You can tell them this:

2385
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:15,074
I say, for now and all time:

2386
02:50:16,143 --> 02:50:18,347
The foreigners who
have imposed this

2387
02:50:18,348 --> 02:50:20,375
sentence upon me may murder me...

2388
02:50:20,481 --> 02:50:23,109
but they have no
right to judge me.

2389
02:50:23,684 --> 02:50:25,675
That I deny them.

2390
02:50:27,688 --> 02:50:32,148
Now, you must excuse me, I do have
to write this letter. Thank you.

2391
02:50:40,501 --> 02:50:42,594
My one and only sweetheart.

2392
02:50:42,936 --> 02:50:46,565
My life came to an end when I bade
you farewell for the last time.

2393
02:50:47,341 --> 02:50:49,241
Do not grieve, my dearest one.

2394
02:50:49,643 --> 02:50:52,314
Since then I have felt
at peace with myself,

2395
02:50:52,315 --> 02:50:54,512
and consider my death
a deliverance.

2396
02:50:55,749 --> 02:50:59,446
All my thoughts are with you
and our own dear, sweet child.

2397
02:51:00,521 --> 02:51:04,423
My last heartbeats, of our
great and eternal love.

2398
02:51:57,611 --> 02:51:59,135
Colonel, may I?

2399
02:52:02,883 --> 02:52:04,942
- You got what you want?
- I got it, sir.

2400
02:52:05,152 --> 02:52:06,949
Gentlemen, follow me.

2401
02:52:36,450 --> 02:52:37,644
Mein Gott.

2402
02:52:39,086 --> 02:52:40,485
Get dressed.

2403
02:53:05,012 --> 02:53:06,479
Get a doctor.

2404
02:53:08,148 --> 02:53:10,013
Somebody get a doctor.

2405
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:47,448
Cyanide.

2406
02:54:11,745 --> 02:54:13,372
Son of a bitch.

2407
02:54:44,978 --> 02:54:48,470
- State your name.
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.

2408
02:54:48,916 --> 02:54:50,781
Do you have anything to say?

2409
02:54:51,018 --> 02:54:54,419
My last wish is that Germany
realise its destiny.

2410
02:54:55,188 --> 02:54:57,213
I wish peace to the world.

2411
02:55:16,310 --> 02:55:19,939
- Do you have anything to say?
- I now join my sons.

2412
02:55:20,914 --> 02:55:23,382
Deutschland über alles.

2413
02:55:45,272 --> 02:55:46,398
Three.

2414
02:55:52,312 --> 02:55:54,337
I'm dying an innocent man.

2415
02:55:59,720 --> 02:56:02,450
I ask God to accept
me with my sin.

2416
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:07,760
Heil Hitler.

2417
02:56:07,828 --> 02:56:08,828
Heil Hitler.

2418
02:56:18,505 --> 02:56:19,529
Seven.

2419
02:56:47,367 --> 02:56:49,096
All cleaned out. Everything.

2420
02:56:49,803 --> 02:56:53,830
The cells are to be scrubbed
clean. Nothing's to be left.

2421
02:56:57,344 --> 02:56:58,675
Nothing.

2422
02:57:02,983 --> 02:57:04,177
Thank you very much.

2423
02:57:05,919 --> 02:57:06,919
Thanks.

2424
02:57:07,621 --> 02:57:10,681
You know, when we get home, we've
got some decisions to make.

2425
02:57:10,791 --> 02:57:13,316
Some personal decisions.

2426
02:57:14,661 --> 02:57:16,754
Let's just wait till we get home.

2427
02:57:22,102 --> 02:57:23,592
Hello, you two.

2428
02:57:24,404 --> 02:57:26,338
You know it may sound strange...

2429
02:57:26,406 --> 02:57:29,432
but I can't help feeling a touch
sentimental about all this.

2430
02:57:29,876 --> 02:57:31,343
I understand.

2431
02:57:32,679 --> 02:57:35,315
I got a letter from a
friend today saying

2432
02:57:35,316 --> 02:57:37,514
that because of what we've done...

2433
02:57:39,052 --> 02:57:40,952
none of it can ever happen again.

2434
02:57:42,489 --> 02:57:43,717
What do you think?

2435
02:57:44,958 --> 02:57:46,619
Well...

2436
02:57:48,729 --> 02:57:50,026
We can hope, can't we?

2437
02:57:55,368 --> 02:57:56,426
'Bye.

2437
02:57:57,305 --> 02:58:57,869

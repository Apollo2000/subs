2
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:19,105
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

3
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:23,139
Get that monkey on the train.

4
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:26,640
The Medici Brothers' circus
is taking off!

5
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,203
Breathing normal...

6
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:29,772
heart rate normal.

7
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,172
You're cleared to perform.

8
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:36,237
Milly!
Another train!

9
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:44,904
<i>Ninos,</i> wait!
We are coming, too!

10
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:58,971
Joplin!

11
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,770
Joplin, Missouri!

12
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,939
- Hey, sweetheart!
- Daddy!

13
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,904
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

14
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,272
You know,
in the letter I sent?

15
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:42,872
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't here.

16
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,239
Well, come here now.

17
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:47,671
Still me.

18
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:26,347
And you...

19
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,813
you're just as pretty
as your momma.

20
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:39,780
We missed you, Dad.

21
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,480
I missed you, too.

22
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,011
Ivan and Catherine,
thank you both...

23
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,778
for looking out for them.

24
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,244
Captain Farrier,
of course.

25
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,045
Oh, it's Holt, come on now.

26
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,378
It's just Holt.

27
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,980
Don't you worry.

28
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,846
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

29
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,077
Come on! Come on!

30
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,445
Home sweet home.

31
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,746
- Hey! Holt!
- Hey, Puck.

32
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,077
- Hey, Thomas.
- Milly, come on!

33
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,279
Hi, Holt.

34
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,913
Oh! Hey, Miss Atlantis.

35
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,045
Pramesh!

36
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:21,778
The very best journey,
dear friend.

37
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,211
The road that leads home.

38
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:26,077
Welcome home.

39
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,780
No hugs!

40
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,778
Pramesh,
I missed you, too.

41
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,945
What's going on? The camp's
half the size it used to be.

42
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,444
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

43
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,211
Attention, everybody!

44
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:52,144
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

45
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,945
Because
"keep the cages locked"

46
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,211
is the most important
rule of all!

47
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:59,211
When I catch
that fugitive scalawag

48
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:00,911
who interrupted my dream...

49
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:01,878
Rongo!

50
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,211
Where is Rongo?

51
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:07,311
Who's heading
camp management?

52
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:08,544
I'm the strongman.

53
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:11,211
Yes, but we're all wearing
multiple hats!

54
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:15,044
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

55
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,544
Which means
animal whereabouts!

56
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,544
Now, go find that monkey!

57
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,446
I'll have a look around.

58
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:30,012
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

59
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,313
Holt!

60
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,045
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

61
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:52,511
Natalya, Vincenzo...

62
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,146
the Vanderjees, and then...

63
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,944
your wife.

64
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,246
Poor Annie.

65
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,978
How she fought.

66
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:09,279
She was the best of us.

67
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,344
I know it.

68
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:15,076
So, uh, you know, for her,

69
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,346
let's have
our best season yet!

70
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,278
Now where's my horses?

71
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,511
Ah...

72
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:23,377
Funny story about that.

73
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,910
Funny how?

74
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,976
He sold them.

75
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,777
But our act is the soul
of this show!

76
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,310
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

77
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,777
If only Milly would have
learned the trade.

78
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:37,210
I don't wanna be a show-off
in your circus.

79
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:39,343
- "Show-off"?
- You see?

80
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:42,009
I wanna make
scientific discoveries.

81
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,810
I wanna be noticed
for my mind.

82
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,276
Okay.

83
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,909
Then learn clairvoyance.
Telepathy! Something!

84
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,943
I can do a handstand
for almost ten seconds.

85
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:54,343
Oh.

86
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:58,343
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

87
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,111
Hang on now. Without horses,
what the hell's my act?

88
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,510
The crowds come to see me!

89
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:05,445
Max, please.

90
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:08,911
I need to work.

91
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,976
Good news.

92
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:13,810
One job, I have.

93
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,843
Okay, then.
Give me a showstopper.

94
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,510
You know that old rascal
Itchy McPhee?

95
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,210
He finally ran off
with the bearded lady.

96
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:23,310
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

97
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,443
I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.

98
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,476
No, you're not serious.

99
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:28,876
I am on occasion.

100
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:30,410
This is a big job
and you know it.

101
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,043
No, it's a big shovel
for a big pile of...

102
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,011
Dad.

103
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:38,876
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

104
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:42,143
Your scrawny, mangy,
cut-rate elephants.

105
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:44,378
They're important.
Especially this season.

106
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,410
Why's that?

107
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:48,243
I know it goes
against my nature...

108
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:52,043
but for once,
I made an investment.

109
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:57,243
<i>Bellissima!</i>
There she is!

110
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,043
Our brand-new Asian female.

111
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,008
I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.

112
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,008
I had to get him
way down on the price.

113
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,776
But I swear to you, Holt,

114
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:09,875
I saw something special
in her eyes.

115
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:13,210
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

116
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:15,312
Oh, no. She's not sick.

117
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:17,942
Any day now...

118
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,243
she's having a baby.

119
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,310
Dad, watch! Dad!
I'm getting better!

120
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,010
Hang on now,
this is our tent?

121
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:31,543
What happened to our things?

122
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:34,944
We had nice furniture,
we had rooms.

123
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,276
Max, what didn't you sell?

124
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,209
You son of a gun.

125
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,277
Dad, look!

126
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,175
Toys?

127
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:45,008
They're not toys.

128
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,476
They're for
my science experiments.

129
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:49,209
Well, we're a circus,
darlin', a circus.

130
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:51,942
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

131
00:09:51,944 --> 00:09:54,510
You couldn't
just take up one act?

132
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,942
Tumblin' or tightrope?

133
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:58,843
Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.

134
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:01,875
Maybe I'm just not
you and Mom.

135
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,177
Well, who makes the rules
in this family?

136
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,075
Mom did.

137
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,275
Yeah, well,
I make them now.

138
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:08,375
So just, uh...
Go to your room!

139
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:09,810
This is my room.

140
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,342
This is all our rooms.

141
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,442
See this?

142
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:17,242
You know what this is?

143
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:18,810
It's your inheritance.

144
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:22,475
Dad!

145
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:25,908
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

146
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,775
He's stuck here.

147
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,344
Like you and me.

148
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,777
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

149
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,242
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

150
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:52,108
A new season!

151
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:07,375
Let me in,
you little hairball!

152
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:17,275
Hey!

153
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,809
Would somebody please
let me in my own train?

154
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,241
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

155
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:06,509
The elephants need us!

156
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:07,974
Good God, son,

157
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,442
you're gonna make me
miss the war.

158
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:11,774
Gimme that.

159
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,074
Go on, lead the way.

160
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,943
Move it!

161
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,107
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!

162
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:21,007
Don't make me
have to incentivize.

163
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,007
Get her out of there, boys.

164
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,907
Easy, Rufus.

165
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,475
That's a lady in there.

166
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:30,107
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

167
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,341
But he just ain't
on the marquee no more.

168
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,074
Time to see
what he's been missing.

169
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,774
Do you ever
get that feeling?

170
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:37,208
Like there's something
you're missing?

171
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,441
Imagine my surprise,
you didn't enlist.

172
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:42,107
- Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,007
Dad? Something's wrong.

174
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,343
She doesn't wanna leave.

175
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,341
Come on!

176
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,909
Let's get her outta there!

177
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,742
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

178
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,441
Leave her alone!

179
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:03,041
- Stop hurting her, please!
- Leave her alone!

180
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,107
Dad, look.

181
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,410
What now?

182
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:19,808
Move her!

183
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:25,839
Whoa, we got
a baby in here.

184
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,541
She had a baby!

185
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,806
- Baby!
- Huh?

186
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:34,974
Notify the press!

187
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,241

00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:43,410
Look at that.

191
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:45,975
It's okay now.

192
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,210
Don't be scared.

193
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:55,276
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

194
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,240
Baby! We got a baby!

195
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,841
We got a baby!

196
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,507
What is that?

197
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,808
Baby Jumbo.

198
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,106
I already got fake freaks
in the freak show!

199
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:44,340
I don't need a real one
in the center ring!

200
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,307
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

201
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:50,273
Gone and
bought yourself a baby monster.

202
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,309
Think he can hear me?

203
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,340
Boo!

204
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,040
Rongo!

Tell me you didn't do it.

You did it?

Why me? Why me?

215
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:46,772
A face
only a mother could love.

216
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:47,940
Sir?

217
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,240
Many of us
find you handsome.

218
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,075
I was talking
about the elephant!

219
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:59,375
Look, she's drawing him
a bath.

220
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:07,106
Need a vet to come
to look at him, Max.

221
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:08,905
No, no witnesses!

222
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:10,805
We are going to be in Joplin
for two weeks.

223
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,406
We promised them
a beautiful baby!

224
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:14,872
You have until tomorrow
night to fix that!

225
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,406
- Me?
- Yes, you!

226
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,772
This is my problem?

227
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,073
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

228
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:20,941
Make those ears disappear!

229
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,740
Don't look at me.

230
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,275
Look at him, those
giant ears weigh him down.

231
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:46,340
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

232
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:48,206
Welcome to the circus.

233
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,141
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

234
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,772
Aren't elephants
afraid of mice?

235
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:58,072
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

236
00:16:58,074 --> 00:16:59,272
Someone needs to
keep him company.

237
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:00,474
when he's not with his momma.

238
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,039
Look. Give him one.

239
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:18,206
If he can lift his ears
out of the way.

240
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,371
No. You have to blow
your ears out of the way.

241
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,241
Like this.

242
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:27,838
Good luck with that.

243
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,872
Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.

244
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,471
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

245
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,805
Do what I do.

246
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,041
Blow.

247
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:44,838
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

248
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,807
He thinks it's a game.

249
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,872
- Oh, Max, come here.
- What?

250
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:51,805
Watch this.

251
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,972
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

252
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,972
stampede!

253
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,039
Send 'em!

254
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,041
Get out of the way, Max!

255
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,407
I'm, uh, still working out
the timing.

256
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,007
Let me have a turn.

257
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,105
Meanwhile, for when you

258
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,305
- lead out the elephants...
- Uh-huh.

259
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,405
I had the
costume departments

260
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:33,505
make you up
a little something.

261
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:34,407
Okay.

262
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,438
What in gosh...

263
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,405
You really broke the bank
with this, Max.

264
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,038
A lot of kids
come to the show.

265
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,837
You don't want me to
scare anyone, I get it.

266
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,971
Dad, Dad!

267
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:45,371
It's Baby Jumbo.
Come see.

268
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,338
He jumped in the air.
With his ears.

269
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,004
Guys,
I said leave him be.

270
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:50,139
But he was this
far off the ground!

271
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:51,471
Yeah, I bet he was.

272
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:53,338
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

273
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,238
Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.

274
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,940
Just leave the poor guy alone.

275
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,171
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

276
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:06,473
Otherwise,
you don't deserve to know.

277
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:11,771
It's been a rough year
for both of them.

278
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,373
Annie knew
how to talk to 'em.

279

00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:24,004

And now, I give to you...

298

the Medici Brothers' circus.

299
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,170
Okay.

300
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:04,970
Okay, okay,
no one's gonna hurt him.

301
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,738
Okay, little guy,
let's put on a show.

302
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:37,970
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

303
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:41,370
Hey!
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

304
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:43,872
Nah, he died
in the war. So sad.

305
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:50,772
Aw!

306
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:55,138
Aw!

307
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:00,138
What's he doing?

308
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,772
He's reaching
for the feathers.

309
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:19,071
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

310
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,203
Ooh...

311
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,870
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

312
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,436
Those ears are fake!

313
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:43,336
Look! Look at the sign!

314
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:45,138
"Dumbo!"

315
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,269
Uh-oh.

316
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,436
Whoa, calm down, now.

317
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,236
He's a fake!

318
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:02,503
Yeah, he's a fake!

319
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,169
Shut up!

320
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:05,305
You're scaring the elephants!

321
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,102
Take it easy now.
Calm down.

322
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,102
Dumbo,
Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

323
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:14,469
All right, sit down.

324
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:15,236
Dumbo, Dumbo,
fake, fake, fake!

325
00:23:15,238 --> 00:23:16,271
I said sit down!

326
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:18,438
It's okay, little fella.

327
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,271
Fake!

328
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:25,001
Rongo! Music!

329
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,102
Happiness, joy!

330
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:38,068
Hear 'em making
fun of your ugly baby?

331
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,970
Who's gonna help him now?

332
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:45,769
Holt, get those ears
off the stage!

333
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:49,871
Whoa!

334
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:56,369
Okay, all right.

335
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:57,769
Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

336
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,871
Just calm down.

337
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,835
Okay. Attagirl.

338
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:04,704
We're here to protect him.
Same as you.

339
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,968
Attagirl.

340
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,168
Nice and easy.

341
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:15,170
Shh. Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

342
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,871
Rufus, no!

343
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:22,335
- Rufus, stop!
- Mad elephant!

344
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,402
Get back!

345
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:31,435
Max, get the kids out of here!

346
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,302
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

347
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,837
Careful, careful.

348
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:43,268
Kids?

349
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,802
Go, go, go!

350
00:24:44,804 --> 00:24:45,901
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

351
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:46,937
Come on. This way, come on.

352
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:51,304
How do you like your job now,
cowboy?

353
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:54,970
Uh-oh.

354
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,804
Milly, Joe! Come on!

355
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,003
Let's go!
Come on!

356
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,101
And I wanna
just emphasize,

357
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,768
we did everything right.

358
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,768
What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.

359
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,168
It just collapsed.

360
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,070
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

361
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:55,501
Brugelbecker,
I have a man dead,

362
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:56,866
do you understand?

363
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:58,501
This is what they're reading

364
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,067
from the Great Lakes
to the Gulf!

365
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:02,134
You have
a moral responsibility

366
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,134
to buy
your killer elephant back.

367
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:06,301
What about the baby?

368
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:09,367
Well, at least
he got a few laughs.

369
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:10,966
I'll put him
in the clown act,

370
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,136
see if I can
salvage something.

371
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:16,968
I'll buy her back half price.

372
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:21,201
You will buy her back
full price.

373
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:22,434
Quarter price.

374
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,966
Half price it is!

375
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:31,734
Up!

376
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:36,899
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

377
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:38,099
Away.
Back to your tent now.

378
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:39,899
But she's his mom!

379
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,866
Dad, please.
Stop them.

380
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,133
Please!

381
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:44,534
Do something.

382
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,202
Mom would have
done something.

383
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,734
Momma's not here.

384
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:57,166
Okay, little fella.
Okay. Come on.

385
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:02,033
I know, I do.

386
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:06,266
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

387
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,135
Darlin', it's late.

388
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:32,000
Go on now.

389
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,865
I know.
I can't sleep, either.

390
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,232
My momma told me
there'd be times

391
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:35,399
when my life seemed
locked behind a door.

392
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:41,798
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

393
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,299
And said
whenever I have that feeling,

394
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:47,365
imagine that door...

395
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,466
and just turn the key.

396
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,334
So, I keep trying.

397
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:03,531
Not supposed to
be in here alone.

398
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,498
I'm not. You're here.

399
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,065
What's that?

400
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,531
I just thought
he might be hungry.

401
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,134
He's sad.

402
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:13,831
You don't eat
when you're sad.

403
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,167
The mermaid does.

404
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,865
Come on.

405
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:21,299
Have one, Dumbo.

406
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:23,299
We're calling him Dumbo now?

407
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:25,431
If we call him
Jumbo Junior...

408
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,000
it might make him
miss his mom.

409
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:37,399
Here you go... Dumbo.

410
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:40,199
Come on,
and flap those ears again.

411
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,301
To show us
we didn't imagine it.

412
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,966
Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

413
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:53,098
She was just protecting you.

414
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,732
And we think
your ears are great.

415
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,332
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

416
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:05,334
Nobody wants to be alone.

417
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:07,267
Well...

418
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,866
if you change your mind...

419
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:15,400
Night-night, Dumbo.

420
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:46,233
Wow!

421
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,430
It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.

422
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,799
It's the feathers!

423
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:01,933
Dumbo!

424
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:34,397
Dumbo, you gotta do this
in the show.

425
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,097
What do you mean?

426
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,463
'Cause if the circus
sells more tickets

427
00:34:37,465 --> 00:34:38,897
and Medici makes
more money...

428
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:40,064
then we can get him
to use some

429
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,064
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

430
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,231
Yeah!

431
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,796
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

432
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:46,497
Just show them all
what you can do.

433
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,097
Come on.
We gotta tell Dad.

434
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,964
No. He'll just tell us
to be practical.

435
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,931
Shows got canceled
for a week, right?

436
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,966
We can research
and study and test.

437
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:59,796
You're a miracle elephant,
Dumbo.

438
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,933
And we're gonna
bring your momma home.

439
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:06,763
Fire!

440
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,330
So low.

441
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:30,996
An all-time low.

442
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,930
Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?

443
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,130
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

444
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:40,163
Except for lights, music,
fire and crowds.

445
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:42,032
- You can do it.
- Come on, Dumbo.

446
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:45,230
You can do it, Dumbo!

447
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:46,363
Show 'em all
like you showed us!

448
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,497
- Come! Come! Come!
- Attaboy, come on.

449
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,463
Keep comin'. Come on.

450
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:03,298
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

451
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,829
Whoa.

452
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:13,096
Hey! Hey!

453
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:19,398
They love it! They love it!

454
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:24,363
All right, Dumbo.

455
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:25,564
You put out the fire.

456
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:35,021
He won't fly.
He's scared.

457
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:36,855
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

458
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,990
Go on, Dumbo!

459
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,189
Attaboy.

460
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,955
Yeah!
Rule Number One.

461
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,722
"Always have a big finish!"

462
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:12,887
Aw!

463
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,889
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

464
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,156
Yeah!

465
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:34,254
Holt!

466
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,887
- Look, Max!
- What? What?

467
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:37,655
- He's trapped up there.
- Put the fire out!

468
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,387
Dumbo! Fly!

469
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,822
He won't fly
without a feather!

470
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:49,854
Put the fire out!

471
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:50,956
Put it out!

472
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:54,019
- Joe!
- Stop!

473
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,122
Holt, I thought she didn't
want to be in an act.

474
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:02,188
Milly!

475
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:20,787
Here, Dumbo!

476
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:22,288
Come on.

477
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:24,021
Show 'em.

478
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,055
Come on, Dumbo.

479
00:38:54,155 --> 00:38:55,286
Fly, Dumbo.

480
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:56,222
Fly!

481
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:09,889
Whoa!

482
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:14,255
Yeah!

483
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,420
You knew
he could do this?

484
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,721
You should talk
to your kids more.

485
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,453
Sotheby...

486
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:07,686
cancel my dinner
with the president.

487
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:09,954
We've got business
with an elephant.

488
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:14,719
Friends,

489
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:17,985
the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

490
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,286
<i>♪ Happy clowns!</i>

491
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:28,353
- Ah, Rongo the Strong!
- Boss.

492
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:29,885
Hello, Jo!

493
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,252
The Medici Brothers' circus.

494
00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:36,187
Where true love
and mystery abound!

495
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:39,252
Now where's my star?

496
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:42,385
Ah, Dumbo!

497
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:43,719
How's your bath?

498
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,752
Too warm? Too cold?

499
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:48,952
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

500
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:51,352
In our country,
legend tells us

501
00:40:51,354 --> 00:40:54,119
the gods can
take animal forms.

502
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,885
Champagne for Dumbo!

503
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,954
No booze near the baby!

504
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:21,154
Sorry, Dumbo.

505
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:23,818
It's not your momma.

506
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,454
Take Dumbo back inside.

507
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:37,285
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make way

508
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,052
for the emperor
of enchantment.

509
00:41:39,054 --> 00:41:40,385
For the architect of dreams.

510
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:42,718
For the Columbus
of Coney Island.

511
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,685
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

512
00:41:48,454 --> 00:41:52,152
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

513
00:41:52,154 --> 00:41:55,718
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

514
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,252
Miss Marchant!
Miss Marchant!

515
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,819
Ah.

516
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,154
<i>Signore</i> Medici!

517
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,685
He knows who I am.

518
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:08,219
We were just
passing through Missouri...

519
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:10,252
and we heard you were
putting on a little show.

520
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:13,951
Mr. Vandevere.
It's an honor.

521
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:16,919
No, sir.
The honor is mine.

522
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:20,984
I would like
to offer you a drink.

523
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:23,319
But I'm all out of bourbon.

524
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,685
And cognac and scotch.

525
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,252
Not now!

526
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,287
Is that a monkey
in your desk?

527
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:41,784
Just for emergencies.

528
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:44,084
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

529
00:42:44,086 --> 00:42:45,851
I probably should tell you...

530
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:48,251
the elephant is not for sale.

531
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:50,884
Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.

532
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:53,220
That's assuming he is real.

533
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,817
See for yourself.

534
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:04,184
And all due respect,
I don't got all day.

535
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:05,752
- Pleasure to meet you...
- Excuse me.

536
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:07,953
Hello there.

537
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:18,151
So this, uh,
creature of yours...

538
00:43:18,153 --> 00:43:19,886
is supposed to fly?

539
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,917
Trade secrets.

540
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:27,719
Ugh.

541
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,684
Uh, Max,
if you don't mind my asking...

542
00:43:35,686 --> 00:43:40,151
where did you
come upon the animal?

543
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:42,318
He hails
from the far east.

544
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,750
How far?

545
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:45,151
Far.

546
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:48,118
He doesn't look
like "magic" to me.

547
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,817
Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?

548
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:53,817
And you train
flying elephants, too?

549
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,286
Yeah, it's a little hobby
on the side.

550
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:00,153
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

551
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:04,751
Ah, yes.

552
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,384
Yeah?

553
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:13,017
And how on earth
did you do that?

554
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,418
With the
scientific method.

555
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,749
One picture, one picture!

556
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:20,451
Max.

557
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:23,251
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

558
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:25,950
And the tragedy of it is,

559
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:28,850
is you don't even know
that you have it.

560
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:31,451
Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?

561
00:44:31,453 --> 00:44:32,716
No.

562
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:34,018
It's mystique.

563
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:37,950
Max, I know your type.

564
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:40,318
Charlatan, con man,
opportunist...

565
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,384
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

566
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:45,950
And I know it comes
from a deep desire

567
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:47,883
to build something
authentic and true.

568
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,716
I know your game.

569
00:44:49,718 --> 00:44:51,050
It's not a game.

570
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:54,353
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

571
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:56,885
It's up your sleeve.

572
00:44:58,085 --> 00:44:59,952
It's in your pocket.

573
00:45:07,185 --> 00:45:08,749
The secret
to show business

574
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:10,318
is always keep a rabbit
in your hat.

575
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,952
Or a monkey in your desk,
I guess.

576
00:45:14,685 --> 00:45:16,083
Ownership shares?

577
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:17,351
Max, look around you.

578
00:45:17,353 --> 00:45:19,783
Your entire way of life
is dying.

579
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:21,350
The future of the
entertainment business

580
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,183
is to bring
the audience to you.

581
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:25,117
And I've built
that destination.

582
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,749
What I'm lacking...

583
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:29,885
is a protege.

584
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:36,052
I know
there's no Medici Brothers.

585
00:45:37,252 --> 00:45:40,119
You probably always
wanted one.

586
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:42,916
You're offering me
a partnership?

587
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:44,083
Yes.

588
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:45,916
And a home.

589
00:45:45,918 --> 00:45:47,916
For you
and the entire troupe.

590
00:45:47,918 --> 00:45:51,016
A home?
For all of us?

591
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:53,350
Yes. Join me.

592
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:55,450
Join me and my family.

593
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,217
Let me take us all
into the future.

594
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,219
Let me take us all...

595
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:03,185
to Dreamland!

596
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:48,849
I wish Momma
could've seen this.

597
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:51,119
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

598
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:58,884
Way to work your magic, Max.

599
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:11,982
We hear you, Dumbo!

600
00:47:11,984 --> 00:47:13,449
Why won't you
let him see outside?

601
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:15,915
Remember, young lady...

602
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,118
mystique.

603
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:23,650
Now this is why
I joined the circus.

604
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:29,915
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

605
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,182
All right, sugar plum.

606
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:32,982
Remember, we got
a job to do here.

607
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:35,715
My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.

608
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:39,416
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

609
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:42,182
Hang on,
I wasn't saying she can't.

610
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:46,715
What is it exactly that
we do here, <i>ma cherie?</i>

611
00:47:46,717 --> 00:47:50,251
We make
the impossible possible.

612
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:56,915
And that's where
you'll perform.

613
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,216
The Colosseum!

614
00:47:58,218 --> 00:48:01,182
Dumbo will stay
in the training tent behind.

615
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:02,282
Dumbo!

616
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,349
Why aren't we
going with him?

617
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:13,218
Because that
is your new home.

618
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:19,884
Wow!

619
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:22,915
Look at this place!

620
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:24,282
A library...

621
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:26,316
"And the children
shall lead them."

622
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:28,349
We're grateful for the
opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.

623
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:31,381
Oh, your family's mine.

624
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:37,415
You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.

625
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,714
Kentucky's top trick rider.

626
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,116
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

627
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:44,282
only here,
you'd be Captain Farrier...

628
00:48:44,284 --> 00:48:45,415
war hero.

629
00:48:48,151 --> 00:48:49,216
One-armed wonder.

630
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,749
National treasure.

631
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:52,848
Wow!

632
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,116
Well, I still can ride.

633
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:55,316
Oh, I know you can.

634
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:57,781
And you're going to.

635
00:48:57,783 --> 00:48:59,216
Right after you get
that little elephant

636
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:00,448
off the ground for me.

637
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,249
You mean
once his act's working?

638
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:04,015
You're back in the saddle.

639
00:49:04,017 --> 00:49:06,015
We're still working
on the schedule

640
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:07,149
for the rest
of your troupe...

641
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:09,182
but on Friday...

642
00:49:09,184 --> 00:49:10,916
we premiere
our little Dumbo.

643
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,350
I get goose bumps.

644
00:49:17,883 --> 00:49:20,116
Why are you
looking at me?

645
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:21,981
Well, because
the only thing

646
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:25,082
more amazing
than a flying elephant...

647
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:26,616
is the goddess
who can fly it.

648
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:30,282
Have you lost your mind?

649
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:36,184
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

650
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:40,249
So, we fly Friday!

651
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:44,381
Uh, Dumbo's never flown
with anyone.

652
00:49:44,383 --> 00:49:47,348
That's why it's become
abundantly clear

653
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,350
why we need you.

654
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:52,014
Dumbo!

655
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,148
Hey, buddy. We missed you.
You all right?

656
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,948
Hey. Captain Farrier
is in charge.

657
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,883
No one sees the animal
without his approval.

658
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:04,347
Holt.

659
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:05,883
Just call me Holt.

660
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:09,215
I thought you were
a military man.

661
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:11,681
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

662
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:14,681
No.

663
00:50:14,683 --> 00:50:15,948
So you better keep
your elephant friend

664
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,282
on my good side.

665
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:23,749
Hiya, Dumbo.

666
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,948
Dumbo, you mind?

667
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,050
Can I get my arm?

668
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,749
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

669
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:40,215
Welcome.

670
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:42,814
For the record,
this was not my idea.

671
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,280
Dumbo works alone.

672
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:45,883
So do I.

673
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:49,117
<i>Bonjour,</i> Milly, Joe...

674
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:52,380
And you...

675
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:57,014
Hmm, charming.

676
00:50:57,016 --> 00:50:58,280
Well, maybe he doesn't
recognize you

677
00:50:58,282 --> 00:51:00,814
without your makeup.

678
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:02,680
So I gotta
teach you to fly?

679
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:07,014
I know how to fly,
ever since I was a child.

680
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:09,314
They taught
Dumbo to fly, no?

681
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,050
So I don't need
your expertise.

682
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,148
All right.

683
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,780
Well, just so you know,
I've been to France.

684
00:51:17,782 --> 00:51:19,347
It wasn't a good experience.

685
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:21,314
Show me your secret!

686
00:51:21,316 --> 00:51:23,347
How on earth
does your elephant fly?

687
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:25,748
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

688
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:28,615
He won't fly
without a feather.

689
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:32,880
Well then,
neither will I.

690
00:52:00,682 --> 00:52:02,347
Whoa, slow down, princess.
Safety first.

691
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:03,680
Guys, nets.

692
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:04,849
Come on, hurry.

693
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:09,748
All right, guys, good.

694
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:20,181
See, Dumbo?

695
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:23,382
I fly!

696
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,615
See if you can catch me!

697
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:37,947
Here, Dumbo!

698
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,381
Oh, we got some work to do.

699
00:53:50,148 --> 00:53:51,446
Friends and colleagues...

700
00:53:51,448 --> 00:53:52,846
let's give a warm
Dreamland welcome

701
00:53:52,848 --> 00:53:54,213
to our new executive
vice president...

702
00:53:54,215 --> 00:53:55,181
Mr. Max Medici.

703
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:00,213
Anything he needs,
anything at all...

704
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:02,148
make it happen
as you always do.

705
00:54:06,948 --> 00:54:08,679
This is Miss Verna.

706
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:10,045
She will handle
your schedule,

707
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,413
correspondence,
and all your calls.

708
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,179
When you're needed
in meetings,

709
00:54:14,181 --> 00:54:15,779
she'll let you know.

710
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:17,146
Are there meetings today?

711
00:54:17,148 --> 00:54:18,879
I'll let you know!

712
00:54:21,148 --> 00:54:23,011
Uh, Mr. Vandevere,
one question.

713
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:25,215
Exactly what do I do?

714
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:31,747
So where'd
Vandevere find you?

715
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,281
I was a street performer
in Paris.

716
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:38,279
He discovered me.

717
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:40,080
And here I am.

718
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:44,145
A millionaire's girlfriend.

719
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,348
That's a tough break.

720
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,112
It's all for show.

721
00:54:49,114 --> 00:54:51,779
So you and he,
you're not, uh...

722
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:53,446
I'm one of many
gems he wears

723
00:54:53,448 --> 00:54:54,980
to reflect the light
back onto him.

724
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:57,247
Huh.

725
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,912
Good boy, Dumbo.

726
00:55:00,914 --> 00:55:02,712
- Good job.
- Yeah! They're gonna love him.

727
00:55:02,714 --> 00:55:04,214
I think you are
the lucky one.

728
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,345
- Well done, Dumbo.
- Good boy.

729
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:11,681
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

730
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,712
So, how's everything?

731
00:55:15,714 --> 00:55:17,412
- Good?
- Oh, we're making progress.

732
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,145
But he ain't
quite ready yet.

733
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:21,912
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

734
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:24,278
- It's not that simple.
- <i>Ma cherie...</i>

735
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,978
we've already sold
all the tickets.

736
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,779
Maybe our little
scientist here

737
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:31,647
can show us
that it's going to work.

738
00:55:44,314 --> 00:55:45,912
Prepare for takeoff.

739
00:55:45,914 --> 00:55:47,080
- Right wing?
- Check!

740
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:50,178
Left wing?

741
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,145
Check!

742
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:54,247
Take her up, Dumbo.

743
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,911
Let's go.

744
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:01,380
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Come on, Dumbo.

745
00:56:03,347 --> 00:56:05,180
That's it. Come on.

746
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:12,910
Let's try it again.

747
00:56:14,813 --> 00:56:16,646
You got this.
Here you go.

748
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,680
You beautiful
one-armed cowboy.

749
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:37,114
You've made me
a child again.

750
00:56:48,979 --> 00:56:52,010
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>

751
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,780
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

752
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:41,277
<i>Buonasera.</i> Max Medici.

753
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:43,711
I discovered the elephant,
my elephant.

754
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:45,044
And basically I said no.

755
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,744
I walked out and that
was the end of that.

756
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:48,077
The flying
elephant's mine.

757
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,079
Yeah.

758
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:52,111
You're the guy!

759
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:54,910
You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!

760
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:56,144
Max.

761
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:58,711
J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.

762
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:01,010
He's the money man.

763
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:02,277
The J?

764
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:05,111
Whoa! It's a pleasure
to meet you.

765
00:58:05,113 --> 00:58:06,910
How are you?

766
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:08,244
You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.

767
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:09,844
That's why
they're going to send

768
00:58:09,846 --> 00:58:11,277
a man up there
one of these days.

769
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,444
And my bank is
going to be the bank

770
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:16,177
that finances
the expedition.

771
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:17,311
What do you think of that?

772
00:58:17,313 --> 00:58:18,710
Uh-huh.

773
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,044
Needless to say, Max...

774
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:21,910
we all have high hopes
for tonight.

775
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:24,877
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

776
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:26,710
Well, you know,
hopes, and dreams,

777
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,177
that's one thing.
That's words.

778
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:30,344
But what we're talking
about here is facts!

779
00:58:30,346 --> 00:58:31,677
Plans!

780
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,010
Plans! That takes
a lot of money.

781
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:35,710
Which he hasn't got!

782
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,311
So, we are hoping
that your pachyderm

783
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:39,177
comes through
with the goods.

784
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:42,077
Now let's get this show
on the road!

785
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:50,246
We are looking good!

786
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:53,444
Don't worry, Big D.

787
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,211
There's just more room to fly out
there, that's all.

788
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:57,776
Round and round,
just like we practiced.

789
00:58:57,778 --> 00:59:00,177
And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!

790
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:01,244
About the what?

791
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,776
We made a deal with Dumbo.

792
00:59:02,778 --> 00:59:04,211
We promised we'd buy
his mom back

793
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,843
with all the money
he makes for the circus.

794
00:59:05,845 --> 00:59:06,978
That's why he flies.

795
00:59:08,213 --> 00:59:10,710
- Joe, not now!
- Are we ready?

796
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:11,945
Yeah.

797
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,909
Okay, let's go.

798
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:22,612
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

799
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,410
Pink elephants?

800
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:24,845
So?

801
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:28,808
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i>

802
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,908
<i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i>

803
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,042
<i>V.A. Vandevere,</i>

804
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:37,243
<i>in association
with Max Medici...</i>

805
01:01:37,245 --> 01:01:41,908
<i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...</i>

806
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,310
<i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i>

807
01:01:44,312 --> 01:01:46,975
<i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i>

808
01:01:46,977 --> 01:01:49,908
<i>You've even seen a housefly.</i>

809
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,075
<i>But you haven't
seen anything...</i>

810
01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:56,008
<i>until you see
an elephant fly.</i>

811
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,975
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

812
01:02:16,177 --> 01:02:17,743
Coming through.

813
01:02:19,044 --> 01:02:20,743
Come on.

814
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:40,144
He can do it.

815
01:02:42,777 --> 01:02:43,977
I know he can.

816
01:02:48,777 --> 01:02:50,808
<i>And here to welcome him...</i>

817
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:55,842
<i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

818
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:49,740
Dumbo.

819
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:53,009
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

820
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:55,642
Nice and easy,
like we practiced.

821
01:04:02,344 --> 01:04:04,007
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm.

822
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,009
Why aren't they
putting up the nets?

823
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:09,774
Hey, guys?

824
01:04:09,776 --> 01:04:11,108
Guys, what's going on?

825
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,309
Your men are supposed
to be out there!

826
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:13,110
Change of plan.
From the top.

827
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,907
I can't see the nets.

828
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:29,276
- They're invisible.
- Hmm.

829
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,343
What's wrong with you?
They need nets!

830
01:04:34,742 --> 01:04:35,674
Colette!

831
01:04:35,676 --> 01:04:37,176
Wait, don't take off!

832
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,208
Dumbo...

833
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,241
Oh, boy!

834
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:42,909
...Prince of the Elephants.

835
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:47,709
I command you
to fly with me.

836
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:19,907
Colette!

837
01:05:35,909 --> 01:05:37,308
Lower the platform!

838
01:05:55,675 --> 01:05:57,675
Fly, little one!

839
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:18,808
Magic dust!

840
01:06:46,675 --> 01:06:47,875
Where's my show?

841
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:13,339
The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.

842
01:07:33,274 --> 01:07:35,942
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

843
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:13,339
Dumbo, it's okay.

844
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:15,208
We're here.

845
01:08:16,241 --> 01:08:17,705
Good evening.

846
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:19,172
It's Mr. Vandevere.

847
01:08:19,174 --> 01:08:20,372
- Hello, hi.
- Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

848
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:21,705
Everyone having fun?

849
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:23,073
Good.

850
01:08:23,075 --> 01:08:24,839
- Having a good time?
- Yes, sir.

851
01:08:24,841 --> 01:08:26,672
Fantastic.

852
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:29,140
Get him outta here.

853
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:30,738
- Yes.
- Over here!

854
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,072
- Folks, please.
- Hello.

855
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,872
Folks, I need you
to leave the exhibit.

856
01:08:33,874 --> 01:08:35,907
Come on.

857
01:08:37,841 --> 01:08:39,439
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

858
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:41,805
Soldier,
I give the orders here.

859
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,972
It's his bedtime.

860
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,238
<i>This attraction is now closed.</i>

861
01:09:02,408 --> 01:09:04,005
Dad?

862
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:05,140
Uh-huh.

863
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,774
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

864
01:09:13,674 --> 01:09:15,772
Come on,
I want to see Dumbo!

865
01:09:15,774 --> 01:09:17,238
I want to see Dumbo!

866
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,171
I want my money back!

867
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:19,338
I don't understand.

868
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,772
The elephant flies.
You saw it.

869
01:09:21,774 --> 01:09:23,371
I saw a vanishing act.

870
01:09:23,373 --> 01:09:26,972
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

871
01:09:26,974 --> 01:09:29,271
You can't control
your animal.

872
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:31,405
You give me a little time,
I can fix this.

873
01:09:31,407 --> 01:09:34,907
Whatever! Till then,
the bank is closed.

874
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:40,672
What happened up there?

875
01:09:40,674 --> 01:09:41,905
You lost control
of the animal.

876
01:09:41,907 --> 01:09:42,905
You're the animal.

877
01:09:42,907 --> 01:09:44,238
Where was my net?

878
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,705
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

879
01:09:49,373 --> 01:09:51,772
Training?
You call that training?

880
01:09:51,774 --> 01:09:54,271
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

881
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,271
He recognized
that other elephant's call.

882
01:09:56,273 --> 01:09:58,371
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

883
01:09:58,373 --> 01:10:00,138
It's true.
It's her.

884
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,438
She was sold from our
circus two months ago.

885
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,972
Every child
knows its mother.

886
01:10:02,974 --> 01:10:05,438
And they say
elephants never forget.

887
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,704
They can be
together now.

888
01:10:07,706 --> 01:10:09,405
Why are there children
in my office?

889
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:13,338
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

890
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,737
Just reunite them,

891
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:16,171
and he'll do
whatever you want.

892
01:10:16,173 --> 01:10:19,305
No, he'll do
whatever she wants.

893
01:10:19,307 --> 01:10:20,872
You think
I'd have bought her

894
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:23,338
if I thought she was
related to him? Hmm?

895
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,873
Doesn't help me at all.

896
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:31,939
You wanna know
the most important thing

897
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:33,273
about growing up?

898
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:39,140
You've got to learn
to go it alone.

899
01:10:42,207 --> 01:10:44,838
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

900
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,238
And treat yourself
to some new boots.

901
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,606
But, sir,
you can't just kill her.

902
01:10:49,107 --> 01:10:50,271
Why not?

903
01:10:50,273 --> 01:10:51,737
Mr. Vandevere.

904
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:54,004
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

905
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:56,037
Don't do that to my kids.

906
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:58,405
You know, Holt,
when my father left us,

907
01:10:58,407 --> 01:11:00,037
it was a blessing really.

908
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:03,037
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

909
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:05,438
Maybe that's what
your children need.

910
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,938
Don't tell me
what my children need.

911
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,373
Best take a step back,
Elephant Man.

912
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:12,305
Darling...

913
01:11:12,307 --> 01:11:16,704
Dumbo and his mom
need a little alone time.

914
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,971
So, Mommy's going to
take a little trip...

915
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:21,039
so that Dumbo
won't be distracted.

916
01:11:23,806 --> 01:11:26,239
Milly! Milly!

917
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:40,272
Colette?

918
01:11:42,072 --> 01:11:43,339
I have rehearsal.

919
01:11:45,005 --> 01:11:46,072
Max.

920
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:52,904
<i>Nightmare Island.</i>

921
01:11:52,906 --> 01:11:54,704
Milly?

922
01:11:54,706 --> 01:11:56,337
<i>Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.</i>

923
01:11:56,339 --> 01:11:58,005
Sir, park's closing.

924
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:06,239
Milly!

925
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,239
Milly!

926
01:12:16,139 --> 01:12:18,172
Did you find her?

927
01:12:18,972 --> 01:12:19,972
No.

928
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:27,070
Well, her momma always knew
what to say. No matter what.

929
01:12:27,072 --> 01:12:29,237
She always knew.

930
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:32,804
Your children don't need you
to be perfect.

931
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,005
They just need you
to believe in them.

932
01:12:36,672 --> 01:12:38,139
That simple, huh?

933
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:47,672
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

934
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,437
That's my daughter
all right.

935
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:14,605
The only girl I know who
runs away to go to school.

936
01:13:15,772 --> 01:13:17,404
It's our fault.

937
01:13:17,406 --> 01:13:19,902
Bet Dumbo wishes
he never met us.

938
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:22,437
Ah, you showed him
he could fly.

939
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,270
You think
he'd ever trade that?

940
01:13:25,272 --> 01:13:27,272
He would to have
his mom back.

941
01:13:32,904 --> 01:13:34,205
I miss Momma.

942
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:37,839
Yeah, so do I.

943
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,902
There's something
I want to show you.

944
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:46,136
<i>With advances in both</i>

945
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:48,036
<i>engineering and medicine...</i>

946
01:13:48,038 --> 01:13:50,437
<i>the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...</i>

947
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:53,902
<i>to assist ordinary families,
workers and veterans.</i>

948
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:56,036
<i>All kinds
of technological marvels</i>

949
01:13:56,038 --> 01:13:58,105
<i>await us in the 20th century.</i>

950
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:01,705
You're gonna do
great things.

951
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:03,938
I know it.

952
01:14:14,805 --> 01:14:16,203
Whoa, whoa. What's this?

953
01:14:16,205 --> 01:14:17,836
Oh, give me a break.

954
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:20,705
I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?

955
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,869
Oh, Max, hello!

956
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:30,936
Good, you brought
the paperwork.

957
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,902
Max...

958
01:14:32,904 --> 01:14:35,703
I was reviewing
your troupe...

959
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,403
and to be honest with you...

960
01:14:37,405 --> 01:14:40,069
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

961
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,936
So I was thinking,
I don't know,

962
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:43,736
a month's severance?
Seems fair.

963
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:45,038
<i>Capisce?</i>

964
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:48,303
I thought you promised to...

965
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:51,203
Max, the contract says
that I'd hire them.

966
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:53,236
It never stipulated
for how long.

967
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,336
So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.

968
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:59,902
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

969
01:14:59,904 --> 01:15:02,369
Okay, let's have a heart.

970
01:15:02,371 --> 01:15:04,238
Why don't you tell them?

971
01:15:15,938 --> 01:15:19,205
'Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

972
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:31,968
What's going on, guys?

973
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,935
Vandevere's fired them all.

974
01:15:33,937 --> 01:15:36,071
They're to leave by tomorrow.

975
01:15:48,803 --> 01:16:20,766
Goodbye, little friend.

976
01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:23,313
Goodbye.

977
01:16:25,513 --> 01:16:28,378
We wanted to see him
one last time.

978
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,043
One last time
to see him fly.

979
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,378
I don't think
he wants to anymore.

980
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,310
Oh, no. But he must.

981
01:16:36,312 --> 01:16:39,076
He cannot lose
Mrs. Jumbo again!

982
01:16:39,078 --> 01:16:41,912
Uh, I'm afraid
it's rather worse than that.

983
01:16:42,446 --> 01:16:44,177
Mr. Sotheby?

984
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:47,110
I've come
to clear my conscience.

985
01:16:47,112 --> 01:16:49,910
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

986
01:16:49,912 --> 01:16:52,277
What order?

987
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,343
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.

988
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:57,179
And she's not
meant to survive.

989
01:17:12,978 --> 01:17:15,510
This "Dreamland"
doesn't deserve him.

990
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:17,345
No circus does.

991
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:33,744
Well, who's gonna be
willing to help me?

992
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:37,878
Set Dumbo
and his momma free.

993
01:18:07,179 --> 01:18:08,742
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum,</i>

994
01:18:08,744 --> 01:18:11,445
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

995
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:16,477
Okay.
Second time's the charm.

996
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:20,042
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

997
01:18:20,044 --> 01:18:21,410
<i>Here to pick up the elephant</i>

998
01:18:21,412 --> 01:18:23,210
- <i>from Nightmare Island?</i>
- Confirmed.

999
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:24,844
Unlock the back gates.

1000
01:18:47,877 --> 01:18:50,443
Dumbo in position!

1001
01:18:50,445 --> 01:18:52,276
Soon as he flies,
you run back to his tent

1002
01:18:52,278 --> 01:18:53,875
and I'll find you there.

1003
01:18:53,877 --> 01:18:55,209
All right, Big D.

1004
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:59,342
It's all up to you now.

1005
01:18:59,344 --> 01:19:01,775
Come on, Holt!

1006
01:19:11,744 --> 01:19:13,111
To hell with it.

1007
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,875
Ready for positions.

1008
01:19:19,877 --> 01:19:22,142
We could have used
a little rehearsal.

1009
01:19:22,144 --> 01:19:23,808
Rehearsal?

1010
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,111
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

1011
01:19:27,144 --> 01:19:29,042
You sure you can do this?

1012
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:30,877
I fly elephants
all the time.

1013
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:34,509
Are you sure
you can do this?

1014
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:36,378
With one hand
tied behind my back.

1015
01:19:49,178 --> 01:19:51,777
Wait. What's that?

1016
01:19:53,144 --> 01:19:54,144
Ma'am?

1017
01:19:55,944 --> 01:19:57,942
Ma'am?

1018
01:19:57,944 --> 01:20:00,009
Sorry, ma'am,
attraction's closed.

1019
01:20:00,011 --> 01:20:03,242
My dream...
to be a mermaid...

1020
01:20:03,244 --> 01:20:05,774
and now
they've taken it away.

1021
01:20:05,776 --> 01:20:08,242
And yet I hear
the water singing.

1022
01:20:08,244 --> 01:20:09,476
I hear them
beckoning me home.

1023
01:20:09,478 --> 01:20:11,409
Lady, just be careful,
okay?

1024
01:20:11,411 --> 01:20:12,807
Return me
to the vast abyss!

1025
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,242
Let's go.

1026
01:20:14,244 --> 01:20:16,676
- My destiny, the sea!
- Okay.

1027
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:07,276
We've lost power!

1028
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:08,807
Even the cages?

1029
01:21:08,809 --> 01:21:12,008
But the animals...

1030
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,342
Find the breakers.
Get the lights back on!

1031
01:21:14,344 --> 01:21:16,177
And make sure
those cages are locked.

1032
01:21:34,776 --> 01:21:36,175
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1033
01:21:36,177 --> 01:21:38,175
<i>boys and girls.</i>

1034
01:21:38,177 --> 01:21:41,841
<i>Making his second
Dreamland debut.</i>

1035
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:44,508
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

1036
01:22:44,476 --> 01:22:45,343
Hey!

1037
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:55,708
It's a trick!
Get back to the...

1038
01:23:11,009 --> 01:23:15,507
<i>And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!</i>

1039
01:23:37,376 --> 01:23:38,440
You.

1040
01:23:38,442 --> 01:23:41,276
Where is
your circus of freaks?

1041
01:23:43,142 --> 01:23:44,507
What's going on?

1042
01:23:44,509 --> 01:23:47,007
The elephant's
mother is gone!

1043
01:23:47,009 --> 01:23:49,940
His troupe's behind it!

1044
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:52,474
Alert the tower
and secure the gates.

1045
01:23:52,476 --> 01:23:54,075
Don't let them get out.

1046
01:23:55,341 --> 01:23:57,442
But why would they
only take the one?

1047
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:01,973
Keep your eye on Farrier
and those kids.

1048
01:24:01,975 --> 01:24:03,675
You! Come with us.

1049
01:24:17,842 --> 01:24:19,142
There they are!

1050
01:24:21,176 --> 01:24:22,242
Hey!

1051
01:24:32,176 --> 01:24:33,806
Hey, you!

1052
01:24:33,808 --> 01:24:35,274
What are you
doing up there?

1053
01:24:35,276 --> 01:24:37,073
That's private property.

1054
01:24:37,075 --> 01:24:38,973
Come on! Get down here!

1055
01:24:38,975 --> 01:24:40,207
Now!

1056
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:43,406
Hey, I'm Max Medici,
Vandevere's partner.

1057
01:24:43,408 --> 01:24:45,973
He's just a maintenance man
fixing a light!

1058
01:24:45,975 --> 01:24:47,274
Get back to your posts!

1059
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:49,142
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

1060
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:06,107
Let's try this again.

1061
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:07,408
You and me.

1062
01:25:23,075 --> 01:25:24,339
Hey, the kids?

1063
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:25,506
Where are the kids?

1064
01:25:25,508 --> 01:25:26,939
Hey, have you
seen the kids?

1065
01:25:26,941 --> 01:25:31,039
Dumbo,
Prince of the Elephants!

1066
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:34,041
I command you
to fly with me.

1067
01:25:49,141 --> 01:25:51,375
Dumbo, please fly.

1068
01:25:52,441 --> 01:25:54,141
Do it for your momma.

1069
01:26:49,174 --> 01:26:50,274
Where's your father?

1070
01:27:03,774 --> 01:27:05,307
Dumbo!

1071
01:27:17,874 --> 01:27:19,673
Hey! Get those kids!

1072
01:27:22,806 --> 01:27:24,407
Dumbo!

1073
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:58,007
Come on.

1074
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:00,305
There!

1075
01:28:17,873 --> 01:28:18,940
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1076
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,773
Just passing through!

1077
01:28:24,106 --> 01:28:25,740
Hey! You can't do that!

1078
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,171
Get the elephant!

1079
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:31,971
You get the elephant!

1080
01:28:53,539 --> 01:28:56,704
Don't worry.
Dad'll be here soon.

1081
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,273
Where's the elephant?

1082
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,404
Why are you
just standing there?

1083
01:29:06,406 --> 01:29:07,704
Get to the tower!

1084
01:29:07,706 --> 01:29:10,038
Electricity's failing!
There's no elevators!

1085
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:13,671
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

1086
01:29:13,673 --> 01:29:15,370
<i>We seem to be experiencing</i>

1087
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:17,307
<i>some technical difficulties.</i>

1088
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:34,304
What happened to my power?

1089
01:29:34,306 --> 01:29:37,138
What power, <i>mon cheri?</i>

1090
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,637
You ungrateful...

1091
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,504
You were nothing before
I made you my... Uh...

1092
01:29:42,506 --> 01:29:45,539
I believe the word
is "queen."

1093
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:48,439
I need lights!

1094
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,271
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1095
01:29:53,273 --> 01:29:55,204
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1096
01:29:55,206 --> 01:29:56,404
Right now it's impossible!

1097
01:29:56,406 --> 01:29:58,706
Nothing's impossible!

1098
01:30:00,339 --> 01:30:02,206
Mr. Vandevere!

1099
01:30:08,105 --> 01:30:09,473
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1100
01:30:35,206 --> 01:30:36,739
Milly! Joe!

1101
01:30:45,538 --> 01:30:47,371
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1102
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:15,470
Get everyone out!

1103
01:31:15,472 --> 01:31:17,505
Evacuate the park!

1104
01:31:21,538 --> 01:31:23,269
Milly! Joe!

1105
01:31:36,405 --> 01:31:37,572
Hey!

1106
01:31:43,538 --> 01:31:45,570
Where is the elephant?

1107
01:31:45,572 --> 01:31:47,570
Let her go!

1108
01:32:04,338 --> 01:32:05,503
Come on!

1109
01:32:05,505 --> 01:32:06,736
Milly! Joe!

1110
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:08,503
Dad!

1111
01:32:08,505 --> 01:32:09,770
- You all right? All right?
- We're fine.

1112
01:32:09,772 --> 01:32:11,470
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

1113
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:13,203
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1114
01:32:13,205 --> 01:32:14,338
Back!

1115
01:32:16,638 --> 01:32:17,738
Stay close.

1116
01:32:27,204 --> 01:32:28,503
Come on, everybody.

1117
01:32:28,505 --> 01:32:31,202
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1118
01:32:31,204 --> 01:32:33,270
- Where are the Farriers?
- They must still be inside.

1119
01:33:06,103 --> 01:33:07,004
Dad!

1120
01:33:07,705 --> 01:33:09,168
It's okay, Joe.

1121
01:33:10,672 --> 01:33:11,738
Come here. Come here.

1122
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:15,638
Dumbo!

1123
01:33:23,705 --> 01:33:24,770
Dumbo!

1124
01:33:24,772 --> 01:33:26,736
Come on!

1125
01:33:26,738 --> 01:33:29,602
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Jump!

1126
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,168
Come on. Come on.

1127
01:33:38,737 --> 01:33:40,537
- All right, let's go.
- Stay close, come on.

1128
01:33:43,504 --> 01:33:44,769
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

1129
01:33:44,771 --> 01:33:47,168
Come on!

1130
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:49,335
- Dumbo!
- Come on!

1131
01:33:49,337 --> 01:33:50,735
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1132
01:33:50,737 --> 01:33:52,569
Guys! Milly! Joe!
Come on!

1133
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:54,204
Dumbo, let's go!

1134
01:33:58,204 --> 01:33:59,302
Go!

1135
01:34:04,404 --> 01:34:06,035
Dumbo!

1136
01:34:06,037 --> 01:34:07,669
Get him!

1137
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:10,202
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1138
01:34:10,204 --> 01:34:11,635
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1139
01:34:11,637 --> 01:34:12,735
He lost the feather.

1140
01:34:12,737 --> 01:34:14,202
Feather doesn't do nothin'.

1141
01:34:14,204 --> 01:34:16,168
Dumbo, you don't need
the feather to fly.

1142
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:17,735
Dad, they're coming!

1143
01:34:17,737 --> 01:34:20,101
Stand back! Stand back!

1144
01:34:20,103 --> 01:34:21,137
Out of my way!

1145
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:25,435
Dumbo, remember this?

1146
01:34:25,437 --> 01:34:27,435
From my momma?

1147
01:34:27,437 --> 01:34:32,302
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

1148
01:34:32,304 --> 01:34:34,067
But I don't need
this key to do it.

1149
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:35,304
And you don't need
the feather.

1150
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:37,504
Come on.

1151
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:54,034
Dad!

1152
01:34:54,036 --> 01:34:55,136
Gotta go. Come on!

1153
01:34:57,069 --> 01:34:58,469
What are you doing?

1154
01:34:58,471 --> 01:35:00,201
There ain't room
for the three of us.

1155
01:35:00,203 --> 01:35:01,569
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1156
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:02,969
Go on, Big D.

1157
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,435
Grab 'em!

1158
01:35:10,437 --> 01:35:11,436
Hey!

1159
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:19,571
Hey!

1160
01:35:21,236 --> 01:35:23,269
That's my elephant!

1161
01:35:37,036 --> 01:35:38,601
They're safe.

1162
01:35:38,603 --> 01:35:40,203
Come on, let's go!

1163
01:35:43,069 --> 01:35:44,568
Hey! Get back here!

1164
01:35:47,804 --> 01:35:49,601
You freak!
What have you done?

1165
01:35:49,603 --> 01:35:51,434
What they pay me for,
mister.

1166
01:35:51,436 --> 01:35:53,034
Put on a hell of a show.

1167
01:35:56,269 --> 01:35:58,134
Hey! Him!

1168
01:35:58,136 --> 01:36:00,034
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1169
01:36:00,036 --> 01:36:02,367
Hey, we had a contract,
Medici!

1170
01:36:02,369 --> 01:36:05,403
I'm no expert, but I think
you got bigger problems here.

1171
01:36:17,303 --> 01:36:19,403
Wow. This is a disaster.

1172
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,201
Come on,
I'll buy you a hot dog.

1173
01:36:22,203 --> 01:36:24,134
Sounds good, J.G.

1174
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:06,200
Last call for cargo!

1175
01:37:06,202 --> 01:37:08,801
All aboard!

1176
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:31,302
Colette!

1177
01:37:39,368 --> 01:37:41,066
Where's your father?

1178
01:37:41,068 --> 01:37:43,233
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1179
01:37:49,402 --> 01:37:50,768
Dad!

1180
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:52,636
I knew you could ride.

1181
01:37:59,035 --> 01:38:01,135
- Pramesh, we have to go.
- Please, hurry.

1182
01:38:02,435 --> 01:38:04,968
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

1183
01:38:06,068 --> 01:38:07,202
Come.

1184
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:09,569
Let's go home.

1185
01:38:25,469 --> 01:38:27,502
Hey!

1186
01:38:49,368 --> 01:38:51,402
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

1187
01:38:54,135 --> 01:38:55,166
Go on.

1188
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:37,098
Ladies and gentlemen...

1189
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:41,766
introducing our world-famous
flying elephant.

1190
01:39:49,134 --> 01:39:52,500
Welcome to
the Medici Family circus!

1191

no wild animals

1192
01:39:54,734 --> 01:39:57,334
shall be held in captivity.

1193

and most versatile man.

1195
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:15,365
Meet the bewitching
Miss Atlantis...

1196

underwater Shakespeare,

1197
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:22,399

only living merman, Puck!

1198
01:40:27,734 --> 01:40:30,098
And visit
our newest attraction,

1199
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,632

World of Wonders...

Marvel at the skills

And the Pearl of Paris,

Queen of the Heavens!

1206

Friends, young and old,

3
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,430
<i>Dash! Dash!</i>

4
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:42,634
<i>Dash!</i>

5
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,835
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

6
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,311
Cover me!

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,829
<i>Miller!</i>

8
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,908
Is that it?

9
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,546
Project 725.

10
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:19,490
If you provide a server
powerful enough,

11
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:21,793
the A.I. will run off this.

12
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,531
So small, yet so powerful.

13
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,368
This...

14
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,572
is how we change the world.

15
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:32,997
<i>Need some help up here, hurry!</i>

16
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,867
<i>Miller!</i>

17
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,935
<i>Don't leave me!</i>

18
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,932
You did it.
Good job, good job.

19
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,127
Boy.

20
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:15,500
Derek Miller.

21
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,105
- Donovan Chalmers.
- Pleasure.

22
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,941
Welcome to Chapter House.

23
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,516
I read up on you.

24
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,985
Impressive stuff.

25
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:36,686
Just doing my duty.

26
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,223
Spoken like
a true soldier.

27
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:41,925
Well, it takes one
to know one, right?

28
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,329
Ah, you did your homework.

29
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,231
Yes, sir.

30
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,233
It's not every day you get
to meet a ground and pounder

31
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,100
turned CEO.

32
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:54,271
75th Regiment,
Task Force Ranger...

33
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:55,638
B Company.

34
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:57,041
Mogadishu?

35
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,909
Mogadishu,

36
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,178
Somalia, Bosnia...

37
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,614
Iraq.

38
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:06,684
Quite the career change.

39
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:07,752
Why the switch?

40
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,887
Hm.

41
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,254
Family life...

42
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,691
changes everything.

43
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,226
Yeah.

44
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,697
Your refrence spoke
very highly of you.

45
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,833
Is that right?

46
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,379
And who was it that referred me?

47
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,680
I did, you son of a bitch.

48
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,315
Fox! Look at you.

49
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,817
Uh-oh.

50
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:43,887
"Suits and ties
are for pussies."

51
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,187
Oh, man.

52
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:48,024
Maggie wanted me out of the game
while I still had all my limbs.

53
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,293
- Wives.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

54
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:53,797
She made me sell
my soul for a fancy 401(k).

55
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,865
- Looking good.
- Thank you, brother.

56
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,300
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

57
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,836
- Right.
- Hey, Fox...

58
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:59,903
Yes, sir?

59
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,838
Walk Derek
through the proposal.

60
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:08,745
I'm sure you recognize
your old friend,

61
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,346
the Pardoner.

62
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,850
The terrorist revolutionary
who's been raising hell

63
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,318
all over the globe
for the past two years.

64
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,053
How could I forget him?

65
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,122
He put a bullet
in my back.

66
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,125
Still have the scar
to prove it.

67
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:27,697
What's this have to do
with Chapter House?

68
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,966
Last week,
the Pardoner stole

69
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,935
a piece of Chapter House
technology.

70
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:35,339
A piece of proprietary tech that
we do not need in hands like his.

71
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,141
Why's that?

72
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,711
Could be bad.

73
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,913
"Could be bad?"
Bad for who?

74
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,148
Bad for you?

75
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,752
Bad for everyone.

76
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,754
Flight 314...

77
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,057
Crashed off the coast,

78
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,925
no survivors.

79
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:58,194
Now, we have reason to believe
that the Pardoner is liable.

80
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:00,263
Now, fortunate for us,

81
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,800
we put a fail-safe on the
trigger of the device,

82
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:05,235
just in case
for circumstances like this.

83
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,237
That's good, right?

84
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,370
Yeah...

85
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,408
but there's only one man
that has the code to decrypt it.

86
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:13,978
And now that man is
a high-value target.

87
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,980
That man is me.

88
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,352
The board put a trip
on the books for Mr. Chalmers

89
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:24,288
<i>to check out a site
for a new factory.</i>

90
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,190
<i>Now, it's an old warehouse</i>

91
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:29,926
that they're dying to tear down,
but we need to act fast.

92
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,329
Tax incentives,
credits, rebates...

93
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,230
Billions on the line.

94
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:35,733
So, what?

95
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:38,435
You want me and my team
to babysit you?

96
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,237
Come on.

97
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,740
Hey. This is a lay-up.

98
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,842
Okay, maybe nothing happens,

99
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,210
but you and your team,
you go in,

100
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,345
you go home
with an easy payday.

101
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,682
Or maybe...

102
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:55,219
Maybe you get another chance to go
another round with the Pardoner.

103
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:59,990
I don't know, Nick.

104
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,925
We don't usually
do security detail.

105
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,927
Come on.
I need you on this one.

106
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,764
Can't you call in
some favors?

107
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:09,466
Get a couple more
teams involved?

108
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,902
The Pardoner is a former Tier-1
turned radical.

109
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:14,103
His influences run deep.

110
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:16,973
Now, we can't risk
the possibility of infiltration.

111
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,243
I can trust you.

112
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:21,811
I can't say the same thing
about my other contacts.

113
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:24,849
Remember Darfur?

114
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:29,119
I'm the one
that saved your ass.

115
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:31,288
I figured you owe me
on this one.

116
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:37,260
Chapter House has
unlimited resources.

117
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:41,097
We're prepared to offer you
a very lucrative contract.

118
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,166
Lots of zeroes, buddy.

119
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,070
Lots of zeroes.

120
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:57,480
Okay.

121
00:10:57,514 --> 00:11:00,984
If we do this,
we do it my way.

122
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:04,021
You clue me in
on everything.

123
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,023
And everything
goes through me.

124
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,025
No questions asked.

125
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:11,095
Then you'll do it?

126
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,331
Yeah.

127
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:25,141
Uh, Crystal,
can I have two beers?

128
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:26,509
- Sure.
- Thank you.

129
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,078
What'd you do last night?

130
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:30,514
A little bit of laundry.

131
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,249
- Party girl.
- Yeah.

132
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:35,118
You got anything
for tonight planned?

133
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,919
Washing the dog.

134
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:38,288
Okay.

135
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,324
All right, well,
I'll catch you later.

136
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:43,059
Have fun with your dog.

137
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,061
Your usual, honey?

138
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,562
Yes, please.

139
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,465
Club soda with lime.

140
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:50,634
Thank you.

141
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,903
What's wrong?
You seem down.

142
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:56,439
Just stuff.

143
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:09,119
What's up, buddy?
Nice to see you.

144
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:10,921
Dude, do you think
I should talk to her?

145
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:12,088
- Her?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,923
Oh, absolutely.

147
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:17,126
You can't let a girl like that
drink by herself now, can ya?

148
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:19,495
Uh...

149
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,398
What do you think...

150
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:23,333
Listen, listen.

151
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:25,401
That's not just some girl.

152
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:28,504
That's a woman.
A real woman.

153
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,206
Now, you be brave.

154
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,442
And you slide
right over there,

155
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,510
you look her
in the fucking eyes,

156
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,946
you kiss her.

157
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,180
All right?

158
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,115
Chicks love that shit.

159
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,184
Go get 'em, big guy.

160
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,290
- There you go!
- Fuck it!

161
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,493
You are an asshole.

162
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,361
This should be interesting.

163
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:54,364
Hey...

164
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:58,000
Ooh.

165
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,504
Don't you fucking put your hand on me.

166
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,072
Jesus, Sasha.

167
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,609
Really, Dash?

168
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,912
Let him go, Sash.

169
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,380
Fuck.

170
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:13,350
We've got business to discuss.

171
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:18,621
Look, I know
I'm asking a lot.

172
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,494
Last time, we got our
asses kicked by the Pardoner.

173
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,330
We lost our VIP.

174
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:28,498
And if you remember correctly,

175
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,200
you almost came home
in a body-bag.

176
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,570
Is this some sort
of revenge thing?

177
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,104
That doesn't feel
like you, man.

178
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,975
It's a job.
Nothing personal.

179
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:41,011
Listen, I don't give a flying
fuck if you've got a score to settle.

180
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:43,279
This is a shit-ton of money
we're talking about here.

181
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,448
- That's right.
- Life-changing.

182
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:48,185
I'm in.

183
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,423
And what about you two?

184
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:57,461
You know, it's
"all for one and one for all."

185
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:00,396
Right?

186
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,065
I don't know. I feel like we're
not getting the full story.

187
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,302
And I want to know
what this Pardoner guy stole.

188
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:06,737
We all do.

189
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,739
But that ain't the job.

190
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:11,375
This is strictly
VIP protection.

191
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:12,743
Easy money.

192
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,444
But why the skeleton crew?

193
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:18,280
Wouldn't it make more sense
to have a presence?

194
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:20,549
I'm with Fox on this one.

195
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,151
You know,
going in with a full kit

196
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,453
could intimidate
the city council on site.

197
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:26,789
Might even look bad
for Chalmers, too.

198
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:29,292
Do we have to bring
the corporate stooge?

199
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:31,561
We go way back.

200
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:34,398
He's good in a fight.
Trust me.

201
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:41,169
All right.

202
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:43,739
If you want another shot
at the Pardoner,

203
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:45,642
I got your back, boss.

204
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,749
Look, you know I'd go anywhere to
bust some skulls with you guys.

205
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:56,520
But this thing ain't right.

206
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:59,123
Being rushed out there,
no prep...

207
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,260
Sasha, you can do this
if you want...

208
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:07,230
- I'm out.
- Harrison, you're right,

209
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,500
but this payday
is a game-changer.

210
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,436
Wouldn't you want
to spend the rest of the year

211
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:15,072
not getting shot at
for once?

212
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:16,706
I mean, think about it.

213
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,408
Come on.

214
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,044
Do it for me.

215
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,181
Fuck.

216
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,449
There we go.

217
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,084
See? That's what
brothers are for.

218
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:29,820
To keep their sisters
out of trouble.

219
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:32,423
Such a heartwarming moment.

220
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,824
All right. Crystal!

221
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:36,525
Another round of shots.

222
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:38,194
Hey, Crystal, make it two.

223
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,197
You buying?

224
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,132
We'll send the bill
to Chapter House.

225
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,599
I hear that.

226
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:45,701
- Hoo-ha!
- Hoo-ha!

227
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,913
What a shithole!

228
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:46,889
Not loving the spot, boss.

229
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:48,791
Lot of windows,

230
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:50,693
lots of places to hide.

231
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,497
Less time here,
the better.

232
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:56,666
Where's our rendezvous, Fox?

233
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,902
You said we were meeting
the building manager?

234
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:02,939
Mr. Chalmers?

235
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,243
Tell 'em.

236
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:09,913
There is no building manager.

237
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:12,982
There is no rendezvous.

238
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,819
- Fuckin' knew it.
- What the hell is this about, Fox?

239
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:21,357
The Pardoner.

240
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,861
- He's coming here.
- Hold on.

241
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,762
You knew the Pardoner
was coming

242
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:28,431
and you didn't bring
the fucking cavalry?

243
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:29,565
We are the cavalry.

244
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:32,301
A cavalry that's outmanned
and with limited firepower.

245
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,771
So, this was all a set-up?

246
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:37,874
We did what we had to.

247
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,842
Posing as civilians
was the only way

248
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,311
that we could get
a team in range.

249
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:44,547
This will work.

250
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:47,583
If the Pardoner saw us
come with the authorities

251
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,653
he may have pulled back.

252
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:52,021
It had to be
a small security team.

253
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,856
It had to be you, Miller.

254
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:00,062
Great. No service.

255
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,832
You guys are Chapter House,
can't you move a satellite or something?

256
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,834
Probably just the Pardoner
jamming the signals.

257
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,802
So we're bait.

258
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,672
No. You're not the bait.

259
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:10,406
I am.

260
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:54,584
Of all people...

261
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,422
I expected you
to understand.

262
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:04,461
When this is all over, you're gonna
see why it has to be this way.

263
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,742
You lied to me.

264
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,610
I had no choice.

265
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:22,978
I know you, Miller.

266
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:27,616
All you
ex-jarheads-turned-PMCs...

267
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,786
You're all the same.

268
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:33,722
You come back stateside
and still want to live the life,

269
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:36,526
but it's not about
God and country,

270
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:38,494
it's about how much money
you can make.

271
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,498
Well, you're getting paid.

272
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,731
So do your job.

273
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:46,069
You put my team in danger.

274
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:48,805
They have families, lives.

275
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:52,408
And you brought us here
unprepared.

276
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:54,877
After everything
we've been through.

277
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,082
Have any of you
checked your bank accounts?

278
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:02,986
Half the money up-front.
Just like you wanted.

279
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:06,588
We get out of this alive

280
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:08,858
and you get the other half.

281
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,960
It's not about the money.

282
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,928
Who wants to beat
the shit out of this guy?

283
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:14,631
Me. Anyone else?

284
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,665
- Gladly.
- I'll have a piece.

285
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,868
Come and get it.

286
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:20,504
Leave him alone.

287
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:26,842
It doesn't matter
how you got here.

288
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,846
If you want to survive,
we're gonna have to work together.

289
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:34,683
I just want to know why.

290
00:21:38,221 --> 00:21:40,623
That son of a bitch

291
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:43,460
is using my daughter
to get to me.

292
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,897
You got kids, Miller?

293
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,470
You'd do anything for 'em.

294
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:54,838
Right?

295
00:21:57,906 --> 00:22:00,109
Right now,
my baby's in trouble.

296
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:10,619
We got a fight
coming to us.

297
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,825
And Harrison's right.

298
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:18,494
We're outmanned, outgunned.

299
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,164
But the fight's still coming...

300
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,735
whether we like it or not.

301
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:30,740
Let's get you someplace safe.

302
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,250
This'll do.

303
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,153
Still know how to use this?

304
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,290
Don't worry about me, soldier.

305
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:25,327
Just go get my little girl,
all right?

306
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,631
No matter what happens,
don't open this door.

307
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:31,099
Miller, please.

308
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,937
We'll get your daughter.
I promise.

309
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,038
I know you will, Miller.

310
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,655
Anything happens
to my team,

311
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:55,592
I'm coming after you.

312
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,663
Wouldn't have it any other way.

313
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,570
Let's move.

314
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,358
Time to shake off
the rust, buddy.

315
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,275
Come in.

316
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:27,309
Come in.

317
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:32,347
We've lost connection
with our scouts.

318
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:34,750
Apparently, Chalmers and his
friends are more resourceful

319
00:26:34,784 --> 00:26:35,785
than we thought.

320
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:49,265
Time for a new strategy.

321
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,067
I hope you're ready.

322
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:56,172
We're moving.

323
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,150
Eyes on how many?

324
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:09,519
Hard to say.
I count ten.

325
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:12,121
Maybe more.
Too much cover out there.

326
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:17,794
Layered attacks.
They'll come in waves.

327
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:20,163
They'll save the big attack
for when we get desperate.

328
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,000
You know...
I hate to say, I told you so.

329
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:28,772
A check that big and that fast,
there's always strings attached.

330
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:32,408
I let my friendship with Fox
get the better of me.

331
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,211
You know what? Fuck 'em.

332
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:37,879
Money already hit our
bank accounts.

333
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:40,583
Let's just make a run for it.
Let Fox and his boss

334
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:41,817
- fend for themselves.
- No.

335
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,387
No.

336
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,557
But I'm not doing this
for Fox or Chalmers.

337
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,093
It's hard to look
a man in the eye

338
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,128
who asks for help to save
his family and tell him no.

339
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,067
Besides, we don't run
from fights.

340
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:02,172
Hooo-rah.

341
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:11,079
That must be Eva.

342
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:12,414
Come on.

343
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:23,426
It's Eva.

344
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:24,560
We've gotta get her now.

345
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:25,494
Hey, hey.
Look...

346
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,230
Give me some cover
fire and I'll grab her.

347
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:28,364
Slow down.

348
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:31,634
The Pardoner is smart.
That's exactly what he wants.

349
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,169
So, what, we're just gonna
let her stand there?

350
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,073
No.

351
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:24,019
Eva, are you okay?

352
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:30,025
Who are you?

353
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:31,326
Nicholas Fox.

354
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:34,264
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:40,135
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

356
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,105
I just wanted to test
it in the field.

357
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,276
What's she talking about?

358
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,346
Look, none of that
matters right now. Okay.

359
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,583
We've all come to
bring you home.

360
00:29:58,287 --> 00:29:59,989
My dad isn't here, is he?

361
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,595
Please tell me that
my dad isn't here.

362
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:22,711
It was the only
way to get you.

363
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:26,515
Me?

364
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,019
Or Project 725?

365
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:38,193
Enough!

366
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:02,317
Nice to see you again, Miller.

367
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:03,519
How's the back?

368
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:15,097
Seven pounds.

369
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:21,504
That's the amount of pressure
required to pull a trigger.

370
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:23,506
Just like that.

371
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,340
It's all over.

372
00:31:26,174 --> 00:31:28,344
Look, you leave her
out of this, okay?

373
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:30,245
If you want Chalmers, you
come and get him, bitch.

374
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:33,783
In due time.

375
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:39,555
My men fight for a cause,
for a purpose.

376
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,325
For a New World Order.

377
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:46,428
We know what's at stake.

378
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,665
Do you?

379
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:53,469
When your men learn the truth,
will they stay by your side?

380
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:58,106
Will you stay, Derek?

381
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:01,277
And what truth is that?

382
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:02,744
That you're a psychopath?

383
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:12,588
This facility is a security
nightmare.

384
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:15,424
Lots of ways in.

385
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:17,793
Hard to protect.

386
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:20,229
Just remember.

387
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:27,069
We have all the weaponry,
all the manpower.

388
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:30,305
And all the leverage.

389
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:32,575
Now, I'm giving you one hour
to bring me Chalmers

390
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:37,378
and the code to Project 725,
or it's going to get messy.

391
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:38,548
No, hey!

392
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:40,583
Not now.

393
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:54,330
I'll see you soon, Miller.

394
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:09,244
Did you find her? Is she okay?

395
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,880
She's alive. For now.

396
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,582
What's Project 725?

397
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:19,988
Tell me.

398
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:23,224
Look I told both of you, that
if I was gonna take this job,

399
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:24,425
I needed to know everything.

400
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,695
And all I keep hearing
is lie after lie.

401
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,631
Tell me what
the fuck's going on.

402
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:33,469
Project 725 is an artificial
intelligence system.

403
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,839
Not just an A.I. system.

404
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,941
It's a quantum A.I.

405
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:42,377
Wait, you cracked a two-state
quantum system?

406
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,547
How about we cut the geek-speak.

407
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:46,714
It's binary on steroids.

408
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:48,617
What? I subscribe to
TechCrunch.

409
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:50,620
It was my daughter's project.

410
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,357
<i>Fresh out of MIT.</i>

411
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,429
And she built something
way beyond me.

412
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,432
And then she stole it.

413
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,235
Eva...

414
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:09,237
Eva was confused.

415
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:12,341
Angry about a lot of things.

416
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,246
She's just got too
much of me in her.

417
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:20,215
So you tried to take the A.I.
from her, but instead

418
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:21,951
she brought it to the Pardoner.

419
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,687
The board.

420
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,657
They just saw the
project differently.

421
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:29,424
Very differently.

422
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,496
And here we are.

423
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:36,199
Yeah.

424
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:38,567
Here we are.

425
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,586
I know you're upset.

426
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,291
You came to me for help.

427
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:04,559
You wanted me to help
you change the world.

428
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:07,463
That's what I'm doing.

429
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,366
I reached out to you
because I wanted to test

430
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,902
Project 725 in the field.

431
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:17,038
To prove that it worked.

432
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:19,807
To prove that it would
help people.

433
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,876
And you promised me that.

434
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:24,980
And you lied.

435
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:34,257
That is exactly what I'm doing.

436
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:38,994
We are fighting
for the same cause.

437
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:44,532
Why do you not see that?

438
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,704
You wanna use your technology
to fix society.

439
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:52,040
To fix what is already sick.

440
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,478
We have the opportunity to make
real change, but in order

441
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,813
to find a cure for the sickness,
we have to know the cause.

442
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:03,318
Greed is the root of all pain.

443
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:08,590
Of all suffering,
of all evil.

444
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:13,061
Pharmaceutical companies enhance
their drugs to become

445
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:14,962
more addictive.

446
00:36:14,996 --> 00:36:17,900
Politicians are lining their
pockets while homeless people

447
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:19,335
flood the streets.

448
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:24,440
I am not the bad guy.

449
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:26,608
I am a saint

450
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:31,713
compared to the pain and misery
they cause every second,

451
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:35,050
of every minute of every day.

452
00:36:36,784 --> 00:36:39,654
You wanna find a cure for this
sickness, I am telling you

453
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,090
what it is.

454
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:43,759
With the code from Chalmers,
we can burn it.

455
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:48,630
Burn it all to the ground.

456
00:36:58,873 --> 00:37:01,042
Aren't you tired
of being a pawn?

457
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:08,918
Time's up. Send them in.

458
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:24,866
Courtesy of our recently
deceased friends.

459
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,901
Nice.

460
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,608
Even with the extra guns
and ammo,

461
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,810
it's gonna be a tough fight.

462
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:38,981
And the sun's
going down fast,

463
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:41,483
so they'll be knocking on our
door before we know it.

464
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:44,619
Derek.

465
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,855
It's okay, we got it.

466
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:49,724
This isn't your fault.

467
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:51,826
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

468
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,896
I talked you all into this.

469
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:56,697
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was
the gold-covered carrot

470
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:57,766
they dangled.

471
00:37:57,798 --> 00:37:59,402
Which you all agreed on.

472
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:04,906
Guys, we all decided
to come, remember?

473
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,143
Look, still got your back, boss.

474
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:16,652
Well, if we're gonna survive,
we gotta be nimble.

475
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:19,487
Use the location to our
advantage.

476
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:22,191
We'll never make it through the
night if we take them head-on.

477
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:26,562
Let's do this.

478
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:58,927
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

479
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:00,054
Let's go.

480
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:05,793
Come on, you sons of bitches.

481
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,862
Go.

482
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:10,960
Side and main entrances
are compromised.

483
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:16,932
Are you sure about this plan?

484
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:19,101
Are you doubting the cause?

485
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:21,971
No, it's just...

486
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:26,273
We're losing good men.

487
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:30,645
I feel their pain, but you know
what's at stake here.

488
00:41:33,148 --> 00:41:35,617
Their sacrifices won't
be forgotten.

489
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:38,686
Trust me.

490
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:42,190
Take a few men and go
around the side entrance.

491
00:41:42,222 --> 00:41:43,891
Signal when you're inside.

492
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:45,127
Copy that.

493
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,394
B team, let's roll out.

494
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:04,913
We're here, back entrance
of the sub-basement.

495
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:08,083
Let's go.

496
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:40,081
Time's up, Miller.

497
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:41,716
Where's Chalmers?

498
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,721
Hold your fire, or she dies.

499
00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:57,432
How much is Chalmers
paying you, Miller?

500
00:43:00,268 --> 00:43:02,036
How much is enough?

501
00:43:04,038 --> 00:43:06,775
You're out here putting
your life on the line.

502
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:10,945
Your team's lives
on the line.

503
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:14,849
And for what?

504
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,020
Money?

505
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:21,255
More money.

506
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:26,161
You are sheep.
You are slaves to a machine.

507
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,767
You're slaves to those
who run it all

508
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,936
for their mass profits,
while you cling to the pennies

509
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:36,771
that fall from their pockets.

510
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:46,782
I'm gonna make you
an offer, Miller.

511
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:51,419
Just put your weapons down
and fight with me.

512
00:43:54,956 --> 00:43:58,059
You can have a seat at the table
and fight for something

513
00:43:58,092 --> 00:43:59,360
that actually matters.

514
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,411
Fox!

515
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:18,112
Tear this place apart.

516
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,945
Fox.

517
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:57,979
Sasha, get down.

518
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,083
Listen to me. He wouldn't
want you dead either.

519
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:03,518
Let's go.
Come on.

520
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:11,460
Eva?

521
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,191
He's still alive!
Cover me!

522
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:44,252
Over there!

523
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:46,087
Eva, get down.

524
00:47:54,594 --> 00:47:55,997
Hang in there, big guy.

525
00:47:56,496 --> 00:47:57,765
Come on.

526
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,434
Over there.

527
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,711
What the hell
were you thinking?

528
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:12,013
I wasn't.

529
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,150
Hey.

530
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:17,351
Tell Maggie I'm sorry.

531
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:20,688
I just tried to get it in
one more time.

532
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,556
But I guess she was right.

533
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,427
I should have stayed my
ass behind the bench.

534
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,196
Hold it. Put pressure on it.
Come on.

535
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:38,039
Don't let that terrorist son of
a bitch find Chalmers.

536
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,110
You can't let him
start Project 725.

537
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:46,713
Promise me.

538
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:48,115
Miller.

539
00:48:48,148 --> 00:48:49,116
Miller.

540
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,385
Boss, we gotta go,
it's getting hot out there.

541
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:53,054
Let's go.
Come on.

542
00:48:56,257 --> 00:48:59,159
Fuck him. Let the bastard die.

543
00:48:59,193 --> 00:49:01,296
He got Harrison killed.

544
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,398
If he hadn't lied to us
and manipulated you,

545
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:07,201
my brother
would still be alive.

546
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,204
That asshole got exactly
what he deserved.

547
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:11,840
Sasha.

548
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:15,509
Don't.

549
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,583
That's my brother's
dead body out there.

550
00:49:22,315 --> 00:49:23,484
Mine.

551
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:29,557
You told me to trust you.

552
00:49:31,324 --> 00:49:32,259
Harrison knew.

553
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:34,896
He knew this job was wrong
from the start.

554
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:36,664
And I talked him into it.

555
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:40,802
We all have his blood
on our hands now.

556
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:44,873
Especially you.

557
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:48,742
Hey... Hey,
where do you think you're going?

558
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:51,211
I'm not leaving him out there
for those animals.

559
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:52,346
That's suicide.

560
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,416
Listen, I would give you time,
but we don't have any.

561
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,786
Please.

562
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:06,628
Fine.

563
00:50:07,427 --> 00:50:08,630
What's our next move?

564
00:50:12,365 --> 00:50:13,668
Stay here.

565
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:14,836
I'm gonna go find Eva.

566
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:50,404
I can't believe this.

567
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:55,677
We'll be okay.

568
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:57,846
No.

569
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:03,918
Dad, what don't you get
right now?

570
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:06,188
I mean, this is my fault.

571
00:51:09,523 --> 00:51:10,825
It's my fault.

572
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:14,862
You should've come to me
first, Eva.

573
00:51:16,797 --> 00:51:19,300
I wanted to but I didn't
know what you would say.

574
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:23,637
You've never trusted me.

575
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:31,512
Sometimes I feel like
you loved your company

576
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:33,315
more than you loved
anything else.

577
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:37,351
If you ever thought that,

578
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:39,753
I'm sorry.

579
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,397
Well,

580
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:52,733
if we make it out of here,

581
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:55,402
I want you to tell me

582
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:56,871
why you still have
that ring on.

583
00:51:58,438 --> 00:51:59,540
To remember.

584
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:06,780
Mom left you
a really long time ago, Dad.

585
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:10,885
Mistakes...

586
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:13,421
Really, lots of...

587
00:52:14,722 --> 00:52:16,557
Many mistakes.

588
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:20,595
I can't let myself forget.

589
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:27,034
I guess we both have a hard
time letting things go.

590
00:52:29,103 --> 00:52:32,440
Well, like father,
like daughter.

591
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:37,378
What was that?

592
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:46,920
- Get in.
- Are you serious?

593
00:52:46,954 --> 00:52:49,457
Get in, yes.
Just trust me.

594
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:51,558
- Are you not coming?
- No, they need me.

595
00:52:51,592 --> 00:52:52,727
Go, now.

596
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:54,429
Be careful.

597
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:02,971
Drop it, Chalmers.

598
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:10,612
If you kill me...

599
00:53:11,746 --> 00:53:15,784
Project 725 is dead.

600
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:21,056
You're right.

601
00:53:31,664 --> 00:53:34,000
I can't kill you.

602
00:53:34,034 --> 00:53:36,070
That is gonna pale
in comparison

603
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:37,405
to what I do to you

604
00:53:37,438 --> 00:53:39,340
if you don't give me
the code.

605
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:47,615
Pick him up.

606
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:26,486
Halt!

607
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,684
Still not talking?

608
00:54:58,686 --> 00:54:59,687
It's all right.

609
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:03,490
Not quite finished
setting up yet, anyways.

610
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,163
Look Donovan...

611
00:55:10,197 --> 00:55:11,699
Do you mind
if I call you Donovan?

612
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:17,237
You and I both know there's
nothing I can do to you

613
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:19,073
to make you
give me that code.

614
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:21,943
The more time you wait,

615
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,179
the more time I have
to find Eva.

616
00:55:26,847 --> 00:55:28,450
And when I do,

617
00:55:29,884 --> 00:55:32,119
I'm going to torture her.

618
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:36,124
And I'm going to make you
watch the entire thing.

619
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:42,497
You'll beg me
to use Project 725

620
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,131
by the time
I'm done with her.

621
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:45,700
I can promise you that.

622
00:55:50,603 --> 00:55:52,506
You wanna torture somebody?

623
00:55:52,972 --> 00:55:54,541
Torture me.

624
00:55:55,543 --> 00:55:56,911
You leave her out of this.

625
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:28,842
Fuck this.

626
00:56:58,838 --> 00:56:59,907
Over here.

627
00:57:24,898 --> 00:57:27,035
Come on.
We're needed at base camp.

628
00:58:08,007 --> 00:58:09,109
Oh...

629
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:13,748
Eyes on Dr. Chalmers.
North hallway.

630
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:19,786
<i>We're closing in on her now.</i>

631
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,256
Oh, it looks like
our guests are arriving early.

632
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,961
Don't underestimate
my daughter.

633
00:58:27,994 --> 00:58:29,829
She's full of surprises.

634
00:58:47,414 --> 00:58:49,050
Shh!

635
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,684
I'm not one of them.

636
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:54,822
Derek Miller.

637
00:58:54,855 --> 00:58:57,992
- You're Fox's friend?
- That's right.

638
00:58:58,025 --> 00:59:00,360
- I'm sorry.
- No time for apologies.

639
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:02,128
We gotta move.
All right?

640
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:03,163
- Okay.
- Come on.

641
00:59:12,438 --> 00:59:14,375
<i>Sir, we lost her.
She just vanished.</i>

642
00:59:16,043 --> 00:59:19,713
Please explain to me
how you lost her.

643
00:59:19,746 --> 00:59:23,116
I keep saying, good help
ain't easy to find.

644
00:59:25,018 --> 00:59:27,021
Are you hacked
into the cameras yet?

645
00:59:27,054 --> 00:59:28,021
Almost.

646
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:30,023
Bringing up the live feed.

647
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,365
Wait a second.
She's... She's gone.

648
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:42,202
Explain to me
how that is possible.

649
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:44,438
I don't know.

650
00:59:44,471 --> 00:59:46,474
It's like she just vanished
into thin air.

651
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:47,740
She vanished...

652
00:59:47,775 --> 00:59:50,077
Find her!

653
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:53,447
And get me a new walkie.

654
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,886
No, no, whoa!
Hey, it's me.

655
01:00:03,389 --> 01:00:04,725
Eva.

656
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,894
Tell 'em what you told me.

657
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:13,967
The Pardoner
has my father.

658
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:21,409
My dad
is one of the strongest,

659
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:25,012
most hard-willed men
that I've ever met.

660
01:00:27,914 --> 01:00:31,284
But these last few days,
I've seen how dangerous the Pardoner is

661
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:34,255
and I've seen just how badly
he wants the access codes

662
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:35,956
to Project 725.

663
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,893
Please...

664
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,296
I don't know how much longer
my dad can hold off.

665
01:00:43,831 --> 01:00:46,500
We can't let the Pardoner
control Project 725.

666
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,201
- We just can't.
- Why?

667
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:51,038
What's so fuckin' special
about this computer anyways?

668
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:54,541
When we created it,

669
01:00:54,574 --> 01:00:57,811
I wanted to use it to
revolutionize the way that we live.

670
01:00:57,844 --> 01:01:00,013
To help our government
run more efficiently,

671
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:04,084
our economy,
every aspect of society.

672
01:01:04,117 --> 01:01:06,287
And it is more than capable
of doing those things.

673
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,989
I know that it can.

674
01:01:09,155 --> 01:01:10,924
I tried to convince the board

675
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,960
to give me the funds
for a trial run.

676
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:15,862
My dad even backed me up.
They voted him down.

677
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:18,032
All they kept thinking about
was the money they could make

678
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:20,367
to flip it to the military.

679
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,135
They wanted to turn it
into a weapon.

680
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:24,271
Exactly.

681
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:25,506
I couldn't let them do that,

682
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:26,574
not after how hard
I'd worked

683
01:01:26,606 --> 01:01:28,074
to bring about
something good.

684
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:30,411
I just kept thinking

685
01:01:30,443 --> 01:01:32,179
if I could show them
the data,

686
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:35,115
if they could see it,
then they would understand.

687
01:01:37,617 --> 01:01:39,219
Did you ever test it
in the field?

688
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,954
Once.

689
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:43,257
Flight 314.

690
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:47,428
The Pardoner
triggered the crash remotely

691
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,029
and got a taste
of its power.

692
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:52,398
Luckily, I was able to
stop him from going further

693
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:55,134
by initiating the fail-safe.

694
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:57,238
And what else does the
Pardoner want to do with it?

695
01:01:59,172 --> 01:02:02,041
I wanted to save the world
with Project 725.

696
01:02:02,074 --> 01:02:04,311
He wants to use it
to burn it to the ground.

697
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:07,181
What do you mean?

698
01:02:07,213 --> 01:02:10,918
She means that he plans
on using the program

699
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:13,052
to wipe out everything.

700
01:02:13,085 --> 01:02:16,590
Financial records, bank
statements, communications...

701
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:19,960
Jesus.

702
01:02:19,992 --> 01:02:22,128
It would send us back
to the Stone Ages.

703
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:23,163
Exactly.

704
01:02:23,898 --> 01:02:25,332
You see,
the Pardoner believes

705
01:02:25,364 --> 01:02:27,367
that if he resets
everything to zero,

706
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,469
that that's the only way
that it will save society.

707
01:02:29,503 --> 01:02:32,472
Wipe everything out,
start with a clean slate.

708
01:02:32,505 --> 01:02:33,907
Unbelievable.

709
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:38,678
And the Pardoner
can do all this?

710
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,614
If your dad gives him
the fail-safe?

711
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:47,021
I've made a terrible mistake
and I realize that now.

712
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,023
This is a power
humanity is not ready for.

713
01:02:50,056 --> 01:02:51,424
We're the only ones
that can stop him.

714
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:55,096
So I am begging you,
please help me.

715
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:07,608
It's been a long time
since we fought

716
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:09,309
for something
other than a payday.

717
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:14,181
But maybe that's why
we're here now.

718
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:16,384
Maybe that's why
all this shit happened.

719
01:03:17,284 --> 01:03:18,385
This.

720
01:03:20,152 --> 01:03:21,922
This is something
worth fighting for.

721
01:03:28,661 --> 01:03:30,364
My brother died today.

722
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:34,233
This...

723
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:36,636
This is the fight
that Harrison would want.

724
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:42,375
He'd wanna stop
the Pardoner.

725
01:03:45,644 --> 01:03:47,146
And that's what
I'm gonna do.

726
01:03:47,179 --> 01:03:49,750
I'm all in, boss.
I'll do whatever it takes

727
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,451
to make that happen.

728
01:03:54,653 --> 01:03:55,989
Dash?

729
01:04:09,402 --> 01:04:11,071
How do you want
to play it, boss?

730
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:15,175
I know that you guys
are the experts,

731
01:04:16,043 --> 01:04:17,211
but I have an idea.

732
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:27,153
When did you see
the schematics?

733
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:29,155
The Pardoner had blueprints.

734
01:04:29,188 --> 01:04:30,490
He's been casing
this place for days

735
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:32,159
waiting for my dad.

736
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:34,494
So, you're drawing this
all based on memory?

737
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:35,528
It's a little crude

738
01:04:35,563 --> 01:04:38,032
but it should give us
a good idea of the space.

739
01:04:38,065 --> 01:04:39,700
The control room.

740
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:43,237
This is where the main power
to the building runs from.

741
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:45,271
Hard to run a computer
if we cut the power.

742
01:04:46,572 --> 01:04:47,708
You think it will work?

743
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:49,777
It has to.

744
01:05:25,144 --> 01:05:26,579
Clear!

745
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:28,348
Fan out! Eyes open!

746
01:05:32,853 --> 01:05:34,188
Miller, hold there!

747
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:52,405
The control room's that way.

748
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:55,375
Okay, let's go. Move.

749
01:05:58,677 --> 01:05:59,746
I see another one.

750
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:03,683
Shit!

751
01:06:21,835 --> 01:06:23,537
<i>Derek Miller.</i>

752
01:06:25,572 --> 01:06:27,675
<i>Your resolve is impressive.</i>

753
01:06:28,909 --> 01:06:31,412
<i>You truly do not know
when to quit.</i>

754
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:36,550
It's admirable.

755
01:06:38,717 --> 01:06:39,786
Stupid...

756
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:42,623
But admirable.

757
01:06:44,257 --> 01:06:45,458
<i>But did you really think</i>

758
01:06:45,492 --> 01:06:47,795
<i>we wouldn't notice the
security cameras going out?</i>

759
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:53,801
Look, I'm assuming
Dr. Chalmers is with you.

760
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:56,136
<i>That's good.</i>

761
01:06:57,536 --> 01:06:59,239
<i>My guards
are moving into position</i>

762
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:00,873
<i>so I'm gonna make you
a limited-time offer.</i>

763
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:03,410
Hand her over to me
and you live.

764
01:07:03,443 --> 01:07:04,478
You get to walk out.

765
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,213
You and your team, go on,
do whatever you wanna do.

766
01:07:10,483 --> 01:07:11,585
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

767
01:07:12,552 --> 01:07:14,320
We gotta get off
his radar.

768
01:07:14,353 --> 01:07:15,588
Any suggestions?

769
01:07:17,724 --> 01:07:18,926
Yeah.

770
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,266
This way's clear.
They must've gone down there.

771
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,309
All clear.

772
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:39,212
Not too bad, Miller.

773
01:07:46,286 --> 01:07:47,288
Got it?

774
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:58,465
Dash, Eva, you're up.

775
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:03,537
This is one complex
and out-of-date grid.

776
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,672
Yeah, it is.

777
01:08:06,572 --> 01:08:08,841
<i>All units,
converge on the generator room.</i>

778
01:08:16,983 --> 01:08:18,552
Any time now.

779
01:08:18,585 --> 01:08:20,421
Try not to get
electrocuted, boss.

780
01:08:25,692 --> 01:08:28,395
<i>My
patience is wearing thin, Miller.</i>

781
01:08:29,762 --> 01:08:31,765
Just pull it.

782
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:34,300
<i>My offer to
let you live is officially revoked.</i>

783
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:35,568
- Come on, Dash.
- Just pull it.

784
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:37,903
Come on, they're coming.
Let's go!

785
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:39,239
Fuck it.

786
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,454
Well... Fuck.

787
01:08:57,657 --> 01:08:58,659
All right.

788
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:01,695
What happened?

789
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:06,867
We lost all power.

790
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:39,767
<i>Come out, you're surrounded!</i>

791
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:17,871
Is something funny?

792
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:20,941
Can't figure it out?

793
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,945
Yeah.

794
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:29,983
It's gonna be, you know, pretty hard
to launch your little toy there.

795
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:33,420
Bring me the back-up
generator from camp.

796
01:10:33,453 --> 01:10:34,588
Yes, sir.

797
01:10:35,622 --> 01:10:36,623
On second thought...

798
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:39,093
I'm coming with you.

799
01:10:41,795 --> 01:10:43,396
No more mistakes.

800
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:00,012
Okay, this is it.

801
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:02,582
We make our move while they're
distracted by the power.

802
01:11:02,614 --> 01:11:04,751
- We nab Chalmers and get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

803
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:06,619
But what about Project 725?

804
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:07,954
We leave it
with the bad guys?

805
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:09,756
They'll still be
coming after Chalmers.

806
01:11:09,788 --> 01:11:11,524
I think I know
what to do about that.

807
01:11:11,557 --> 01:11:13,493
Let's take it.
Sell it on the black market.

808
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:14,595
You can't do that.

809
01:11:15,494 --> 01:11:16,595
Dash!

810
01:11:16,628 --> 01:11:18,431
What the hell
are you doing?

811
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:22,702
Dash...

812
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:24,670
Money's not gonna bring
Harrison back.

813
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:26,907
No, but it won't hurt, either.

814
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:28,442
Call it hazard pay.

815
01:11:29,007 --> 01:11:30,042
Dash, come on.

816
01:11:30,076 --> 01:11:31,612
I can't let you
do this, man.

817
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:34,847
I'm sorry, Miller.

818
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,050
I gotta do this by myself.

819
01:11:37,082 --> 01:11:38,085
Don't do this.

820
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:40,153
Dash, no!

821
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:43,122
- Dash?
- Dash!

822
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,792
Come on.

823
01:11:47,193 --> 01:11:48,228
Dash!

824
01:11:48,261 --> 01:11:49,463
Dash!

825
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:51,565
Dash!

826
01:11:52,832 --> 01:11:54,734
Oh, shit! Take cover!

827
01:12:37,844 --> 01:12:38,878
I don't know why you think

828
01:12:38,912 --> 01:12:40,180
this is gonna end
any differently

829
01:12:40,212 --> 01:12:41,814
than the last time
we met, Miller.

830
01:12:43,115 --> 01:12:45,085
It's time for Eva
to go see Daddy

831
01:12:45,118 --> 01:12:46,553
so he can give me the code.

832
01:12:50,256 --> 01:12:51,859
Hold your fire.

833
01:12:56,662 --> 01:12:57,830
I got what you want.

834
01:13:00,966 --> 01:13:02,869
The money for the girl.

835
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:05,105
We got a deal?

836
01:13:06,072 --> 01:13:07,707
Smart move, soldier.

837
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:08,742
Hand her over.

838
01:13:14,012 --> 01:13:15,782
- We have a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.

839
01:13:16,983 --> 01:13:17,985
Kill him. Go.

840
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:36,936
Cover me!

841
01:14:06,798 --> 01:14:09,301
No! Dash.

842
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:10,938
- I'm not ready to die. Sash...
- Goddammit!

843
01:14:31,356 --> 01:14:32,658
Oh, Jesus Christ!

844
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:34,761
You're hit.

845
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:36,596
Come on, we got to move! Now!

846
01:14:52,744 --> 01:14:54,014
Some rescue, huh?

847
01:14:55,881 --> 01:14:57,083
I told you to run.

848
01:14:59,318 --> 01:15:01,121
You should know by now
I don't listen to you.

849
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:14,701
I told you
I'd find her, Chalmers.

850
01:15:18,337 --> 01:15:20,273
Do you know why they
call me the Pardoner?

851
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:25,112
Anyone?

852
01:15:26,078 --> 01:15:28,847
<i>The Canterbury Tales.</i>

853
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:31,718
Two Ivy League diplomas and no
one knows <i>The Pardoner's Tale.</i>

854
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,255
Once upon a time,

855
01:15:35,854 --> 01:15:36,755
three men,

856
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:39,391
distraught over the death
of their friend,

857
01:15:39,425 --> 01:15:41,360
form a pact
of brotherhood.

858
01:15:41,394 --> 01:15:43,430
To seek out
and kill death.

859
01:15:44,463 --> 01:15:45,832
A wise man tells them

860
01:15:45,864 --> 01:15:47,701
death can be found
under the oak tree

861
01:15:47,734 --> 01:15:48,835
in the grove.

862
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:50,971
When they arrive,

863
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:52,873
all they find...

864
01:15:53,405 --> 01:15:54,740
is a pile of gold.

865
01:15:57,443 --> 01:15:58,744
Two of the men

866
01:15:59,912 --> 01:16:01,748
greedily kill the third

867
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,850
so they could split the
treasure between themselves.

868
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:07,186
Unfortunately,

869
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,789
after they kill
their friend,

870
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:12,325
they drink the wine
he'd poisoned

871
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,161
and they both die.

872
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:18,297
Some pact of brotherhood.

873
01:16:21,266 --> 01:16:23,269
I'm just the wise man

874
01:16:23,301 --> 01:16:24,904
pointing to the oak tree.

875
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:29,076
You're pretty sick,
aren't you?

876
01:16:30,309 --> 01:16:31,911
Sick fucking terrorist,

877
01:16:31,944 --> 01:16:32,946
that's what you are.

878
01:16:33,345 --> 01:16:34,346
You like that?

879
01:16:36,882 --> 01:16:39,418
All of my acts
of so-called "terror"

880
01:16:39,452 --> 01:16:41,722
have been to level
the playing field.

881
01:16:46,492 --> 01:16:48,427
When the generator
is running

882
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:50,296
and Project 725
is back online,

883
01:16:50,328 --> 01:16:51,997
you're going to
give me the code.

884
01:16:57,502 --> 01:16:58,871
What the...

885
01:17:05,377 --> 01:17:06,378
What happened?

886
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,458
Fuck.
Just wrap me up.

887
01:17:19,492 --> 01:17:21,327
Find me a gun
and let's fucking go.

888
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:22,961
I love your enthusiasm,

889
01:17:22,994 --> 01:17:24,096
but you're not
going anywhere.

890
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:26,166
The fuck I'm not.

891
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:28,534
Hey! They know
our location.

892
01:17:28,568 --> 01:17:30,470
It's only a matter of time
before they find us here.

893
01:17:31,604 --> 01:17:33,373
And I'm not losing
anyone else tonight.

894
01:17:40,912 --> 01:17:42,214
I'll draw their attention.

895
01:17:42,247 --> 01:17:44,583
Keep them as far away
from here as I can.

896
01:17:44,617 --> 01:17:47,353
When you think it's clear,
get the hell out.

897
01:17:47,386 --> 01:17:49,356
I'll meet you back at the edge
of the road when it's all over.

898
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:51,458
No way.

899
01:18:02,935 --> 01:18:04,137
This is all my fault.

900
01:18:06,204 --> 01:18:07,239
But I'm gonna fix it.

901
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,213
This time I'm putting a
bullet in the Pardoner.

902
01:18:17,582 --> 01:18:19,485
Put a second one in there
for me, too.

903
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:25,491
And for Harrison.

904
01:18:26,425 --> 01:18:27,427
Hooah.

905
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:29,863
Hooah.

906
01:18:29,895 --> 01:18:31,197
What about Eva
and Chalmers?

907
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:34,868
I told you I got this.

908
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:00,687
Um...

909
01:20:03,355 --> 01:20:05,958
I know it may not mean
much now, but, uh...

910
01:20:07,326 --> 01:20:09,229
for what it's worth,
I just want to say...

911
01:20:11,463 --> 01:20:12,465
I'm sorry.

912
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:15,534
For everything.

913
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,261
Sir.
Generator is back online.

914
01:20:51,503 --> 01:20:53,707
Here we are, Project 725.

915
01:20:55,408 --> 01:20:57,043
<i>Awaiting activation code.</i>

916
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:01,280
You sure about this?

917
01:21:02,247 --> 01:21:03,582
'Cause once we do this,

918
01:21:03,615 --> 01:21:04,717
there's no going back.

919
01:21:06,519 --> 01:21:08,188
That's the point.

920
01:21:10,523 --> 01:21:13,226
A lot of innocent people
are going to die.

921
01:21:14,393 --> 01:21:16,296
Two years...

922
01:21:17,328 --> 01:21:19,298
we've spent working on this.

923
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:21,601
The time,

924
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,136
all of the resources,

925
01:21:25,703 --> 01:21:27,340
all of the lives lost

926
01:21:27,372 --> 01:21:28,774
would be for nothing.

927
01:21:37,649 --> 01:21:40,019
If you don't want to be
a part of it, then say it.

928
01:21:42,755 --> 01:21:43,757
Say it!

929
01:21:45,858 --> 01:21:47,060
Say it!

930
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:51,463
I do.

931
01:22:06,511 --> 01:22:08,480
I'm gonna give you
one last chance, Chalmers.

932
01:22:09,347 --> 01:22:11,384
Give me the code.

933
01:22:14,353 --> 01:22:15,387
Don't do it, Dad.

934
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:17,123
Yeah, Dad. Don't do it.

935
01:22:20,626 --> 01:22:22,095
You're not gonna shoot her.

936
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
Not if you want the code.

937
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,104
You have no idea
what I will do.

938
01:22:31,136 --> 01:22:34,106
You're only delaying
the inevitable.

939
01:22:41,646 --> 01:22:42,715
Tell me!

940
01:22:44,216 --> 01:22:45,852
Tell me, you motherfucker!

941
01:22:45,885 --> 01:22:47,087
Now!

942
01:22:47,853 --> 01:22:50,489
- Don't.
- Tell me the code.

943
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:53,893
No, Dad.
Dad, don't tell him.

944
01:22:53,926 --> 01:22:56,396
Don't tell him.
Don't tell him.

945
01:22:58,163 --> 01:22:59,164
Fine.

946
01:22:59,832 --> 01:23:01,367
- I'm sorry.
- No.

947
01:23:02,768 --> 01:23:04,537
- Don't tell him, don't.
- I'll do it.

948
01:23:04,569 --> 01:23:06,139
I'll give you
the goddamn code.

949
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:18,585
Good.

950
01:23:44,676 --> 01:23:46,345
It worked. We're in.

951
01:23:53,618 --> 01:23:54,853
With the push
of a button...

952
01:23:56,622 --> 01:23:57,757
everything changes.

953
01:23:59,324 --> 01:24:02,162
So, what do we
destroy first?

954
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:05,230
Good question.

955
01:24:08,867 --> 01:24:10,670
Why don't we let
the creator pick?

956
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:15,375
You wanted
to change the world.

957
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:17,743
Now's your chance.

958
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:20,380
Pick.

959
01:24:25,317 --> 01:24:26,485
Fuck you.

960
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:28,688
Fuck you!

961
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,289
Fuck you!

962
01:24:57,448 --> 01:24:58,483
Come in.

963
01:25:00,953 --> 01:25:01,955
Come in.

964
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:08,961
<i>Come in.</i>

965
01:25:11,663 --> 01:25:13,666
<i>How
many men you got left, Pardoner?</i>

966
01:25:14,466 --> 01:25:16,002
Two? One?

967
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:18,770
<i>The answer is none.</i>

968
01:25:20,905 --> 01:25:22,574
You're dead, Miller.

969
01:25:22,608 --> 01:25:24,409
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

970
01:25:25,344 --> 01:25:26,346
Let's play.

971
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:53,972
Fuck this.

972
01:26:06,618 --> 01:26:08,421
I'm here, Miller.

973
01:26:08,453 --> 01:26:09,956
Let's finish this.
Man-to-man.

974
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:16,496
Come here.

975
01:26:28,673 --> 01:26:29,809
Where do you think
you're going?

976
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,782
You got any more
fancy words to say?

977
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:39,652
I'm done talking.

978
01:26:58,837 --> 01:26:59,839
Come on.

979
01:27:21,592 --> 01:27:24,095
- Eva, you're not able...
- Maybe we can salvage it.

980
01:27:24,128 --> 01:27:26,365
No, no. You want
to change the world?

981
01:27:26,798 --> 01:27:27,966
This is how.

982
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,702
Oh, I can't lose
this research.

983
01:27:30,269 --> 01:27:31,436
We have to destroy it.

984
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:34,840
The board will fire
you from your own company.

985
01:27:34,872 --> 01:27:35,875
So what?

986
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:38,411
We'll start our own company.

987
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:41,913
Eva... please.

988
01:27:44,082 --> 01:27:45,918
It takes both
our fail-safes.

989
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:49,088
- You're right.
- Okay.

990
01:27:56,627 --> 01:27:57,630
All right.

991
01:28:07,672 --> 01:28:09,141
Eva, let's do this.

992
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:17,550
- Ready?
- Ready?

993
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:26,458
Come on.

994
01:29:18,844 --> 01:29:20,246
I got your back, soldier.

995
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:12,698
Hey.

996
01:30:14,832 --> 01:30:15,867
You okay?

997
01:30:18,203 --> 01:30:19,772
Do I look okay?

998
01:30:19,805 --> 01:30:22,775
Harrison...
would be proud.

999
01:30:22,807 --> 01:30:23,975
Fuck you.

1000
01:30:24,009 --> 01:30:25,911
I've got a helluva
worker's comp claim.

1001
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:27,680
So, what now?

1002
01:30:29,213 --> 01:30:31,583
Retirement sounds pretty
fucking good right about now.

1003
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:34,720
Yeah.

1004
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:36,922
I don't know
about you guys,

1005
01:30:37,956 --> 01:30:39,925
but I can use
one last drink.

1006
01:30:39,957 --> 01:30:42,226
Well, it better be
on Chapter House.

1007
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,695
I think
I can arrange that.

1008
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:45,763
Yeah, I'm good.

1009
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:10,789
Well, who's driving?

1010
01:31:12,024 --> 01:31:13,057
Not me.

1011
01:31:13,091 --> 01:31:14,627
Do you see
this fucking arm?

1012
01:31:18,245 --> 01:31:23,245

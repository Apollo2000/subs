2
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:37,610
Guardian, this is Omaha 4-4
on heading 158 to Laredo.

3
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,310
Copy, Omaha 4-4.

4
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,402
I'm picking up movement
on the FLIR.

5
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,447
Coming in for a closer look.
Stand by.

6
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,400
This is the
United States Border Patrol.

7
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:31,447
Get on your knees
and put your hands up.

8
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,841
- Hey! Get down!
- I speak English.

9
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,494
I speak English. Get down!

10
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,168
Stay down!

11
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,192
Get down!

12
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,205
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

13
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,731
Get on your knees and
put your hands on your head.

14
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:21,366
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

15
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,108
Get on your knees.
Put your hands up.

16
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:31,159
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

17
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:41,212
Let me see your hands!

18
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:44,085
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

19
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,434
Show...!

20
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:48,959
Be advised.

21
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,502
There's been an explosion.

22
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:51,744
Officers are down.

23
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,978
Hey! Over here!

24
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:17,553
What do you got?

25
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,772
Prayer rugs.

26
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:59,856
Hey, honey. Yeah.

27
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:31,409
Stay here with me.
Just stay here.

28
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,716
It's okay.

29
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,720
Just come with me slowly
and quietly.

30
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,288
Stay here with me. Stay...
Oh, God.

31
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:41,550
You don't have to
do this.

32
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,032
You don't have
to do this, please.

33
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,603
The scene in
Kansas City tonight

34
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,518
is one of horror,
confusion and grief.

35
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,781
15 people,
among them two children,

36
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,045
are so far confirmed dead
with many more injured...

37
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,718
The victims' families remain...

38
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,352
Haunting images
of the attackers

39
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,920
are coming to light
from surveillance...

40
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,530
Secretary of Defense
James Riley

41
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:08,229
is expected to make a
statement on the attacks.

42
00:06:08,403 --> 00:06:11,797
Our intense focus on recovery
and assisting the injured

43
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,886
and the families of
those who have been killed

44
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,106
is matched only by
our determination

45
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,847
to prevent more attacks.

46
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,158
A message to our attackers.

47
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,554
Your bombs do not terrify us.

48
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,556
They empower us.

49
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,170
They empower us
to send you something

50
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,431
that is truly terrifying:

51
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,869
the full weight of
the United States military.

52
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:17,749
Down, down,
down on the ground!

53
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,971
No! Here for what?!

54
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:23,581
I'm not the f-fighter!

55
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:24,887
Fighter!

56
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,339
How you doing?

57
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,502
You think I'm gonna
waterboard you, Bashiir?

58
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:43,226
Waterboarding is
when we can't torture.

59
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,663
This is Africa.

60
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,231
I can do whatever the fuck
I want here.

61
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,891
You're gonna answer
every question I ask you

62
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,110
without me harming
a hair on your head.

63
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,461
Do you want to know why?

64
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,468
Because if you don't...

65
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:13,865
...I'm gonna call in
an air strike on your house.

66
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,088
Nice pool, by the way.

67
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,090
Whoever said
crime doesn't pay

68
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,223
wasn't stealing oil tankers,
were they?

69
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:45,245
Those men are Yemeni.

70
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,856
We have nothing to do
with that.

71
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,555
Your fight is with ISIS,
not me.

72
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,732
All my fights are on water.

73
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,909
They sure are, Bashiir.

74
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,955
And Yemen?

75
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,526
Just across the gulf.

76
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,267
What a coincidence.

77
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:16,624
It's kind of tricky
for Yemeni nationalists

78
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:20,584
to book an international flight
these days, huh?

79
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:22,934
So, if their passports
were fake,

80
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,067
they'd fly straight
to Kansas City

81
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,635
instead of going to Mexico and
hiring coyotes to truck them

82
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:30,594
a hundred miles
to the desert, right?

83
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:36,383
So, the big question is:
how'd they get to Mexico?

84
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,428
'Cause they sure as hell
didn't fly.

85
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:45,479
No, they... traveled by ship.

86
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,568
A ship you didn't
try and steal.

87
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:52,094
So that means
someone paid you not to.

88
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:56,316
So, here's my only question,
Bashiir.

89
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,057
Who paid you
to let the ship through?

90
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,306
Is that your brother?

91
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,048
'Cause I don't want
to kill the pool guy.

92
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:38,793
Every ship smuggles people.Mm-hmm.

93
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,405
And they don't need
my permission.

94
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,017
Yes, they fucking do.

95
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:49,891
Last chance.

96
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:52,154
This is a bluff.No.

97
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,896
You American.

98
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,986
You have too many rules.

99
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,989
No rules today, sport,
just orders.

100
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,557
Go ahead, sir. You're green.

101
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,254
Roger that.

102
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:07,125
No, no, no, no, no.

103
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,563
No, I want you to watch it.
I want you to watch it.

104
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,303
Watch.

105
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,679
You have a big family,
Bashiir.

106
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,507
Lots of brothers.

107
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,987
You should've chosen
another line of work.

108
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,730
I could do this all day.

109
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:48,863
But sooner or later,

110
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,605
I'll get the brother
you can't live without.

111
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,567
I promise.

112
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,327
It's one more thing

113
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,702
pointing to the cartels.

114
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,767
Now, the money came from
Quassim Al-Raymi's camp,

115
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,227
which isn't a surprise.

116
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,881
The ship, on the other hand,

117
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,274
is a Panamanian freighter,
La Victorina,

118
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,364
registered to the Mexican
holding company Grupo Duro.

119
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,543
It docked at Port of Veracruz
on the 18th.

120
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,458
Carlos Reyes' company.

121
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:20,590
The one and only.

122
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:21,983
If you need Matt home,

123
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,202
I can get him out
at 0600 tomorrow.

124
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,596
I'll have a plane
to Washington

125
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,468
ready for you in an hour.

126
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:31,383
See you tomorrow, Matt.

127
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:34,909
Smuggling terrorists seems
pretty short-sighted to me.

128
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,912
Border's gonna tighten
like a vice now.

129
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,437
What happened to the price
of cocaine after 9/11, Ken?

130
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:43,744
Tight borders
are good for business.

131
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,638
Let's go.

132
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:10,727
Will you be home by 3:00?

133
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:12,444
I have to stay late
for the science fair.

134
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:13,643
Do you want me
to pick you up?

135
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:15,079
I'll take the bus. Okay.

136
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:20,737
Let's go.

137
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,616
It's pretty good.

138
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:18,926
How much they make?

139
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:23,147
For lookout?

140
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:26,977
20, 30 a day.

141
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,675
Man, but that's
all they're worth.

142
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:32,156
But you...

143
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,595
well, shit, you know
both sides of the river.

144
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,989
You got a passport.
Come and go as you please.

145
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:45,213
Rafa!

146
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,658
Eh.

147
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:00,881
Fat ass.

148
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,412
What's going on?

149
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:07,931
Hide the beer.

150
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,031
You can name
your own price, you know.

151
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,339
Hmm?

152
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:26,776
This is the border.

153
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,779
The Matamoros Cartel
pay people well to work it.

154
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:37,091
You can, uh...

155
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,441
start making your earn
with me, cousin.

156
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,837
Take it.

157
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,853
It's yours.

158
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,300
So, what do I have to do?

159
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:26,314
You really ought to invest
in a little sunscreen, Matt.

160
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,490
If you guys would start wars
someplace cloudy,

161
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:30,057
I wouldn't have to.

162
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:39,022
DOJ get an ID
on those other suicide bombers?

163
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,851
Not yet. Uh, might want to get on that.

164
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,635
There's proof Reyes Cartel

165
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,290
helped one of them
get to the border, so...

166
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:48,075
we know enough
to move forward.

167
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,383
Mr. Secretary...

168
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,298
Matt Graver.

169
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:56,344
Have a seat.

170
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:13,535
What do you think is
the most valuable commodity

171
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:15,580
that cartels move
across our borders?

172
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:20,281
20 years ago, cocaine.

173
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,719
Uh, today I'd have to say
it'd be people.

174
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:27,114
It's a resource they don't
have to cultivate or process

175
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,637
and if they don't
make it across,

176
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:29,986
they can pay to cross again

177
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,683
at three times
the price of a kilo.

178
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:37,907
How would you define terrorism,
Mr. Graver?

179
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,388
I think that's your job, sir.

180
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:46,655
The current definition is
"Any individual or group

181
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,876
that uses violence
to achieve a political goal."

182
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,661
The administration
believes that

183
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,446
the drug cartels
now fit that definition.

184
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,623
Next week, the president's
adding drug cartels

185
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,191
to the list
of terrorist organizations.

186
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,019
You can understand
how that will

187
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,935
expand our ability
to combat them.

188
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,632
The cartel territories

189
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,045
are fairly stable
at the moment,

190
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:11,549
but as we learned in Iraq,

191
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,161
striking your enemy is
a whole hell of a lot easier

192
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:16,728
if they're fighting
each other.

193
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,646
I'll do whatever you need.

194
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,997
Just point the way.

195
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,304
Do you have any thoughts?

196
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:30,481
I mean, I wouldn't take out
a cartel leader.

197
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,919
Turn one cartel into 50.

198
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,835
Besides, killing kings doesn't
start wars, it ends them.

199
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,924
That's our concern.
Mm-hmm.

200
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,188
You have a location on Reyes?

201
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,494
No, but the family's
under surveillance.

202
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:45,279
Is he in contact with them?

203
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,716
Not to our knowledge,
but we assume yes.

204
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,719
Any kids? HAMMONDS: Two.

205
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,112
What's the age
of the youngest?

206
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,504
Sixteen.

207
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:54,941
Sixteen?

208
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:02,470
Yeah, if you want to
start a war...

209
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:03,906
kidnap a prince.

210
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,169
King will start it for you.

211
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:12,349
You did this sort of thing
in the Middle East.

212
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,873
Hmm.

213
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:17,485
You think those tactics
will work here?

214
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,791
If you want it to, sir.

215
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:33,240
Boots on the ground, you're
gonna hire on the outside.

216
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:34,934
And the same goes
for your supply train

217
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:36,983
and for air support.

218
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:39,246
And I don't need
to remind you

219
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,597
what happens if they figure out
that it's us.

220
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,429
Just to be clear,

221
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:51,127
you want to see
this thing through,

222
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:54,304
I'm gonna have to get...
dirty.

223
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:00,832
Dirty is exactly why
you're here.

224
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:07,274
What do you need?

225
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:08,840
Everything.

226
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,104
Drones with
attack capability...

227
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:13,149
You have Black Hawks, right? Mm-hmm.

228
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,586
I want two of those.
I need logistics,

229
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,850
communications equipment
compatible with a SOCOM JCU.

230
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,852
First phase,
I need a strike team,

231
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,290
two snipers,
I need a demolition team...

232
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,118
Are you going to Ukraine?

233
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,902
I got Russians on the payroll,
brother.

234
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:28,643
Don't put me
in that position.

235
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,473
Where's the coup?

236
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:34,388
It's an extraction...

237
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,650
for starters.

238
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:38,087
How much can I know?

239
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:40,785
Brother, you don't
want to know.

240
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,180
Well, I don't need specifics,

241
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:46,356
but I have to know
where they're going.

242
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:51,405
Mexico.

243
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:55,472
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

244
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:57,237
It's not the government.

245
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:00,066
It's cartel.

246
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:03,286
Treasury cutting the checks?

247
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,854
Eh, under a company in Brazil
called Rio Verde.

248
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:16,343
If it's constant action,

249
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:19,085
I'm ten mil a month
in payroll and supplies.

250
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:21,739
At least.

251
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:25,656
I want 150 over cost
and immunity.

252
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,705
Done.

253
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,119
Congratulations, you can afford
your own hockey team now.

254
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:03,031
You'll be easy to shop for
at Christmas.

255
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:07,818
I don't celebrate Christmas.

256
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:13,084
Well, I bet you will
this year.

257
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:14,912
What'd they do?

258
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,653
Doesn't matter.

259
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:27,098
No rules this time.

260
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:30,450
I'm turning you loose.

261
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,237
How loose?

262
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,849
Carlos Reyes.

263
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:43,245
How's that for loose?

264
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,077
It's your chance
to get even for your family.

265
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,347
You're gonna help us
start a war.

266
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:00,436
With who?

267
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:05,136
Everyone.

268
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:44,654
Aah! Aah...

269
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:54,098
Aah!

270
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,045
Adios.

271
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:06,823
This would have been a lot
easier taking her in the house.

272
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:10,218
Could get real sloppy
on the street.

273
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:11,872
Sloppy's good.

274
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:13,766
Sloppy makes it look like
the cartel did it.

275
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,275
All right,
let's go.

276
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,542
She started it.

277
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:15,631
Miss Reyes?

278
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:21,942
She called me a narco
whore and slapped me, so I hit her.

279
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:24,510
What would you do?

280
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:26,512
You.

281
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:28,557
Go to the nurse.

282
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:33,040
No, you're not
going anywhere.

283
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:35,042
Sit.

284
00:30:43,964 --> 00:30:45,531
Now what am I going
to do with you?

285
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:48,969
She deserved
what she got.

286
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:50,884
It's not your place to do it.

287
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,408
Fine.

288
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:56,280
You beat the shit out of her.

289
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,806
I should expel you.

290
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:03,026
Do it.

291
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,820
That's what I thought.

292
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,623
How we looking?

293
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:37,104
Got eyes on the prize?

294
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:39,062
Roger.

295
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:41,456
Prize is in the tail vehicle.

296
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:01,797
No!

297
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:05,584
No! No! No!

298
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,772
Where we going? Go straight to the plane.

299
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:05,402
Don't worry about the vehicle.
We'll take care of it.

300
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:06,514
All right.

301
00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:16,334
All right, you're
gonna drive that to the mall.

302
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,048
Keys are in the gas flap.
You just leave them there.

303
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,877
All right. Then you go see
what's waiting for you.

304
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,671
Where you got us? Building 5, sir.

305
00:36:00,846 --> 00:36:02,673
You're gonna take a left.
I know where it is.

306
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:30,136
Now walk me through
what I'm watching here.

307
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,791
This is a map of Mexico
on a hundred-mile grids.

308
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:34,749
And you took
the subject here.

309
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:37,317
Speculation is Reyes
has a family residence

310
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:40,189
somewhere near Monterrey.

311
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:42,409
Has the Mexican police
responded yet?

312
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,412
Yeah, local, state and federal
police are all there now.

313
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:48,110
Satellite cannot
pick up cell chatter.

314
00:36:48,284 --> 00:36:49,982
Okay. Yeah, we can lock coordinates

315
00:36:50,156 --> 00:36:51,810
to the cell
and snag the phone number,

316
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:53,004
but we can't hear the call.

317
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,856
Give me a satellite feed

318
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,336
of the house in Mexico City.

319
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,338
Yeah, you got it.

320
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:00,514
What we're hoping for is
a call from this location

321
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,472
to start a trail.

322
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:03,798
Any family
members in the house?

323
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,171
No, just staff.

324
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:08,261
Teenage girl with
her own 30-room mansion.

325
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,568
I wish I was a teenage girl.

326
00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:13,614
Pull up the incident site.

327
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,012
It looks
like you popped them all.

328
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:22,231
No, we only engaged one.

329
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:24,843
One died in the crash, and
the other two we tied and left.

330
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:27,062
That's a pretty big risk.
Why do that?

331
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:30,109
Just to see what they'd do.

332
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:32,589
Back it up.
Show me earlier.

333
00:37:32,763 --> 00:37:34,083
A minute just after we left.Yeah.

334
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,248
Keep going.

335
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,033
All right, there, good.

336
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:47,802
We have new audio
coming in on the black phone.

337
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:51,607
Copy that.

338
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,063
Call is not coming
from the house,

339
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:13,239
it's coming from that fucker
right there.

340
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:14,893
Give me a live feed
and find him.

341
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,895
On it.

342
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:21,508
Phone!

343
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:23,336
Lock in on it.

344
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,599
All right, locking now.

345
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:28,123
Data link up. There's the king.

346
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:30,778
There it is.
Start tracking.

347
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:31,952
Come on.

348
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:33,389
Tracking on two.

349
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:35,163
Stand by. We got three.

350
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:19,087
Por favor.

351
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,793
Por favor.

352
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:45,347
Get down! Police! Get down!

353
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,828
Hands where I can see 'em! Move! Move!

354
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:53,094
Clear!

355
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:54,356
Clear!

356
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:23,559
We got another one here!

357
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:31,176
A-Are you okay?

358
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,873
Are we clear?

359
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:35,397
All clear!

360
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:37,878
It's okay.

361
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:41,055
Let's go. It's okay.

362
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,101
It's okay.

363
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:46,713
It's okay. It's okay.

364
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:49,933
It's okay.

365
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,966
Am I in Texas?

366
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:27,275
Yeah, we are.

367
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:34,804
What do you want us
to call you?

368
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:39,809
Isabel.
Isabel.

369
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:43,726
I need to ask you
a question.

370
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,256
Did they hurt you?

371
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,220
What happened here?

372
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:09,187
I got in a fight at school.

373
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:15,802
So when do I get
to go back home?

374
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:18,152
Well, we still need
to work through some things

375
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:20,633
to make sure we understand
all the circumstances

376
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,809
surrounding
your abduction, okay?

377
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,419
But you're safe.

378
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:30,033
So hang in there, we're gonna
get you home very soon.

379
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:39,347
Alicia will look after you.

380
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:42,350
And if you need anything,
just ask her.

381
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:24,044
We put the girl in the middle
of Matamoros territory,

382
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:25,741
and Reyes will start
the fireworks.

383
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:29,136
What's a good spot
where we can leave her?

384
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:32,052
We'll hold her in a federal
police depot in Méndez.

385
00:44:32,226 --> 00:44:33,836
We're deep enough
in Matamoros land

386
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,621
that they'll have
to fight their way out

387
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:37,927
if they come looking for her.

388
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,585
Where do I say you found her?

389
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:45,805
Oh, say we raided a safe house
in Brownsville

390
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:47,502
and found her there.

391
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:49,765
Matamoros Cartel is
very strong in this area.

392
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:51,700
Reyes will have trouble
getting his men through.

393
00:44:51,724 --> 00:44:53,073
Ah, they'll let
his men through.

394
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:54,767
Getting back out
will be their problem.

395
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:58,470
When would you
bring her across?

396
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:00,210
Well, now that
we got the cartels

397
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,225
at each other's throats,
the sooner the better.

398
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,388
Secret won't keep long.

399
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:05,520
Uh, there's no secrets
in Mexico.

400
00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:07,087
Why do you think
I'm driving armor?

401
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:08,828
Can you get me cleared
for that?

402
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:10,873
Will do.

403
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,441
Federal police will meet you
at the border with an escort.

404
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:17,837
Thanks.

405
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:35,158
Still amazes me.

406
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,466
The appetite of this place.

407
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,990
Yeah, well,
welcome to America.

408
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:44,994
You all right?

409
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:46,996
What the fuck?!

410
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,535
Hey! Why don't you
keep your fucking eyes peeled?

411
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:09,018
Ah, you can't even tell
they're gangbangers anymore.

412
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:47,317
I've got a problem.

413
00:46:47,492 --> 00:46:49,929
Either be home before dawn
or my dad will get mad.

414
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:52,845
Oh, get the fuck out, dude, no.
No, no, no.

415
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,978
You got a new daddy now.
All right?

416
00:46:56,152 --> 00:46:58,590
When you meet him,
act like a fucking man.

417
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,636
You ready to be a man,
right?

418
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:07,033
All right, yes, dude.
All right.

419
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,616
Just wait here till
I come get you, all right?

420
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,900
Come on.

421
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:36,252
No. ¿No?

422
00:49:12,637 --> 00:49:13,637
Sí.

423
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:23,561
Sí.

424
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:42,928
How you feeling?

425
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,433
I'd feel better
if someone actually told me

426
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:52,067
what was going on.

427
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:54,330
We're turning you over
to the Mexican Army.

428
00:49:54,504 --> 00:49:56,637
They'll arrange to take you
back to your father.

429
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,641
Let's go.

430
00:50:26,536 --> 00:50:28,800
I'm gonna need you
to put this on.

431
00:50:44,163 --> 00:50:46,731
Load up!

432
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:48,471
Loading up! Heads up!

433
00:51:16,064 --> 00:51:18,501
I have seven Mexican police vehicles

434
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:20,286
located at the border
checkpoint waiting.

435
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,070
They're moving and forming up

436
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:23,985
in your configuration
at this time.

437
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,833
It's a nice day
for a drive, huh?

438
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:47,443
Ah, beautiful day.

439
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:49,141
Blue skies,
large-caliber weapons.

440
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,231
I love getting out
of the office.

441
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:54,712
Air, how are we looking?

442
00:51:54,886 --> 00:51:56,539
Clear on both sides.

443
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:00,369
You see no vehicles?

444
00:52:00,543 --> 00:52:02,023
Nothing but desert.

445
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:03,808
You're clear.

446
00:52:05,374 --> 00:52:07,637
What's your field of view?

447
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:10,075
Ten miles in every direction.

448
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:12,468
Mexico Feds said
that the road would be clear.

449
00:52:12,642 --> 00:52:14,427
Looks like they're
keeping their word.

450
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,241
All right, copy that.

451
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:28,397
Why weren't we stopped
at the border?

452
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:31,400
'Cause I'm special.

453
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,795
I thought you were policemen.

454
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:36,362
You're soldiers.

455
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,559
You know, we saved you...
why don't you just sit back

456
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:42,237
and be grateful.

457
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,199
Oscar-One, paved road ends

458
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,678
half a mile ahead.

459
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:50,680
Wait, what?

460
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:52,770
Paved road ends
in half a klick.

461
00:52:52,944 --> 00:52:54,510
Road isn't paved ahead.

462
00:52:54,684 --> 00:52:56,556
You got your thermal?
Yeah, in my bag

463
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,037
in the back; you gotta take the wheel.
All right.

464
00:53:00,603 --> 00:53:01,909
Got it.

465
00:53:03,693 --> 00:53:05,260
Oh, shit.

466
00:53:14,313 --> 00:53:16,402
Nothing's ever easy.

467
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:19,187
I got it.

468
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:20,449
Shit.

469
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:22,538
I got no vis.

470
00:53:22,712 --> 00:53:24,540
This fucker's speeding up.

471
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:26,978
Well, he's not stupid.
Stay on his ass.

472
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,939
Dirt roads make me nervous.

473
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:15,461
Air, I'm blind here.

474
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,463
Road's clear.

475
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:19,726
No vehicles, no movement,
left or right.

476
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:27,777
All right, anything?

477
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:30,302
Shit. Oscar-One,
incoming on your right.

478
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,912
Air, I see nothing. Contact right.

479
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:33,479
I don't see anything.

480
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,351
All down! Down!

481
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,152
Stuck! I'm stuck!

482
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:03,770
Aw, come on!

483
00:55:03,944 --> 00:55:05,641
West side, hundred meters!

484
00:55:05,815 --> 00:55:07,078
Take him out!

485
00:55:07,252 --> 00:55:08,652
Roger that. Heads down!

486
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:10,820
Heads down!

487
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:15,042
We're stuck. We're stuck.

488
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:20,787
Go! Go, go!

489
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:35,035
Cease fire! Cease fire!

490
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,915
Clear!

491
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:49,484
Clear.

492
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:50,658
Drop your weapon!

493
00:56:50,703 --> 00:56:51,791
Them, over there. Sir!

494
00:56:56,274 --> 00:56:58,363
Spread out!

495
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:04,673
Put 'em down, guys!

496
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:06,197
Easy, easy.

497
00:57:08,373 --> 00:57:10,462
- !Abajo!
- Ayuda.

498
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,476
Easy, guys, easy.

499
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,466
Down. Down.! Ayuda!

500
00:57:35,356 --> 00:57:36,966
Fuck!

501
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:38,794
Shit.

502
00:57:38,968 --> 00:57:41,362
Fuckin' Mexican police
shot me?

503
00:57:41,536 --> 00:57:43,190
You all right?

504
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:44,844
Oh, shit.

505
00:57:45,018 --> 00:57:47,020
I'm good.
It caught the plate.

506
00:57:47,194 --> 00:57:49,544
All right. We clear?

507
00:57:49,718 --> 00:57:52,199
Sir! We have police vehicles
approaching from the south.

508
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:53,592
Five klicks out.

509
00:57:54,984 --> 00:57:56,203
All right, load up!

510
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,075
Come on, load up!

511
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,085
Where is she?

512
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:12,524
New mission!

513
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,134
Gather round! New mission!

514
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:16,658
Uh... no time for that.

515
00:58:16,832 --> 00:58:19,226
Head north. I'll find her.

516
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,839
Okay. Go.

517
00:58:24,013 --> 00:58:26,190
All right, we got company
three klicks out,

518
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:27,669
coming from the south.

519
00:58:27,843 --> 00:58:29,671
Grab that Humvee,
pull this thing out.

520
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:30,845
Go! Now! Now!

521
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,850
Come on, guys! Now!

522
00:58:35,024 --> 00:58:37,157
Go, go! Let's go!

523
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,941
Let's go! Move it!

524
00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:02,704
Take this.

525
00:59:02,878 --> 00:59:05,751
All right?

526
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,014
Send me a signal
when you get to the border,

527
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:09,450
we'll come and get you.

528
00:59:09,624 --> 00:59:10,973
All right?

529
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:15,413
Let's go, let's go!
Let's move it!

530
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:29,427
All right,
everyone in their vehicles!

531
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,414
Air, we need a medivac
from rally point alpha.

532
01:00:00,588 --> 01:00:02,721
Contact 47th med at Laughlin.

533
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,636
Roger that, Oscar-One.

534
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,725
Be advised,
you have police vehicles

535
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:08,179
approaching your six
in a Code 3.

536
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:09,510
Oh, that's great.

537
01:00:09,684 --> 01:00:11,338
Police approaching
our six fast.

538
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:15,081
Air, we need a lane clear
at the border.

539
01:00:15,255 --> 01:00:16,952
No bullshit.
Anybody gets in our way,

540
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:18,246
we drive right through them.

541
01:00:38,496 --> 01:00:40,933
Border coming up fast.
Border.

542
01:01:22,104 --> 01:01:23,104
!Oye!

543
01:01:24,716 --> 01:01:25,716
!Oye!

544
01:01:27,022 --> 01:01:28,285
!Oye!

545
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:42,342
Isabel?

546
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:01,012
No!

547
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:03,363
No!

548
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:28,388
Get in.

549
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:49,556
Who kidnapped me?

550
01:03:57,303 --> 01:03:59,566
Your father
has a lot of enemies.

551
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:05,267
And you're one of them?

552
01:04:06,921 --> 01:04:08,488
Yes, I am.

553
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:25,766
You're gonna need stitches.
Yeah. Lucky for me,

554
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,465
I'll still need
them tomorrow.

555
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,989
Miss Sunshine on your six.

556
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,557
Hi. Fuckin' Mondays, huh?

557
01:04:35,994 --> 01:04:38,518
Can we go somewhere
that's private?

558
01:04:39,693 --> 01:04:40,999
All right.

559
01:04:41,173 --> 01:04:43,567
Can you give me a sec?
Ma'am.

560
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:48,506
My source is
with her right now.

561
01:04:48,572 --> 01:04:50,051
She'll be back in an hour.

562
01:04:50,225 --> 01:04:51,662
That's not what
I'm talking about.

563
01:04:51,836 --> 01:04:53,228
It was a green on blue,
Cynthia.

564
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:54,621
There was no other option.

565
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:56,536
You wanted Afghanistan,
now you got it.

566
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,016
This isn't Afghanistan.

567
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,887
This is our fucking neighbor!

568
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:03,456
There are 54 million Americans
with relatives there,

569
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,502
Mm-hmm. and they're all sitting around

570
01:05:05,676 --> 01:05:08,722
watching footage
of dead Mexican police

571
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:11,508
on Fox News. The police were the ambush.

572
01:05:11,682 --> 01:05:13,205
Oh, yeah, okay. We had no choice.

573
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:15,033
All... They attacked us.

574
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:16,730
Doesn't matter.

575
01:05:16,904 --> 01:05:18,464
POTUS doesn't have
the stomach for this.

576
01:05:18,558 --> 01:05:19,994
He shut us down.

577
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:22,301
What did you say? We're shut down.

578
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,870
I did my fuckin' job.
You do yours.

579
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:28,089
You sit that
fuckin' coward down,

580
01:05:28,263 --> 01:05:31,876
and you explain to him...
this is how we win.

581
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,399
He's not worried
about winning.

582
01:05:33,573 --> 01:05:36,141
He's worried about
being fucking impeached,

583
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:38,665
because you killed
two dozen Mexican police.

584
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:40,406
Who worked for Reyes.

585
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,713
Spin it. Do your job.

586
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:44,715
This only strengthens
our position.

587
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:46,543
We don't have a position,
Matt.

588
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:49,023
Because we're not supposed
to fucking be there.

589
01:05:49,197 --> 01:05:51,852
Your objective was to start
a war with Mexican cartels,

590
01:05:52,026 --> 01:05:54,333
not with
the Mexican government.

591
01:05:54,507 --> 01:05:55,900
You know what?

592
01:05:56,074 --> 01:05:57,945
This-this is why
nothing ever changes.

593
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:01,122
You think change
is the goal? Really?

594
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:04,082
You've been doing this too long
to believe that.

595
01:07:44,617 --> 01:07:46,140
Sí.

596
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:26,937
Why didn't you hold her
someplace in Mexico?

597
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:29,156
We don't have the
infrastructure for that, sir.

598
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,050
Mission security
would be almost impossible.

599
01:09:31,115 --> 01:09:32,681
Was this your mission? No, sir.

600
01:09:32,856 --> 01:09:34,379
Then why are you answering?

601
01:09:34,553 --> 01:09:37,295
Mr. Graver?

602
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:39,776
We don't have the
infrastructure for that, sir.

603
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,691
Mission security
would be almost impossible.

604
01:09:48,306 --> 01:09:51,483
And this girl was witness to
all aspects of the mission,

605
01:09:51,657 --> 01:09:54,616
correct? No, she was shielded
from the kidnapping.

606
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,315
What about the 25
Mexican police officers

607
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:59,186
that were killed,
on foreign soil,

608
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,275
all of which she witnessed?

609
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:03,538
The ones who attacked us?
Yes, sir.

610
01:10:06,237 --> 01:10:08,369
Where is she?

611
01:10:08,543 --> 01:10:11,677
I have a source
bringing her to the border.

612
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:13,984
Do we have an exact location?

613
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:17,901
That question is for you, Mr. Forsing.

614
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:21,165
We don't know
her whereabouts, sir,

615
01:10:21,339 --> 01:10:23,080
but he has a beacon...
he'll activate it

616
01:10:23,254 --> 01:10:25,169
as soon as he gets close
to the border.

617
01:10:25,343 --> 01:10:27,780
If they can make it
to the border.

618
01:10:27,954 --> 01:10:30,870
Which is a chance
we cannot take.

619
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:34,743
Cynthia.

620
01:10:34,918 --> 01:10:36,267
Yes, sir?

621
01:10:38,312 --> 01:10:40,227
You handle it from here.

622
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:58,376
We can't risk her falling
into the wrong hands.

623
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,508
When the beacon's activated,

624
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:02,249
your team takes them.

625
01:11:02,423 --> 01:11:03,511
You understand?

626
01:11:06,384 --> 01:11:08,908
Clean the scene.

627
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:11,563
When I say clean, gentlemen,
I mean spotless.

628
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:13,565
Your operative included.

629
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:20,702
Do you know...

630
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:23,531
how hard he was to make?

631
01:11:23,705 --> 01:11:25,751
I could throw a stick
across the river

632
01:11:25,925 --> 01:11:28,319
and hit 50 grieving fathers.

633
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,364
Make another one.

634
01:11:30,538 --> 01:11:32,497
Can't do that.

635
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:35,108
Well, look who doesn't have
the stomach for it now.

636
01:11:35,282 --> 01:11:37,197
Oh, who are you
to question me

637
01:11:37,371 --> 01:11:39,373
after all the shit
that I've eaten for you?

638
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:43,595
We ID'd
the other bombers, Matt.

639
01:11:43,769 --> 01:11:45,553
They're U.S. citizens.

640
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:47,816
They're from New Jersey.
Doesn't change anything.

641
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:49,949
It changes
the fucking narrative!

642
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:58,365
Hey.

643
01:12:58,539 --> 01:12:59,801
Hey.

644
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:01,499
You got the girl?

645
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:03,240
She's with me now, yeah.

646
01:13:05,155 --> 01:13:07,026
They want me to cut ties.

647
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,202
You got to get rid of her.

648
01:13:14,468 --> 01:13:16,731
I can't do that.

649
01:13:16,905 --> 01:13:18,907
What are you telling me?

650
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:21,258
Not this one.

651
01:13:23,086 --> 01:13:25,131
Help me get her across,

652
01:13:25,305 --> 01:13:27,438
and we can decide
what to do with her.

653
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:31,224
Uh-uh. Don't put me
in that situation.

654
01:13:31,398 --> 01:13:34,097
If they're cutting ties,
you're already in that situation.

655
01:13:38,797 --> 01:13:41,104
If she stays here,
she'll be killed.

656
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:45,630
Help me get her across.

657
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,594
I can't help you do that.

658
01:14:02,299 --> 01:14:04,736
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

659
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,955
I'll figure it out.

660
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,658
Good luck.

661
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:19,767
I got to get you north.

662
01:16:07,075 --> 01:16:08,903
See, the flashing light
is you.

663
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:10,905
All right? That red line,

664
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:12,429
that's your path.

665
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:14,170
Okay. Don't get that wet.

666
01:16:24,615 --> 01:16:26,834
Keep it safe for a bit.

667
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:35,626
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

668
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,019
They're sheep.

669
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:40,326
Treat them like it.

670
01:17:04,742 --> 01:17:06,396
!Rápido!

671
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:16,319
!Vámonos!

672
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:28,826
Follow the trail to the road.

673
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,741
Your ride's waiting.

674
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,548
It's okay.

675
01:18:55,722 --> 01:18:57,333
Come on.

676
01:19:15,176 --> 01:19:17,831
Show me a job that pays better
and I'll do it.

677
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:21,357
Where are you headed, baby?

678
01:19:21,531 --> 01:19:23,335
Get me to the
grocery store on Trenton.

679
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:24,795
I can walk from there.

680
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:49,472
Why does a soldier know
sign language?

681
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,477
My daughter was deaf.

682
01:20:02,876 --> 01:20:05,009
I know who you are.

683
01:20:09,187 --> 01:20:12,495
You're the attorney
whose family they killed.

684
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,109
Not "they."

685
01:20:25,508 --> 01:20:28,293
My father.

686
01:20:28,467 --> 01:20:30,687
A man who worked for him.

687
01:20:38,956 --> 01:20:40,261
Why?

688
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:44,091
To send a message.

689
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:49,357
Now you hunt them...

690
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:52,448
so you won't be a message.

691
01:20:53,623 --> 01:20:57,540
I will always be a message.

692
01:20:57,714 --> 01:21:01,239
Only now,
the message is different.

693
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:20,301
Is the border hard to cross?

694
01:21:24,523 --> 01:21:27,091
It could be...

695
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:29,136
for Isabel Reyes.

696
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,634
From now on,
your name is Carina.

697
01:23:03,448 --> 01:23:05,798
Signal was activated at 1939,

698
01:23:05,972 --> 01:23:07,887
heading northeast of Reynosa.

699
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:16,200
I'm sending another team
to finish this.

700
01:23:16,374 --> 01:23:19,682
No. I'll do it.

701
01:23:19,856 --> 01:23:22,815
'Cause if I don't, he'll
probably come and kill you.

702
01:26:17,642 --> 01:26:19,296
Oh...

703
01:28:47,705 --> 01:28:49,905
There's interference on the road.

704
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:55,191
Are the vehicles unmarked
or police? Unmarked.

705
01:28:58,194 --> 01:29:00,022
ETA to target?

706
01:29:00,196 --> 01:29:01,762
25 minutes.

707
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:04,173
No.

708
01:30:56,529 --> 01:30:57,529
No?

709
01:32:05,816 --> 01:32:07,034
No.

710
01:33:59,538 --> 01:34:00,626
Huh?

711
01:34:53,113 --> 01:34:54,811
No! No!

712
01:34:54,985 --> 01:34:55,985
No! No! No!

713
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:02,862
No!

714
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,452
That's him. ETA?

715
01:35:27,626 --> 01:35:29,498
15 minutes.

716
01:35:29,672 --> 01:35:32,588
Get us there in ten...
I can't have the girl talk.

717
01:35:32,762 --> 01:35:34,154
Hang on back there.

718
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:36,113
Gonna get bumpy.

719
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:00,632
José.

720
01:38:52,744 --> 01:38:53,744
No!

721
01:38:55,007 --> 01:38:56,182
No!

722
01:39:56,982 --> 01:39:59,681
Glad we didn't
have to do that.

723
01:39:59,855 --> 01:40:01,683
What about the girl?

724
01:40:04,816 --> 01:40:06,688
Two minutes out.

725
01:40:08,385 --> 01:40:10,039
Matt?

726
01:40:22,181 --> 01:40:25,054
Base, what's subject's
exact location inside the car?

727
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:27,188
Subject is back seat,

728
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:29,058
right side
behind the passenger.

729
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:35,499
Prize is passenger side,
second seat, green Expedition.

730
01:40:38,197 --> 01:40:39,808
Rules of engagement?

731
01:40:45,161 --> 01:40:47,554
Fuck it all.

732
01:40:47,729 --> 01:40:50,514
Wipe it clean.

733
01:45:26,355 --> 01:45:28,792
Stand up! Stand up!

734
01:45:43,938 --> 01:45:46,244
What are you doing?

735
01:45:46,418 --> 01:45:47,724
Matt!

736
01:45:47,898 --> 01:45:50,292
You're fucking us!

737
01:45:50,466 --> 01:45:53,251
She said spotless. Fuck 'em all.

738
01:45:53,425 --> 01:45:55,079
She'll go
into witness protection.

739
01:53:22,874 --> 01:53:24,485
Sit down.

740
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:07,658
So you wanna be a sicario.

741
01:54:26,677 --> 01:54:28,853
Let's talk about your future.

741
01:54:29,305 --> 01:55:29,917

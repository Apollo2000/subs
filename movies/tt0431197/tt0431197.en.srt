2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,446
After capturing most of 
the Arabian Peninsula

3
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,074
with the help of
the Wahhabi Islamic warriors,

4
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,883
Ibn Saud establishes
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

5
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,521
The Wahhabis
were fiercely anti-Western.

6
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,057
They want to go back in time

7
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,562
to a pure Islam that wasn't
threatened by the West.

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,063
It was by chance
that we discovered oil.

9
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,292
We were looking for water.

10
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,098
Despite criticism
of foreign presence in the Kingdom,

11
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,037
the King allows commercial
oil production to begin.

12
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,673
The result is the first union

13
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,734
between Saudi Arabia
and the United States.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,841
To accommodate the workforce

15
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:24,678
the first Western housing
compounds are created.

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,777
The strict Islamic laws
enforced outside of these walls

17
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,343
do not apply inside.

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,685
West and East came together in Egypt

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,659
when President Roosevelt
and Ibn Saud, King of Arabia...

20
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,663
They want America
present there in the kingdom

21
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,198
because we are their security.

22
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,828
The Saudi elite became notorious
big spenders and lost credibility

23
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:48,566
and respect among
religious conservatives.

24
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,940
In response to the U.S. Support of Israel
in the Arab-Israeli War,

25
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,377
Wahhabi Muslims pressured
the Saudi monarchy to stop pumping oil.

26
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,678
Those who control the flow of oil

27
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,683
hold the Western world hostage.

28
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,253
Prices quadruple.

29
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,782
Oil was an American
national security priority.

30
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,091
The embargo redefined the balance of power

31
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,255
between the oil consumers
and oil producers.

32
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,461
Iraq's battle-trained army
swept across Kuwait's borders at first light.

33
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:19,095
As a Saudi national,
Osama bin Laden offered his services

34
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,829
to the Royals.

35
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:20,472
He told them he could

36
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,563
bring his army from Afghanistan

37
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,667
to repel the Iraqi invaders
from Kuwait.

38
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,405
But the Saudis had a better offer.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,970
A half-million troops
from the United States.

40
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,179
His offer rejected,

41
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,983
Osama took to the streets
and mosques to denounce the U.S.,

42
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:39,546
the Royal Family
and their unholy alliance.

43
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,922
Osama bin Laden this week

44
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,895
again lashed out
at the Saudi Royal Family.

45
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,690
We were tracking bin Laden
since the early '90s.

46
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,666
We stripped him of his citizenship.

47
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:09,911
When it became clear
that 15 of the 19 were Saudis,

48
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:13,389
that was a disaster.
A total disaster.

49
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,222
Because bin Laden, at that moment,
had made, in the minds of Americans,

50
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,422
Saudi Arabia into an enemy.

51
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,933
- We are with you to get to...
- The perpetrators of this cowardly attack.

52
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,333
How dare they say they are Muslim!

53
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,270
This is a nation
where tradition and modernity

54
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,033
are in violent collision.

55
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,173
The Al Qaeda is thought
to have been behind the bombing.

56
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:37,079
A team of F.B.I. agents prepare
to investigate the attack in Saudi Arabia.

57
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:42,748
The latest terrorist attacks
showcase the great division

58
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,985
between the pro-U.S. Monarchy
and the extremist Wahhabi militants

59
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,686
within the kingdom.

60
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,503
Yeah, come on! Come on!

61
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,199
- Here we go.
- Let's go!

62
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,331
Here you go, man.

63
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,635
Hey, thanks.

64
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,935
Yeah!

65
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,110
Hey, guys, 
you might want to move back!

66
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,615
Is this what you're looking at?

67
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,809
Easy.

68
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,317
Out!

69
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,317
Give it up!

70
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,689
Come on, move it!

71
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,089
We need a hit. Come on!

72
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,024
Here we go. No-hitter.

73
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,220
No-hitter.

74
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,627
Come on. Do your worst.

75
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,977
Hello. How are you today,
Sergeant?

76
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,712
Sun is shining.
Wind is blowing.

77
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,048
How bad can I be doing?

78
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:06,099
And this is the skateboard
that my Grandma Ruth gave to me.

79
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:10,301
This is my fish Jaws.
And he's a really neat fish.

80
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,210
And this is the day that my daddy says
is the happiest day of his life.

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,272
Can you tell us
about that day, Mr. Fleury?

82
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,384
Yeah. You guys want to hear it?
You want to hear the story?

83
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,816
Do you want to hear about that day?
Well, I'll tell you what.

84
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,586
This is December 4

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,786
and we were at the hospital all day
and most of the night.

86
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,055
And we was waiting on
this little man to come out.

87
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,893
And then all of a sudden the doctor
showed up and said, 'He's not coming out.'

88
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,228
'We got to go in and get him.'

89
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,433
Like a search team, right?
So what she did was...

90
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,341
- You sure I can tell this story?
- Yeah, go ahead.

91
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:45,274
So what happened was,
is they took a tiny little knife

92
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,870
then cut right underneath
the belly button,

93
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,038
and they opened her up

94
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,017
and then took her hands and stuck them
all the way in her belly and disappeared.

95
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,077
And she was in there just rustling
and rumbling and looking for something.

96
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,248
Then she started pulling and pulling
and pulling and pulling

97
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,691
and she was pulling,
and all of a sudden she stopped!

98
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,956
Then she looked at me and said,
'Mr. Fleury, are you ready

99
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,397
'to have your world rocked?'

100
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,368
And I said,
'Well, I guess so.'

101
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,029
And so she starts pulling and pulling
and all of a sudden a head popped out.

102
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,166
And I looked down and I said, 'Kevin!'
And then he looked back at me

103
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,731
- and he said...
- Daddy!

104
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,243
Daddy! Yeah.

105
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,143
And that was...

106
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,474
That was the happiest day of my life.

107
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,847
Say that again!

108
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,292
Roddy!

109
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,835
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!

110
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:43,928
On the floor!

111
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,178
Shame on you.

112
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,628
Please do not panic,
everything okay.

113
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,496
Come. Follow me, please.
Come with me.

114
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:57,992
Come. Follow me, please.
Come with me.

115
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:01,388
There is no God but Allah,
and Mohammed is his messenger.

116
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:30,973
All glory to Allah.

117
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,202
- Fran?
- Are you getting this yet?

118
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,942
Slow down. I'm at Kevin's school.
What's going on?

119
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,542
Riyadh. We got a lot of bodies
down here, Ronnie.

120
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,087
Hold on, I'm going outside.
I can't hear you. Where exactly?

121
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,623
The Al Rahmah Western Housing Compound.

122
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,386
Oil company employees.
They hit the compound picnic.

123
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,852
How?

124
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,054
Broad fucking daylight.

125
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,427
They blew up a goddamn
softball game, Ronnie.

126
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,965
I mean, kids and everything.

127
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,330
- You understand?
- When?

128
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,699
An hour ago.
Get them away from there!

129
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,307
An hour ago. One bomber.
Shooter crew for diversion.

130
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,304
Over there! Jesus Christ.

131
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,436
Fran, you okay?

132
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,276
Get them on the far side.

133
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,682
Yeah, I'm fine. Listen to me, Ronnie.
You got to get out here.

134
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,947
Do you understand me?
You got to get out here.

135
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:24,386
Don't take no for an answer.

136
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,014
All right, I hear you.
I hear you.

137
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,581
- They're not gonna say no.
- Good.

138
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,648
All right.

139
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:34,159
Hey. Look, Daddy's got to go to work. 
All right?

140
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,460
We're gonna do ceramics.

141
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,694
We're gonna do what?
Ceramics?

142
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,531
Well, we'll do ceramics
when I get back, okay?

143
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,662
Who was that?

144
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,035
That was Uncle Fran.

145
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,199
Uncle Fran? What happened?

146
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,334
Some bad things happened.

147
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,279
A lot of bad people out there?

148
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,975
Yeah. But you are not one of them.

149
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,826
Hey, Rex?

150
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,033
How old were you
when your hat was that small?

151
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,249
Come on, buddy.
You got to get up.

152
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,709
We got work to do.

153
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,897
Well, we got to clear out this perimeter.
We got to...

154
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,700
- I got...
- We got to preserve some of this evidence.

155
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,428
Get Jack and Steve
to cover on the far side.

156
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,442
The initial attack,

157
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,377
involving a suicide bomber
and at least two gunmen...

158
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,642
...was apparently designed
to lure...

159
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,190
FBI, Washington D.C.

160
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,583
...followed by
a massive secondary explosion.

161
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,748
Numbers so far, 100 plus killed,
200 plus injured.

162
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,725
Target was a softball game.

163
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,662
The killers wore Saudi police uniforms. 
Special...

164
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,066
Special Agent Fran Manner
was killed.

165
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,355
Grant? 
Take a stab at the bomb sizes.

166
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,568
From the craters it looks like they used a high explosive, 
possibly military grade.

167
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,638
Twenty, thirty pounds of P.E.T.N.

168
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,142
That's something that they have.

169
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,704
Semtex or C-4 if they could get it.

170
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,980
That there. God knows.

171
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,814
That crater looks like a plane
dropped a 500-pounder.

172
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:10,616
Sir? I, already know the answer to this,
but is there any chance in hell

173
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,589
we get to go over there
and use our hands?

174
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:15,022
If you already know the answer,
why ask the question?

175
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,185
Just thought I'd ask.

176
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,389
Look, we're not seeing
this kind of planning and execution

177
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,863
- anywhere else, are we?
- No.

178
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,230
I mean, these ain't 
hot-wired artillery shells

179
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,461
waiting for Humvees to roll by.

180
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,494
These hits are coordinated.

181
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,530
The planning, timing in big,
broad-daylight, balls-out ugly.

182
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,633
So fucking greedy.

183
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,008
Do we know if they used the uniforms
in the other two attacks?

184
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,343
No, as far as I know
this is the first time for that.

185
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,612
Then you're saying now they got
access to Saudi uniforms?

186
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,710
I mean, baby Jesus!

187
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,981
Is anybody taking credit?
Anybody seen anything on the web?

188
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,613
Haven't heard anything.
Tom, you got anything?

189
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,715
We haven't found anything yet.

190
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,623
How do we know it's not Saudi on Saudi?

191
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,686
Could be. If it's Saudi, 
then it's quite probably the work of Abu Hamza.

192
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,563
Osama wannabe.
Lived in Iraq. Afghanistan.

193
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,225
Sir, not to beat a dead horse,

194
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,567
but if there was ever a time for us
to put boots on Saudi sand,

195
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:01,866
I mean, don't you think this is it?

196
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,000
There's no way, Adam.
They will never allow it.

197
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,406
Then let's just ask.

198
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:08,343
The Saudi Royal Family cannot appear
as if they're losing control.

199
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,075
If they lose control of their country,
lose control of the people,

200
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,083
they risk losing control of the oil.

201
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,140
And that is not gonna happen.

202
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,113
State Department.

203
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,821
'We are in agreement
with the Saudi security assessment

204
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,885
'that any additional American presence
on kingdom soil represents reckless risk.'

205
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,555
- Oh, come on, risk?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,157
What's that?
That's not a reckless risk?

207
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,259
Fuck it.

208
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,833
You hang tight.
I'm gonna go get access.

209
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,266
Keep your bags packed.
Keep your phones on.

210
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,776
Some of you are gonna get some calls.

211
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,254
Everyone's terrified,
so nothing moves.

212
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,382
You and your team aren't going anywhere

213
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,790
and this meeting's
just a circle jerk, Ronnie.

214
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,920
Attorney General Young is gonna go 
through the motions

215
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,191
because protocol says
we get an appeal.

216
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,666
We'll be on record,
but you expect nothing more.

217
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,298
I met with Prince Thamer at Saudi Embassy

218
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,670
15 minutes after hearing
this morning's news.

219
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,766
And after speaking with Thamer,

220
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,709
I advised withholding
additional U.S. Personnel,

221
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,510
because a large part
of the religious justification

222
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,642
for these bombs is the presence
of current U.S. Personnel.

223
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,550
More boots on Saudi soil

224
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,418
is only gonna make
an already combustible situation

225
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,956
that much more so.

226
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,252
My two cents.

227
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,156
The Saudis have not asked for F.B.I. help.
They've done the opposite.

228
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,858
This is just going to further complicate
an already deteriorating situation

229
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,696
with one of our few remaining allies 
in the Middle East.

230
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,757
Rock solid logic.

231
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, we would like to be on the record
as saying the F.B.I. would like

232
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,271
an Evidence Response Team
on the ground in Riyadh now.

233
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,938
Doesn't your team in that country
represent exactly the kind

234
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,051
of target that these masters
would die for?

235
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,350
They'd trade 10 of their own
for one of you.

236
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,721
Not to go after criminals
because they might try to harm you

237
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,782
is really not a policy of the F.B.I.

238
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,585
See, we try not to say uncle.

239
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,087
We try.

240
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,688
Let me put it to you another way.

241
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,995
Al Qaeda lost the first phase
of this war.

242
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,090
And they know it.

243
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,496
So a new zero-sum phase has begun.

244
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,572
'If you're a Westerner
or a moderate Arab

245
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,440
'and you won't join us, we will let loose
the truly talented murderers.'

246
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,102
Men like Abu Hamza.

247
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,812
These are operational commanders

248
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,715
who plan, organize, train, brainwash,
preach extreme violence.

249
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,512
These are the men we're fighting.

250
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,715
Duly noted.

251
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,685
Anything else?

252
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,317
Now, as far as the public's concerned

253
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:55,022
let's try to view this
through F.B.I. agents' eyes.

254
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,122
Is that clear?

255
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:03,931
Sir, how do you suppose this is viewed
through F.B.I. agents' eyes?

256
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,334
Pardon me?

257
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,345
I said, in this situation,
how do you feel this is viewed

258
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,041
through our eyes?

259
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,710
It's a variation of vengeance.

260
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:19,517
When one of your own is killed,
agents lose their analytical skills.

261
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,615
Kind of like a...

262
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,319
Thirty-six hours.

263
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,695
We don't do it in 36 hours,
we can forget it.

264
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,790
Agent Fleury, Agent Mayes,

265
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,693
I appreciate your passion.
Quite spirited.

266
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,331
If you were running the F.B.I.,
you might turn it into Patton's Third Army.

267
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,272
Might be a good idea,
I don't know.

268
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,721
My daddy used to fly a helicopter
up in Saudi Arabia.

269
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,415
Is that right?
Now, where would he sit?

270
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,458
Would he sit either here,
or would he sit over there?

271
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,390
No, he used to sit right here.

272
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,757
And you want to know a secret?

273
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,022
What?

274
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,724
My daddy died in Saudi Arabia.

275
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,334
Yeah. Your daddy died in Saudi Arabia.

276
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,796
You know your daddy was my friend, right?

277
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,239
Yeah.

278
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,105
So that means that now you're my friend.

279
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,405
Yeah.

280
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,382
So, since we're friends
you promise to take me flying

281
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,452
- when you know how to fly this helicopter?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,849
Good. Good.

283
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,614
What sound does it make
when it takes off?

284
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,346
Yeah.

285
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,952
What about...

286
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,723
Yeah, like that, huh?

287
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,664
That's when it's coming in.

288
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,277
How hard you gonna hit
the Royal Family tomorrow in your column?

289
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:29,147
I'm gonna hit them
with a fucking sledgehammer.

290
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,553
The bombings or other things?

291
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,613
What's other than the bombings?

292
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:36,386
I know you've been tracking
our investigation on Al-Haramain, right?

293
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,021
Yeah. Royal Family's donations
that end up blowing shit up.

294
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,396
Yeah. Seat's taken.

295
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,096
I need a favor.

296
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,467
I don't do favors, Ronnie.

297
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,837
Listen, Elaine, when this thing breaks
and it's gonna be real,

298
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,932
I'm gonna bring it to you first.

299
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,034
I'm listening.

300
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,640
I need you to call Thamer at the Embassy,

301
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,442
tell him that the F.B.I. is getting ready

302
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,679
to lay out major Saudi VIP indictments
dealing with charity financing

303
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,516
out of this Boston investment firm.
We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash

304
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,283
and roll out some
hardcore embarrassment.

305
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,416
And you tell them
I'm heading up the investigation.

306
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,050
And I'm not the nicest kid 
on the block.

307
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,116
That's accurate.

308
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,857
And all I need is 15 minutes tonight.

309
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:13,988
Tonight?

310
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,259
Come on. Exclusive.

311
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,358
I know you like exclusives.

312
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,264
I'll see what I can do.

313
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:31,006
Your Excellency,
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

314
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,642
- Listen, can we talk inside?
- Sure.

315
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,846
There's too many people in there
that know both me and you.

316
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,118
I would like to keep this
as discreet as possible.

317
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,555
I know you have a busy schedule.
It's just, so many people in there.

318
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,118
Why don't we pull up here and talk?

319
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,235
I had an interesting conversation
with a reporter from the Post.

320
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:56,000
She exaggerates a lot of things.
Me, I consider myself a friend.

321
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,737
A friend of Saudi Arabia.

322
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,937
I just need a little cooperation,
that's all.

323
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,812
What kind of cooperation?

324
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,211
Like clearance to land

325
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,408
on the Prince Sultan's airport tomorrow.

326
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,748
One month would be as soon as we could.

327
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,122
One month. This is gonna go down 
one of two ways.

328
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,158
One, the F.B.I. has evidence that
two Royal Family wives donated

329
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,990
$10 million to three
Arab-American cultural centers

330
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,495
right outside of Boston,

331
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,929
and that some of that money
got to Jakarta

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
and these mosques, 
and they have training camps right next to them.

333
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,130
It's just weird to see little kids playing

334
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,297
and then not-so-little kids
playing with guns right next door.

335
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,103
It's just odd.
Don't you think?

336
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:33,404
You have no proof of this.

337
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,537
How do you know?

338
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,577
It's gonna be big.
It's gonna be a big story.

339
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,052
I mean, it's not just gonna be
in the metro papers.

340
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,249
It's gonna be in the Omaha Herald,
places like the Terrell Tribune.

341
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,018
You, you ever been to Terrell, Texas?

342
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,821
Good chili.

343
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,156
What is your point?

344
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,096
I want in immediately.

345
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,663
Define immediately.

346
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,462
Right the fuck now immediately.

347
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,071
So, what was Fran Manner to her?

348
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,214
He taught her how to shoot.

349
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,243
She introduced him to his wife.

350
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,921
And he got her into the Bureau.

351
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,016
They celebrated her graduation
at the IHOP

352
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,322
until some townie called Janet something.

353
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,124
I don't know,
something not very nice.

354
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,290
So the townie didn't see Fran
coming out of the head,

355
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:33,029
but he definitely felt
Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw.

356
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,367
Really? 
And he didn't get bounced for that?

357
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,135
No. No, Fleury took care of it.

358
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,579
Yeah, I do know the post in Riyadh 
was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.

359
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:46,275
Thank you. Janet, 
what did Fleury whisper to you this morning?

360
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:53,380
Grant's age is a liability.

361
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,790
- Hey.
- Hello, sir.

362
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,851
Thanks for volunteering.

363
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,123
Yeah, actually I didn't.

364
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,221
Well, thank you, anyway.

365
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,357
We're going to Riyadh?
Is that right?

366
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,095
- State Department said yes?
- Nope.

367
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,158
White House?

368
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,727
Nope.

369
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,604
- We bringing security?
- No.

370
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,904
This is really gonna suck,
I think.

371
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,104
All right, 
well that's very questionable.

372
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,840
Dog giving birth.
'Whelp.'

373
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,903
W-H-E-L-P-S? Whelps?

374
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,109
Yeah.

375
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,482
Bitch giving birth.
Whelp. Next word.

376
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,349
A dog giving birth.

377
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,445
Right on.

378
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,581
Is that what you thought it meant?

379
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,089
I know what it means.

380
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,180
That's why I played it.

381
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,557
And you didn't think it was
a hit and a scream.

382
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,825
Like a 'welt' and a 'yelp'?

383
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:35,058
Yeah.

384
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,030
I don't have much here,
don't worry about it.

385
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,503
Hey, what are four people supposed to do

386
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,005
over there in five days, anyway?

387
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,633
Aren't you the one that practically demanded 
we go this morning?

388
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,700
I didn't say 'I.'
I said 'F.B.I.'

389
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,767
Let's go.

390
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,871
I got it, I got it!

391
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,209
Here it comes.

392
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,476
False alarm.

393
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,183
What's it like over there
on the ground?

394
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,655
It's a bit like Mars.

395
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,950
- Mars?
- Yeah.

396
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,357
Sounds like I didn't pack right.

397
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:08,021
Well, I will be looked at with disdain
for pretty much the entire time

398
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,658
we're on the ground.
Kind of like South Virginia.

399
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,100
Hey. Go easy on my kin.

400
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,998
Man, it feels like you got
a beast in there, Fleury.

401
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,270
What is it?
You don't think I'm okay?

402
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,571
I think you're not
entirely clear right now.

403
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,280
Look, you want to go?
We go. I got you.

404
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,581
But you got to check yourself.

405
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,548
I'm checked.

406
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:16,882
Okay. I'm just checking
that you're checked.

407
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:30,199
You know, I got 15 ties
in my closet from Fran.

408
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:33,211
- Every Christmas, he'd give me these ties.
- My God.

409
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,070
Fran sent you ties?
He sent me ties, too.

410
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:35,980
Ties, yeah. Really?

411
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,877
At least 12, 13 of them.

412
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,109
Some of the ugliest ties
I've ever seen in...

413
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:42,152
- Hey, good-looking ties.
- What?

414
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,677
Very colorful.
I go fishing with those ties.

415
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:49,122
I'll take you shopping with me sometime.
I'll show you style.

416
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,455
You'll show me style?

417
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,927
You gotta get your L.L. Bean on.

418
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:54,963
You got to? You probably buy your car batteries 
and your shirts in the same place.

419
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,665
That's good. That's good.

420
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,591
Colonel Al Ghazi.

421
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,100
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

422
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,004
Special Agent Mayes. Special Agent Sykes.
Special Agent Leavitt.

423
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,937
- You have your vests?
- Excuse me?

424
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,238
Vests. You know, stop bullets.
The vests.

425
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,402
Bullet-proof vests.

426
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,469
Yeah, we, we brought them.
We're good, thanks.

427
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:19,641
Good. I will ask for
your passports and weapons.

428
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:29,347
Sykes.

429
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,818
What?

430
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:36,855
Fuck.

431
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:42,696
There is an Israeli stamp in here.
Is that a problem?

432
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,771
I've been to Israel three times.

433
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,573
Got a grandma there.
Is that all right?

434
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,104
It's okay.

435
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,183
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Your two fallen comrades.

436
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,391
If you please go to the second vehicle.

437
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,981
It's like 150 miles an hour.

438
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,316
You, like, 
doing like a breathing thing?

439
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:33,447
Like a yoga technique or something?

440
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,048
Do you have a problem with this?
Take the iPod.

441
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,059
Yeah, I have a problem.
I wish that I was as calm as you are.

442
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,028
- I like it.
- If somebody was tailing us,

443
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,256
they'd stick out.

444
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,229
Standard operation speed.

445
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,466
Hey, explain to the driver
I get carsick.

446
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,938
You've got to shut up.

447
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,908
You ever been to the U.S., Colonel?

448
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,001
Yeah, I have been there once.

449
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:56,941
I spent four days in Quantico.

450
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,711
I also saw Michael Jordan play
for the Washington Wizards.

451
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,309
Hey, Colonel, your people got
portable lights on the scene?

452
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,413
Portable lights?

453
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,683
So we can work at night.

454
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,849
- See what we're doing.
- Lights, yes.

455
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,952
We have portable lights.
But your team cannot work at night.

456
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,622
Why? We only got seven days.
We work around the clock.

457
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,189
Five, Mister. You have five days,
and you're not safe at night.

458
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,496
We're safe during the day, huh?

459
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,299
Listen, were the uniformed bombers
brother soldiers?

460
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:23,930
I don't know.

461
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,272
Driver, are we late or something?
Is there a...

462
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,811
Abu Hamza.

463
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,580
You think he was responsible
for these attacks?

464
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,544
I don't know.

465
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:40,783
You don't know
the source of the blast.

466
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,883
You don't know
if there was uniformed officers.

467
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,656
Listen, Mister, Special Agent Fleury.

468
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:48,526
Forty-seven of my men were blown 
into hundreds of pieces.

469
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,190
That will take months
to collect them.

470
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,236
Eighty thousands of officers
across all the country.

471
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:56,329
Thousands of people
that can forge identity.

472
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,309
I apologize. I'm very sorry
I don't have definitive answers.

473
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,607
Hey, driver, driver, driver!

474
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:13,480
It's a camel.

475
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,389
That's, well, it's good practice, huh?

476
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,292
Maybe slower,
next time we'll recognize livestock.

477
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,359
Okay. The bathroom through that door.

478
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,874
We tried to give you some privacy.

479
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:07,567
Actually, I want to put you in the bathroom,

480
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,807
but if it's okay with you this. So...

481
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,640
And we try to find something pink

482
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,185
but I wish it will make the job.

483
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,086
Okay, tomorrow we will start working.

484
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:20,850
I will come in the morning.

485
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,025
See you tomorrow.

486
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,253
- Al Ghazi.
- Yeah?

487
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,318
Exactly what time are you coming tomorrow?

488
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,023
- Sunrise.
- Okay.

489
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,463
What time is sunrise?

490
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,667
Excuse me!
What time is sunrise?

491
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,096
When I open this door.
Good night.

492
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,738
That's against fire code.

493
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,507
They don't have fire codes here, Sykes.

494
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,570
You're in the jungle now, baby.
Look sharp.

495
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,278
Axl, do you have any more lollipops?
Blood sugar's a little low.

496
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,483
Don't cross this pink line.
Stay back.

497
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,717
You're real butch after a long flight.

498
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,157
'Contrary to
the State Department policy,

499
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:59,092
'the F.B.I. has sent
an investigative team

500
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:03,065
'to Saudi Arabia. In so doing,
I have come before this committee

501
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:07,194
'with a painful admission.
I've lost all confidence in the F.B.I.

502
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,073
'Especially its uppermost echelon.'

503
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,471
That's you, baby.

504
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,570
'Entrenched and outmoded,
the leadership has shown itself fearful

505
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:21,777
'of the pioneering thoughts this committee
and I have tried to imbue.

506
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,149
'It is thus an agency at contretemps
hindering our every effort.'

507
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:32,392
And by 'committee,'

508
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,995
I mean the fucking
Senate Select Committee on Terror.

509
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,762
So you're going before
the Senate Select Committee

510
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,997
and not to the President
who appointed you.

511
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,506
Why is that?

512
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,536
I bet the President wasn't
the audience you thought he'd be.

513
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,370
I'll bet the President realized
that you can't have voters asking

514
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:53,439
why the second longest-serving
F.B.I. Director got fired for doing his job.

515
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:57,817
For sending agents to Saudi Arabia just
seven months before mid-term elections.

516
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:59,549
So you want to bet?

517
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,490
Mister Attorney General,
I obviously already have.

518
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,715
I bet my job.

519
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,024
I'm gonna bury you.

520
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:11,432
You know, Westmoreland made all of us officers 
write our own obituaries during Tet.

521
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,863
When we thought the Cong 
were gonna end it all right there.

522
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:17,839
And once we clued in
to the fact that life is finite,

523
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,239
the thought of losing it
didn't scare us anymore.

524
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,840
The end comes no matter what.

525
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,713
The only thing that matters is
how do you want to go out?

526
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,718
On your feet or on your knees?

527
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,945
I bring that lesson to this job.

528
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:37,820
I act knowing that someday this job will end, 
no matter what.

529
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,664
You should do the same.

530
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,788
Which one of you is Ronald Fleury?

531
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,998
Damon Schmidt, State Department.

532
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,969
I'm here to make sure
that you get out of here okay.

533
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,569
- Is this your team right here?
- Yes. All three of them.

534
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,609
Hey, everybody, you're gonna need these.
Electrolytes.

535
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,407
Good to see you.
Some electrolytes for you.

536
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,043
Take that.
You don't want to drop in this heat.

537
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,414
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

538
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,475
My boss hates you.

539
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,678
He's furious.

540
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,279
When you get back home, you're done.

541
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:15,650
If you make it back home.
Now here comes the Prince.

542
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,253
You hold onto his hand and you make sure
you don't let go of it until he does, okay?

543
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,760
That's good.
We got to dial down the boobies.

544
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,994
We need to cover these situations.

545
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,136
No verbal response.

546
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:28,999
All right, everybody,
here we go.

547
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,836
Your Excellency,
Special Agent Fleury

548
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,968
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and his colleagues.

549
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:58,027
You will honor me with
your presence tomorrow at my home.

550
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,701
I'll tell you why this is a win.
You documented it and you're still alive.

551
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,643
I got a plane.
It's fueled up,

552
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:12,306
it's ready to go,
it's got your name on it.

553
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,111
You guys want to go,
let's do it.

554
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,812
You talk a lot.
A little too much.

555
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:20,022
You wearing a vest?

556
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,616
You got nothing.
You got nothing, big boy.

557
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,321
- You want to tighten up the Kevlar. Okay?
- All right. 

558
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,386
Offer still stands.
I'm always ready to go.

559
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,175
So what'd the Prince say?

560
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,007
That there are more rules
than just not working at night.

561
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,171
Rules? What rules?

562
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,909
It's a slow roll.

563
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,641
This whole trip's gonna be
like deep sea fishing in Florida.

564
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,483
We need more security here
before we go on.

565
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,489
Are you fucking kidding me?
You got a fucking army.

566
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,323
I'm not kidding you, okay?
And don't talk to me with this language.

567
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,922
You pay 700 bucks for a boat,
sit on your can out in the ocean.

568
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:06,560
Crew jumps around, screams, points,
throws out fish bait, you catch nothing.

569
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,796
Okay, let's go inside now, please.

570
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,155
This is the kind of radical circumstance

571
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,352
that could have seriously upped
Shaq's free throw percentages.

572
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,952
I mean, you take a man,
you ship him off to Riyadh.

573
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,965
- Grant.
- No cell phones, no girls, no booze.

574
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,395
Look at this website.

575
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:38,764
Nothing but being locked in a gym.

576
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,267
He could have been shooting,
what, 70, 80 percent?

577
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,507
Lakers would still be together.
Kobe and Shaq, lovers forever.

578
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,709
I don't know about that part.
Kobe's a hater.

579
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,805
Fleury, come here and look at this.

580
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,173
It's a website that went up
about a half hour ago,

581
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,014
Al Saha dot something.

582
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,188
They so love to flaunt their work.

583
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,696
Time to go.

584
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,703
You won't need your gear.
Not yet.

585
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:17,531
That's what I thought.

586
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,638
The remaining rules.

587
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,072
You cannot touch evidence,
please leave it.

588
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,774
You cannot question anyone 
without me present,

589
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:29,216
touch a dead Muslim,
or leave my sight at any time.

590
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,549
Your safety is my primary concern.

591
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,222
I thought your primary concern
would be the investigation.

592
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,021
And you would be mistaken.

593
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,689
I think this is one of those
'something happens to us,

594
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,457
'his head comes off' kind of deals.

595
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,760
You're our babysitter, right?

596
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,664
We call that a babysitter.

597
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,862
Yeah. Who's running the investigation?

598
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,369
General Abdulmalik.

599
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,872
He has given us permission 
to walk through the crime scene.

600
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,964
- Walk through? Shit.
- Walk through?

601
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,031
You kidding me?

602
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:54,944
- Where are you going, Mr. Fleury?
- You're not in charge.

603
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,739
I'm gonna go find somebody that's in charge, 
so I can get

604
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,213
some clarification on what's going on.

605
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,647
Okay, there is nothing to clarify.

606
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,911
Yes, the hell there is!
You think I flew over here for 18 hours,

607
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,475
and you gonna tell us we can walk through?

608
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,418
I don't know what kind of game you playing.
I'm not that guy!

609
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,616
Listen. 
This is not a game show, Mr. Fleury.

610
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,352
And definitely there are no deals made here.

611
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:14,223
There is me telling you
what you may or may not do.

612
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,491
And there is you doing it.

613
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,796
- You gonna tell me what to do.
- That's it.

614
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,835
You will be permitted to
walk through the crime scene

615
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,532
when we determine it is safe,
that's it.

616
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,301
Any questions?

617
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,238
By the way,
I don't like your jokes.

618
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,379
What about witnesses?

619
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,419
The witnesses?

620
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,753
So you haven't interviewed
the witnesses?

621
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:43,450
Not yet.

622
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,755
Can we do that?

623
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,437
We didn't really see anything.

624
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,916
It was so fast and so loud.

625
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,413
So nobody saw anything?

626
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,649
I hit the deck.
The place was going Rambo.

627
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,315
Guns, guns, guns.

628
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:17,018
We went into our safe room.

629
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:18,924
- Safe room, what's that?
- That room right there.

630
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:24,193
Earl got an allowance of about $15,000
when we moved here to build it.

631
00:43:26,102 --> 00:43:29,969
We stayed in here,
till we heard the screams.

632
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,441
Yeah, those kids were screaming,
all right.

633
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,010
That's what got me out of the house. 
Them kids.

634
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,271
Which kids are those?

635
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,249
Tracy Jackson.
She lived next door.

636
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,077
She was murdered looking out of her own window, 
in front of her children.

637
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,488
Jacksons didn't have a safe room.

638
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,592
Mr. Jackson?

639
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,038
Mr. Jackson. Aaron Jackson?

640
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,135
Yeah.

641
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,405
You keep him away from me!

642
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,846
Hold on, hold on.

643
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,042
Special Agent F.B.I. Ronald Fleury.

644
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:16,477
You know what?

645
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,247
- That's... 
- Whoa, whoa.

646
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,249
They're the ones that attacked us.

647
00:44:20,323 --> 00:44:21,722
We don't know that just yet.

648
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,156
That's what I'm here for.

649
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,990
I just need to ask the boys
some questions about maybe something

650
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,290
that they saw the other night.

651
00:44:27,363 --> 00:44:29,159
What do you want to ask my boys
about the other night?

652
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,029
I told you...

653
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,158
What do you want to ask them about?

654
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:34,396
You want to ask them about
watching their mother bleed to death?

655
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,871
Is that what you want to ask my boys?

656
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,007
My 5-year-old boy, when I got home,
had a box of Band-Aids

657
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,344
and he was trying to put
his mama's mouth back on.

658
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:51,978
Is this what Mohammed the prophet...

659
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:53,317
Oh, come on, man,
let's not have a fight.

660
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,152
- Is this what Allah wants?
- You know that, this isn't...

661
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,452
This isn't gonna bring your wife back.

662
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:58,824
Does Allah love your kids
more than he does mine?

663
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:01,693
Does Allah love your wife
more than he does mine?

664
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,258
Leave me the fuck alone
and do not come back to my house!

665
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,891
I'll leave you alone, but just...

666
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,663
I should have went home
a long goddamn time ago!

667
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,376
This is the big explosion.

668
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,911
About one hour into the rescue.

669
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,509
Where did the water come from?

670
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,046
They hit a water main?

671
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,103
Water main?

672
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,341
Yeah, where'd the water come from?

673
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,008
From a water pipe?
They break one?

674
00:45:55,085 --> 00:46:00,647
No, it's from the tanks
of this fire engine.

675
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:05,055
This is the water that didn't,
how you say it, evaporate in the blast.

676
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:06,959
This truck used to be here?

677
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,395
We think so.

678
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:14,161
This hole is the case.
Your men are contaminating this.

679
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:18,464
You understand evidence?
Little things that are clues.

680
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:22,169
Clues can be very helpful
to a fellow trying to solve a crime.

681
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,470
You want to go into the hole?

682
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:25,775
Yeah! Absolutely.

683
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,175
No.

684
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,685
All right.

685
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,147
Who was running security?

686
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,317
Security here is a combination of police

687
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,794
and National Guards of...

688
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,690
Mr. Sykes! Please come back.

689
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,600
Please.

690
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:07,783
This vehicle was stolen.

691
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,019
A team outside the blast radius,
shooting at anything, everyone.

692
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,788
Sergeant Haytham ended this part.

693
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:25,771
Were any of the shooters your men?
Real Saudi police?

694
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,207
No, they weren't.

695
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,644
Nice work.

696
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:42,452
There were two officers in the car.
Both of them were executed.

697
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,865
And those were your men.
I'm sorry.

698
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,095
Car was parked here,
backed in?

699
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:56,263
Yes.

700
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,528
They were attacked from the front,

701
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,575
so they must have assumed
they were fellow officers.

702
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,735
These guys been identified yet?

703
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,246
Not yet. It's likely that the four men
prayed in the same mosque.

704
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,803
That's enough to identify them?

705
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:06,940
If it's in Suweidi, yes.

706
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,041
Suweidi?

707
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,018
Suweidi's a known militant stronghold.

708
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,747
Al Qaeda could recruit from the storefronts.

709
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,812
Is there any way we can check out
those surrounding buildings.

710
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,619
Like especially that one right there.

711
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:17,260
- Why?
- From the posting on the Internet

712
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,419
the attack was filmed from a high vantage point

713
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,259
and that building right there
looks over the whole crime scene.

714
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:23,798
It's outside the walls.

715
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,163
Come on now,
this is damn insane.

716
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,635
We got enough security to
invade North Korea and Suweidi...

717
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,604
You don't know
what you are talking about.

718
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:31,071
Can we just ask?

719
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,102
Okay.

720
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,408
All right. 
We'll be in the Community Center.

721
00:48:55,465 --> 00:49:01,130
How many virgins 
will be available to you upon entry

722
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:07,802
into the afterlife here, 
if you follow what the zealots follow in this stuff?

723
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,406
Seventy.

724
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,078
That's incorrect.

725
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,862
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

726
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,668
I'm in Saudi Arabia.

727
00:50:40,736 --> 00:50:42,636
Yeah, you remember
where I showed you on the map?

728
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,633
Well, right now I'm sitting
in the gym-slash-hotel.

729
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,874
What? 
Yeah, Fran is, Fran's around.

730
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,751
We, we... 
Yeah, I saw him.

731
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,091
He is...
He's, he's tall as ever.

732
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,757
Yeah, and we're looking for the bad guy.

733
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,592
And I'm gonna get some sleep.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed.

734
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,992
I love you, too.
All right, bye.

735
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:39,224
We have permission.

736
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,484
Really?

737
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,588
Yeah.

738
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,318
- There's the building. That's the rooftop.
- Yeah.

739
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,271
We have a problem.

740
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,681
What's the problem?

741
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,508
Hey! Hey! Hey!

742
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,105
All right, easy, easy, easy.
Fleury, stop Fleury. Careful. Leave it!

743
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,215
Fuck! Al Ghazi!

744
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,823
Tell me he didn't blow out my eardrum.

745
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:16,880
Is it fucking bleeding?

746
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,324
It's all right.
There's no blood.

747
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:27,317
Come on, you okay? Let's get up.
Janet, you okay? Let's get up.

748
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,841
- Are you okay?
- Come on, Janet.

749
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,581
- Are you okay?
- No, are you okay? He slapped you.

750
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,738
- I'm good. I'm good. 
- You sure?

751
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:39,941
- Thanks. Okay.
- Let me look at you.

752
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,004
Thank you.

753
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,608
All right.
Come on, let's go up.

754
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,517
Fleury, look at this.

755
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,998
There's the front gate,
the police car and the bomb site.

756
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,660
And look.
That's about the same angle, right?

757
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,135
Yeah. Al Ghazi, 
have you seen the video on Al Saha?

758
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,241
Look. Look right through there.
Same exact thing.

759
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,370
This is too pretty of a plan
to be hatched in just one day.

760
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,745
He had to come here a couple of times.

761
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,045
This man is a Saudi.

762
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,282
See, if foreigners were here,

763
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,486
someone would say something.

764
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,889
- So maybe Abu Hamza?
- Could be.

765
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,823
Yeah. Then we should ask around.
Get out of here and some people...

766
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:26,485
They won't tell you anything.

767
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:27,654
Why not?

768
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,255
He's like Robin Hood to you.

769
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,294
People feel sympathy to him.

770
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,768
Well, we know two things.

771
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,896
We know he was Saudi,
we know he was here.

772
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,496
That's two big answers
in two minutes.

773
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:39,200
Imagine if we had a couple of days.

774
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,266
General Malik, 
he's got his heart in the right place,

775
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:43,811
but he is clearly not an investigator.

776
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,313
Now listen.
Let me help you.

777
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,118
It's a detonator. Where you...

778
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,585
Yeah, it's a gift from us to you.

779
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:54,316
We found it at the bomb site.
Run with that.

780
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,688
- Leavitt!
- Yeah?

781
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,494
Hey, where,
where are you going?

782
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,757
You got a lot of evidence here.
We'd like to bag it.

783
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,093
No, no we have five minutes...

784
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,101
Fucking bullshit.
We're here to collect evidence.

785
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,465
Why you say this bad word?

786
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,026
We're not fucking tourists here, 
all right.

787
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:10,196
Why you say these bad words?

788
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,739
I'm getting the kit.
Fleury, talk to this guy.

789
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,828
I would bring a soap
and wash your mouth!

790
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:14,811
What do you think?

791
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,438
Leavitt!

792
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,482
Yeah, it's Leavitt,
not Livette.

793
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,040
I'm not a goddamn French-Canadian.

794
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:28,990
Tonight we have the dinner
in the palace.

795
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,922
Miss Mayes, she can't be there.

796
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,454
- It's only men.
- Only men?

797
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,057
Yeah, you know, tradition.

798
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,896
That's gonna be boring.
No women?

799
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,129
No. Just men.

800
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,465
No women allowed. All right.

801
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,903
- Only men.
- Yeah.

802
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,337
- You wait.
- No.

803
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:48,274
Janet. 
He wants to tell you something.

804
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,911
What?

805
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,610
How's your ear? It is good?

806
00:55:56,485 --> 00:55:58,680
It's the right one or the left?

807
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:21,495
How many princes are there?

808
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:22,799
Over 5,000.

809
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,463
Does every prince get a palace this big?

810
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,940
Some get bigger.

811
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,441
And who pays for all this?

812
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,773
Exxon? Chevron? Shell?

813
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,679
Serious now, 
the Prince will talk to you like subjects.

814
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:36,740
If he gives you to hold his raptor, 
do not flinch.

815
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:38,115
It is a compliment.

816
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,950
His what? Hold his rapture?

817
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,253
His talons slice bones.

818
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,121
That right?

819
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,054
That's my most prolific hunter.

820
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,859
I try to teach his friend over there,

821
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,495
but I fear it is something
you are born with or not.

822
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,696
You agree, Mr. Ronald?

823
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,070
Innate or not at all?

824
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,200
I do.

825
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:02,905
What have you seen so far 
in our kingdom?

826
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,436
I know that I can arrange a safari
for you and your colleagues.

827
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:08,875
Safari?

828
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,680
Well...

829
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,596
I'll tell you what I've seen.
I've seen...

830
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,203
I've seen that the man that planned
the worst crime in your kingdom's history

831
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,674
is without a doubt Saudi.

832
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,749
If you walk three kilometers
from the compound,

833
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:45,313
you will find the rooftop
where the attacks were planned.

834
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:48,714
I've seen a person in this room
who's 'born with it.'

835
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:53,657
Colonel Al Ghazi. Everything that I'm telling you 
Mr. Al Ghazi told us

836
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,730
while he was observing the crime scenes
and protecting us.

837
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,288
He wasn't even on duty.

838
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,394
So I agree with you that instincts like 
this cannot be taught.

839
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,633
Not to falcons,
and definitely not to SANG generals.

840
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,632
I know you want him caught.
We want him caught.

841
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,735
So let us help you.

842
00:59:10,812 --> 00:59:14,111
America's not perfect, not at all,
I'll be the first to say that,

843
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:16,241
but we are good at this.

844
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,119
Allow us to help your men
go catch this criminal.

845
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,370
The rules for tonight still stand,

846
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,734
but tomorrow is a new day.

847
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,830
All right, Ghazi.

848
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,998
Look at you Mr. Al Ghazi.

849
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,871
- Coming through.
- You feeling your power, huh?

850
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:42,678
- Yeah, of course.
- You feel his power? He's real powerful.

851
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,837
We made a success tonight,
correct or not?

852
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:45,902
We need to party.

853
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,004
Okay.

854
01:00:06,134 --> 01:00:07,624
Okay. Give him half, you keep half.

855
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,068
Tell him pass them out
around the compound,

856
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,128
see if they recognize anything.

857
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:14,702
Let's go.

858
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,891
Need a little check? Huh?

859
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:35,963
You big queer.
I can... Never mind.

860
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,634
Gonna have to get a little dirty, people.

861
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,203
Yeah, you got to get dirty.
Nasty, filthy!

862
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,373
All right, fellows, what we need to do 
is get this water out of here.

863
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,446
So we can see what's really 
going on down here.

864
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,048
You understand?

865
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,384
See, something drivable blew up.

866
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:13,527
Let's dry up this hole to see
if we can't figure out what she was.

867
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,394
All right?

868
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,704
Who's got a pump?

869
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:21,970
Pump?

870
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,069
Yeah, a pump.
Pump out the water.

871
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,536
You cannot touch any Muslim.

872
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,401
So tell me what to do,
I'll do it.

873
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,941
Yeah, come over here then.
Take this.

874
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,402
- This finger also? I push it?
- Yes, please.

875
01:01:57,946 --> 01:02:00,915
Really clean on the...
That's what's important.

876
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,212
Okay. Good. The non-Muslim bodies,
where are they?

877
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,222
We have them in the next tent.

878
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,554
I need to see them.

879
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,326
Just take a look at these and see 
if you recognize any of them please.

880
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:18,059
Oh, those are horrible.

881
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,664
No, I'm sorry,
I don't recognize either of them.

882
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,402
You know, that chair outside
looks like it gets a lot of wear.

883
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:28,876
It looks comfortable.

884
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,775
Yeah, it is.
That's my mom's chair.

885
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,173
She spends a lot of time out there?

886
01:02:32,247 --> 01:02:33,475
Yeah, all day.

887
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:36,210
All day, huh? Where is she?

888
01:02:36,518 --> 01:02:38,212
She's sleeping now.

889
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,981
Then let's wake her up.

890
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:41,478
I've seen him.

891
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:42,581
When?

892
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,283
Like a week ago.

893
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,330
Twice, I've seen him
watering with the garden crews.

894
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:50,694
And I thought that was funny.

895
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,926
Funny how?

896
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,833
He was a Saudi, I'm pretty sure.
The gardener.

897
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,866
- Yeah?
- Well, Saudis, like Americans

898
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,842
don't do manual labor.

899
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,175
Blowing leaves is beneath them.

900
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:47,014
The gardener. We know who he is.
I want to take you somewhere.

901
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,077
Where?

902
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,387
Someone who can lead us
to catch the big dogs.

903
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:52,483
More like the big fish.

904
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:53,585
Big fish?

905
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,494
Yeah, big fish.

906
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:02,364
A dog... A dog is more bigger
than a fish.

907
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,765
Yeah, I don't...
I didn't make it up.

908
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:16,478
Don't count on me
to do the things I've done before

909
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,550
So why'd you get into this,
Al Ghazi?

910
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,683
Into what?

911
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,988
Being a cop. 
Why'd you get into being a cop?

912
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:28,723
I mean, with all this violence and chaos, 
it seems so crazy.

913
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,731
It's because of...

914
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:34,466
- The Green Beast.
- The what?

915
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,696
The Green Beast.

916
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:36,998
What the hell is the Green Beast?

917
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:39,563
It's a TV show when I was kid.

918
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:41,609
You know, a man who turns green

919
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:44,077
when he's very angry,
he turns green and...

920
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,339
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, the Hulk.

921
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:50,077
Yeah, you know. He was killing just bad people, 
because they did wrong.

922
01:04:50,151 --> 01:04:53,848
Yeah. Yeah, 'Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.'

923
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,217
Ah, you know also Steve Austin?

924
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,259
Yeah, Six Million Dollar Man!

925
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,227
Now, that's my shit.
That's my shit.

926
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,320
What? You need bathroom, you mean?

927
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,455
No, no, no.

928
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,293
- I can stop here if you want.
- No, no, no.

929
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:09,165
Cause when those lights go on at night

930
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,604
And light up the playgrounds then

931
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,090
Sir? Thank you.

932
01:06:31,786 --> 01:06:33,447
Something cooking.

933
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,074
That's a gurney.

934
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,008
Son of a bitch.

935
01:06:57,579 --> 01:07:00,515
Oh, God. You know what 
those sons of bitches did?

936
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:03,077
They blew up an ambulance.

937
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,087
Oh, man. Now that is nasty!

938
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,856
Low-down.

939
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,787
I'm 42 years old.

940
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,192
I have two daughters and a son.

941
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:20,624
Beautiful son.

942
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,535
And I find myself in a place
where I no longer care

943
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,732
about why we are attacked.

944
01:07:25,807 --> 01:07:30,710
I only care that 100 people woke up 
a few mornings ago,

945
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,839
had no idea it was their last.

946
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,745
When we catch the man
who murdered these people,

947
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,581
I don't care to ask even one question.

948
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,614
I want to kill him.

949
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,060
Do you understand?

950
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,065
Yes, I do.

951
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:01,375
So, is your first name Colonel?

952
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,033
What?

953
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,444
Your first name.
What's your first name?

954
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:06,972
Faris.

955
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:08,140
Faris.

956
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,241
Yeah.

957
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:10,682
Officer Faris.

958
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,224
Friend, hold up!

959
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:34,700
Shit. Give me that shovel.

960
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,537
Oh, we got something good, man.

961
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,943
That grapple?

962
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,611
Get the keys to it.
I need it down here.

963
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,455
Thanks, bud.

964
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,954
See that man, through the window?

965
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,222
Yeah.

966
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,489
Izz Al Din.

967
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,262
He joined bin Laden when Al Qaeda 
brought the fight to the Royal Family.

968
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:35,236
- Does he know where bin Laden is?
- No, no, no, no, no.

969
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,770
'Cause that'd be a real big promotion for me, 
if I could get that one.

970
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,172
He turned himself in last year
during an amnesty.

971
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:45,508
He's now part of a new government effort,
to balance the experience of Saudi youth.

972
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,816
- Oh, he's doing community service.
- Yes.

973
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,781
- Okay.
- Yes.

974
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:40,096
The man who made war on Al Rahmah 
is someone his age.

975
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:51,234
A man who can plan mass murder
of women and children

976
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:53,212
and then go home and sleep soundly,

977
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:56,444
that kind of man 
is supremely difficult to catch.

978
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,109
How does he know he slept soundly?

979
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:04,887
Because he hasn't stopped.

980
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:13,596
You stop only when dead faces
don't let you sleep.

981
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:14,930
Is that why you quit?

982
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,602
Seventeen days without sleep
will make you quit anything.

983
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,324
American military detonator.

984
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,519
Yeah.

985
01:11:39,694 --> 01:11:40,991
How would they get it?

986
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,827
There are several ways to get
this military equipment.

987
01:11:51,906 --> 01:11:53,533
But not everyone can get it.

988
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,133
Could Abu Hamza get 'em?

989
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,247
Absolutely, yes.

990
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,458
Then ask him if he knows
where I can find Abu Hamza.

991
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,297
Did you say something funny?
'Cause I didn't say something funny.

992
01:12:18,366 --> 01:12:21,061
Abu Hamza, he is like ghost.

993
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:23,025
Abu Hamza like a ghost.

994
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,196
Yeah, I got that.

995
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:26,439
I understood that.

996
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,171
You need...

997
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,802
Yeah, prayers, luck and...

998
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,278
Handshakes.

999
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:45,686
Every bomb maker at some point
gets bitten by his own work.

1000
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,179
Okay, chief.

1001
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,122
It's hospital identification.

1002
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,958
- You know it?
- Yes.

1003
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:24,653
Call it in.

1004
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,700
Look who got the big clue!

1005
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,861
It's some pretty soft skin,
I'll bet you, too.

1006
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,198
You know,
that mud looked pretty good.

1007
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,832
Hey, hey, come on,
that's my only shirt, Grant!

1008
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,474
The ambulance was stolen
from King Fahd Hospital,

1009
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:40,536
three days before the bombing.

1010
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:41,640
Okay.

1011
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:46,346
I got 20 men that rotated shifts
on the stolen ambulance.

1012
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:50,252
One of them is very important.
He's in our interest.

1013
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:54,317
His name is Muaath Al Abdullah.
This is Fahd Al Abdullah, his brother.

1014
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,885
The one that Haytham shot.

1015
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,123
So where's Muaath?

1016
01:13:57,198 --> 01:13:59,496
We are going now there.
Let's go.

1017
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,429
Bring your vests.

1018
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,988
Fingerprints are on the other side.

1019
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:37,860
I'm not looking for fingerprints.

1020
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:39,092
Then what are you doing?

1021
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,566
Fingers.

1022
01:15:55,483 --> 01:15:58,941
Pictures of the compound.
American Embassy.

1023
01:16:05,593 --> 01:16:06,617
Japan.

1024
01:16:06,694 --> 01:16:09,185
It's the Coalition.
All these countries have troops in Iraq.

1025
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,698
This is meaningless, man. 
This is pointless.

1026
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,436
What he say?

1027
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,205
- The Prince.
- Fuck.

1028
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,446
Ghazi.

1029
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:39,816
Was anyone hurt?

1030
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:42,260
No, nothing.
Everything under control.

1031
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,093
- Relax.
- Were there any pictures taken?

1032
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:47,464
No picture. Nothing, the team was safe.
Everything good.

1033
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:49,400
I'm taking them out of here.
They're getting on a plane

1034
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,769
as soon as the Prince leaves, all right?
Where are they right now?

1035
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,830
- They are inside.
- Are they?

1036
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,875
Hello. Yes, sir, everybody's safe.

1037
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,037
No, I'm next to the corpses right now,

1038
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:01,910
but I don't think 
this is the end of this, sir.

1039
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,350
To me this doesn't feel anything 
like senior leadership.

1040
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,442
Yeah.

1041
01:17:06,554 --> 01:17:08,283
Yes, sir, I do. I do.

1042
01:17:08,356 --> 01:17:09,345
Fleury!

1043
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:11,814
Hey.

1044
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,592
- Schmidt, you all right?
- Yeah.

1045
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,761
- You sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

1046
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:26,035
All right.
Don't throw up on your tie.

1047
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,039
- Want some water?
- No, I'm fine.

1048
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,703
- You sure?
- Yes!

1049
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,214
You lucky bastard, Fleury.
Congratulations.

1050
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,307
You won the hand on the river card.

1051
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,476
Schmidt, we didn't win anything.

1052
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:39,985
These are just teenagers.
Kids. Insignificant.

1053
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:44,924
I'm looking at one, two, three,
four bad guys, a whole lot of guns.

1054
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,894
This is good stuff.
You did good. Pack up.

1055
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,590
Revel in the fact that when you get home, 
for a few weeks,

1056
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,633
your shit's not gonna stink.
All right?

1057
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,201
Turn those frowns upside-down, people.

1058
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:03,937
This will be pitched as a stunning
Saudi-only counterpunch,

1059
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,302
killing those responsible
for Al Rahmah.

1060
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:10,613
The Al Jazeera is gonna play up the fact
that there's an F.B.I. presence here.

1061
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:12,546
Hello. Put that down.
Put it down.

1062
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:13,952
Yeah. You got it.

1063
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,752
It's time to go home.
The four of you are on a plane now.

1064
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:19,190
Four vehicles will be left behind
when the Prince and the press leave.

1065
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,751
You'll convoy straight to B.A. Flights
into Dulles.

1066
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,296
Last-minute fares come out
of all your pockets.

1067
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,332
I tried to get you an upgrade.
Doesn't look good.

1068
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,302
Check at the counter. All right?
You guys are heroes. Fly safe.

1069
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,976
I'm going straight
to Diamond Dan's

1070
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,644
and I'm gonna order six P.B.R.'s.

1071
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,383
Pabst, Sykes? Really?

1072
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:49,923
Yeah, first thing.
Best beer on the planet.

1073
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,926
Is that how you get laid? 
You go and you take a couple Pi-Phi's and you...

1074
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:57,129
So, Al Ghazi, what do you think?
What's going on in that head of yours?

1075
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:59,100
- Haytham, you guys drink that stuff, Pabst?
- Amateurs.

1076
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,429
- What is it?
- It's a small win.

1077
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,662
It's beer.

1078
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,500
Reminds me of when they hit the towers,
first time, in '93.

1079
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,436
You remember how they caught the cell?

1080
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:07,599
- Car bomb.
- Yeah.

1081
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,667
He went back to get his deposit 
on the rental car.

1082
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,077
$400. Stupidity.

1083
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,112
Then nine years later
they come back.

1084
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:16,841
I got a feeling I'm coming back too.

1085
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,544
Yes, you will.

1086
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,113
Yes, you will.

1087
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:22,189
I didn't even know
you could still buy that.

1088
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,416
It only comes in keg form, 
doesn't it?

1089
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:24,481
Oh, Schlitz, Pabst, sure.

1090
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,083
Do you think they just hand 
that blue ribbon out? Do you?

1091
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,426
It's not just some cute little name.
It was just Pabst.

1092
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,125
And then they won a ribbon.

1093
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:34,135
- And now it's Pabst Blue Ribbon.
- You ever have canned beer when

1094
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,327
- you're doing sensitive work?
- Haytham?

1095
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,428
You guys have Pabst Blue Ribbon out here?
Oh, you don't even have

1096
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,030
- beer out there.
- No, you can't drink beer.

1097
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,007
- They don't have beer.
- No pork, no beer.

1098
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,737
Yeah, I used to do
keg stands in college.

1099
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,779
Oh, yeah?
Well, what, does that mean that you

1100
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,713
don't like things
that are awarded the blue...

1101
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,245
Brake!

1102
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,565
I'm still locked in.
Get me out.

1103
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,878
- What are they doing? Hold onto him!
- You gotta take that.

1104
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,912
Hey, Leavitt, hold on!
Don't do it!

1105
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,572
Hold on! Hold on!

1106
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,076
Come on, Leavitt, hold on, baby.

1107
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,276
Fuck you!

1108
01:20:57,351 --> 01:20:58,909
I got you!

1109
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,647
Shit!

1110
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,286
Fleury! Fleury! Fleury!

1111
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:10,962
There's more of them!

1112
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,760
Fleury! Fleury!

1113
01:21:32,953 --> 01:21:34,011
Leavitt!

1114
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,025
We gotta move!

1115
01:22:13,193 --> 01:22:15,354
Al Ghazi, you've gotta put your foot
in this motherfucker. Let's go!

1116
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,623
I put it! I putting foot!

1117
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,688
Motherfuckers!
I'm gonna fucking kill them!

1118
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,461
We cannot lose him, you understand?
We can't lose him.

1119
01:22:20,534 --> 01:22:21,558
If we lose him, he's dead.

1120
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:39,841
Give me a MAC. Give me a MAC.

1121
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:40,945
I see it!

1122
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:42,046
There he is right there,
let's go!

1123
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,249
Yes, yes.

1124
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,622
Let's move. Let's move.
Take the left, take the left, take the left.

1125
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,706
- Let's go, let's go, let's move.
- Come on, faster.

1126
01:22:58,806 --> 01:22:59,864
You've lost him!
Damn it, you lost him!

1127
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,033
I have not lost him!
I see him! He is in front!

1128
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,168
There he is, there he is!

1129
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:04,574
Punch it! Punch it, Al Ghazi!

1130
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,145
Watch it, he just turned,
he just turned.

1131
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,953
He's up there.
He's right there, don't lose him.

1132
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,019
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out, watch out!

1133
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,744
Khaled! Khaled!

1134
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,994
- He went to the left!
- Take a left!

1135
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,462
You're gonna lose him!
Do not fucking lose him!

1136
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,411
No, no, it's Suweidi.
This is not good area.

1137
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:24,480
We shouldn't be here.
We shouldn't be here!

1138
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,021
Suburban to the right.

1139
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,737
Mercedes. Mercedes straight ahead.

1140
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:44,502
All right.

1141
01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:46,409
- We're in it, we're in it, we're in it.
- You got it.

1142
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,640
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

1143
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:11,996
Reverse! Reverse!

1144
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:13,973
Move, move, move.

1145
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:31,813
Grenade!

1146
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,086
Cover!

1147
01:26:35,722 --> 01:26:37,246
Move, Al Ghazi!

1148
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,670
- You good?
- I'm good.

1149
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:56,934
Go!

1150
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,631
Cover me!

1151
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,099
There's a blood trail!

1152
01:28:01,174 --> 01:28:04,837
There's a blood trail
going into the building!

1153
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,902
- Are you good?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

1154
01:29:09,976 --> 01:29:10,965
We gotta get backup.

1155
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:12,204
Look, we don't have time.

1156
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,942
We need two to backup here.
The other three go inside.

1157
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,415
- Haytham.
- Okay. You good, Sykes?

1158
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,117
- Yeah, I got backup!
- Go, go.

1159
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,813
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1160
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:22,419
This is very bad neighborhood.

1161
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,219
Yeah, no shit.

1162
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:24,548
Which side of the door
you think Allah is on?

1163
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,377
We are about to find out.

1164
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,491
Fuck!

1165
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:32,305
It's okay! Malesh! Malesh!

1166
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:36,782
Stay here! Malesh! Malesh.
Stay here! Stay here!

1167
01:34:03,036 --> 01:34:05,266
Leavitt! You okay?

1168
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:16,473
Haytham! I got this!

1169
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,575
Go inside and see how they're doing.

1170
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:25,842
You okay?

1171
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:32,558
Oh, I have something.

1172
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,191
Abu Hamza.

1173
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:48,897
Get out!

1174
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:51,500
Put it down! Put it down!

1175
01:36:51,571 --> 01:36:53,232
You put that fucking gun down!

1176
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,638
- Put it down.
- Put that gun down.

1177
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,538
- Put it down!
- Put that fucking gun down!

1178
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:58,804
- Put the fucking gun down right now!
- Put the gun down!

1179
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:02,274
Ali.

1180
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:03,645
Fuck.

1181
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,251
Go, go, go, go.

1182
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:16,261
Hold on. Fuck.
Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

1183
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:19,389
Hold on. Hold on. Breathe, breathe, 
breathe, fucking breathe.

1184
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:23,061
It's okay. God, he's just a kid.
He's just a kid.

1185
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:30,299
It's all right, I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you. I got you.

1186
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,704
I got you. Just calm down. Relax.
Relax, relax. Gotta breathe.

1187
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:37,147
You gotta breathe, you gotta breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1188
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,619
Relax, relax. You gotta breathe.
You gotta breathe.

1189
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:45,817
Let's get a fucking ambulance!

1190
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:58,362
We got 'em. We got 'em. We got 'em.
We got 'em, okay? We got 'em all.

1191
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:00,531
Just relax. Relax, baby.

1192
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,232
Come on,
you gotta stay with us.

1193
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:04,299
You gotta stay with us.
You gotta...

1194
01:38:04,844 --> 01:38:06,937
Faris! Faris!

1195
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:31,867
Yeah. We got 'em, baby.
We got 'em.

1196
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:37,864
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

1197
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:23,273
This is his son, Sultan.

1198
01:40:23,349 --> 01:40:24,907
Sultan. Hey.

1199
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:33,320
Tell him that his father
was a very brave man.

1200
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:46,537
He asks if you know his father.

1201
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:49,306
Yeah.

1202
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:57,309
I knew your father,
your father was a good friend of mine.

1203
01:41:07,294 --> 01:41:08,783
All right.

1204
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:53,361
Thank you, Sergeant Haytham.

1205
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,736
Thank you.

1206
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,438
Thank you, man.

1207
01:41:58,511 --> 01:42:00,843
This is to keep away your worries.

1208
01:42:04,184 --> 01:42:07,050
Thanks, man.

1209
01:42:32,812 --> 01:42:34,780
We testify next Tuesday.

1210
01:42:34,882 --> 01:42:36,872
Fleury goes first.
But I'm gonna go through it

1211
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:39,509
with each of you one-on-one,
in advance, just to make sure

1212
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:41,450
we're all on the same page.

1213
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,684
If they ask you, if we've talked about 
any of this, the answer is

1214
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:47,590
unequivocally no, okay?

1215
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:53,228
You did outstanding work over there.
You hold your heads high.

1216
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:05,003
Fleury.

1217
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:09,407
Tell me what you whispered to Janet,
in the briefing, to get her to stop crying

1218
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:12,474
about Fran, you know, before all this,
before we even got airborne.

1219
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:14,543
What'd you say to her?

1220
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:27,233
You remember?

1221
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:37,576
I told her we were gonna kill them all.

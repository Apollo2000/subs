00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,040
Around the country, the bookies
pay off winners at track odds.

3
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,885
It's dangerous when a longshot
comes in,

4
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,380
unless you have someone at
the tracks to lower those odds.

5
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,860
Bet you can't do that with
a quarter.

6
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:07,295
Are you kidding? Sure I can.

7
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,410
I'll give you a dime for every quarter you can lay down.
- It's a bet

8
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,710
Hey. You got any quarters?
- Sir?

9
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,920
How're you doing? Can I get a Miler please?
- You got it.

10
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,480
Outta 20. 3, 4, 5,
5 is 10, 10 is 20. Thanks. Next.

11
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,910
OK, ace, they're on a row.
- Yep, you're right.

12
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,540
That's a dollar I owe you.

13
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,290
That was the deal.
A dime for every quarter.

14
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,700
5000 on the 3 horse to win,
please.

15
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,500
Thank you.

16
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,870
2000 on the three horse to win.

17
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,900
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
- Why? What's wrong?

18
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,695
You are a valued customer, as
you know. But what's wrong?

19
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,425
I can't understand this. It's
something you almost never see.

20
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,120
This is some of the finest filegree
platinum I've ever seen.

21
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,630
But the stones... no. They're not
diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.

22
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,090
But they must be! They cut glass!
- Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.

23
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,010
Almost anything will.

24
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,970
Come with me.

25
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,860
Let me show you a positive test
for diamonds.

26
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,940
Take this.

27
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,460
Do you see, how the water splashes
over him? How it slides off in a sheet?

28
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,340
With real diamonds, it won't do that.

29
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,590
It clings to the surface in tiny
droplets.

30
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,260
I see it.

31
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,190
I hope you're not too badly
disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.

32
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,730
- It's not your fault.
- You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again.

33
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,990
I hope. If there's anything you think
we might be interested in...

34
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,990
Well, I have only one thing now.

35
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,120
Are you interested?

36
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,830
Well, I would have to see it,
of course.

37
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,250
You are seeing it.

38
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,720
You're looking right at it.

39
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,970
Mrs. Langtry,

40
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,310
something like this very rarely
happens.

41
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,060
A fine setting in workmanship
usually means precious stones.

42
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,360
It always hurts me when I find
them not.

43
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,110
I always hope I'm mistaken.

44
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,500
Can I get a Miller, please?

45
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,160
- One too many, mister? - 
What? - Step away from the car.

46
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,580
May I see your driver's license?

47
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,670
You seem pretty sick, Mr. Dillon.

48
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,510
No, it's a bad shrimp, I think. Didn't
quite taste right when I was eating it.

49
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm getting over it, though.
- Must I take you to the doctor?

50
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,560
No, I'm fine now, thanks.
I still got a lotta clients to see.

51
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:49,890
- Take it easy now.
- I will, thank you.

52
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,190
Have a good day now.

53
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,730
- Hi, Lilly.
- Hi. I'm done here. Do I come back to Baltimore?

54
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:36,945
No. Bobo wants you to go on
to La Jolla.

55
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,900
La Jolla? I never go to California.
It's a thousand miles from here.

56
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:44,030
Come on, Lilly. You don't argue with
Bobo. He needs someone to

57
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,790
handle playback there.
- Maybe I'll swing out to Los Angeles on the way

58
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,080
Take two or three
days. Call when you get there.

59
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,020
Put it this way. Say I rent it to a
woman. Of course, she has to have

60
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,150
a room with a bath because otherwise
she's got the hall bath tied up all the time

61
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:22,860
washing their goddam hair and her clothes

62
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,410
I had my first hotel 37 years in
Witchita Falls, Texas

63
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:31,335
and that's when I learned
about women.

64
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,965
They don't make the money, see, for
a place like this. Not regularly.

65
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,590
There's only way they can get it: By
selling'theirself', tapping them cute

66
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,590
little piggy banks they all got.
Mr. Dillon. Mr. Simms.

67
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,765
Here's a potential neighboor
of yours.

68
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,310
Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
- I'll send her right up.

69
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,900
That's the fine type of person I have in
mind for here, like yourself, I'm sure.

70
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,825
Don't you wanna see me?
Of course, I do. Come down.

71
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,030
No, honey, I can't go there.
- What do you have in mind?

72
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:03,780
Come on, you could be here
in 20 min.

73
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,070
Oh, I don't know, Roy. I gotta get
thru all this traffic downtown.

74
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,620
In a minute.

75
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,220
Smack.

76
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,060
Heads.

77
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,860
What do you want, kid?

78
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,960
- Show me how ya did that other
one. - Scram. Go home. - I can't.

79
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,300
I've just left home.
- Too young. Ya oughta be in school.

80
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,840
I am in school.

81
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,800
5 of spades.

82
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,480
Where's the 5?
- In your other hand.

83
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,360
Good. You learned something.

84
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,150
Goodbye.

85
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,700
I wanna learn everything.

86
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,660
Wanna be a grifter?
- Grifter? Yes.

87
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,790
Not partners. That's your first lesson. Cut
your score in half, right down the middle.

88
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,920
Worse than that, you take a partner, you
put an apple on your head, and hand

89
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,970
the other guy a shotgun.

90
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,220
Grifters, ah?

91
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,520
You're one, allright. Grifters
got an irresistible urge to be

92
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:43,690
the guy who's wise.

93
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,230
There's nothing to whipping a fool.
Hell, fools were made to be whipped.

94
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,610
But to take another pro, even your
partner, who knows you

95
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:55,490
and has his eyes on you,
that's a score.

96
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,950
No matter what happens.

97
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,105
You wanna learn a few tricks? I'll
teach you a few tricks.

98
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,170
- But you hand does not get into my pocket.
- It's a deal.

99
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,550
Roy.

100
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,590
All right, forget the long con.
If the fool tips, you're caught.

101
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,685
You'll do time. Never do time.

102
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,680
- Don't go dressing like that. - 
Ah?! - Showing off. Showing off!

103
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,770
Any blind man can spot you.

104
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,900
Give me 10 dollars.

105
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,330
Come around tomorrow,
I'll take you again.

106
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,155
Well, that's fine.
Two months we know each other,

107
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,115
You're already so bored, you fall
asleep before I get here.

108
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,040
When you're not here, all I can do
is dream about you, Myra.

109
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,500
You stink. I hate you.

110
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,670
The twins seem to be very restless.
Maybe we oughta put them to bed?

111
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,260
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna smother you.

112
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,220
Death, where is thy sting?

113
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,390
You smell good, Myra.
Like a bitch in a hothouse.

114
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,940
Darling! What a beautiful thing
to say!

115
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,780
Maybe you don't smell so good.
- I do, too. You just said so.

116
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:57,780
It could be your clothes.

117
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,280
It's me.

118
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,750
Do I have to prove it?
- Naturally.

119
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,090
What?

120
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,880
Sims here, Mr. Dillon.

121
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,890
Sure, Mr. Sims. What can I
do for you?

122
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,230
A visitor, Mr. Dillon.
A very attractive young lady.

123
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,110
She says she's your mother.

124
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Send her up.

125
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,340
Come on in, Lilly.

126
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,720
Hi, Lilly.

127
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,850
Roy.

128
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,940
Long time no see you.

129
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,120
Eight years.

130
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,870
I'm just making some coffee. You
want some? Just instant.

131
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,040
It'd be nice.

132
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,900
Here we are. Come on,
sit down, Lilly.

133
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,070
So, what are we up to these days?

134
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,425
Still handling playback money at
the track.

135
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,380
I'll be going back to Baltimore as soon
as the races at La Jolla are finished.

136
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,960
- So you're working for that same bookmaker?
- Yes.

137
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
An easy life?

138
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,880
Usually.

139
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,060
Got a great view, Roy.

140
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,520
I guess you've been getting my
Christmas cards.

141
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,190
- You always did have a sense of humor.
- Glad to see ya, Lilly.

142
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,610
I'd have been hurt if you hadn't
drop by.

143
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,780
I'm glad to see you too, Roy.

144
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,450
Though I'm not sure what
you're up to.

145
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,370
Up to? I'm not up to anything, Lilly.
- Come on, Roy, you can't kid me.

146
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:57,130
You got so much more in the ball
than I ever did. Do you know

147
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,880
what it does to a person...
- Lilly, I want you to mind your own goddam business!

148
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,890
Roy, what is it?

149
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,390
It's no sweat.

150
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:17,480
- God, you're ice cold. - Don't laugh at
me. - Laugh? I'm not laughing at you, honey.

151
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,860
- Did somebody hurt you, Roy?
- Got hit in the stomach a couple of days ago

152
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,570
- Let me see!
- Oh, no.

153
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,505
Dr. Mittchel?
It's Lilly Dillon, doctor.

154
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,170
I work for Justus Amusement Company
out of Baltimore.

155
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:47,220
What?
Don't you brush me off, buster.

156
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,680
If I have to have Bobo Justus
call you...

157
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,350
Mrs. Dillon, I am sorry about our
little disagreement on the phone.

158
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:57,275
I'm really sorry. About
your son...

159
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,155
It's hard to believe this strapping
young man is your son.

160
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,240
- Never mind that. Just take care of him.
- Yeah, but he's had...

161
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:08,370
He's had an internal hemorrage.
He's bleeding to death.

162
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:10,085
Well, make it stop.

163
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,620
His blood pressure is under 100.
I don't think he's gonna make it to the...

164
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:17,597
You know who I work for?
- There's just not much I can do.

165
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:21,540
My son's gonna be allright.
If not, I'll have you killed.

166
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,280
No, really?
You're Roy's mother?

167
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,530
That's impossible!
- Not quite. But, I'm not sure who you are, Mrs...

168
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,490
Langtry, was it?

169
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,910
I'm Roy's friend.

170
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,830
Yes, I imagine you're lots of
people's friend.

171
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,300
Oh, oh, of course. Now that I see
you in the light,

172
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:08,652
you're pretty old enough
to be Roy's mother.

173
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:11,970
- Aren't we all?
- Play nice. Don't fight.

174
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,680
Darling!
- Roy!

175
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,680
You're gonna be allright.

176
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,650
What am I doing here?

177
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,820
You were bleeding inside, honey.
Remember that bruise you had?

178
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,160
You called the doctor, ha?
- Well, no Roy. Your mother did.

179
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,330
Thanks.

180
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,550
- How long do they say till I can get outta here?
- Roy, your mom saved your life.

181
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,590
Yeah.

182
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,310
Second time I gave it to ya.

183
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,890
I was kind of,

184
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:07,280
inconvenient for Lilly. She was
only 14 when I came along.

185
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,535
In fact, I used to be her kid
brother, well,

186
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,585
or so she'd say.
- Well, you're alright now, I guess.

187
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,910
It's a two-hour drive, I'm late,
I have to go down to the track.

188
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,250
- Thanks, Lili. - Don't mention
it. - I guess I owe you my life.

189
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,130
You always did.

190
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,880
Down to the track?

191
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,720
La Jolla. A job.

192
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,230
I wanna know everything about you.

193
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,150
Damn it!

194
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,650
Number 7, "Troubador",
rank outsider,

195
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,740
stays unchanged at 70:1.

196
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,950
70:1.

197
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,250
Now at the start,
"Blue bay", 5:2.

198
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,500
"Celadon Star", the favorite,
moves in at 2:1.

199
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,050
Now "Troubador" goes into the gate,
still running high odds at 70:1.

200
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,010
An they're off! From the start
it's "Zreli poklon", "Troubador",

201
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,315
"Otis Blue", "Buck Meister",
"Uncle Louis".

202
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,405
Down the back stretch, "Celadon
Star" has the lead by two lengths,

203
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,650
with "Warmy hep" second. "Six Streams"
goes along in third. Now "Troubador"

204
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,690
now moving stoutly on the far outside.
- No, "Troubador".

205
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:33,705
Running the far turn,
"Celadon Star" at front.

206
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,820
"Warmy Hep" second. "Blue bay" begins
to drop back a little bit as "Six streams"

207
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,330
moves up. Now "Troubador"
making a bold move on the outside.

208
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,290
They round the turn around into the home
stretch and it's "Celadon Star" in front.

209
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,440
On the outside, "Troubador" now coming
strong with "Warmy Hep" along the rail.

210
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:50,550
Those two running for the second
position but it's "Celadon Star" in front.

211
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,475
Now "Troubador" begins to pick up the
pace

212
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,785
"Celadon Star" holding the lead, "Troubador"
coming on it.

213
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,060
"Celadon Star" and "Troubador"
tracking on the outside

214
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,847
It's "Troubador" on the outside

215
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:05,565
coming behind to get the lead.

216
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,485
"Troubador" winning it by half a
length.

217
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,785
The results were as follows:
To this amazement sucess story

218
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,860
"Troubador", outsider, at 70:1
meets first place, second place...

219
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,530
Roy, what happens when you get outtta here?
- Tick-a-tick parade, a key to the city,

220
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:24,410
sex with my baby,
the usual I guess.

221
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:27,540
And that's it?
- What else?

222
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,420
Well that's what I wanna know.
Is this all we have, Roy,

223
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,880
"sex with my baby"?
Not that I'm knocking it

224
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,090
but is that all?
- What're you driving at, Myra? Marriage?

225
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,810
- I didn't say that. - But that's
what I asked. - I don't think so.

226
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,275
I'm a very practical little girl,
and I don't believe in giving

227
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,030
any more than I get. And that may be
pretty akward for a match-book

228
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:58,070
salesman or whatever you are.
- Everybody needs matches.

229
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,540
What do you sell anyway?
- Self-confidence.

230
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,830
God knows you have it
to spare.

231
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,040
I'll see you tomorrow.

232
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,630
No kiss?

233
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,370
Hello, Mrs. Langtry.
Time to rest.

234
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,960
Well, I'll leave you in Carol's
good hands.

235
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,300
- You're looking much better today.
- But you're not. You're looking very bad.

236
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,930
You belong in bed, Mrs. Linn.

237
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,600
Here, I'll give you part of mine.

238
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,270
But you must. I've seen girls with
this look before.

239
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,940
Bed is the only thing that will
cure them.

240
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,820
Bed without dinner might cure you.
- You'd better behave,

241
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:24,660
or I won't kiss you goodnight
and then you'll be sorry.

242
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,160
You'd better behave,
or I'll tell your mother.

243
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,920
Well, we wouldn't want that
now, would we?

244
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,870
Oh, hi, Myra.
I didn't recognize you.

245
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,960
No, I'm sure you didn't.

246
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Myra's been here.

247
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,940
And what's your objection to Myra?
- Same as anybody's.

248
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,325
I stopped by your place, picked up
your mail.

249
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,320
Just bills. I'll take care of them.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.

250
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:44,450
Whatever you say.

251
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,580
The manager at your place
said your boss called.

252
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,465
Really pulled the wheel out of
everyone's eyes, ha?

253
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,885
- What're you talking about? So I got a job, so what?
- Stop kidding me.

254
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,420
Four years in a town like Los Angeles,
a peanut selling job is the best you can do.

255
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:05,510
D'ya expect me to believe that?
- What's there?

256
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:08,015
The boss called.
You said do yourself.

257
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,355
That dump you live in, those
clown pictures on the walls...

258
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,600
- I like them. - You do not. Roy Dillon,
corn-ball clown pictures, comission salesman

259
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:17,485
it's all a front.
You're working some angle.

260
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,655
Don't tell me you're not, 'cause I wrote
the book.

261
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,785
You want to talk? You still want to run
playback money for the mob?

262
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,070
- That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut off for the rackets, Roy.
- How come?

263
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:29,820
You aren't tough enough.

264
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,410
Not as tough as you, ha?
- How d'ya get tha punch in the stomach?

265
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,710
I tripped on a chair.
- Get off the grift, Roy!

266
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,000
Why?

267
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,590
You haven't got the stomach for it.

268
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,440
Oh, good, Carol. Come in.
Dr. Mitchel says you can get out of here Friday.

269
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:06,490
But that you should have someone to look in
on you, so I hired Carol.

270
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,160
- You hired? - You'll pay me back, I'm sure.
- Lilly, I make my own decisions for a long

271
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,415
time now.
- Roy, you couldn't possibly object

272
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,750
to a pretty young lady coming to visit you.
- Carol!

273
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,010
Do you know why my mother
hired you?

274
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,970
Ha, yes. I'll come every afternoon
and make sure you feel...

275
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,440
She hired you for me to fuck.

276
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,190
To keep me away from bad
influences.

277
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,440
Isn't that right, Lilly?

278
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,530
It is not.

279
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,620
- Mrs. Dillon, perhaps I...
- Go wait in the hall! Don't go away!

280
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,460
- You didn't have to do that.
- I thought I did.

281
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,970
- So you won't take a thing from me, is that it?
- Sex?

282
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,310
- I'm not offering you sex, you little punk!
- That's not what I meant.

283
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,980
Lilly, you're just throwing that wall flower
on me'cause you don't like Myra.

284
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,320
Moire is nothing!
She's less than nothing.

285
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,990
Why does she bug you?

286
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:37,080
- You jealous?
- Of what? You wanna lie down with dogs?

287
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,830
- Then I'll pick the dog.
- Go ahead, Roy.

288
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,840
Thanks, mom.

289
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,650
That's right. I just give you your life.
What you do with it is up to you.

290
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,230
That's right.

291
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,380
Myra here. So you miss me.
Tell me how to reach you.

292
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,685
And I will.

293
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,735
Baby, I'm getting outta here today.
That's it.

294
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,890
Listen, let's go down to La Jolla this
afternoon. We'll hit the beach!

295
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:47,020
Have some fun, ha? Take some
time off.

296
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:49,230
Forget all this sorry stuff.

297
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Myra!

298
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,970
Don't tell me. You're Addison
Sims of Seattle! And we had lunch

299
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,640
together in the fall of 1902?
- Myra, listen! Myra, damn it!

300
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,980
Listen! Myra!

301
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,940
Joe. How's your wiry zone? Are
hidden germs lurking in your nooks

302
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:36,165
and crannies?

303
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,410
Allright, this is your final warning.
You've got to settle your bill today.

304
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:45,040
Joe, don't I always pay my bills?
One way or another?

305
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,210
Well, this time it's just
one way.

306
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,655
Stop getting up nights, man.
You too could learn to dance.

307
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,680
All you need is a magic step.
Simple as one-two-three.

308
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,030
Here's your bill.

309
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,250
It's a lotta money, Joe.
You wouldn't have padded it?

310
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,965
You owe every damn cent
of that.

311
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,840
Maybe I could get the dough from
your wife, you suppose?

312
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,935
Maybe your kids would crack their
piggy banks?

313
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:41,890
You take one step towards my family...
- Don't wet your pants, for Christ's sake.

314
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,710
Come in, Joe!

315
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,600
The money!

316
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,770
There it is.

317
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,810
The automatic clutch, Joe.
It comes with a deluxe upholstery,

318
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,940
and the highspeed wiry zone...

319
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,120
Myra, please.
I've let you...

320
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,500
I've been very good to you.
I've let you stay here...

321
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:53,580
Can't be done, Joe.
All passangers must

322
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,135
pay as they enter.
No free passes or rebates.

323
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,130
That's a strict rule of the intercourse
commerce comission.

324
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:03,095
Oh, God!

325
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:09,430
Only one choice to a customer:
The lady, or the loot.

326
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,190
What's it gonna be?

327
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,410
The difference between a folded towel
and a clean towel is a trip to the laundry.

328
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:26,907
When you're cleaning those baths
what you do is, you pick up a towel,

329
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:30,370
and you give it a good shake and
a good look, and you say to yourself:

330
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,620
"Would I dry myself in one
of those towels"?

331
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,670
- If the answer is "yes", you fold it.
- What if it's wet?

332
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,260
Mr. Dillon, welcome back.

333
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,265
- You're looking fine, just fine.
- Thank you, Mr. Sims. I'm feeling fine.

334
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,890
- I'm glad you're better. - Sickness comes
to us all, Mr. Dillon. - That's true, Mr Sims.

335
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:52,140
We never know when, we never know why,
we never know how. The only blessed thing

336
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:56,350
we know is that it'll come in the most
time, just when you've got tickets

337
00:38:56,385 --> 00:38:59,270
to the World Series. And that's the way
the permanent waves.

338
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:02,030
Well...

339
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,290
That fellow could be a congressman.

340
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,540
If it's wet, you don't fold it.
You shake it and hang it neatly

341
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:18,170
on the knob provided.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,130
- What're you laughing at?
- Nothing. Oh, no, nevermind, Joe.

343
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,850
It's just that I was remembering,
at lunch, on the menu it said

344
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,070
"Today's special:"

345
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,650
Broiled hothouse tomato,

346
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,700
under a generous slice
of riped cheese.

347
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,220
Hi, Bobo.

348
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,770
Did I buy you that dress
you piece of shit?

349
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,480
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
- I'm the guy you work for, ha?

350
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,440
In that case I may just flush
you down the toilet.

351
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,280
Take me to my hotel.

352
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,540
Troubador!

353
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,805
How did you figure you were
gonna get away with that?

354
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,385
- I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
- You're fucking right!

355
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,895
How much did your pals cut you in
for on that nag, or did they give you

356
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,890
the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Maybe

357
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:58,850
not as much as I should've been. There was a lotta action...
- One question!

358
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:02,190
You wanna stick to that story or
you wanna keep your teeth?

359
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,995
I wanna keep my teeth.
- Allright.

360
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,450
I'll ask you another: You think I got
no contacts out here?

361
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,095
That nag paid off at almost
the opening price. There wasn't hardly

362
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,700
a flutter on the tote board from the time
the odds were posted.

363
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,160
There ain't enough action to tickle the
toteboard and you claim a ten-grand win.

364
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:22,750
You send me 10.000 dollars like
I'm a fucking marker

365
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:25,925
in rip off.

366
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,260
- No, Bobo... - Are we
talking straight up? - My son.

367
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,260
- Your what?
- My son was in the hospital.

368
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,060
- What the fuck are you doing with a son?
- He left home a long time ago.

369
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,900
He's was in a hospital, up in Los
Angeles. He was real sick.

370
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,780
Motherhood.

371
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,910
I never fucked up before, Bobo.

372
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,950
You got any kind of long coat in the car,
something you could wear home

373
00:41:57,985 --> 00:41:59,950
over your dress?

374
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,790
No.

375
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,670
I'll loan you a raincoat.

376
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,730
You guys take a walk.

377
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,330
You wanna go to the bathroom
and bring me a towel?

378
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,010
Ever hear about
the oranges, Lilly?

379
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,720
You mean the insurance
frammis?

380
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,730
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly,
while you put those in the towel.

381
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,740
You hit a person with the oranges
wrapped up in a towel,

382
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,950
they get big, ugly-looking bruises, but they
don't really get hurt, not if you do it right.

383
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,710
It's for working scams against
insurance companies.

384
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,880
And if you do it wrong?

385
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,220
It can mess up your insides.

386
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,760
You can get pe-pe-pe...

387
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,600
What?

388
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,440
Permanent damage.
- You never shit right again.

389
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,920
Bring me the towel.

390
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,470
Come on. Get up. Coat is on
the bed.

391
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:21,880
Oh, I won't forget. 10 grand.
Yours. "Troubador"?

392
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,100
- You want a drink?
- Gee. I'd better not, if that's OK?

393
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:34,150
- Still got a drive up to Los Angeles.
- See your son, ha?

394
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,770
That's nice, Lilly. Side of you
I never knew.

395
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,240
- He's a good kid. Salesman.
- On the square, ha?

396
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,290
- How are you hanging out these days? Stealing much?
- From you?

397
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,250
My folks didn't raise no stupid kids.

398
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,090
You're not scheming a thing, Lilly?

399
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,550
Well, you know, I clip a buck here,
and a buck there. Not enough to notice.

400
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,470
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
- A person who don't look out for himself

401
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,520
is too dumb to look out for anybody else.
He's a liability, right, Bo?

402
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:21,320
That's a 1000% right, Lilly.
- Or else he's working an angle.

403
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,900
If he's not stealing a little,
he's stealing a lot.

404
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
You know it, Lilly!

405
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,880
You know what, I like that suit, Bobo.

406
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,380
I don't know what there is about it, but

407
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,260
somehow it makes you look
taller. - Yeah? - Yeah.

408
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,850
- You really think so? - Yeah. - A
lotta people've been telling me that.

409
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,360
Well, you can tell them from me
they're right.

410
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,440
Well, I'd best be going.

411
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,700
Roy will wonder where I am.
- Worries about his mother, does he?

412
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,700
You give him a hug from me.
- I will.

413
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,460
Thanks, Bobo.

414
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,420
So long, Bobo.

415
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:33,545
I don't see why we have to take
the train.

416
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,910
What if we wanna drive somewhere,
while we're there?

417
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,540
We will rent a car.
- Expender!

418
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,340
You ain't seen nothing yet.
- Why so many people?

419
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,090
The races at La Jolla.

420
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,590
Where your mother is?

421
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,010
You don't wanna see her, do you?
- No.

422
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,980
Hit the beach, eat well is good
enough for me.

423
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,740
I must stretch my legs, you wanna
come along?

424
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,700
No.
- Wanna drink?

425
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,200
No.
- See you in a minute.

426
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:25,710
- A drink for you, a drink for Generson's day grandmother.
- Right.

427
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:28,880
- But junior gets milk.
- Right, right.

428
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,890
A minute.

429
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,670
I'm sorry.
I spilled all your drinks.

430
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,380
- Sure you're ok?
- Yeah. What were those? Beers?

431
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,480
Four Millers.

432
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,490
Hey! Did one of you guys drop this?
- No.

433
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,820
I don't know. I wouldn't have taken a chance.

434
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,540
Another round, I'm buying.
- No, come on guy, you can't buy every round.

435
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:30,460
It's like our turn.
- Come on, we've got plenty of cash.

436
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:33,340
Tell you what.
We'll roll off one?

437
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,970
- Low number buys. - Very
good. - You're on for it.

438
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,720
Let's go, Junior.
That's just four.

439
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,690
- Gimme a chance to get one of you back.
- You got it.

440
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,880
Wanna go one more time?
I got four.

441
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,800
It's great to get away, isn't it?
To take some time off?

442
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:01,430
Next week, I'll be back to work.
- You already went back to work.

443
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:07,220
- What?
- I watched you. Working the tatt on those sailor boys.

444
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,520
- Working the what?
- Oh, come on, Roy. The tatt. What you do for a living.

445
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:21,990
I'm a salesman. - You're on the grift.
Same as me. - Myra, I'm not following this.

446
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:26,530
Roy, you're a short-con operator.
And a good one, I think.

447
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:30,290
Don't talk to me like
I'm another square.

448
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,345
You talk the lingo.
What's your pitch?

449
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,800
The long end. Big con.
- Nobody does that single out.

450
00:54:45,835 --> 00:54:49,220
I was teamed 10 years with the
best in the business.

451
00:54:49,255 --> 00:54:52,270
Cool Langley.
- I've heard the name.

452
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,270
- It was beautiful, and getting better all the time.
- Is that right?

453
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,570
It is, Roy, it's where you should be.
What are you bringing? 3,400 a week?

454
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:03,610
We used money like that for tips.
- Wow!

455
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,490
And now, right now, it's the perfect time.
The best time

456
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:12,250
since I've been in the game.

457
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,930
All over the southwest you've got
these businessmen. They were

458
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:35,770
making money when everybody was
making money. They think that means

459
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,980
they're smart. And now they're hurting.
When the price of oil fell, so did they.

460
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:46,450
They've still got money,
but they need more money.

461
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,120
When the oil money was good, they put
up all these office buildings. Now they're

462
00:55:52,155 --> 00:55:56,120
half empty. They'd give you anything to
move in: First two months free,

463
00:55:56,155 --> 00:56:00,747
redecoration, whatever you want.

464
00:56:00,782 --> 00:56:05,340
They help you set up the store.

465
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,140
I'm the roper. I go out and find them,
and bring them in.

466
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,310
Morning, gentlemen.

467
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,320
Gloster Hebing, may I present my
fine stock broker, Henry Fellows?

468
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,650
Gloster.

469
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,240
What we have here today,
Mary Beth, is strickly between...

470
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:34,370
Oh, I told Mr. Hebing all
about it. How brilliant you are

471
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,540
at making money for your
special clients.

472
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:44,550
Well, I certainly hope that you're not
spreading the news a little too widely.

473
00:56:44,585 --> 00:56:48,680
Well, of course not! But I'd trust
Mr. Hebing with anything.

474
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,260
Wouldn't I, darling?

475
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:56,060
Well, I guess I'll just have to take
your word for that. Won't I?

476
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,440
Here's the money.

477
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,030
Goodie!

478
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,540
Please, let me help you.

479
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,170
Once they saw that money,
they were hooked.

480
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:31,970
And I made sure they saw it.
Ain't that just beautiful?

481
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:42,100
- Then, all Cool had to do was tell the story.
- We are talking about

482
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,405
breaking the law here. I just wanna
make sure you understand that.

483
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,490
- No one is gonna get hurt, but the law is gonna be broken.
- Laws were made to be broken.

484
00:57:48,525 --> 00:57:51,320
Lose talk is the one thing I worry about.

485
00:57:51,355 --> 00:57:54,870
I can keep my mouth shut.

486
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,710
Gloster, come on over here
and sit down.

487
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,840
Tokyo exchange is 9 hours behind us,
the NY exchange is 1 hour ahead of us.

488
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:11,725
There is never one hour in which
both exchanges are open.

489
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,800
Information moves, but it has to wait.
Now, I have a fellow working for me.

490
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:18,185
D'ya know what a hacker is?

491
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,600
- Yeah, sure. That's like a computer expert, a genius.
- Very good.

492
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:24,980
And what this boy has been able to do,
is tap into that main link

493
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:27,940
between Tokyo and NY
and when we really need it

494
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:31,035
he's been able to give us
a 7 second delay

495
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,450
in the transfer of that information.
Do you know what that means?

496
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:38,120
Well, I can see that you get your
information ahead of NY.

497
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:41,580
Every once in a while
a major change happens.

498
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,095
And we have a 7 second advantage
to put a buy order, a sell order,

499
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:49,630
into that computer in NY just before
that data from Tokyo comes pulling in

500
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:53,010
right behind it.

501
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,645
- Not much time.
- No, we have to be ready, we have

502
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,020
to have the money, we have to know
what that information means

503
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:02,517
and we have to move like grease
lightning.

504
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:04,980
But boy, when it works,
it is beautiful!

505
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,820
Seven seconds, ah?

506
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,400
- I don't see how you can do it.
- Machines!

507
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:14,200
Machines, Gloster!

508
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:19,790
I've got a whole room full of machines
machines back here. Y'wanna see it?

509
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:27,960
- Henry, no.
- I've got a whole suite full of mainframe computers back here.

510
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,420
- They are so beautiful!
- No, Henry.

511
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,470
Oh, you got a minute?
Come on, Gloster!

512
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,470
Listen to them hum.

513
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,980
- Henry, don't try Mr. Hebbing's patience!
- You sure?

514
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,480
Well...

515
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,310
OK, then.

516
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:54,070
- Cole liked to take risks, huh?
- He didn't think they were risks.

517
00:59:54,105 --> 00:59:58,072
He was so good, Roy,
he could just play with the mark.

518
00:59:58,107 --> 01:00:02,040
He was so crooked, he could
eat soup with a corkscrew.

519
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,545
- And when he got serious?
- He'd explain he had to have cash,

520
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,590
so there wouldn't be any paper
trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash,

521
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:12,760
or it wasn't worth while.

522
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,020
The least we ever took
was US$ 40.000,

523
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,850
and the most was 185.000$,
from one sucker!

524
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:32,280
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor.

525
01:00:32,315 --> 01:00:36,047
They had savings accounts,
stocks to sell,

526
01:00:36,082 --> 01:00:39,745
houses to mortgage.
Sell their wife's jewelry.

527
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,410
Oh, they had a lot of money,
when they put their minds to it.

528
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,250
Or when I put their minds to it.

529
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:50,170
And a month later, the sucker calls
the cops and you're on the run.

530
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:54,840
No no! He never calls the cops,
not after we give him the blow-off.

531
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,480
FBI! Everybody hold
what you've got!

532
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,195
Back off!

533
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:12,610
It's right here!

534
01:01:12,645 --> 01:01:15,955
You was it!
- No!

535
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,610
You and your goddam bigmouth!
- No!

536
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,870
Henry, no!

537
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,130
You don't move, backwards,
nobody move!

538
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,300
You stay there! Come with me!
- No!

539
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,630
Go, go, go!

540
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,610
They never came back.

541
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:21,760
We were rolling in dough,
lived wherever we wanted,

542
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:25,060
only pulled two or three
scams a year.

543
01:02:25,095 --> 01:02:27,060
It was great!
Great! Great!

544
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,350
What happened to Cole?

545
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,690
He retired.
- Retired...

546
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,110
Where?

547
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,410
Upstate.

548
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,450
Upstate where?

549
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,330
Atascadero.

550
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,470
No, baby. Not again.

551
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,230
It's hollow. I can't move.

552
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,440
Cant' move. Can't move.

553
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,660
It's just the stress again.
We'll take a vacation.

554
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,870
Cole, you scare me
when this happens!

555
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,290
No, no! Turn around!

556
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,840
Cole, please! Please!

557
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:41,760
That's where they keep
the criminally insane, isn't it?

558
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:44,430
He retired, and that's it.

559
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,185
But I didn't.
I'm still the best long-con

560
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,940
roper you'll ever see.
- I bet you are, too.

561
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:06,070
Now you're trying to rope me.
- Join up with you!

562
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,170
- A beautiful woman like you? You shouldn't eat alone
- Go away.

563
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:33,180
What d'ya wanna eat alone for?
- Can I have some more coffee?

564
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,520
- Coming up!
- We can have coffee together.

565
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,940
My name's Kenny.

566
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:44,860
Your pal wants you.
Let'm find his own pretty woman.

567
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,955
- This fellow bothering you, miss?
- Yes.

568
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:50,370
Why don'y you go back there
and just go sit down?

569
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,410
I'll sit here.

570
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:07,805
- You all right?
- You didn't need to do that!

571
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,220
I thought I did. You should
take better care of yr friend.

572
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:13,100
Get outta here!

573
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,270
I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
without been bothered!

574
01:05:19,305 --> 01:05:21,770
Will never happen again, miss.

575
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,450
See you later.
- Why d'we have to have separate rooms?

576
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,250
Expect your father to come through?
- Separate bathrooms, darling.

577
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:40,830
I will not lay out all my
cosmetics for you to knock over.

578
01:05:40,865 --> 01:05:43,805
Things a man isn't
supposed to know.

579
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,260
You don't mind, really, d'ya, Roy?
It's been such a wonderful evening,

580
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:50,090
I guess I just wore myself out.

581
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,390
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.

582
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,540
Forget the longcon,'cause I'm
the one who's been conned.

583
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,500
Screw this noise!

584
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,100
Open your door!

585
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,850
What for?

586
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,100
Open it, and find out.

587
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:13,010
Gangway!

588
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,020
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I just washed my clothes,

589
01:07:22,055 --> 01:07:25,060
and I couldn't do a thing
with them.

590
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,200
If you could have seen the look on
yr face when I told you good night!

591
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,200
You looked so...

592
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,820
- Roy! - Can I
come in? - Sure.

593
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:23,750
What'r'ya doing in La Jolla?
- Me and Myra came down yesterday,

594
01:08:23,785 --> 01:08:25,370
we're leaving tonight.

595
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,090
- If ya come out to the track, don't know me.
- We won't hit the track.

596
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:39,140
What's that? - 4 grand.
It's for the hospital, is it enough?

597
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,640
- Roy, I don't want yr money.
- I pay my debts.

598
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,770
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah!

599
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,690
Expecting somebody?

600
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,490
No. That was the point.

601
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:01,410
- Where did ya get that?
- Accident. Take the money back, I don't want it.

602
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:04,040
No.

603
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,090
I thought...

604
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,845
I was hoping we could play it
straight with one another.

605
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,390
- I guess not.
- I guess you won't be getting a straight job, either?

606
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,770
- Not this week. - Not
ever! - It's up to me.

607
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,480
I'm strictly short-con.

608
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
It's nothing but small-time stuff.

609
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,280
I can walk away from it anytime I want.

610
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,820
- I've heard that one before.
- Yeah, but I'm in control.

611
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,110
Sure. You're only 25 years old
already you can lay down

612
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:51,915
4 grand, without even
turning a hair!

613
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,750
Goes like anything else, Roy.
You don't stand still,

614
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,580
either go up or down, usually
down, sooner or later.

615
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,800
Well, that oughta be
a surprise, then.

616
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,220
You'll gonna head east
from here?

617
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,140
After the meet.
Back to Baltimore.

618
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,820
It was nice to see
you again.

619
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,080
You little prick!

620
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:02,740
- OK? - I see him. Just wait. Hold
it. - That's the guy we followed.

621
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:04,360
Just wait!

622
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:50,790
Excuse, me? Can I borrow your
binoculars? Thanks!

623
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,170
Excuse me.

624
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:41,790
- What did you do to yrself all afternoon?
- I went out to the track.

625
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,590
What were you doing at the track?
Did you run into my mother?

626
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,720
No, how could I?
I was in the clubhouse.

627
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:56,060
Lilly wouldn't be in the clubhouse,
would she? How did ya know that?

628
01:12:56,230 --> 01:13:01,060
- OK, I saw her.
- But she didn't see you, in other words?

629
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:04,610
I saw her out there, and I was curious.
You know she's always so nasty to me.

630
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,950
I know she was knocking me
to you every chance she has.

631
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:13,490
So, I called a friend of mine in
Baltimore, so now I know who she is.

632
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,925
You must have some very
knowledgeable friends.

633
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,670
I'm well connected, Roy. Cole
introduced me to a lotta people.

634
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:25,147
Very valuable.
Valuable for us.

635
01:13:25,182 --> 01:13:28,555
Running your broker scam,
you mean.

636
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:32,470
What a team we'll make!
You won't regret this, Roy.

637
01:13:32,505 --> 01:13:35,855
Regret what? I didn't say
I was coming aboard.

638
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:41,690
- Why not? I thought it was settled!
- Nothing was ever settled.

639
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:47,200
- It's yr mother talking against me!
- She's got nothing to do with it!

640
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,250
- I make my own decisions!
- It's not what Lilly thinks...

641
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,580
Who cares what she thinks?
I don't care what she thinks.

642
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:00,420
Left home when I was 17, with nothing
but stuff I bought and paid for myself.

643
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:01,130
Nothing from Lilly.

644
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,325
Darling, guess what?
I had to tell you right away.

645
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,660
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
the one who plays my chauffeur.

646
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:37,302
He says that there's a sucker there
that's made for us.

647
01:14:37,337 --> 01:14:40,910
And a broker that just shut down,
we can use their office,

648
01:14:40,945 --> 01:14:41,960
not change a thing!

649
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:47,210
I can scrape up 10 grand if I try,
I got a couple of aces in the whole,

650
01:14:47,245 --> 01:14:50,395
some markers I could call on
for something real.

651
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:54,390
That leaves 15 or 20 to yr end.
We can start this weekend,

652
01:14:54,425 --> 01:14:58,020
get the sucker into position...
- Hold it!

653
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,065
You're talking some
pretty tall figures,

654
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,100
What makes you think I have got
that kind of money?

655
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:09,530
Now, you must have.
Now, you know you do, Roy.

656
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,700
Maybe I like it where I am.

657
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:23,000
Well, maybe I don't. I had 10 good
years with Cole, and I want'em back.

658
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,040
I gotta have a partner.

659
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,420
I looked and looked
and believe me, brother

660
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,880
I kissed a lotta fucking frogs!

661
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,065
And you're my prince!

662
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,230
- Don't I get any say in this?
- No… - That's what I say!

663
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:46,400
What I say is no.
We don't do partners.

664
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,690
What is it?

665
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:57,085
What's going on? Why don't
you wanna team up?

666
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,120
The best reason I can think of
is that you scare the hell outta me.

667
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:03,912
I've seen women like you before,
baby. You're double tough,

668
01:16:03,947 --> 01:16:07,635
you're sharp as a razor, and you
get what you want, or else...

669
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:13,050
But you don't make it work forever.
Sooner or later, the lightning hits.

670
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,510
And I'm not gonna be around
when it hits you.

671
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:23,315
By God!

672
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,810
It's your mother.

673
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:28,190
- It's Lilly!
- What?

674
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:32,360
Sure it is. That's why you act
so funny around each other

675
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,820
What's that?

676
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,410
Don't act so goddam innocent!

677
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:41,330
You and your own mother?

678
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:46,965
- You like to go back where you been, huh?
- Watch yr mouth!

679
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,170
I'm wise to you, I should've seen it
before, you rotten son of a bitch!

680
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:54,250
How is it, huh?
How do you like it...

681
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,010
Stop!

682
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:11,770
That's not like me.
I don't do this.

683
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,860
That's why we wouldn't
work together.

684
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,280
Yr disgusting. Yr mind's so filthy
it's hard even to look at you.

685
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,950
Goodbye.

686
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,140
And you don't even know it.

687
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:04,540
Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.

688
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:24,430
- Yeah?
- Lilly, it's Roy. Lilly, I was wondering if...

689
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:29,980
I was wondering if we could just talk.
You know, like have a conversation.

690
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:34,860
Maybe we've both grown up.
Maybe we could just talk?

691
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,570
Sure, Roy.

692
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,580
- You want me to
drive up? - No. - OK.

693
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:50,370
- I'll come there tonight.
- Fine. Come on down.

694
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:56,920
- There won't be a home cooked meal.
- That's good news.

695
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:17,520
Who's a boy gonna talk to,
if not his mother?

696
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,895
Lilly, listen, it's Irv.

697
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,060
You've always been decent to me,
I'm taking a hell of a chance here.

698
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:54,980
Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
The car full of money, he's...

699
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,900
Lilly? Lilly?

700
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:07,710
Bobo knows about all the money in
the car. The money you stole from him.

701
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:28,500
A black and gold Cadillac.

702
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:49,895
Hi! Wellcome to Phoenix.

703
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,970
I'd like a single room
for tonight.

704
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:54,850
Everything's the same size,
same price.

705
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:59,190
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
noise keeps me wide awake all night.

706
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:02,230
Trucks. I know what you mean.

707
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,610
Do you have something around
back facing away from the road?

708
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:11,540
I'll put you in 19. Very quiet.
Faces the desert.

709
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,710
Sounds perfect. Can I park
my car back there?

710
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:16,580
Right in front of the room.

711
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,190
Something wrong?

712
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,320
Oh, sorry. I thought you were
the other lady.

713
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:25,070
No. I'm me.

714
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:40,250
I'll give you n. 6. Very nice room.
Very handy.

715
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,830
In the front, right by the pool.

716
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:47,710
Don't you have sth round back?
Where it's quieter?

717
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,340
Everybody wants
the back tonight!

718
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:56,260
I guess everybody
wants privicy.

719
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:16,840
Roy Dilon? Lt. Pearson,
Phoenix police. I have a car here.

720
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,850
- There was a bunch of money hidden in yr mother's car.
- Yeah?

721
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:39,570
A lotta money! Would you know
anything about that? - No.

722
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,820
- I realise this is a shock.
- Mostly, I don't believe it.

723
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:47,570
- That's natural.
- No, I mean, I don't believe it.

724
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:51,290
I know my mother. Lilly is not a suicide.
Nothing would make her check out.

725
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,580
I'm sorry. It was her, all right.

726
01:29:55,870 --> 01:30:00,050
- It's her gun, even.
- Her gun?

727
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:13,895
There is one thing I have
to caution you.

728
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:16,955
Normally, we don't do a next to kin
ID, unless there's no other choice.

729
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:19,980
In this case, there's no fingerprints
on the file, the dental records

730
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:22,940
don't help, because of the
location of the wound...

731
01:30:22,975 --> 01:30:25,955
She ate the gun!

732
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:28,820
I'm sorry. This is going
to be a shock.

733
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:43,010
- Not many laughs in this room, eh?
- Not many.

734
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:03,530
Remove that, we want a full
identification.

735
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:12,030
- Jesus!
- No question, ahn?

736
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,580
No.

737
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,910
- That's it, then.
- Yeah.

738
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,500
That's that.

739
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,430
Mom.

740
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,100
The last modern thing I liked
was the miniskirt.

741
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:56,665
Your technology, now,
nobody understands it,

742
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:59,230
that's the simple fact
of the situation.

743
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:04,270
Evening, Miss...
Langtrey.

744
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,390
Hello, Lilly.

745
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:02,980
Roy, you scared me.

746
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,870
You going somewhere?
- Somewhere else, that's for sure.

747
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:26,170
I just came back from Phoenix.
- Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?

748
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,550
Looks very solid, Lilly.

749
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,470
- Take a minute, tell me about it.
- I've really got to go...

750
01:35:32,505 --> 01:35:35,657
- You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
- Yeah, but not for long.

751
01:35:35,692 --> 01:35:38,810
Cops may buy it, but Bobo will
spend money to make sure.

752
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:42,060
Even so, relax a minute.
Sit down!

753
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,980
Just for a minute.

754
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:49,650
Put that down.

755
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:01,335
- Myra followed you, huh?
- Yeah.

756
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,960
I guess She must have been the
one that blew me off with Bobo.

757
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:11,960
- To get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
- No.

758
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,430
It was she was after, though.
What happened at Phoenix?

759
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:20,400
Oh, Roy. It was terrible.

760
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:29,610
You read about people killing
people and all that,

761
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,690
But when it happens...

762
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:36,700
My God!

763
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:45,830
She was in her nightgown, you
know, the old grifter's dodge,

764
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:51,840
nightgown and the ice bucket and she
just got into the wrong room by mistake.

765
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:08,650
I sat in there with her,

766
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,020
I thought, what do I do now?

767
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:15,780
Run, I've got Bobo
and the law after me.

768
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:18,450
Stay, and how do I explain?
- This was perfect.

769
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:23,330
It is, isn't it? I've wanted
out of the rackets for years,

770
01:37:23,365 --> 01:37:24,335
and now I'm out.

771
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:28,290
I can make a clean break and...
You've already made a break.

772
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:33,130
- I don't know how clean it is.
- I'm sorry, Roy.

773
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:37,170
I hated to take your money, but -
You're not taking it.

774
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,720
Roy, I need this money. I can't run
withouth money, and if I can't, I'm dead.

775
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:44,890
- You must have some money. - 
Just a few bucks. - Myra's stuff?

776
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:47,815
Her credit cards. How far am I
gonna get with that?

777
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:51,020
Far enough. San Francisko, St Louis.
Some place new. Start over.

778
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,195
You're smart, good-looking, you
won't have any trouble finding a job.

779
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:56,740
- A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
- Well, you're gonna start if you wanna

780
01:37:56,775 --> 01:38:00,342
live through this. You're gonna get a
square job, live a quiet life. You start

781
01:38:00,377 --> 01:38:03,910
showing up at the track or the hot spots
and Bobo's boys will be all over you.

782
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:07,700
- Roy, don't tell me what to do with myself, it's a big world out there.
- Not anymore.

783
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:13,090
- Lilly, listen to me, it's good advice. I'm following it myself.
- What?

784
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:16,880
You wanted me out of the rackets,
off the grift? I think I'm gonna get out.

785
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,845
Roy, that's fine,
but I don't have time for this.

786
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,935
- Bobo's after my ass!
- I thought you'd be happy for me.

787
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:24,330
After all, you're the one who...
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me!

788
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:27,655
And he's goddamn good, but so am I.
What makes you think I'm gonna let you

789
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:31,940
outta here with my money?
- I'm a survivor. I survive. And to survive, I need money.

790
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:36,570
No!

791
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,040
You want a drink?

792
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:54,170
No! You probably shouldn't
have one either.

793
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:58,210
No, but I'm goddam thirsty.

794
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,590
Ice water?

795
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:04,720
Sure, that sounds nice.

796
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,100
I'll get it.

797
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,300
Take whichever one you want.

798
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,090
You wouldn't do that.

799
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,430
You don't know what I'd do.

800
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,810
You have no idea.

801
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,730
+To live.
- You'll live, Lilly.

802
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:07,910
- I know what's bugging you, of course.
- Oh? I didn't know anything was.

803
01:40:07,945 --> 01:40:10,910
I wasn't a very good mother
to you when you were a kid.

804
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,370
It was pretty lousy of me, I guess.

805
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:20,320
- To be a child at the same time you were.
- For God's sake, Lilly!

806
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,970
I gave you your life twice.

807
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,720
I'm asking you to give me
mine once.

808
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:31,640
I need the money, Roy.

809
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:33,890
No.

810
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:59,080
- So, you're getting off the grift,
ahn? - I might. - That's good.

811
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,880
You don't really belong on this
side of the fence, you know.

812
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:09,300
- I don't?
- If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?

813
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:10,930
Well, I don't see why not.

814
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:16,695
I guess I got it wrong, then.
Seems to me I heard about a guy

815
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:21,250
just your age that got hit so hard
in the guts it almost killed him.

816
01:41:21,285 --> 01:41:25,117
- Well, uh...
- That's different... That doesn't count.

817
01:41:25,152 --> 01:41:28,950
It doesn't really matter, does it?
If I'm getting out...

818
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:34,160
You're getting out? You're on the
level? You don't need the money.

819
01:41:34,195 --> 01:41:36,290
So why the hell can't I take it?

820
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:42,005
Lilly, my money wouldn't last
forever. And then what?

821
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,410
You'd be stuck in some other part of
the rackets, with another Bobo Justus

822
01:41:45,445 --> 01:41:48,340
to slap you around and burn
holes in your hand.

823
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:51,470
If you can't change your life now,
when you're still relatively young,

824
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:56,100
how could you do it when you're
say... crowning 50?

825
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,610
This way you gotta go
the square route.

826
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,610
Send me a card when you got settled,
I could maybe help you out sometimes...

827
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:16,400
Roy... What if I told you
I wasn't really your mother?

828
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,290
That we weren't related?

829
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:21,260
What?

830
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,000
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Sure you would.

831
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:30,970
You don't have to tell me.

832
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:34,510
Now, why would you like that, Roy?

833
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,980
What're talking about? Of course
you're my mother. Of course you are.

834
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:44,380
- Roy... Roy...
- There's nothing more to talk about.

835
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:46,430
I want that money, Roy.

836
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:49,360
I need it.

837
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,740
What do I have to do to get it?

838
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,450
You mean, you won't give it
to me, Roy?

839
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:10,920
Will you? Won't you?

840
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:13,760
What can I do to get it?

841
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,770
Is there nothing I can do?
- Lilly, Jesus, what're you doing?

842
01:43:17,805 --> 01:43:19,400
Nothing at all...?

843
01:43:20,305 --> 01:44:20,515

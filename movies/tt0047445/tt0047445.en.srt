19
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,848
The origin of this story

20
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,894
goes back to medieval times,

21
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,981
when Japan had not yet emerged
from the Dark Ages

22
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,110
and mankind had yet to awaken
as human beings.

23
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,741
It has been retold
by the people for centuries,

24
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:43,621
and it is treasured today

25
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:49,043
as one of the epic folk tales
of history.

26
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,995
Zushio, be careful.

27
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,872
Okay.

28
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,138
Mother.

29
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,681
What is it?

30
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,478
How did Father end up
in a faraway place like Tsukushi?

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,485
Father is a great man, isn't he?

32
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,155
Certainly.

33
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,657
He is a righteous and fine man.

34
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,576
I knew it!

35
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:08,789
Father!

36
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,010
Zushio-sama!

37
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,845
Zushio!

38
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,693
Don't be violent!
Step back, all of you!

39
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,237
We didn't come here to be violent.

40
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,697
We're here to appeal.

41
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,075
Then, please, calm down!

42
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,411
Are you the general?

43
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,166
Master, please come out!
We're all here for you!

44
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:56,671
- What are you going to do?
- We'll have Master's transfer cancelled!

45
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,216
The transfer is just a pretense!
It means exile!

46
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,052
What kind of nonsense is that?

47
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,306
He is being punished because of us!
We can't just stand by and watch!

48
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,267
Let's all go to the general's office
and appeal!

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,146
Wait! I know you care for our master.

50
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,734
But what you want to do will only
make his situation more difficult!

51
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,945
Be sensible and listen to us.

52
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:26,117
For 13 years, famine has caused
suffering for all of you.

53
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,997
You need every working hand
you have.

54
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:37,086
That was why our master opposed
the general's demand

55
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,506
for more men to fight his war
and the increase of taxes on rice.

56
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,969
His attempt to help you was overruled.

57
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:51,142
If you do this now,
you too will be punished!

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:56,480
That's right!
If you riot, he will be blamed!

59
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,607
He will be accused of rebellion!

60
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,278
So, please, return to your homes!

61
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:10,369
You're too lenient on them!
This is a riot!

62
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,954
Kill them all!

63
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,667
What are you saying?
I do not approve of that!

64
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,214
Keep out of this.
You are no longer governor.

65
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,593
How dare you speak that way!

66
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,446
Zushio-sama.

67
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,118
Your food is ready.

68
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,730
I am sorry to have caused
you trouble, Uncle.

69
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:08,070
You've involved the whole family.
Your wife and children are in pain.

70
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,575
The peasants are in pain as well.

71
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,951
Nonsense!

72
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,080
You cannot compare us to peasants!

73
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,583
You fool!

74
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,808
Tamaki, take the children
to your parents' home in Iwashiro.

75
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,602
Yes.

76
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,229
Tell them I am sorry

77
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,817
for disappointing them
after they put their trust in me.

78
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,575
Zushio, I wonder if you'll become
a stubborn man like me.

79
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,749
You may be too young to understand,
but hear me out anyway.

80
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,795
A man is not a human being
without mercy.

81
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,047
Yes.

82
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,842
Even if you are hard on yourself,
be merciful to others.

83
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,638
Men are created equal.

84
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,058
Everyone is entitled
to their happiness.

85
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,456
This is the goddess of mercy,
a family treasure.

86
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,459
Think of this as my principle.

87
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,674
Keep it in remembrance of me.
Always keep it with you. Understand?

88
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,467
Yes.

89
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,680
Now repeat what I've just told you.

90
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:02,518
"A man is not a human being
without mercy.

91
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:07,022
Even if you are hard on yourself,
be merciful to others."

92
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:25,249
"Men are created equal.

93
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,544
Everyone is entitled
to their happiness."

94
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:37,886
- Do you remember your father's face?
- Yes, Mother.

95
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:43,726
- And his teachings also?
- Yes, Mother.

96
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:23,182
Zushio, it is time
to say good-bye to your father.

97
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:29,563
Anju, become a lovely lady.

98
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,819
- Look after your sister.
- Yes, Father.

99
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,956
We are not parting forever.

100
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,377
Be hopeful and brave.

101
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,961
Yes.

102
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,636
I never dreamed
I would have to leave this place.

103
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:18,737
- Governor!
- Master!

104
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:41,778
Come, we must hurry.
We have to find a place to stay.

105
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,458
Zushio, Anju...

106
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,420
we are taking the same road
your father took.

107
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,675
Father.

108
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,691
My lady! My lady!

109
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,700
There are no lodgings
available in this area.

110
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,370
Why is that?

111
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,457
There have been bandits and slave
dealers posing as travelers recently.

112
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,127
They have been killing
and kidnapping women and children,

113
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:44,049
so the governor has prohibited
sheltering travelers.

114
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,678
Bandits and slave dealers?

115
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:05,612
- We are in trouble.
- What shall we do?

116
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,576
We have no choice
other than to find a place to camp.

117
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,120
Camp, my lady?

118
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:19,626
We must build a shelter
before it gets too dark.

119
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,338
Zushio, Anju, you must help too.

120
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,549
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes, Mother.

121
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,123
Here.

122
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,883
Mother, shall I go get more?

123
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:13,722
Yes, more thatch and soft grass
would be nice.

124
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,225
- Come, Anju.
- Yes, brother.

125
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,765
Brother, we should get this branch.

126
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,601
You can't break it by yourself, Anju.

127
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,199
Mother is calling us.

128
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,786
- It's the sound of the waves.
- No, listen carefully.

129
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:26,128
Anju, come back quickly!

130
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,591
Zushio!

131
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,012
Anju!

132
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:54,656
You two must be hungry.
This will help.

133
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,999
- What was that?
- Wolves, my lady.

134
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:09,963
Do not worry.
They will not come near the fire.

135
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,467
Don't worry, dear. It'll be all right.

136
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:31,526
I'm sorry
we don't have any warm food.

137
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,288
I will try to go get some porridge
from a house nearby.

138
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:48,210
And some bedding for sleeping.

139
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,339
I'll be right back.

140
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,258
Thank you.

141
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,599
Who's there?

142
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,943
What on earth are you doing here?

143
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,614
We are travelers.

144
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,951
We could not find any lodging.

145
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,998
I'm very sorry to hear that.

146
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,919
The cold night is harmful to children.

147
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,719
Come to my place.
I can give you warm porridge.

148
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:26,683
I appreciate your kindness,
but I would not want to intrude.

149
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,020
Just come quietly.

150
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,649
Even if the authorities find out,
I'm sure they'll allow one night.

151
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,027
Come, quickly.

152
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,070
Thank you...

153
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,823
but there is
one more person with us.

154
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,825
Another person?

155
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,122
Is this person a man or a woman?

156
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,918
It is a woman. Our servant.

157
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,296
Then it's all right.

158
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,592
I can't have a man
staying with a priestess.

159
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:08,433
I was able to get straw mats
but could not get any food, my lady.

160
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,770
It's all right.
This priestess here

161
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,315
has graciously offered to lodge us
secretly for the night.

162
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:20,111
- Really?
- Now, then, let's go.

163
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,617
Thank you so much.
I am so happy. Thank you so much.

164
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,169
I can never thank you enough
for your kindness.

165
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:42,717
It is nothing. I do not live my life
only to serve the gods.

166
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,513
No, really.
Even family cannot help us.

167
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,225
It is a cold world.

168
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,610
So you stayed at your brother's
in Iwashiro for six years?

169
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,153
Yes.

170
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:08,326
Marriage will break apart
even siblings, I guess.

171
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:13,707
With their stomachs full, the children
have selfishly fallen asleep.

172
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,926
And what are your plans for travel?

173
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,931
It is impossible to walk.
Why don't you go by boat?

174
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,934
There are hard roads ahead,

175
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,272
and there are many bandits
lurking in the mountains.

176
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,357
Is going by boat safe?

177
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:44,112
Certainly.
I know reliable boatmen.

178
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,365
- I will ask them for you.
- Thank you.

179
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:58,918
I made all the arrangements
while you were asleep.

180
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:04,549
- How can we ever thank you?
- It was nothing.

181
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:29,115
Thank you. Here they are.
Please take care of them.

182
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,077
Thank you for accepting them.

183
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,621
Come this way.

184
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,679
Here you are.

185
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,349
Please get on the boat.

186
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,352
I'll never forget your kindness.

187
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,605
Zushio, Anju, say good-bye.

188
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,899
- Thank you very much.
- Farewell.

189
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:09,239
Farewell. I'll be praying
for your safe voyage.

190
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,740
Thank you very much.

191
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,368
Now, lady, you go first.

192
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,465
Anju-sama, Zushio-sama,
go ahead and get in.

193
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,094
Get back.
I'll help the children.

194
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,264
The children will ride separately.
We can't all fit in one boat.

195
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:39,060
That won't do.
I need the children with me.

196
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,272
- Please!
- Shut up!

197
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,690
Mother!

198
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,443
Priestess, are you sure
they are reliable?

199
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,447
You'll be taken to the right place!

200
00:24:51,615 --> 00:25:00,874
- Mother!
- Mother!

201
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,628
I'll give you all the money.
Please go back.

202
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,757
Please, go back. Please!

203
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:15,138
Mother!

204
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,682
Go back, please!

205
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,980
Please, I beg you! Please!

206
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,775
- Mother!
- Mother!

207
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,862
Please! Go back! Please!

208
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,952
Ubatake!

209
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,216
Those kids over there.

210
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,268
These kids? They're too young!

211
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,981
- They're smart and will be useful.
- How much?

212
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,026
Four and a half silver for one.
Eight silver for both.

213
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,528
They look weak.

214
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,662
I don't want any sick ones.
No, thanks.

215
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,790
Hey! Wait a minute! Hey!

216
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,502
Stop all that sobbing!

217
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,298
Your mother's already been sold to Sado.
Crying won't get you anywhere!

218
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:37,387
That's enough! If you want
to keep crying, you'll get no food.

219
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:49,899
Please, buy them.
I need to get rid of them.

220
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,569
Go to Tango.
Try Sansho the Bailiff.

221
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,572
- Sansho the Bailiff?
- He's the richest man there.

222
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,575
- He'll buy them from you.
- I see.

223
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,954
You'll have a better chance than here.

224
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,341
Hurry up!

225
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,857
Hey! Don't be standing around!

226
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,079
The kids are here.

227
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,343
Bow to the master.

228
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,805
You paid seven silver
for these weaklings?

229
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,224
What can they do here?

230
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:11,147
They're too weak to do rough work.
Maybe they can sweep the yard.

231
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:17,362
No, I spent enough on them.
They need to work as hard as others.

232
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,615
What are your names?

233
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,786
- They won't say, Master.
- Why not?

234
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:30,041
Stubborn kids, eh? Take them away.

235
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,799
Have no mercy on them!

236
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,268
Walk! Walk!

237
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,104
Kinpei!

238
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,399
Kinpei.

239
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,359
- Brother!
- Anju!

240
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,152
You come this way!

241
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,655
Brother!

242
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,368
Anju!

243
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:09,831
Where do you think you're going?
That way. Get going.

244
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,709
Here. A newcomer.
Teach her some work.

245
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,587
- She should be playing with dolls!
- What?

246
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,299
- Are you serious?
- Shut up and get to work!

247
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,428
This is unbelievable. Namiji.

248
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,311
- Here, try holding this.
- Yes.

249
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,983
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

250
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,653
Damn that heartless demon!

251
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:54,792
I don't know who sold you,
but you poor thing!

252
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,302
Get up. Come on.

253
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,692
Brother!

254
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:37,061
Forgive me! Please! I beg you!

255
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:43,234
I wasn't trying to escape!
I really wasn't!

256
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,697
Those kids reminded me
of mine back home.

257
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,490
I just went to the third gate.

258
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,578
Fool!
That's as bad as trying to escape!

259
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,747
Forgive me! Please, forgive me!

260
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:05,923
- What are you going to do?
- Give her what's due, of course.

261
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,429
That's Namiji.

262
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,764
Are they going to kill her?

263
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:18,102
Of course not. If they kill us,
they have one less worker.

264
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,520
Then she will be confined?

265
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:25,443
You don't know what happens?
Look! This is what happens!

266
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,364
I won't do it again!

267
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,243
Please forgive me!
I won't do it again!

268
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,623
She's apologizing.
You don't have to punish her!

269
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,669
They need to be taught a lesson.
Here, you do it, Taro.

270
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,840
You spineless coward!

271
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,650
Don't look.

272
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:12,823
Eat your supper
and start your night work!

273
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,836
Get in here.

274
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,302
Where did you two come from?

275
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,353
Come here. Tell me.

276
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,439
There's no need to be afraid.

277
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,574
Do you have parents?

278
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,493
They sold you?

279
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,496
Father would never sell us!

280
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:05,710
"Father," you say?
You're no peasant's kids.

281
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,714
Why were you sold?
Tell me everything.

282
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,185
Here, have some rice cake.

283
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,939
It's roasted well.

284
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:47,293
A messenger from the minister is
coming, and Taro decides to disappear!

285
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,254
Hey, Kichiji!

286
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,175
Where's Taro? Go find him!

287
00:34:54,342 --> 00:35:00,556
A guest will be here soon.
Get the women ready!

288
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,692
And bring some sake!

289
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:17,364
Even children as young as you
are bought and sold,

290
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,868
treated like animals,
and nobody questions it.

291
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,996
What a horrible world!

292
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,255
Tell me your father's words again.

293
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:38,177
"A man is not a human being
without mercy.

294
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,723
Even if you are hard on yourself,
be merciful to others."

295
00:35:56,071 --> 00:36:00,574
I want to get you back to your parents,
but Sado is far away.

296
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,036
Tsukushi is even farther than that.

297
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,206
It is not a distance
children can travel on their own.

298
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:13,712
Wait until you grow up!
No matter what happens, endure it!

299
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:22,346
I now see why you keep
your names secret,

300
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:28,018
but you will need something.
I will give you names.

301
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:34,108
For you, Mutsu-Waka,
after your birthplace.

302
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:41,156
You will be Shinobu,
to endure through anything.

303
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,118
Understood?

304
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,292
Taro-sama!

305
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,671
There you are.

306
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,090
A messenger from the minister
is about to arrive.

307
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,800
You are needed back in the hall.

308
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:05,180
- Tell my father you couldn't find me.
- He is an important guest from Kyoto!

309
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,853
Come. Let's go.

310
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:20,821
Such a sudden visit.
I thought you had come to scold us.

311
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:27,161
Nonsense. What for?
We only have to thank you.

312
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:32,333
You collect taxes promptly

313
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,586
and provide more tributes
every year. It is a great help to us.

314
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,089
I am honored, sir.

315
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:45,262
You're the most trusted man
among all the bailiffs.

316
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:50,392
The minister insisted that I visit
and study the methods you use

317
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,686
in the handling of your people.

318
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:57,232
Please, I do not deserve such praise.

319
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,530
I am only doing my duty
in managing his lordship's manor.

320
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,617
It is seldom done these days.

321
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,662
The minister appreciates
your work so much

322
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,541
that he's thinking of inviting you
to Kyoto as a reward.

323
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,003
- Is that true, sir?
- Yes.

324
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:25,052
I cannot believe it.
I appreciate his kindness.

325
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:30,015
Kichiji, bring the chest!

326
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,528
This is a humble token
of my gratitude, sir.

327
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,239
This is impressive. Thank you.

328
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,909
This is my son, Taro.
Show your gratitude.

329
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:54,498
You are lucky to have such a father.
Be a dutiful son.

330
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,919
Girls, begin your dance!

331
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,003
Are you asleep?

332
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,868
Take care of yourselves.

333
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,005
Open the gate.

334
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,092
- Where to so late?
- It's none of your business.

335
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:45,043
AFTER TEN YEARS,
THE YOUNG CHILDREN

336
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,006
HAVE DEVELOPED
INTO STURDY YOUNG ADULTS

337
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:53,010
IN SPITE OF THEIR LONG
HARDSHIP AND MISERY.

338
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:57,931
THE WINTER FINDS ZUSHIO,
ALIAS MUTSU, 23 YEARS OLD.

339
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,351
ANJU, KNOWN AS SHINOBU, IS 18.

340
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,837
Brother, wake up.

341
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,757
- What?
- The alarm.

342
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,331
That way! He ran that way!

343
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,547
This way! This way!

344
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,842
Come back here, you!

345
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,013
- Over there!
- Get him!

346
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,891
Why, you!

347
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,185
Catch him!

348
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,689
Get him! Get him!

349
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,449
Let me go! Please!

350
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:45,789
I've been working patiently
for 50 years!

351
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,499
Let me go.

352
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:52,504
I'm already 70.
My days are numbered!

353
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:57,259
Let me die a free man!
I don't want to die here!

354
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,554
Mutsu, you handle this.

355
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:25,203
- Who did the branding?
- It was Mutsu-Waka.

356
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,789
How cruel of him!

357
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,750
He'll die a miserable death.

358
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:35,172
Mutsu is a bad one.
Must be the son of a bandit.

359
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:53,732
Don't worry,
you're not to blame for anything.

360
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,196
- Teach this newcomer.
- Pleased to meet you.

361
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,121
Take care of her.

362
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,314
Look. Like this.

363
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,651
Try it.

364
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,995
- What's your name?
- Kohagi.

365
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,832
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

366
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,918
- Are you a peasant's daughter?
- Yes.

367
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,963
- Where were you sold from?
- Sado.

368
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,257
Sado?

369
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:05,679
Do you happen to know
a woman named Tamaki?

370
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,180
No.

371
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:11,852
She was sold 10 years ago.
She was 35 or 36 then.

372
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,646
She must be 45 or 46 by now.

373
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:19,359
I'm sorry. Sado is a big island.

374
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,916
Are you in pain again, Namiji-san?

375
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,879
I feel as though a heavy stone
is in my stomach.

376
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,590
You're getting worse.

377
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,010
I can't rest unless I die.

378
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,430
We're not human beings.

379
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:56,104
Why does the rest of the world
turn its back on us?

380
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:00,984
What are you saying?
You're talking like a newcomer.

381
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:08,783
I have to get back to work. You too.

382
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:25,133
Zushio, how I long for you

383
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:39,940
Isn't life a torture?

384
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:52,452
Anju, how I long for you

385
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:02,963
Isn't life a torture?

386
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,216
Hey, what song are you singing?

387
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,762
What is it called?

388
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,474
It goes, "Zushio, how I long for you.
Anju, how I long for you."

389
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,643
Who taught you that?

390
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,853
It became a popular song in Sado.

391
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,148
Who first sang such a sad song?

392
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,733
A courtesan, they say.

393
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,487
- A courtesan?
- Yes, named Nakagimi.

394
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,325
Do you think she's still alive?

395
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,495
I don't know.

396
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,999
"Zushio, how I long for you.
Isn't life a torture?

397
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,961
Anju, how I long for you.
Isn't life a torture?" Is that right?

398
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,339
- Sing it again.
- Yes.

399
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:57,809
Zushio, how I long for you

400
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:12,616
Isn't life a torture?

401
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:23,126
Anju, how I long for you

402
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:33,386
Isn't life a torture?

403
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,263
It's Mother!

404
00:49:39,185 --> 00:50:05,627
Isn't life a torture?

405
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,409
Wait! Please, wait!

406
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:44,124
Take me too! Please, take me!

407
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,043
This is all the money I have!

408
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:51,715
Row off, quickly! Please!

409
00:50:55,886 --> 00:51:00,515
Nakagimi! Not again.
We're going back!

410
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,274
She's impossible!

411
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,860
Cut her tendon
so she can't run away!

412
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:18,366
Please, I won't do it again!
Please have mercy on me!

413
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,993
Shut up!

414
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,924
Please forgive me!

415
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:49,022
Remember, girls.
Runaways are punished like this!

416
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:35,360
Too bad, Nakagimi-san.
We can't see the mainland today.

417
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:07,892
Zushio.

418
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:16,943
Anju.

419
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:12,081
Anju, stop it! Stop singing.

420
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:17,962
It's the first news about Mother
we've heard.

421
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,673
Don't you care?

422
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,802
Don't you think of Father
and Mother anymore?

423
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,722
Don't you want to see them again?

424
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,059
What's the use of wanting?

425
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:36,189
If we escape, we'll find a way.

426
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:42,779
How? We don't have any money.
How will we look for them?

427
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,782
Just look at us. It's better
not to meet them like this.

428
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,661
So we'll go to Kyoto
and become somebodies.

429
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,830
Become somebodies?
Stop dreaming.

430
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:57,460
Despite our births,
we're servants now. Slaves!

431
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,462
Who'd bother with us?

432
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:04,509
You'll be sold to a brothel.
I'll become a thief.

433
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:08,680
Or we'll both be beggars.

434
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,975
You already have the heart of a bandit!

435
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,978
A soul lower than that of a beggar!

436
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:21,859
How can you brand
an old man's forehead like that?

437
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,779
How can you be so brutal?

438
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,032
Did you forget Father's words?

439
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,536
Don't you feel shame
before the goddess of mercy?

440
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,331
Brother!

441
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,503
How could you?

442
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,132
It does me no good!

443
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:49,929
It's better to be loyal to the bailiff
and get on his good side.

444
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,933
You have changed.

445
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:26,591
Mutsu, Namiji isn't going to make it.
Go dump her in the mountains.

446
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:45,151
Namiji is like our sister.

447
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,989
Please let her die here.

448
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,997
- Take her, Mutsu.
- Yes.

449
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,793
Don't take her, brother.

450
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:06,422
She's still alive.
Don't give her to wild birds.

451
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,591
It's the bailiff's orders.

452
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,963
Another dead one?

453
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,758
This one's still alive.

454
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,803
- Take them.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,391
Open the gate.

456
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,409
Not you!

457
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:33,426
When you're reincarnated,
be born to a good family!

458
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:39,140
Be born to a rich family!

459
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,463
Hey, hurry up.

460
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:25,853
I tied this to the Buddha,
so hold it tight.

461
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,321
And this is the goddess of mercy.

462
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:40,159
You'll be born fortunate
in your next life.

463
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,595
Ready?

464
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:06,143
That's too ruthless. Please let me
protect her from the frost.

465
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,021
Make it quick.

466
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,690
Brother, help me.

467
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:37,443
Brother, doesn't this remind you
of the time we camped near Naoe Port?

468
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:46,160
Mother had us gather straw and grass
like this, remember?

469
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,290
Zushio!

470
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:56,796
Anju!

471
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,216
Oh, Mother is calling us!

472
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:10,476
Zushio!

473
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:20,796
Anju, let's run away.

474
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,506
What?

475
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,258
Let's escape!

476
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,058
You mean it?

477
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,240
Then hurry!

478
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,701
- Go alone.
- What about you?

479
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,329
We'll get caught if we're together.

480
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:58,334
I'll delay them. Meanwhile,
run away as fast as you can.

481
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:05,007
They say there is a temple
at Nakayama. You'll be safe there.

482
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,969
I can't leave you. They'll torture you.

483
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,725
They don't kill slaves very often.

484
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,560
Don't worry.

485
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,105
They'll catch us
if we run away together.

486
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,816
If you go alone, you'll be all right.

487
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:27,321
Don't worry about me.

488
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:34,286
If you can, take Namiji-san with you.

489
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:42,294
Go while I talk with the gatekeeper.

490
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,632
The amulet is on Namiji's chest.

491
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,971
Wait for me.

492
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:56,225
I'll come back for you,
even if it's the last thing I do!

493
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,493
My brother will do the rest.

494
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,495
What?

495
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:21,000
Thank you for waiting. My brother
will handle the rest. Let's go.

496
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:26,672
I hope I don't end up like that.
Let's go, quickly.

497
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,156
Come, Namiji-san, let's go.

498
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,648
Your brother is taking a long time.

499
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,900
He'll come soon.

500
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,763
What happened?

501
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,433
He's late.

502
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,561
Hey.

503
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,398
You go look.

504
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,641
He's gone! He's gone!

505
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,728
- He ran away!
- What?

506
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:50,441
You slut!
You must be behind this.

507
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:55,404
Kayano, watch her!
Get more men!

508
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,219
Master! Bailiff!

509
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:22,931
- What happened?
- What is it?

510
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,059
- Mutsu the slave escaped!
- Escaped?

511
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:29,521
- And Shinobu?
- She's at the gate.

512
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,399
Torture her. She must know
where he's headed.

513
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:37,362
Hurry and search the village!
Hurry up!

514
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:43,911
You know where Mutsu went,
don't you?

515
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:55,214
I believe you're determined
not to say at any cost,

516
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:59,384
but you'll be talking
after they torture you.

517
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,307
No torture...

518
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:10,562
can make a dead person speak.

519
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:29,790
It's too late for you to outrun them.

520
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:44,429
Tie me up here and go
before it's too late.

521
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,266
Thank you, Kayano-san.

522
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,110
Now go.

523
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,828
Hurry. Hurry.

524
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,291
Farewell. Farewell.

525
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:17,170
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

526
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:33,312
Search throughout the gorge.

527
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,522
Come on, run!

528
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,236
Which way?

529
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:17,064
Zushio, how I long for you

530
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:32,537
Isn't life a torture?

531
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:41,964
Anju, how I long for you

532
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:59,773
Isn't life a torture?

533
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,876
Move away!

534
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,465
Check the back!

535
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:14,639
Where is he? Don't lose him!

536
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,478
Over here!

537
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,646
Over there!

538
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,816
That way!

539
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,448
Damn it.

540
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,742
Look! This way!

541
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,160
What?

542
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:39,664
Have you found him?

543
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,425
Where did he go?

544
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,228
We have been sent by the bailiff
in search of a runaway!

545
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:04,481
He must be hiding here!
Hand him over!

546
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:07,651
If you refuse, you will be punished
by the minister.

547
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:13,115
You come bearing arms
as if a riot has broken out.

548
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:18,411
Seeking one of your servants, eh?

549
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:24,042
No one gets shelter here
without my permission.

550
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:28,088
As I haven't given any,
he can't be here.

551
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,264
And may I remind you
this is an imperial temple.

552
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,185
Look.

553
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,564
IMPERIAL TEMPLE
PROVINCE OF TANGO

554
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,651
It is the imperial signature.

555
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,613
Trespassers will be severely punished!

556
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,576
Leave quietly. For your own good.

557
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,786
I saw him!

558
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:02,497
He went in that direction!

559
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,752
Southward, along the wall!
Hurry! You'll probably catch him.

560
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,423
Let's go!

561
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,762
Go left!

562
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,768
Go in the back alley!

563
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,237
How is she doing?

564
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:19,449
Thanks to your medicine,
she's gotten better.

565
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:25,747
- Good. I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you very much.

566
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,375
I'm so glad.

567
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,183
What are your plans?

568
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:51,189
Taro-sama, I have a favor
to ask of you.

569
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:58,363
Can you keep Namiji-san here?

570
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:04,577
I would be happy to,
but what about you?

571
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,080
I plan to go to Kyoto.

572
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,709
Who is the most powerful man there?

573
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:14,462
Well...

574
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:20,051
the chief advisor to the emperor,
I should say. But why?

575
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,053
Taro-sama...

576
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:27,600
why did you leave
your father's house?

577
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:32,355
Do you intend to appeal
to the chief advisor?

578
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,232
Yes, sir.

579
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:45,952
I had the same idea
and went to Kyoto too.

580
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:51,583
But it wasn't as easy as I thought.

581
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:55,253
My single-handed efforts proved futile.

582
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:03,428
I found that humans
have little sympathy

583
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:08,475
for things that don't
directly concern them.

584
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,102
They're ruthless.

585
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:17,442
Unless those hearts
can be changed,

586
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,071
the world you dream of
cannot come true.

587
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:29,996
If you wish to live honestly
with your conscience...

588
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:35,126
keep close to the Buddha.

589
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,005
With all due respect...

590
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:45,553
this is something I must do,
no matter what the cost.

591
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,849
I see.

592
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:56,981
Then do as you wish.
You have a difficult road ahead of you.

593
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,777
I am prepared for that.

594
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,737
Very well.

595
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:08,743
I shall ask the priest to write
a letter to the chief advisor.

596
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:12,872
Thank you very much.
Thank you so very much.

597
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,430
Please, my lord,
if I may have a word!

598
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:19,142
Please! Please, my lord!

599
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:25,023
I am the son of the former deputy
governor of Mutsu! Please, my lord!

600
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,150
- Get back!
- Please!

601
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:31,195
I have here a letter from Priest Donmo
of the temple in Nakayama!

602
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,575
I'm doing this
as I was refused at the gate!

603
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:39,787
- Please! I beg you!
- Call the guards!

604
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,040
- Please!
- Stay away!

605
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,125
Please! Please!

606
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,712
I beg you!

607
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:06,606
Please, listen to me!
Please! Please!

608
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:12,403
Please! I beg of you! Please!

609
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,882
Where did you steal this from?

610
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:37,053
I didn't steal it!
It is my family's treasure!

611
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:42,016
Return it to me!

612
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,394
That's my father's keepsake!

613
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:49,232
Please give it back to me!

614
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,654
Please, for God's sake,
give it back to me!

615
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:26,644
Come out!

616
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,986
Don't send me back to Sansho
the Bailiff! Please! Please!

617
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,698
Don't worry.
His lordship has sent for you.

618
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:40,658
You're a lucky fellow.

619
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,203
Come out.
You must not keep him waiting.

620
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,114
- I have brought him.
- Come this way.

621
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,261
He is here, my lord.

622
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,723
Good.

623
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:54,732
Raise your head.

624
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,569
The letter you bring
claims you are the son

625
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,073
of Masauji Taira of Mutsu.
Is that true?

626
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,325
Yes, your lordship.

627
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,577
The statue you had
in your possession

628
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,997
originally belonged to
one of my forefathers, Michinaga.

629
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:15,711
He gave it to your family in recognition
of their good works. Did you know that?

630
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:20,299
I was only told that it was a treasure
handed down in our family.

631
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:24,762
My father left it with me
when he was sent to Tsukushi.

632
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:28,558
Your lordship!
Was what my father did a crime?

633
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,727
Is it unlawful to love your people?

634
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:38,025
No, but one must obey
his superior officer.

635
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:45,241
However, your father argued
with arrogant military men.

636
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:47,869
He is a man of extraordinary courage.

637
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,621
You knew about that, my lord?

638
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:55,084
Had I been in office,
things would have been different.

639
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:58,588
Then will you pardon him now?

640
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:02,842
It would make little difference now.

641
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:09,307
Zushio, do not let this dishearten you.

642
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:16,480
Your father has already departed
this transient life.

643
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:21,777
When did it happen, my lord?

644
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:25,197
After reading your letter,
I took the liberty to investigate.

645
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:30,077
He passed away
during the spring of last year.

646
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:44,508
I sympathize with you
and the hardships you have endured.

647
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,398
In recognition of his achievement
and efforts,

648
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:03,527
I am arranging for you
to succeed your father's title.

649
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:09,450
For me? For me, my lord?

650
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:12,995
The post of governor
of Tango is vacant.

651
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:15,748
I will give you that post.

652
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:18,292
- Governor?
- Right.

653
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:26,467
Masamichi Taira is created a peer
of the Junior Grade of the Fifth Rank.

654
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:50,157
"Masamichi Taira, of the Fifth Rank,
is hereby appointed governor of Tango."

655
01:28:55,747 --> 01:29:00,084
This is the imperial prescript
of your post. Come closer.

656
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:10,344
I have chosen a name
befitting a governor.

657
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:14,265
Call yourself Masamichi Taira
from now on.

658
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:16,600
Visit your father's tomb.

659
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,061
Thank you, my lord.

660
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:25,317
My father may be dead,
but my mother and sister will be delighted.

661
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:28,279
Now I can make
a happy life for them.

662
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:33,784
I can also liberate the slaves

663
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,495
from the infernal house of Sansho.

664
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:40,499
What? Liberate slaves?

665
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,418
Nonsense.

666
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:47,381
Yura Manor is the property
of the Minister of the Right.

667
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:53,554
A governor isn't authorized
to interfere with a private manor.

668
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:58,642
How do you expect to carry out
your duties without knowing that?

669
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:01,979
Carefully reconsider your limitations.

670
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,900
Understand?

671
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:17,203
Imagine, the governor of Tango
coming all the way to Tsukushi.

672
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:22,750
His lordship is the son
of Lord Masauji who died here.

673
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:26,170
He came before going to his post.

674
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,673
A truly dutiful son.

675
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:50,903
My regret is that I could not come
while he was still alive.

676
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,636
I see so many flowers.

677
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:28,399
Have you been keeping them
on his grave like this?

678
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:34,446
No, sir. They are from those
who remember his kindness.

679
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:38,951
Your father was kind
to everyone he met,

680
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,496
especially the unfortunate peasants.

681
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:46,667
Your father taught them
how to read and write

682
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,837
and how to live a moral life.

683
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,871
I am Judge Norimura, my lord.

684
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,333
We congratulate you
on your new post

685
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:31,128
and humbly welcome you
and wish you a smooth transition.

686
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,672
Thank you for welcoming me.

687
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:03,160
I'm Murotsuna, my lord.

688
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,163
Narisada, my lord.

689
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:09,166
Toneyasu, my lord.

690
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:15,214
I want to do something in lieu
of announcing my arrival.

691
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,384
All but Norimura and his staff may go.

692
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:31,188
I want to issue a decree.
Take note.

693
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:38,028
"In this province,
the sale of human beings

694
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,949
is forbidden
under penalty of law.

695
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:48,580
The use of slaves
shall be prohibited

696
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:51,542
on both government lands
and private manors."

697
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:56,213
Is this an order from the capital?

698
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,924
No, it is my own.

699
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:03,762
Yours? Are you sure you want
to issue such a decree?

700
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,848
Do you think I am joking?

701
01:34:06,016 --> 01:34:09,643
I am sure you have your reasons,

702
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:14,732
but you must admit this is reckless
even for your young age.

703
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,443
Reckless?
What is reckless about it?

704
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:20,195
- I have more.
- One moment.

705
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:24,908
A governor only has jurisdiction
over government land.

706
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:27,745
Manors are private property, sir.

707
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:31,081
Interfering with them
will bring serious consequences,

708
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:35,753
especially when the manor belongs
to the Minister of the Right.

709
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,132
Its bailiff, Sansho,
is a difficult adversary.

710
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,844
I want to liberate Sansho's slaves.

711
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,512
What are you saying, my lord?

712
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:51,352
He is an official
personally appointed by the minister.

713
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:56,273
His slaves are the property
of the minister himself.

714
01:34:56,441 --> 01:35:00,361
As their guardian,
the bailiff will fight you!

715
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,946
- I don't want to hear any more.
- That's not all, sir.

716
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:04,782
Should this reach the capital,

717
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:09,745
the minister will undoubtedly move
to have you discharged.

718
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,206
You may be exiled!

719
01:35:12,374 --> 01:35:17,461
Your very life might be in danger!

720
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:23,884
I do not understand where you got
such an extraordinary idea,

721
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,054
but please give it up
for your own good.

722
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:31,308
- Norimura, you wish to disobey me?
- No, my lord!

723
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:33,560
Continue.

724
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:40,818
"Liberated slaves shall be granted
the choice of being sent home

725
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,821
or staying on the land
as employees,

726
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:48,075
to be paid fairly in money or land."

727
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,535
That is all.

728
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:53,372
Publish this throughout the province.
Understood?

729
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,084
Norimura.

730
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:07,344
I want you to go to Sansho's
and fetch a girl named Shinobu.

731
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,180
A girl named Shinobu, sir?

732
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,933
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

733
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:37,374
- There is no such girl here.
- No? Are you sure?

734
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:41,920
Even if she were, a local official
cannot make demands to see her.

735
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:47,134
Remember, this is the manor
of the Minister of the Right.

736
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:49,887
No governor can butt in here.

737
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,599
Go while the going's still good!

738
01:36:56,394 --> 01:37:00,022
Off with you! Go away!

739
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,232
Go!

740
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,252
- Did you turn him away?
- Of course.

741
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:28,133
The fool. Why would he want
Shinobu anyway?

742
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:31,470
But don't let your guard down.
Stand on alert.

743
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:38,101
What nonsense.

744
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:47,361
I don't understand it at all.

745
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,458
"The buying and selling
of human beings

746
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:07,798
and use of slaves are prohibited
in this province of Tango.

747
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:11,635
Violators will be severely punished.

748
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:16,056
Issued November 25 in the seventh
year of Kanji by the governor of Tango."

749
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,560
Who is this new governor?

750
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:25,816
He must be absolutely crazy!
We're going to make him pay!

751
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:34,700
Dispatch a courier to Kyoto.
Let the minister know of this at once.

752
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:36,326
Yes, sir.

753
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:43,333
Be sure the slaves don't hear this.

754
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:48,672
Those morons are liable
to start meaningless trouble.

755
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:56,138
And tear down all of the notices
as fast as you can!

756
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:08,650
Go away!

757
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:15,991
No buying and selling of slaves?
Tear it down.

758
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:32,883
- What does it say?
- I can't read!

759
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,890
Destroy it!

760
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:04,498
- The governor's notice!
- We're free!

761
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:22,265
Hold it there!

762
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:47,958
Let's go!

763
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,258
Ready my men!

764
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:59,803
Please, sir!
As noble as your idea is -

765
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:02,431
You couldn't possibly understand!

766
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:06,643
Think of those
who rot in that earthly hell!

767
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:08,979
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.

768
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:38,175
They have arrived, Master.

769
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:43,513
It is a privilege to welcome you.

770
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:49,144
I'm afraid there is nothing to offer you,
as this is so sudden.

771
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:54,399
It has been a while, bailiff.

772
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:01,364
Mutsu-Waka!

773
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,576
I am Masamichi, governor of Tango.

774
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:14,544
You have changed.
I apologize for not recognizing you.

775
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:18,131
Do make yourself at home, please.

776
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,550
- Bring some drinks.
- Don't bother.

777
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:22,385
I do not come as a friend.

778
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:27,224
You and your men are under arrest.

779
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:34,564
- What for? What have I done wrong?
- Silence!

780
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:38,068
Destroying the governor's signpost
is crime enough.

781
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:45,659
Oh, do you mean
those lawless notices? I see.

782
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:51,206
Now I know how they got there.
However, this manor belongs to -

783
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:54,960
- I already know!
- Then all the more reason

784
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:59,923
your recklessness is sure
to rebound on you.

785
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,592
I recommend you promptly
repeal your decree.

786
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:07,222
If you do, I will not report this
to the minister.

787
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:13,728
I don't know how you rose
to this position of yours,

788
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:18,984
but a slave becoming a governor,
that's a true fairy tale!

789
01:43:19,235 --> 01:43:23,530
- You should not spoil it.
- Is that all you have to say?

790
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:27,117
You need not inquire about me.

791
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:30,912
Your property shall be confiscated
and you will be exiled. Arrest him!

792
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,540
Release me!

793
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:36,084
Who do you think you're dealing with?

794
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:38,587
Whose house do you think this is?

795
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:46,303
Prepare yourself for the punishment
that will fall for attacking this manor!

796
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,346
Let me go!

797
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,519
Release me!

798
01:43:55,313 --> 01:43:57,355
I'm telling you to release me!

799
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:04,738
Listen carefully, friends.

800
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:11,161
In this place of Tango,
slave trade has been banned.

801
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:15,040
On both government land
and in private manors,

802
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:18,501
the use of slaves
has been prohibited.

803
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:26,885
From this moment on, you are no longer
the property of Sansho the Bailiff.

804
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:31,348
You are all now free!

805
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:37,145
You may go home if you wish.

806
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:41,316
You may stay here and work.

807
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:44,194
You will be paid

808
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:48,865
or given land as your own.

809
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:57,415
Niou.

810
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:07,467
Oh, Mutsu-Waka!

811
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:15,058
My sins in branding you
can never be erased,

812
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:21,106
but I ask you to let this
make up for part of it.

813
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:29,322
Anju.

814
01:45:30,366 --> 01:45:32,200
Did you hear me?

815
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:35,954
Shinobu, I mean. Did you hear me?

816
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:38,748
Hey.

817
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:41,960
Where is my sister?

818
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:45,797
Where is she?

819
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,091
What happened?

820
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,760
Tell me.

821
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:55,640
She passed away.

822
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:57,517
He killed her?

823
01:45:58,436 --> 01:46:00,437
No.

824
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:20,123
Why didn't you wait for me?

825
01:46:21,917 --> 01:46:25,295
I truly believed you would.

826
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:30,091
It was your great faith

827
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:34,512
that gave me back my life.

828
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,226
Why didn't you wait
for your brother's return?

829
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:02,183
Sansho's house is on fire, sir.

830
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:03,768
What?

831
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:32,797
He and his family
have already been exiled, sir.

832
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,934
TO THE CHIEF ADVISOR

833
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:56,029
Submit this letter to the chief advisor.
It is my resignation.

834
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,614
What?

835
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:04,829
Perhaps you think it very strange,

836
01:49:05,164 --> 01:49:10,585
but those who shared in my suffering
will appreciate my actions.

837
01:49:23,224 --> 01:49:26,309
I am going to Sado tomorrow.
Please make the preparations.

838
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:27,936
Yes, sir.

839
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:49,332
All aboard.

840
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:53,920
The boat is leaving.

841
01:49:58,175 --> 01:50:00,551
Come on, hurry.

842
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:13,314
You are not coming aboard?
What's the matter?

843
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:19,737
I'm looking for a woman named
Nakagimi. Can you help me?

844
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:22,407
Nakagimi? She must be a courtesan.

845
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:28,538
There are brothels over there.
They can tell you.

846
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:07,577
I want to see Nakagimi.
Is she one of you?

847
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:11,873
- Yeah, she is.
- Where?

848
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:13,833
That house.

849
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:18,629
She's getting ready.

850
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:43,738
Nakagimi-san?

851
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:54,791
- Nakagimi-san?
- Who is it?

852
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:04,175
Welcome. Come here.

853
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:08,262
Are you really Nakagimi-san?

854
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:13,184
Of course.
I'm the one and only Nakagimi.

855
01:52:13,394 --> 01:52:16,104
Come here.

856
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:18,773
Well?

857
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,444
What's the matter?

858
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,823
Come have a good time.

859
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:31,536
Why are you leaving?

860
01:52:33,831 --> 01:52:36,666
You cheapskate!

861
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,045
Are you penniless?

862
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:43,464
You big prize fool!

863
01:52:44,341 --> 01:52:46,342
You were rejected!

864
01:52:54,726 --> 01:52:56,477
What's wrong?

865
01:52:56,895 --> 01:53:01,566
It wasn't her. I'm looking for
a woman over 40.

866
01:53:01,733 --> 01:53:05,445
Oh, you must mean
the former Nakagimi-san.

867
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:09,949
- Do you know her?
- She's dead now, I think.

868
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,704
She was found dead by the cape.

869
01:53:14,872 --> 01:53:17,623
Or was it that
she jumped into the sea?

870
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,584
You're all wrong.

871
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:24,630
She was killed by
the big tsunami two years ago.

872
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:29,469
Are you a relative or something?

873
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:32,013
Where did it happen?

874
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,225
Beyond that cape over there.

875
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:52,301
Excuse me. I heard that this area
was hit by a tsunami two years ago.

876
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:54,053
That's right.

877
01:54:54,221 --> 01:55:01,018
The village lost nine or ten
to the vicious waves.

878
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:05,481
Many bodies haven't
been discovered yet.

879
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:13,489
Why do you want to hear
about that tsunami?

880
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:30,840
Isn't life a torture?

881
01:55:39,224 --> 01:55:48,858
Zushio, how I long for you

882
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:27,563
Anju, how I long for you

883
01:56:49,461 --> 01:57:09,814
Isn't life a torture?

884
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:25,913
Anju, how I long for you

885
01:57:32,796 --> 01:57:34,463
Mother!

886
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:41,762
It's me, Zushio.

887
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,975
You wretched being.

888
01:57:46,143 --> 01:57:51,313
You've come to try and fool me again.

889
01:58:03,702 --> 01:58:05,995
Go away.

890
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:07,747
Mother.

891
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:15,671
You can't fool me anymore.

892
01:58:57,923 --> 01:58:59,715
Mother.

893
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,597
Here.

894
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:52,309
It is the goddess of mercy
that Father gave me.

895
02:00:09,536 --> 02:00:11,203
Zushio?

896
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:28,304
Are you truly...?

897
02:00:28,638 --> 02:00:30,973
Do you recognize me?

898
02:00:32,142 --> 02:00:35,060
I've come for you, Mother.

899
02:00:40,317 --> 02:00:46,989
Zushio.

900
02:00:58,293 --> 02:01:02,004
Are you alone?

901
02:01:05,926 --> 02:01:08,302
Anju is with you, right?

902
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:13,849
Anju - where is she?

903
02:01:14,601 --> 02:01:17,853
Please, let me see her.
Right away.

904
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:20,272
Anju has...

905
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,192
Anju has gone to join Father.

906
02:01:26,237 --> 02:01:28,155
Your father?

907
02:01:28,865 --> 02:01:31,241
Is he doing well?

908
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:38,207
No, Mother. It's just you and I.

909
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:41,710
We're all alone now.

910
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:10,572
I could have come for you

911
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:13,450
as a governor...

912
02:02:14,995 --> 02:02:21,500
but I gave up my title in order
to follow Father's teachings.

913
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:26,005
Please, Mother, forgive me!

914
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:43,022
What nonsense do you speak of?

915
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:48,986
I don't know what you have done...

916
02:02:52,115 --> 02:02:56,368
but I know that you followed
your father's teachings.

917
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:01,081
And that is why...

918
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:09,673
we have been able to meet again.

919
02:04:12,237 --> 02:04:18,617
THE END

920

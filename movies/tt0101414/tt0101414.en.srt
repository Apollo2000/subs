2
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,959
Once upon a time
in a faraway land...

3
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:27,005
a young prince
lived in a shining castle.

4
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,258
Although he had everything
his heart desired...

5
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:35,972
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

6
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,266
But then,
one winter's night...

7
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,977
an old beggar woman
came to the castle...

8
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,980
and offered him
a single rose...

9
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,442
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

10
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,944
Repulsed by her
haggard appearance...

11
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:54,949
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.

12
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,494
But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances...

13
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,748
for beauty is found within.

14
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,669
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away...

15
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,673
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

16
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,759
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late...

17
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:17,513
for she had seen that
there was no love in his heart.

18
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:21,225
And as punishment, she transformed him
into a hideous beast...

19
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:26,898
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.

20
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,483
Ashamed of
his monstrous form...

21
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,570
the beast concealed himself
inside his castle...

22
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:38,200
with a magic mirror as
his only window to the outside world.

23
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,578
The rose she had offered...

24
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,164
was truly an enchanted rose...

25
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,834
which would bloom
until his 21 st year.

26
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,629
If he could learn
to love another...

27
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:54,759
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell...

28
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,137
then the spell
would be broken.

29
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,890
If not,
he would be doomed...

30
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:05,478
to remain a beast
for all time.

31
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,646
As the years passed...

32
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,194
he fell into despair
and lost all hope...

33
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,364
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

34
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,188
Little town
It's a quiet village

35
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:54,151
Every day
like the one before

36
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,614
Little town
full of little people

37
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:03,911
Waking up to say

38
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:11,752
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

39
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,005
The same old
bread and rolls to sell

40
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,007
Every morning
just the same

41
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,801
Since the morning
that we came

42
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,428
- To this poor provincial town
- Good morning, Belle.

43
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,389
- Morning, monsieur.
- Where you off to?

44
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,642
The bookshop. I just finished
the most wonderful story...

45
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,186
- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.

46
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,564
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!

47
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:36,068
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question

48
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,530
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell

49
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,242
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud

50
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,538
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle

51
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,540
- Bonjour
- Good day

52
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,250
How is your family

53
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,377
- Bonjour
- Good day

54
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,087
How is your wife

55
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,590
- I need six eggs
- That's too expensive

56
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:02,803
There must be more
than this provincial life

57
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,264
- Ah, Belle!
- Good morning.

58
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,225
- I've come to return the book I borrowed.
- Finished already?

59
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,894
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

60
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,771
Not since yesterday.

61
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,233
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.

62
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,777
That one?
But you've read it twice!

63
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,988
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places...

64
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,241
daring sword fights, magic spells,
a prince in disguise.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,494
If you like it all that much,
it's yours.

66
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,204
- But, sir!
- I insist.

67
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,374
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

68
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,086
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar

69
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,423
I wonder if
she's feeling well

70
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,926
- With a dreamy, far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book

71
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,055
What a puzzle
to the rest of us is Belle

72
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,641
Oh

73
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,270
Isn't this amazing

74
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,856
It's my favourite part

75
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:02,571
Because you'll see

76
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:08,743
Here's where
she meets Prince Charming

77
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,914
But she won't
discover that it's him

78
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,376
Till chapter three

79
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,003
Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!

80
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,882
Now it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

81
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,093
Her looks have got
no parallel

82
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,847
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

83
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,765
Very different
from the rest of us

84
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,601
She's nothing like the rest of us

85
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,563
Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle

86
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,446
Wow! You didn't
miss a shot, Gaston!

87
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,324
- You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!
- I know.

88
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,868
No beast alive stands
a chance against you...

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,829
- and no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, Lefou.

90
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,373
And I've got my sights
set on that one.

91
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,834
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one!

92
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,128
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...

93
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,380
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...

94
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,841
That makes her the best!

95
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,678
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course! I mean, you do!

96
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,640
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

97
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,977
I said she's gorgeous
and I fell

98
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,021
Here in town
there's only she

99
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,856
Who is beautiful as me

100
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,985
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

101
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,947
Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy

102
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,159
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute

103
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,787
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing

104
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,334
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute

105
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,543
- Bonjour
- Good day

106
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,629
- You call this bacon
- What lovely grapes

107
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,922
- Some cheese
- Ten yards

108
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,174
- Excuse me - I'll get the
knife - Please let me through

109
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,469
- This bread, it's stale - Those
fish, they smell - Madame's mistaken

110
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,306
There must be more than
this provincial life

111
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,518
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

112
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,813
Look, there she goes, a girl
who's strange but special

113
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,150
A most peculiar
mademoiselle

114
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,654
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

115
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,073
'Cause she really is
a funny girl

116
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:16,746
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

117
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,917
That Belle

118
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,966
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.

119
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,052
Gaston, may I have
my book, please?

120
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,679
How can you read this?
There's no pictures!

121
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,057
Well, some people
use their imagination.

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,768
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books...

123
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,521
and paid attention
to more important things.

124
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,272
Like me.

125
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,026
The whole town's
talking about it.

126
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,111
It's not right
for a woman to read.

127
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,906
Soon she starts
getting ideas and thinking.

128
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:56,160
- Gaston, you are positively primeval.
- Why, thank you, Belle.

129
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,496
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern...

130
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,582
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.

131
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,086
- What's wrong with her? -
She's crazy. - He's gorgeous!

132
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,756
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.

133
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,383
Goodbye.

134
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,262
That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.

135
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,389
Don't talk about
my father that way!

136
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,058
Yeah! Don't talk about
her father that way!

137
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,477
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius!

138
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:39,412
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?

139
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,164
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?

140
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,585
I- I'm a... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.

141
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,755
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!

142
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,758
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!

143
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,178
Yes, you will, and you'll win
first prize at the fair tomorrow.

144
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,349
- Hmph!
- And become a world-famous inventor.

145
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,145
- You really believe that?
- I always have.

146
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,566
Well, what are we waitin' for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.

147
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,819
Hand me that... the... the...
the dog-legged clincher there.

148
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,738
So, did you have a good time
in town today?

149
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,116
I got a new book.

150
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,160
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

151
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,288
My daughter? Odd?

152
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,373
Where would you get
an idea like that?

153
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:28,794
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I fit in here.

154
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,879
There's no one I can really talk to.

155
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,466
What about that Gaston?
H- He's a handsome fella.

156
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,262
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...

157
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:42,349
- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
- Well, don't you worry...

158
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,270
'cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.

159
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:49,273
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.

160
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:07,291
- It works!
- It does?

161
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:09,418
- It does!
- You did it!

162
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,420
You really did it!

163
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,757
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!

164
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,052
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck!

165
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,222
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.

166
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,117
We should be there by now.

167
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,369
Maybe we missed a turn.

168
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,748
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.

169
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,171
No. Let's go this way.

170
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:08,435
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.

171
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,541
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?

172
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,336
We better turn around.

173
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:39,716
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.

174
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,263
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!

175
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:51,770
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!

176
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:55,857
Back up, back up, back up!

177
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,653
Good boy! Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!

178
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,364
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.

179
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,200
Steady. No, Philippe!

180
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,626
Philippe?

181
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,088
Oh.

182
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,363
Help!
Is... Is someone there?

183
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,948
Help!

184
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,079
Oh!

185
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,270
Wha... Oh!

186
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,610
Hello?

187
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,239
Hello!

188
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,658
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.

189
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:31,786
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.

190
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,914
Is someone there?

191
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:37,625
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word!

192
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,005
I- I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse...

193
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,966
and... and I need a place
to stay for the night.

194
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:47,176
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

195
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,595
Shh!

196
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,014
O- O-Ow! Ow! Ow!

197
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,307
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.

198
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,934
Who said that?

199
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,936
Over here.

200
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,105
- Where?
- Hello.

201
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,360
Incredible!

202
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,279
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.

203
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:09,157
Splendid! Just peachy!

204
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,618
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once!

205
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:15,288
Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.
Stop that, I say!

206
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:24,088
Sir, close that at once!

207
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,549
- Do you mind?
- I-I beg your pardon?

208
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:29,969
It's... It's just that I've
never seen a clock that...

209
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,563
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, monsieur.

210
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,732
Come.
Warm yourself by the fire.

211
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:46,193
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!

212
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,321
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

213
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:51,991
I demand that you stop
right there!

214
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:55,328
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!

215
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,291
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!

216
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:04,045
Well, hello there, boy.

217
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:10,551
- Oh, what service!
- All right!

218
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,888
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...

219
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:17,850
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.

220
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,187
No! No tea. No tea!

221
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:26,358
His mustache tickles, Mama!

222
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:29,737
Oh! Hello!

223
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,618
Uh-oh.

224
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,378
There's a stranger here.

225
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:49,673
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.

226
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:52,009
He was cold and wet, so...

227
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,515
Master, I'd like to take
this moment to say...

228
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,808
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.

229
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:03,020
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...

230
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,444
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

231
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,947
I- I-I was lost in the woods and...

232
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,117
- You are not welcome here!
- I-I-I'm sorry.

233
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,328
- What are you staring at?
- N-Nothing.

234
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:23,082
So, you've come to stare
at the beast, have you?

235
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:26,585
Please, I meant no harm!
I- I just needed a place to stay.

236
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:31,590
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!

237
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:40,682
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?

238
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,602
Yep, this is her lucky day.

239
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:49,775
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

240
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:53,445
First I better go in there
and propose to the girl.

241
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:58,492
And you, Lefou, now, when
Belle and I come out that door...

242
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:01,203
Oh, I know! I know!
I- I strike up the band!

243
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,459
- Not yet!
- Sorry.

244
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:18,762
Oh!

245
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:22,182
Gaston,
what a pleasant surprise.

246
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:25,602
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

247
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:30,065
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in
town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.

248
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:31,733
This is the day...

249
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,322
This is the day
your dreams come true.

250
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:40,284
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

251
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,620
Plenty!
Here. Picture this.

252
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:48,875
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fire...

253
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,004
and my little wife
massaging my feet...

254
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:54,923
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.

255
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,217
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?

256
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,844
No, Belle.

257
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:01,430
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.

258
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,224
- Do you know who that little wife will be?
- Let me think.

259
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,435
- You, Belle.
- Gaston, I'm...

260
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:08,979
I'm speechless.

261
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,523
I really don't know
what to say.

262
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:15,735
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

263
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:19,865
but I just don't deserve you!

264
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,423
So, how'd it go?

265
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:39,467
I'll have Belle for my wife.

266
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:42,596
Make no mistake about that.

267
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:45,724
Touchy!

268
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,650
Is he gone?

269
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:58,903
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

270
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:03,325
Me, the wife of that
boorish, brainless...

271
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,285
Madame Gaston

272
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,287
Can't you just see it

273
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,915
Madame Gaston
his little wife

274
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:14,669
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it

275
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:19,716
I want much more than
this provincial life

276
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:33,313
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

277
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:37,942
I want it more
than I can tell

278
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:41,362
And for once
it might be grand

279
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,617
To have someone understand

280
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,373
I want so much more
than they've got planned

281
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:58,004
Philippe! What are you
doing here? Where's...

282
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,758
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

283
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:05,094
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

284
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:21,361
What is this place?

285
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:24,822
Philippe, please, steady.

286
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,743
Steady.

287
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,789
Papa!

288
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:35,708
Couldn't keep quiet,
could we?

289
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,294
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?

290
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:41,547
Serve him tea,
sit in the master's chair.

291
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:44,550
- Pet the pooch!
- I was trying to be hospitable.

292
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:50,098
Hello?
Is anyone here?

293
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:52,600
Hello?

294
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:56,020
Papa? Papa?

295
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:58,189
Are you here?

296
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:01,192
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

297
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:04,445
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

298
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,864
Really, Mama.
I saw her.

299
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:09,033
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What...

300
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:12,828
A girl!
I saw a girl in the castle!

301
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,747
See, I told ya!

302
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,043
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy eared, slack-jawed...

303
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:21,671
Papa?

304
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:25,216
Did you see that?

305
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:28,386
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.

306
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:31,722
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!

307
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:34,600
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

308
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:42,441
Papa?

309
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,446
Hello?
Is someone here?

310
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,866
Wait!
I'm looking for my father. I...

311
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:58,541
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.

312
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:00,334
I- Is anyone here?

313
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:03,295
- Belle?
- Papa!

314
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:08,551
- H-H-How did you find me?
- Oh, your hands are like ice.

315
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,720
- We have to get you out of there.
- Belle, I want you to leave this place.

316
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:14,265
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.

317
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:16,767
- You must go. Now!
- I won't leave you.

318
00:23:16,851 --> 00:23:18,894
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!

319
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:23,524
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.

320
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:26,443
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.

321
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:29,864
- Can't you see he's sick?
- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!

322
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:32,825
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.

323
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:36,912
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

324
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:40,332
Oh, there must be some way
I can... Wait!

325
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,592
- Take me instead.
- You?

326
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,804
You would take his place?

327
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:56,098
Belle, no! You don't know
what you're doing!

328
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:59,059
If I did,
would you let him go?

329
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:03,689
Yes, but you must promise
to stay here forever.

330
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:09,028
Come into the light.

331
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:23,709
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!

332
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:28,046
- You have my word.
- Done!

333
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:35,304
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.

334
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:37,473
- Wait! -
Belle! - Wait!

335
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:41,810
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!

336
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:45,314
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.

337
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:47,983
Let me out.
Please let me out!

338
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:52,237
Let me out!
Please! Please!

339
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,411
- Master?
- What?

340
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:03,540
Uh, since the girl is going to be
with us for quite some time...

341
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:08,337
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.

342
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:11,548
Then again, maybe not.

343
00:25:14,343 --> 00:25:16,970
You didn't even let me
say goodbye.

344
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:19,264
I'll never see him again.

345
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:24,061
- I didn't get to say goodbye.
- I'll show you to your room.

346
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:27,689
My room?
But I thought...

347
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:29,816
- You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower?
- No.

348
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,319
Then follow me.

349
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:55,967
- Say something to her.
- Huh? Oh.

350
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:59,513
I, uh, hope you like it here.

351
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:06,061
The castle is your home now, so you can
go anywhere you like except the west wing.

352
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:08,897
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!

353
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,157
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.

354
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,868
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.

355
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:25,997
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!

356
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:48,478
Who does she think she is? That girl
has tangled with the wrong man.

357
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:51,564
- No one says no to Gaston!
- Darn right!

358
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:55,944
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!

359
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:57,821
Why, it's more
than I can bear.

360
00:26:57,904 --> 00:27:01,408
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.

361
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:04,536
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never!

362
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:09,040
Gaston, you've got to
pull yourself together.

363
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:12,252
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

364
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:15,296
Looking so
down in the dumps

365
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,508
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

366
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:21,803
Even when taking
your lumps

367
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:25,056
There's no man in town
as admired as you

368
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:28,560
You're everyone's
favourite guy

369
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:31,521
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you

370
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:34,983
And it's not very hard

371
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:38,611
To see why

372
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,575
No one's

373
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:46,786
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston

374
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:49,998
No one's neck's as
incredibly thick as Gaston

375
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:53,918
For there's no man in town
half as manly

376
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:56,504
Perfect
A pure paragon

377
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,966
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley

378
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:05,221
And they'll tell you whose team
they prefer to be on

379
00:28:05,304 --> 00:28:08,474
No one's

380
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,561
Been like Gaston
a kingpin like Gaston

381
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:14,689
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston

382
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:18,526
As a specimen
yes, I'm intimidating

383
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:21,696
My, what a guy
that Gaston

384
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,074
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips

385
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:30,455
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

386
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:33,624
No one

387
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,586
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston

388
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:39,881
In a wrestling match
nobody bites like Gaston

389
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:43,342
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

390
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:46,596
As you see
I've got biceps to spare

391
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,558
- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right!

392
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,853
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair

393
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:56,689
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston

394
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:00,026
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

395
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:04,155
I'm especially good at expectorating

396
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:07,074
- Ptooey!
- Ten points for Gaston

397
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:10,119
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs

398
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:13,664
Every morning
to help me get large

399
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:16,834
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs

400
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:22,840
So I'm roughly the size
of a barge

401
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:26,344
No one

402
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:29,638
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston

403
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:32,933
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

404
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:36,854
I use antlers in all
of my decorating

405
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:39,398
My, what a guy

406
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:46,155
Gaston

407
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:52,453
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?

408
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,747
Please! Please, I need your help.

409
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,249
He's got her... He's got her
locked in the dungeon!

410
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,376
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.

411
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,253
Not... Not a minute to lose.

412
00:30:01,337 --> 00:30:03,589
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.

413
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,674
Who's got Belle
locked in a dungeon?

414
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:09,678
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!

415
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,518
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge!

416
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:19,772
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly!

417
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:23,609
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?

418
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:25,986
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.

419
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,907
You will? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

420
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:34,453
Crazy old Maurice.

421
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:38,165
He's always good
for a laugh.

422
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:41,168
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

423
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:45,506
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.

424
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:49,259
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking

425
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:52,596
- A dangerous pastime
- I know

426
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,641
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

427
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:58,769
And his sanity's
only so-so

428
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:02,147
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning

429
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:05,275
Since I looked at
that loony old man

430
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,821
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle

431
00:31:08,904 --> 00:31:13,158
And right now
I'm evolving a plan

432
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:15,619
- If I...
- Yes?

433
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:18,705
- Then we...
- No, would she?

434
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,332
- Guess!
- Now I get it!

435
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:22,668
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

436
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,462
No one

437
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:28,590
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

438
00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:31,843
Plans to persecute harmless
crackpots like Gaston

439
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:37,599
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

440
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,977
My, what a guy

441
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,231
Gaston

442
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:51,029
Will no one help me?

443
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:01,456
- Who is it?
- Mrs Potts, dear.

444
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,544
I thought you might like
a spot of tea.

445
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:07,796
But you're...
You're a...

446
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:11,466
- Oh! Careful.
- This is impossible!

447
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,219
I know it is,
but here we are.

448
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:17,055
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

449
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:20,392
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.

450
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:24,146
- Don't spill.
- Thank you.

451
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:26,273
Wanna see me
do a trick?

452
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:30,777
- Chip!
- Oops, sorry.

453
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,363
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

454
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:36,658
- We all think so.
- But I've lost my father...

455
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:38,660
my dreams, everything.

456
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:43,665
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.

457
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:46,084
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me...

458
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:48,670
jabberin' on while there's
a supper to get on the table.

459
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:52,007
- Chip?
- Bye!

460
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,801
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

461
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:57,512
Oh, let's see what I got
in my drawers.

462
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:01,391
Oh, how embarrassing!

463
00:33:01,474 --> 00:33:04,102
Ahem.
Ah, here we are!

464
00:33:04,185 --> 00:33:06,104
You'll look ravishing
in this one!

465
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:09,649
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.

466
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:12,277
Ah, but you must!

467
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,779
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.

468
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:17,699
Dinner is served.

469
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:23,371
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.

470
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:27,042
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Oh, try to be patient, sir.

471
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,503
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

472
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:32,589
Master, have you thought
that perhaps...

473
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,883
this girl could be the one
to break the spell?

474
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:37,719
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.

475
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:40,597
Good!
So, you fall in love with her...

476
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,099
she falls in love with you,
and poof!

477
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:46,186
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.

478
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:49,230
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.

479
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:51,399
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

480
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:53,818
Oh, it's no use.

481
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:57,447
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!

482
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,744
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

483
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:04,913
I don't know how.

484
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:07,707
Well, you can start by
making yourself more presentable.

485
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,751
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

486
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:14,005
Ah, yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

487
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:16,633
Come, come.
Show me the smile.

488
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:20,470
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.

489
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:22,013
But be gentle.

490
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,057
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.

491
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,603
And above all,
you must control your temper!

492
00:34:28,686 --> 00:34:30,480
Here she is!

493
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:34,359
Good evening.

494
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:36,444
Well, where is she?

495
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:41,157
Who? Oh, ha ha ha!
The girl, yes. The girl.

496
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:45,203
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

497
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:47,330
Circumstances
being what they are...

498
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:49,707
Uh, she's not coming.

499
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,502
What!

500
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:55,797
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence!

501
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,632
Let's not be hasty!

502
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,180
- I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
- I'm not hungry.

503
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:07,683
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!

504
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:11,687
Master, I could be wrong,
but that may not be...

505
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:14,106
the best way to win
the girl's affections.

506
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,693
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

507
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:20,530
But she is being so difficult.

508
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:23,616
Gently, gently.

509
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:28,371
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!

510
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:30,831
Suave, genteel.

511
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:34,961
It would give me
great pleasure...

512
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:37,046
if you would
join me for dinner.

513
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:39,090
And we say please.

514
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,633
- Please.
- No, thank you.

515
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,843
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.

516
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:47,598
Fine! Then go ahead
and starve!

517
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:53,229
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!

518
00:35:55,815 --> 00:35:58,442
Oh, dear. That didn't
go very well at all, did it?

519
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:01,737
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door...

520
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:04,907
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.

521
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,368
You can count on me,
mon capitaine.

522
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:12,331
Well, we might as well
go downstairs and start cleaning up.

523
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,960
I ask nicely, but she refuses.

524
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:19,630
Wh-Wh-What...
What does she want me to do, beg?

525
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:22,174
Show me the girl.

526
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:27,388
But the master's really not so bad
once you get to know him.

527
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:31,225
- Why don't you give him a chance?
- I don't want to get to know him.

528
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,103
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.

529
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:38,065
I'm just fooling myself.

530
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,568
She'll never see me
as anything...

531
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,195
but a monster.

532
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,827
It's hopeless.

533
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:09,221
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

534
00:37:09,346 --> 00:37:12,016
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!

535
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,727
I've been burnt by you before.

536
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:19,565
Zut alors!
She has emerged!

537
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:27,489
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

538
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,909
But I'm not sleepy.

539
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:34,163
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

540
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:37,458
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?

541
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,586
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste!

542
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:43,839
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.

543
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:47,050
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn!

544
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:48,760
After all, he did say please.

545
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:52,306
But if the master doesn't learn to control
that temper, he'll never break the...

546
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:55,726
Splendid to see you
out and about, mademoiselle.

547
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:59,146
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

548
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:03,817
- This is Lumiere.
- Enchantי, chיrie.

549
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:07,571
If there's... stop that...
anything we... please... can do...

550
00:38:07,696 --> 00:38:10,407
to make your stay
more comfortable...

551
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,784
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?

552
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,494
Hear that?
She's hungry!

553
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:17,706
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.

554
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:20,167
Remember what
the master said.

555
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:23,545
Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.

556
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:26,590
All right, fine. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...

557
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:29,051
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!

558
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:31,762
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest!

559
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:35,599
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.

560
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,559
Well, keep it down.

561
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:40,020
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

562
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:42,147
Of course, of course.

563
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:45,692
But what is dinner
without a little music?

564
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:47,110
Music?

565
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:54,326
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...

566
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:56,244
that we welcome you tonight.

567
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,955
And now
we invite you to relax.

568
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,919
Let us pull up a chair
as the dining room proudly presents...

569
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,629
your dinner.

570
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:10,509
Be our guest

571
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,929
Be our guest
Put our service to the test

572
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:18,642
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chיrie
and we provide the rest

573
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,061
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres

574
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:23,271
Why, we only live to serve

575
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:25,607
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious

576
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,901
Don't believe me
Ask the dishes

577
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:30,195
They can sing
They can dance

578
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:32,656
After all, miss
this is France

579
00:39:32,781 --> 00:39:36,534
And a dinner here
is never second best

580
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:38,995
Go on, unfold your menu

581
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,207
Take a glance and then
you'll be our guest

582
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:45,502
Oui, our guest
Be our guest

583
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:49,881
Beef ragout, cheese soufflי
Pie and pudding en flambי

584
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:54,135
We'll prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret

585
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,556
You're alone and you're scared
but the banquet's all prepared

586
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,850
No one's gloomy
or complaining

587
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:03,186
While the flatware's entertaining

588
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:07,273
We tell jokes, I do tricks
with my fellow candlesticks

589
00:40:07,357 --> 00:40:11,194
Und it's all in perfect taste
that you can bet

590
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:15,490
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass

591
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:17,826
To be our guest
if you're stressed

592
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:19,828
It's fine dining
we suggest

593
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:23,706
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest

594
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:30,588
Life is so unnerving
for a servant who's not serving

595
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:33,967
He's not whole without
a soul to wait upon

596
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,760
Get off!

597
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:39,597
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

598
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:44,352
- Huh?
- Suddenly those good old days are gone

599
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:47,397
- Oh!
- Ten years we've been rusting

600
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,857
Needing so much more
than dusting

601
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:55,238
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills

602
00:40:55,321 --> 00:41:00,034
Most days wejust
lay around the castle

603
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:03,371
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy

604
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:07,166
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

605
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:11,129
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

606
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:15,091
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear, that's fine with me

607
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:18,803
While the cups do their soft- Shoein'
I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'

608
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:22,765
I'll get warm, pipin'hot
Heaven sakes, is that a spot

609
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,102
Clean it up
We want the company impressed

610
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:30,106
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two

611
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,442
- For you, our guest
- She's our guest

612
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:34,986
- She's our guest
- Be our guest

613
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:38,239
- Be our guest, be our guest Our command is your request
- Let's go, people. Fun's over. Over here. Line up.

614
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:42,034
It's ten years since we've had
anybody here and we're obsessed

615
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:45,955
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

616
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:48,583
While the candlelight's
still glowing

617
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:52,879
Let us help you
We'll keep going

618
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:57,508
Course by course

619
00:41:57,592 --> 00:41:59,635
One by one

620
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,471
Till you shout
Enough, I'm done

621
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:06,309
Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest

622
00:42:06,392 --> 00:42:10,062
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up

623
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:12,064
Be our guest

624
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:15,067
Be our guest
Be our guest

625
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:18,404
Please be our

626
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:24,619
Guest

627
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:31,584
- Bravo! That was wonderful!
- Thank you.

628
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:36,881
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!

629
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:41,469
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.

630
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:44,013
Oh, I couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

631
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:46,057
It's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

632
00:42:46,182 --> 00:42:48,309
Enchanted!

633
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:51,562
Who said anything about
the castle being enchanted?

634
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:55,107
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I figured it out for myself.

635
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,487
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

636
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,907
- Oh, would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

637
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,284
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

638
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:10,706
We can't let her go poking around in
certain places, if you know what I mean.

639
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:15,419
Perhaps you'd like to take me. I'm sure you know
everything there is to know about the castle.

640
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:18,631
Oh, well! Actually, I...

641
00:43:18,756 --> 00:43:21,133
Yes, I do.

642
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:24,845
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away...

643
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,181
to reveal
the minimalist rococo design.

644
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:30,392
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

645
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:33,854
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.

646
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:37,816
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

647
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:42,363
Where was I?

648
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:44,657
As you were!

649
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,370
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...

650
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:50,871
Uh, mademoiselle?

651
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,962
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.

652
00:43:59,088 --> 00:44:01,215
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.

653
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:03,967
Dusty, dull, very boring.

654
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:06,512
Ah, so that's the west wing!

655
00:44:06,637 --> 00:44:08,847
Nice going.

656
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:11,392
I wonder what
he's hiding up there.

657
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:15,395
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

658
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:19,858
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would,
uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?

659
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:22,653
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

660
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:24,947
- Maybe later.
- Uh, the... the gardens...

661
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,074
or, or the...
the library perhaps?

662
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,992
You have a library?

663
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:31,119
- Yes! Oh, indeed.
- With books.

664
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:33,997
- Scads of books!
- Mountains of books!

665
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:35,332
- Forests of books!
- Cascades!

666
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:36,667
- Cloudbursts!
- Swamps of books!

667
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,586
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.

668
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,797
Books on every subject
ever studied...

669
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:43,402
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.

670
00:44:43,437 --> 00:44:44,883
By every author
who ever set pen to paper.

671
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,728
Oh, oh.

672
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:28,111
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.

673
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:32,032
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.

674
00:46:32,115 --> 00:46:35,201
Do you realize
what you could have done?

675
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:36,870
Please! Stop!

676
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,748
- Get out!
- No!

677
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:44,461
Get out!

678
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,391
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise...

679
00:46:58,475 --> 00:47:00,351
I can't stay here
another minute.

680
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:03,897
No, wait, please!
Please wait!

681
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,723
No!

682
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:32,837
Here, now. Don't do that.

683
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,884
Just hold still.

684
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,347
- That hurts!
- If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!

685
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:45,683
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

686
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:49,353
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

687
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:52,189
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!

688
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:54,400
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

689
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:01,115
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.

690
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:08,539
By the way, thank you
for saving my life.

691
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:15,045
You're welcome.

692
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:25,806
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night...

693
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,727
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

694
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,398
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.

695
00:50:34,523 --> 00:50:37,359
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

696
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:40,904
But she needs a little persuasion.

697
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,282
Turned him down flat!

698
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,784
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

699
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:49,496
He was in here tonight raving
about a beast in a castle.

700
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,123
Maurice is harmless.

701
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,334
The point is,
Belle would do anything...

702
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,629
to keep him
from being locked up.

703
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,715
Yeah, even marry him.

704
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:05,137
So you want me to throw her father
into the asylum...

705
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,930
unless she agrees to marry you.

706
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:08,640
Unless she agrees to marry you.

707
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:13,645
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!

708
00:51:16,231 --> 00:51:19,276
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone!

709
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,404
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!

710
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:25,115
I'll find that castle
and somehow, I...

711
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:27,367
I'll get her out of there.

712
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:36,126
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.

713
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:38,503
Guess it's not gonna work after all.

714
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:40,964
They have to come back sometime.

715
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:44,843
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

716
00:51:44,926 --> 00:51:49,181
Lefou, don't move from that spot...

717
00:51:49,264 --> 00:51:51,308
until Belle
and her father come home.

718
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:54,603
But... But I...

719
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:57,105
Ah, nuts!

720
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:22,130
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

721
00:52:23,882 --> 00:52:27,761
I want to do something
for her, but what?

722
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,846
Well, there's the usual things.

723
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:33,099
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.

724
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:37,229
Ah, no, no, it has to be
something very special.

725
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:40,941
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!

726
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,070
Belle?

727
00:52:45,153 --> 00:52:47,739
There's something
I want to show you.

728
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,868
But first,
you have to close your eyes.

729
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:57,165
It's a surprise.

730
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:10,136
- Can I open them?
- No, no. N-Not yet.

731
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,889
Wait here.

732
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:21,398
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now!

733
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:32,492
I can't believe it!

734
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:34,744
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

735
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:37,914
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful!

736
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:42,127
- Then it's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.

737
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,255
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.

738
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:47,757
What? What works?

739
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:51,094
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?

740
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:53,721
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.

741
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:55,974
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

742
00:53:56,057 --> 00:53:59,602
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

743
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:49,986
There's something sweet
and almost kind

744
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:53,614
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

745
00:54:53,698 --> 00:54:57,660
And now he's dear
and so unsure

746
00:54:57,743 --> 00:55:02,081
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before

747
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:18,723
She glanced this way
I thought I saw

748
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:22,393
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw

749
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:26,355
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore

750
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:30,359
But then she's never looked at me
that way before

751
00:55:32,945 --> 00:55:38,909
New and a bit alarming

752
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:41,621
Who'd have ever thought

753
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:48,252
That this could be

754
00:55:48,336 --> 00:55:50,463
True

755
00:55:50,546 --> 00:55:54,342
That he's no Prince Charming

756
00:55:54,425 --> 00:55:57,011
But there's something in him

757
00:55:57,094 --> 00:56:02,516
That I simply didn't see

758
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,643
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul

759
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,729
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who indeed

760
00:56:06,812 --> 00:56:09,440
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own

761
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:12,109
- It's so peculiar, wait and see
- We'll wait a see

762
00:56:12,193 --> 00:56:14,195
A few days more

763
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:19,533
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

764
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:23,746
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before

765
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:25,623
What?

766
00:56:25,706 --> 00:56:29,335
There may be something there
that wasn't there before

767
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:32,046
- What's there, Mama?
- Shh.

768
00:56:32,129 --> 00:56:34,882
I'll tell you when you're older.

769
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:38,802
Right, then, you all know
why we're here.

770
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:42,348
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds...

771
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:44,266
to create the most magical,
spontaneous...

772
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,645
romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

773
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:56,153
Right. Need I remind you...

774
00:56:56,236 --> 00:56:59,365
that as the last petal falls
from this rose...

775
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:02,534
the spell will never be broken!

776
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:06,121
Very well. You all know
your assignments.

777
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,667
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing...

778
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,378
the rest of you,
come with me.

779
00:57:16,757 --> 00:57:20,469
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

780
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:22,721
It's obivious there's a spark
between them.

781
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:26,350
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames, you know...

782
00:57:26,433 --> 00:57:27,476
a little.

783
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:31,605
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
if we ever expect to be human again.

784
00:57:31,688 --> 00:57:34,608
- Ah, human again.
- Human again.

785
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:38,278
Yes, think what that means.

786
00:57:40,614 --> 00:57:45,494
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again

787
00:57:45,577 --> 00:57:48,956
With a mademoiselle
on each arm

788
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:53,043
When I'm human again
Only human again

789
00:57:53,126 --> 00:57:56,922
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

790
00:57:57,005 --> 00:58:00,676
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again

791
00:58:00,759 --> 00:58:04,513
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

792
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:07,933
I'll hop down off this shelf
and tout suite be myself

793
00:58:08,016 --> 00:58:11,561
I can't wait to be human again

794
00:58:13,814 --> 00:58:17,067
Be human again
Only human again

795
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,654
We'll be knick-knacks
and what-nots no more

796
00:58:20,737 --> 00:58:24,074
When we're human again
Good and human again

797
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:27,661
Oh, cherie,
we'll be only top drawer

798
00:58:27,744 --> 00:58:31,331
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
and I won't be so huge

799
00:58:31,415 --> 00:58:34,751
Why I'll easily fit through that door

800
00:58:34,835 --> 00:58:36,920
I'll exude savoir faire

801
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:38,755
I'll wear gowns
I'll have hair

802
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:42,926
It's my birth
to be human again

803
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:50,434
When we're human again
Only human again

804
00:58:50,517 --> 00:58:53,895
When the world once more
starts making sense

805
00:58:53,979 --> 00:58:55,605
I'll unwind for a change

806
00:58:55,689 --> 00:58:57,190
Really that would be strange

807
00:58:57,274 --> 00:59:00,777
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense

808
00:59:00,861 --> 00:59:04,072
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea

809
00:59:04,156 --> 00:59:07,450
Let my early retirement commence

810
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:11,246
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks

811
00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:16,376
- And relax
- When I'm human again

812
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:19,754
So sweep fast
round the floor

813
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,383
Let's let some light in the room

814
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:26,177
I can feel I can tell
Someone might break the spell

815
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:30,181
Any day now

816
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:33,310
Shine up the brass
on the door

817
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:36,313
Alert the dustbin and broom

818
00:59:36,396 --> 00:59:40,191
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand

819
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:43,653
Any day now

820
00:59:43,737 --> 00:59:47,073
Open the shutters
and let in some air

821
00:59:47,157 --> 00:59:51,202
Put these here
and put those over there

822
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:54,497
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

823
00:59:54,581 --> 00:59:59,210
And throw them away

824
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:08,052
We'll be human again
Only human again

825
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:11,556
When the girl finally
sets us all free

826
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:14,851
Cheeks a-bloomin'again
We're assumin'again

827
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:18,521
We'll assume our long lost
joie de vivre

828
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:21,816
We'll be playin'again
Holidayin'again

829
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,320
And we're prayin'its'A.S.A.P.

830
01:00:25,403 --> 01:00:27,030
We will push
We will shove

831
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:29,365
They will both fall in love

832
01:00:29,449 --> 01:00:34,287
And we'll finally be human again

833
01:00:35,246 --> 01:00:37,624
"There never was a story
of more woe

834
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:40,293
"Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo"

835
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:45,840
- Could you read it again?
- Here, why don't you read it to me?

836
01:00:45,924 --> 01:00:48,343
Uh, all right.

837
01:00:52,847 --> 01:00:55,642
- I can't.
- You mean, you never learned?

838
01:00:55,725 --> 01:00:58,811
I learned... a little.

839
01:00:58,895 --> 01:01:01,522
It's just been so long.

840
01:01:01,606 --> 01:01:03,900
Well, here, I'll help you.

841
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:06,944
- Let's start here.
- Here.

842
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:10,865
- Okay. "Twoh..."
- "Two."

843
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:15,286
"Two." I knew that.
"Two households..."

844
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:21,834
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again

845
01:01:21,918 --> 01:01:25,213
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

846
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:28,257
When we're human again
Only human again

847
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:31,969
We'll go waltzing
those old one-two-threes

848
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:35,223
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again

849
01:01:35,306 --> 01:01:38,851
Stepping, striding
As fine as you please

850
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:42,230
Like a real human does

851
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:45,775
I'll be all that I was

852
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:49,987
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

853
01:01:50,071 --> 01:01:53,950
And we're all of us human

854
01:01:54,033 --> 01:02:02,875
Again

855
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:13,928
Tonight is the night.

856
01:02:16,138 --> 01:02:19,392
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.

857
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:21,686
You must be bold, daring.

858
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:23,771
Bold! Daring!

859
01:02:26,982 --> 01:02:31,028
There will be music,
romantic candlelight...

860
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:33,030
provided by myself.

861
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:37,034
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

862
01:02:37,118 --> 01:02:39,161
Yes, I con...

863
01:02:39,245 --> 01:02:41,247
I, I... No, I can't.

864
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:45,042
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.

865
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:48,796
Well, then you must tell her.

866
01:02:48,879 --> 01:02:52,675
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...

867
01:02:52,758 --> 01:02:54,718
Stupid.

868
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:57,012
Not quite the word
I was looking for.

869
01:02:57,096 --> 01:02:59,807
Perhaps a little more
off the top.

870
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:06,230
Your lady awaits.

871
01:03:30,462 --> 01:03:33,215
Tale as old as time

872
01:03:35,718 --> 01:03:38,512
True as it can be

873
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:43,517
Barely even friends

874
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,145
Then somebody bends

875
01:03:46,228 --> 01:03:48,647
Unexpectedly

876
01:03:51,316 --> 01:03:54,278
Just a little change

877
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:58,866
Small to say the least

878
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:01,452
Both a little scared

879
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,079
Neither one prepared

880
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:07,458
Beauty and the beast

881
01:04:09,877 --> 01:04:13,464
Everjust the same

882
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:17,885
Ever a surprise

883
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,808
Ever as before
Everjust as sure

884
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:28,478
As the sun will rise

885
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:32,941
Tale as old as time

886
01:04:35,235 --> 01:04:37,863
Tune as old as song

887
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:44,953
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change

888
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:48,665
Learning you were wrong

889
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:53,045
Certain as the sun

890
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:57,674
Rising in the east

891
01:04:57,758 --> 01:05:03,180
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

892
01:05:03,263 --> 01:05:06,266
Beauty and the beast

893
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:09,186
Shh.

894
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:12,481
Tale as old as time

895
01:05:12,564 --> 01:05:16,651
Song as old as rhyme

896
01:05:16,735 --> 01:05:22,908
Beauty and the beast

897
01:05:24,326 --> 01:05:26,661
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

898
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:29,164
It's past your bedtime.

899
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:32,584
Good night, love.

900
01:05:56,107 --> 01:05:58,109
Belle?

901
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:03,031
Are you happy here with me?

902
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:05,116
Yes.

903
01:06:09,162 --> 01:06:11,915
What is it?

904
01:06:11,998 --> 01:06:15,669
If only I could see my father again
just for a moment.

905
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:18,630
I miss him so much.

906
01:06:23,009 --> 01:06:25,011
There is a way.

907
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:30,141
This mirror
will show you anything...

908
01:06:30,225 --> 01:06:33,061
anything you wish to see.

909
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:36,314
I'd like to see my father, please.

910
01:06:42,987 --> 01:06:45,990
Papa! Oh, no!

911
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:51,371
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

912
01:06:56,626 --> 01:07:01,422
- Then you-you must go to him.
- What did you say?

913
01:07:01,506 --> 01:07:04,968
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.

914
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:08,221
You mean, I'm free?

915
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:12,183
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

916
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:14,686
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.

917
01:07:17,564 --> 01:07:20,316
Take it with you
so you'll always have a way...

918
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,696
to look back and remember me.

919
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,326
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

920
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,587
Well, Your Highness, I must say...

921
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:43,881
everything is going
just swimmingly.

922
01:07:43,965 --> 01:07:46,884
I knew you had it in you.

923
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:49,012
I let her go.

924
01:07:49,095 --> 01:07:51,806
Yes, yes, splen...

925
01:07:51,889 --> 01:07:56,102
You what?
How could you do that?

926
01:07:56,185 --> 01:08:00,648
- I had to.
- Yes, but, but, but... but why?

927
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:04,318
Because I love her.

928
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:06,028
He did what?

929
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:10,199
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?

930
01:08:10,283 --> 01:08:12,285
But he was so close.

931
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:16,873
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

932
01:08:16,956 --> 01:08:19,625
That's it then.
That should break the spell!

933
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:24,213
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.

934
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:27,008
Now it's too late.

935
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:38,436
Papa? Papa?

936
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:55,578
They're back.

937
01:08:56,787 --> 01:08:59,165
- Belle!
- Shh.

938
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:03,210
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.

939
01:09:03,294 --> 01:09:06,630
I thought I'd never see you again.

940
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:09,175
- I missed you so much!
- But the beast...

941
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:12,053
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.

942
01:09:12,136 --> 01:09:15,598
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?

943
01:09:15,681 --> 01:09:19,810
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.

944
01:09:25,316 --> 01:09:28,819
- Hi!
- Oh, a stowaway.

945
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:31,781
Why, hello there, little fella.

946
01:09:31,864 --> 01:09:34,200
Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.

947
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:36,911
Belle, why'd you go away?

948
01:09:36,994 --> 01:09:39,163
Don't you like us any more?

949
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:42,833
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that...

950
01:09:45,878 --> 01:09:49,423
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.

951
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:52,218
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.

952
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:54,803
We'll take good care of him.

953
01:09:56,222 --> 01:09:59,433
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!

954
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:03,437
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!

955
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:06,565
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?

956
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:09,318
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

957
01:10:09,401 --> 01:10:13,030
Just how big was the beast?

958
01:10:13,113 --> 01:10:16,617
He was... I mean,
he was... he was, uh, enormous!

959
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,080
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
uh, no, more like ten feet!

960
01:10:22,539 --> 01:10:25,000
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that!

961
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:28,504
It's true, I tell you!

962
01:10:28,587 --> 01:10:31,757
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!

963
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,219
No! You can't do this!

964
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:38,430
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.

965
01:10:38,514 --> 01:10:41,225
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

966
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:46,313
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...

967
01:10:46,396 --> 01:10:49,191
- If what?
- If you marry me.

968
01:10:49,274 --> 01:10:51,360
- What?
- One little word, Belle.

969
01:10:51,443 --> 01:10:53,445
- That's all it takes.
- Never!

970
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:58,659
- Have it your way!
- Belle? Let go of me!

971
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:01,328
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it!

972
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:03,664
Show me the beast.

973
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:11,463
- Is it dangerous?
- Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.

974
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:16,635
Please, I-I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

975
01:11:16,718 --> 01:11:18,887
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better...

976
01:11:18,971 --> 01:11:21,974
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

977
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:24,601
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!

978
01:11:25,894 --> 01:11:28,730
She's as crazy as the old man!

979
01:11:28,897 --> 01:11:31,149
The beast will make off
with your children.

980
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:33,151
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No!

981
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,696
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!

982
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:38,532
I say we kill the beast!

983
01:11:38,615 --> 01:11:41,827
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night

984
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:45,455
Set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite

985
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:49,126
He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free

986
01:11:49,209 --> 01:11:52,879
So it's time
to take some action, boys

987
01:11:52,963 --> 01:11:58,135
It's time to follow me

988
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:02,681
Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows

989
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:06,017
It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride

990
01:12:06,101 --> 01:12:09,438
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

991
01:12:09,521 --> 01:12:12,858
And there's something
truly terrible inside

992
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:15,735
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

993
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:19,030
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

994
01:12:19,114 --> 01:12:22,659
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home

995
01:12:22,742 --> 01:12:25,954
Till he's dead
Good and dead

996
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:28,248
- Kill the beast
- No, I won't let you do this.

997
01:12:28,331 --> 01:12:30,834
If you're not with us,
you're against us.

998
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:33,837
- Bring the old man!
- Get your hands off me!

999
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,548
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature!

1000
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:40,176
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!

1001
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,263
- Who's with me?
- I am! I am!

1002
01:12:43,346 --> 01:12:45,307
- I am!
- Light your torch, mount your horse

1003
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,309
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1004
01:12:47,392 --> 01:12:50,270
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1005
01:12:50,353 --> 01:12:53,356
Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle

1006
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,401
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

1007
01:12:56,484 --> 01:13:00,280
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain

1008
01:13:00,363 --> 01:13:03,199
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1009
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:06,619
Sally forth, tally-ho
Grab your sword and your bow

1010
01:13:06,703 --> 01:13:08,204
Praise the Lord and here we go

1011
01:13:08,288 --> 01:13:12,417
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1012
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,628
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.

1013
01:13:15,712 --> 01:13:17,881
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?

1014
01:13:17,964 --> 01:13:21,551
Now, now.
We'll think of something.

1015
01:13:28,057 --> 01:13:31,186
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us

1016
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:34,814
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1017
01:13:34,898 --> 01:13:37,942
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives

1018
01:13:38,026 --> 01:13:41,112
We'll save our village
and our lives

1019
01:13:41,196 --> 01:13:43,198
We'll kill the beast

1020
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:46,451
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1021
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:49,245
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1022
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,457
- Could it be?
- Is it she?

1023
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,959
Sacrebleu! Invaders!

1024
01:13:55,043 --> 01:13:57,587
- Encroachers!
- And they have the mirror!

1025
01:13:57,712 --> 01:14:00,715
Warn the master. If it's a fight
they want, we'll be ready for them.

1026
01:14:00,798 --> 01:14:02,717
Who's with me?

1027
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,802
Take whatever booty
you can find.

1028
01:14:04,886 --> 01:14:07,889
But remember,
the beast is mine!

1029
01:14:07,972 --> 01:14:10,850
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle

1030
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:14,145
Unafraid although the danger
just increased

1031
01:14:14,228 --> 01:14:17,315
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong

1032
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:20,443
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1033
01:14:20,526 --> 01:14:22,362
Let's kill the beast

1034
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:25,782
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.

1035
01:14:25,865 --> 01:14:28,368
But, sir,
the castle is under attack!

1036
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:32,246
Kill the beast
Kill the beast

1037
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:35,958
- This isn't working.
- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!

1038
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:38,419
Wait! I know!

1039
01:14:38,503 --> 01:14:40,755
Kill the beast
Kill the beast

1040
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:44,592
What shall we do, Master?

1041
01:14:44,675 --> 01:14:48,387
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.

1042
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:51,724
Kill the beast
Kill the beast

1043
01:14:51,808 --> 01:14:54,769
Kill the beast

1044
01:15:05,988 --> 01:15:08,324
Now!

1045
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:29,637
Yes!

1046
01:15:32,598 --> 01:15:34,266
Here we go!

1047
01:15:37,728 --> 01:15:40,272
What the devil?

1048
01:15:40,398 --> 01:15:42,900
Belle, look out!

1049
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:51,033
You guys gotta try this thing.

1050
01:15:55,496 --> 01:15:58,499
Up here, you scurvy scum.

1051
01:15:58,582 --> 01:16:01,460
Now!

1052
01:17:09,737 --> 01:17:12,072
And stay out!

1053
01:17:41,727 --> 01:17:46,982
Get up!

1054
01:17:47,065 --> 01:17:50,277
What's the matter, beast?

1055
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,322
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1056
01:18:00,704 --> 01:18:03,373
No!

1057
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:08,295
- Belle!
- No, Gaston, don't!

1058
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:16,845
Let's go, Philippe.

1059
01:18:40,494 --> 01:18:43,371
Come on out and fight!

1060
01:18:44,748 --> 01:18:47,584
Were you in love with her,
beast?

1061
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:50,295
Did you honestly think
she'd want you...

1062
01:18:50,378 --> 01:18:53,924
when she had someone like me?

1063
01:19:04,392 --> 01:19:08,271
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!

1064
01:19:13,693 --> 01:19:16,947
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.

1065
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,866
I'll do anything. Anything!

1066
01:19:33,213 --> 01:19:35,924
Get out!

1067
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:39,302
- Beast!
- Belle.

1068
01:19:48,436 --> 01:19:50,563
Belle?

1069
01:19:55,402 --> 01:19:57,570
You came back.

1070
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:40,405
You... You came back.

1071
01:20:40,488 --> 01:20:42,657
Of course I came back.

1072
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:46,744
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.

1073
01:20:46,828 --> 01:20:48,830
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1074
01:20:48,913 --> 01:20:53,334
Maybe it's better...
it's better this way.

1075
01:20:53,418 --> 01:20:55,795
Don't talk like that.

1076
01:20:55,878 --> 01:20:58,297
You'll be all right.

1077
01:20:58,381 --> 01:21:03,177
We're together now. Everything's
going to be fine, you'll see.

1078
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:06,472
At least...

1079
01:21:06,556 --> 01:21:10,977
I got to see you one last time.

1080
01:21:21,863 --> 01:21:24,657
No! No!

1081
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:27,201
Please! Please!

1082
01:21:27,285 --> 01:21:29,620
Please don't leave me.

1083
01:21:32,665 --> 01:21:35,376
I love you.

1084
01:23:12,932 --> 01:23:16,018
Belle, it's me!

1085
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:33,369
It is you!

1086
01:24:06,193 --> 01:24:08,195
Lumiere!

1087
01:24:08,278 --> 01:24:10,906
Cogsworth!

1088
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:13,617
Mrs Potts!

1089
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,744
- Look at us!
- Mama! Mama!

1090
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:24,545
- Oh, my goodness!
- It is a miracle!

1091
01:24:34,304 --> 01:24:36,556
Ah, I'amour.

1092
01:24:40,602 --> 01:24:44,022
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1093
01:24:44,106 --> 01:24:46,942
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.

1094
01:24:47,025 --> 01:24:51,571
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh,
but I believe I told you.

1095
01:24:51,655 --> 01:24:53,657
No, you didn't. I told you!

1096
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,369
You most certainly did not,
you pompous, paraffin-headed peabrain!

1097
01:24:57,452 --> 01:25:00,831
En garde,
you-you overgrown pocket watch!

1098
01:25:00,914 --> 01:25:03,125
- Take that!
- Stop shoving.

1099
01:25:06,128 --> 01:25:09,381
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?

1100
01:25:09,464 --> 01:25:12,008
Of course, my dear.

1101
01:25:12,092 --> 01:25:14,302
Of course.

1102
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:17,013
Do I still have to sleep
in the cupboard?

1103
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,312
Certain as the sun

1104
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:28,066
Rising in the east

1105
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:33,363
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

1106
01:25:33,446 --> 01:25:38,076
Beauty and the beast

1107
01:25:39,494 --> 01:25:42,330
Tale as old as time

1108
01:25:42,414 --> 01:25:45,876
Song as old as rhyme

1109
01:25:45,959 --> 01:25:51,214
Beauty and the beast

1110
01:26:16,322 --> 01:26:20,618
Tale as old as time

1111
01:26:22,495 --> 01:26:26,750
True as it can be

1112
01:26:28,835 --> 01:26:31,880
Barely even friends

1113
01:26:31,963 --> 01:26:35,091
Then somebody bends

1114
01:26:35,175 --> 01:26:39,679
Unexpectedly

1115
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:44,934
Just a little change

1116
01:26:47,604 --> 01:26:50,565
Small to say the least

1117
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:53,735
Both a little scared

1118
01:26:53,818 --> 01:26:56,821
Neither one prepared

1119
01:26:56,905 --> 01:27:01,576
Beauty and the beast

1120
01:27:03,244 --> 01:27:07,957
Everjust the same

1121
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:14,631
Ever a surprise

1122
01:27:15,757 --> 01:27:21,679
Ever as before
and everjust as sure

1123
01:27:21,763 --> 01:27:26,184
As the sun will rise

1124
01:27:53,086 --> 01:27:57,548
Everjust the same

1125
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:05,431
Ever a surprise

1126
01:28:05,515 --> 01:28:08,601
Ever as before

1127
01:28:08,684 --> 01:28:11,646
Everjust as sure

1128
01:28:11,729 --> 01:28:15,525
As the sun will rise

1129
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:25,201
Tale as old as time

1130
01:28:27,495 --> 01:28:31,582
Tune as old as song

1131
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:36,879
Bittersweet and strange

1132
01:28:36,963 --> 01:28:39,966
Finding you can change

1133
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:44,387
Learning you were wrong

1134
01:28:46,263 --> 01:28:52,436
Certain as the sun

1135
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,564
Rising in the east

1136
01:28:55,648 --> 01:28:58,567
Tale as old as time

1137
01:28:58,651 --> 01:29:01,779
Song as old as rhyme

1138
01:29:01,862 --> 01:29:06,409
Beauty and the beast

1139
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:11,080
Tale as old as time

1140
01:29:11,163 --> 01:29:14,542
Song as old as rhyme

1141
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:21,841
Beauty and the beast

1142
01:29:45,698 --> 01:29:54,873
Beauty and the beast

1143
01:29:55,305 --> 01:30:55,942

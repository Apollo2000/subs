2
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,645
It looks like a paradise,but
it is in fact

3
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,316
the most treacherous desert
in the world--the Kalahari.

4
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,050
After the short rainy season,

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,322
there are many water holes,
and even rivers,

6
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,257
but after a few weeks,
the water sinks away

7
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,193
into the deep Kalahari sand.

8
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,396
The water holes dry up,
and the rivers stop flowing.

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,998
The grass fades
to a beautiful blond color

10
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,668
that offers excellent grazing
for the animals,

11
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,505
but for the next nine months,
there'll be no water to drink,

12
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,541
so most of the animals
move away,

13
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,277
leaving the beautiful
blond grass uneaten.

14
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:19,347
Humans avoid the deep Kalahari
like the plague,

15
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,015
because man must have water
to live,

16
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:26,687
so the beautiful landscapes
are devoid of people...

17
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,224
except for the little people
of the Kalahari.

18
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,667
Pretty, dainty,
small and graceful,

19
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,235
the Bushmen.

20
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,971
Where any other person would
die of thirst in a few days,

21
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,440
they live quite contentedly
in this desert

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,609
that doesn't look
like a desert.

23
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,380
They know where to dig
for roots and bulbs and tubers,

24
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,783
and which berries and pods
are good to eat.

25
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,201
And, of course, they know
what to do about water.

26
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,503
For instance,
in the early morning,

27
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,571
you can collect dewdrops
from leaves

28
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,908
that were carefully laid out
the previous evening...

29
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:27,481
or a plume of grass
can be a reservoir,

30
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,550
and if you have the know-how,

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,686
an insignificant clump of twigs
can tell you where to dig,

32
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,223
then you'll come to light
with an enormous tuber.

33
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,093
You scrape shavings off it

34
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,631
with a stick that was split
to give it a sharp edge.

35
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,266
You take a handful
of the shavings,

36
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,935
point your thumb at your mouth
and squeeze.

37
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,679
They must be the most
contented people in the world.

38
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,482
They have no crime,
no punishment,

39
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,050
no violence, no laws,

40
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,988
no police, judges,
rulers, or bosses.

41
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:12,293
They believe that the gods
put only good and useful things

42
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,094
on the earth for them to use.

43
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,798
In this world of theirs,
nothing is bad or evil.

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,869
Even a poisonous snake
is not bad.

45
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,738
You just have to keep away
from the sharp end.

46
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,343
Actually, a snake is very good.

47
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,579
In fact, it's delicious,

48
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,215
and the skin
makes a fine pouch.

49
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,285
They live in the vastness
of the Kalahari

50
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,320
in small family groups.

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,822
One family of Bushmen might
meet up with another family

52
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,224
once in a few years,
but for the most part,

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,926
they live
in complete isolation,

54
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:49,763
quite unaware that there are
other people in the world.

55
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,132
In the deep Kalahari,
there are Bushmen

56
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,436
who have never seen
or heard of civilized man.

57
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,371
Sometimes they hear
a thundering sound

58
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,340
when there are no clouds
in the sky,

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,642
and they assume the gods
have eaten too much again,

60
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,612
and their tummies
are rumbling up there.

61
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,246
Sometimes, they can even
see the evidence

62
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,882
of the gods' flatulence.

63
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,852
Their language has
an idiosyncrasy of its own.

64
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:16,256
It seems to consist
mainly of clicking sounds.

65
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,163
They're very gentle people.

66
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,999
They'll never punish a child
or even speak harshly to it,

67
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,902
so, of course, those kids
are extremely well-behaved,

68
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,340
and their games are cute
and inventive.

69
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,851
When the family needs meat,
the hunter dips his tiny arrow

70
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,886
in a brew that acts
as a tranquilizer,

71
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,021
so when he shoots a buck,
it only feels a sting,

72
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,657
and the arrow drops out.

73
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,493
The buck runs away,
but soon it gets very drowsy

74
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,027
and it stops running.

75
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,833
After a while,
it goes to sleep...

76
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,972
and the hunter apologizes
to his prey.

77
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,174
He explains
that his family needs the meat.

78
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,745
The one characteristic

79
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,947
which really makes the Bushmen
different

80
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,849
from all the other
races on Earth

81
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,686
is the fact that they have
no sense of ownership at all.

82
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,355
Where they live, there's really
nothing you can own--

83
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:24,392
only trees
and grass and animals.

84
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:25,693
In fact, these Bushmen
have never seen

85
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,260
a stone or a rock
in their lives.

86
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,199
The hardest things they know
are wood and bone.

87
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,435
They live in a gentle world,

88
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:39,172
where nothing is as hard
as rock, or steel, or concrete.

89
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,344
Only 600 miles to the south,
there's a vast city...

90
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,918
and here you find
civilized man.

91
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,743
Civilized man
refused to adapt himself

92
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,811
to his environment.

93
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,080
Instead, he adapted
his environment to suit him,

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,316
so he built cities, roads,
vehicles, machinery,

95
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,718
and he put up power lines

96
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,688
to run
his labor-saving devices,

97
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,723
but somehow,
he didn't know when to stop.

98
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,459
The more
he improved his surroundings

99
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,594
to make his life easier,

100
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,496
the more complicated
he made it,

101
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,797
so now his children
are sentenced

102
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,533
to 10 to 15 years of school

103
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,234
just to learn how to survive

104
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,936
in this complex
and hazardous habitat

105
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,105
they were born into.
And civilized man,

106
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,475
who refused to adapt himself
to his natural surroundings,

107
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,877
now finds he has to adapt
and re-adapt himself

108
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,779
every day
and every hour of the day

109
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,181
to his self-created
environment.

110
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,316
For instance,
if the day is called Monday

111
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,385
and the number 7-3-0 comes up,

112
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,489
you have to dis-adapt yourself
from your domestic surroundings

113
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,823
and re-adapt yourself

114
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:07,094
to an entirely
different environment.

115
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,168
8-00 means everybody
has to look busy.

116
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,311
I've got a very good story here
about handicapped children.

117
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,715
- Handicapped children?
- No! You don't...

118
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,984
Uh, yeah, all right.
Look, I'm sorry.

119
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,753
I'll only print
sweetness and light,

120
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,387
even if
it bores the pants off them.

121
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:38,191
10-3-0 says you can stop
looking busy for 15 minutes...

122
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:45,265
and then
you have to look busy again.

123
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,366
Hi, Kate.
Hi, Pete.

124
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,801
Think you can use this?

125
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,637
It's about the shortage
of teachers in Botswana.

126
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,638
Good story?

127
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,540
Yeah, they're so short,

128
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,041
they'll take anybody
who can read and write.

129
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,876
I don't know.
I got bawled out

130
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,811
for writing a story
on mugging.

131
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,047
He says my page should only
have sweetness and light,

132
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,949
like Liberace
and Jackie Onassis. I'm sorry.

133
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,585
And so your day is chopped up
into little pieces,

134
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,086
and in each segment of time,

135
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,788
you have adapt
to a new set of circumstances.

136
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,057
May I share a table?

137
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,026
No wonder some people
go off the rails a bit.

138
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,031
Does the noise
in my head bother you?

139
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,702
No.

140
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,704
Pete, Have you still
got that story

141
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,739
about the teacher
shortage in Botswana?

142
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,440
Yeah.
You going to use it?

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,876
No. Maybe they can use me.

144
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,911
But in the Kalahari,

145
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,446
it's always Tuesday,
or Thursday if you like,

146
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,048
or Sunday.

147
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:39,319
No clocks or calendars
tell you to do this or that.

148
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,155
Lately, strange new things
sometimes appeared in the sky--

149
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:46,694
noisy birds that flew
without flapping their wings.

150
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,710
One day,
something fell from the sky.

151
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,927
Xi had never seen
anything like this in his life.

152
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,162
It looked like water,

153
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,933
but it was harder than
anything else in the world.

154
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,201
He wondered why the gods
had sent this thing

155
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,170
down to the earth.

156
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,943
It was the strangest
and most beautiful thing

157
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,811
they had ever seen,

158
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,380
and they wondered why the gods
had sent it to them.

159
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,089
Pabo got his finger
stuck in the thing,

160
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,759
and the children
thought he was very funny.

161
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,605
At first, Xi tried
the thing out to cure thongs.

162
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,109
It had the right shape
and just the right weight.

163
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,681
It was also beautifully smooth
and ideal for curing snakeskin.

164
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,188
And Pabo discovered
you could make music on it,

165
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:26,226
and every day, they discovered
a new use for the thing.

166
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,330
It was harder and heavier
and smoother

167
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,532
than anything
they'd ever known.

168
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,902
It was the most useful thing
the gods had ever given them,

169
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:38,706
a real labor-saving device...

170
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,709
but the gods had been careless.

171
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,244
They had sent only one,

172
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,979
and now for the first time
in their lives,

173
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,781
here was a thing
which could not be shared,

174
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,383
because there was only
one of it.

175
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,226
Suddenly, everybody needed it
most of the time.

176
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,329
A thing they didn't need before
became a necessity,

177
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,465
and unfamiliar emotions
began to stir,

178
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,668
a feeling of wanting to own,
of not wanting to share.

179
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,146
And other new things came--

180
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:25,052
anger, jealousy,
hate, and violence.

181
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,869
Xi was angry with the gods.

182
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,536
He shouted,
"Take back your thing!

183
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,007
"We don't want it! Look
at the trouble it brought."

184
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,009
But the gods
did not take it back.

185
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,312
He shouted, "You must be crazy
to send us this thing!

186
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,881
Take it back!"

187
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,749
Then he shouted,
"Look out! Look out!"

188
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,919
But he spoke too late,

189
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,721
and the thing felled
his daughter, Dani.

190
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:23,944
Xi carried the thing away
from the shelter and buried it.

191
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,225
That evening,
there was no laughter

192
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,527
and no chatter
around the family fire.

193
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,198
A strange feeling of shame
had come over the family,

194
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,267
and they were very quiet.

195
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,074
Xi said,
"I have buried the thing.

196
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:57,177
It will not
make us unhappy again."

197
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,494
That night, a hyena smelled
the blood on the thing,

198
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,264
and dug it up...

199
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,336
but a bad-tempered warthog
chased the hyena

200
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,139
away from her territory,
and it dropped the thing.

201
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:35,348
The next day, Dani found it.

202
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,158
Her brother, Toma,
heard her playing on it,

203
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,728
and he said, "Let me try.
Let me try too."

204
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,536
That night,
the family was very unhappy.

205
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,245
They began to talk
about this thing

206
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,013
that had come into their lives.

207
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,581
They did not
have a name for it.

208
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,217
They called it
the "evil thing."

209
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,625
Gaboo said, "Perhaps the gods
were absent-minded

210
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,495
"when they dropped
the evil thing on the earth.

211
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,397
"They've always sent us
only good things,

212
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,833
"like the rain, the trees,
and roots and berries to eat.

213
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,803
"because we are their children,
and they love us,

214
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:08,241
but now, they've sent us
this evil thing."

215
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:15,615
Xi said, "The thing does not
belong on the earth.

216
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,817
"Tomorrow, I will take it
to the end of the earth

217
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,720
and throw it off."

218
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,724
Gobo said, "I think the end
of the earth must be very far.

219
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,527
"I think you will have to walk
for 20 days.

220
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,130
Perhaps 40."

221
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,800
Xi said, "I will start walking
tomorrow."

222
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,137
2,000 miles to the north
in the state of Birani,

223
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,505
trouble was brewing.

224
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,780
It's 35 million to combat
erosion in the Moda valley,

225
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,982
and 6 million for improvement
of the breeding stock--

226
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,118
Hold it, minister.
We can't expect--

227
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,508
Aah!

228
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,194
Get out, my fellow.
We need the car.

229
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,182
That was Sam Boga's gang.

230
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,318
You said they
were in Cabinda.

231
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,019
That's what I thought.

232
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,554
How many got away?

233
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,490
There were two jeeps.
Four got away.

234
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,991
Sam Boga was there?
No.

235
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,294
This time,
he's got to die.

236
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:45,098
Find him and
kill him yourself.

237
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,871
Bring him here.

238
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,448
Where is Sam Boga?

239
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,420
Where is your hideout?

240
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,659
Bring the one
in the corridor.

241
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,329
Bring that one.

242
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,738
Where is Sam Boga?

243
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,240
Where is your hideout?

244
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,376
Take them...

245
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,380
to the helicopter.

246
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,556
They went south.

247
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,824
I'll direct you
from the helicopter.

248
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,293
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,839
Gas guzzler.

250
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,875
Four of the eight assassins
got away in two jeeps.

251
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,944
The other four were
shot down in the Cabinet room

252
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,779
by the security guards
of the president.

253
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,114
Bastards.

254
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,916
The assassins were wearing
the brown T-shirts

255
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,419
which have become the trademark
of the terrorist gang

256
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,587
led by the notorious Sam Boga.

257
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,325
However, eyewitnesses state
that Sam Boga himself

258
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,627
did not take part
in the assassination.

259
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,962
It is assumed that
he masterminded the attack

260
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,665
from a hideout
some distance from the capital.

261
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,600
Government sources announced

262
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,936
that the assassins killed
the ministers of education,

263
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,771
public works and agriculture.

264
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,139
The president,

265
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,041
who miraculously survived
the hail of bullets

266
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,676
with only a flesh wound

267
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,811
will be addressing the nation
in a few moments.

268
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,587
We did it! We did it!
We got the president,

269
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,357
and we got five
of his ministers.

270
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,959
You didn't, you know. That's
him.

271
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,595
It was the will of the Almighty
that I was spared,

272
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,498
but we deeply mourn the deaths
of three members of my Cabinet.

273
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,533
We extend
our deepest sympathies--

274
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,403
He's lying. We got six of them.
I saw them go down.

275
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:08,007
You killed three
and wounded five...

276
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,209
and you lost four.

277
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,612
Why do I have to work
with amateurs?

278
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,213
Did you get away clean?

279
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,182
Yes, we were in and out
in two minutes.

280
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,251
They'll never find us.

281
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,875
Attention.

282
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,248
What happened?

283
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,351
We ran out of gas.

284
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,820
How long ago?

285
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,054
About 15 minutes, sir.

286
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:58,291
Okay, let's go!

287
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,597
Now, you tell me.

288
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,503
Where is Sam Boga?

289
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,038
Where is your hideout?

290
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,281
Next time you're going to be
a bit higher.

291
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,552
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

292
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,954
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you!

293
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,791
I'll show you. The banana forest
at Dumgaze.

294
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,793
I'll tell you.
I'll show you where.

295
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,463
Dumgaze. Do you hear me?
Right here, general.

296
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,565
Banana forest at Dumgaze.
Follow me.

297
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,999
Right, general.

298
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,969
The man we want to get
is the president,

299
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,037
not the bloody
Minister of Education.

300
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,507
And this time
I'll come with you.

301
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,676
We'll get him in his bed.

302
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,346
Cover up! Cover up!

303
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,417
Mount the bazooka.

304
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,687
Move it, move it!

305
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:04,991
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

306
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,993
Now take cover.
You, you go there.

307
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,962
Not there, you bloody fool.
Get out of there.

308
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,506
Well?
They're there. They're there.

309
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,674
You cannot see them,
but they're there.

310
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,813
Okay.

311
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,758
You see?
There they are.

312
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,933
Okay.
No, hold it.

313
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:04,884
Okay.

314
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,018
Oh, shit.

315
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,123
Cut it out, man!

316
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,860
Okay.

317
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,380
Born to be our champion.

318
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,381
You showed them.

319
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,382
Beautiful, man.

320
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,350
Quiet.

321
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,755
Stand by.

322
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:02,475
Let's go.

323
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:57,864
The most inquisitive creature
in Africa is the baboon.

324
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,252
He said, "That is a very
evil thing you've got there.

325
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,054
"You'd better
give it back to me

326
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,490
"so I can take it away
and throw it off the earth.

327
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,959
"It brought great unhappiness
to me and my family.

328
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,761
"If you don't give it to me,

329
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,564
it'll bring much grief
to you and your family too."

330
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,168
He spoke long and earnestly

331
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,138
until the baboon
began to pay attention.

332
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,140
In the end,
he must have convinced it,

333
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,710
and it dropped the thing,
and he said,

334
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,779
"You have done
a very wise thing."

335
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,702
You want to go into an
Albert Schweitzer in Botswana?

336
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,971
I just want
to get away from all this

337
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,641
for six months
or a year, or...

338
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,509
But in the Kalahari?
Mom, it's not in the Kalahari.

339
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,179
Botswana isn't all desert.

340
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:18,938
- You bloody son of a--
- Get in there, you...

341
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,639
Why do they put
the bloody nuts

342
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,641
where the bloody spanner
can't get at them?

343
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,578
Right in my bloody face.

344
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:32,484
Every year, I have
to lay here on my back.

345
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,554
Keep it down
a bit, Mpudi.

346
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,958
I'm trying to tune
the scanner.

347
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,328
Okay, Mpudi.
Go ahead.

348
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,430
Every year, you comes here

349
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,333
with a bigger tent
and better equipment,

350
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,236
and every year, you turn up
with this same son of a--,

351
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,404
and I have to work
my ass off.

352
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,209
That's funny.

353
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,980
This elephant's dung
shows a complete lack of boron.

354
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,891
Hello, Reverend.
What are you doing on a horse?

355
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,160
Mm, I hit a rock
with my crankcase.

356
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,195
Cracked it wide open. And the
trouble is,

357
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,065
I have to meet the new
schoolteacher at Mabula today.

358
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, boy. Well,
you can have that one,

359
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,935
but she's in a terrible shape.

360
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:25,637
We've been knocking around
in the Hamadulas.

361
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,174
I promised Mpudi I would
work around here for a while,

362
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,609
so he can have a whole
week to patch her up.

363
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,979
Here, Reverend.
Thank you.

364
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,848
Get in there,
you bloody son of a--

365
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,716
Morning, Mpudi.

366
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,852
Morning, Mpudi!
Morning, Reverend.

367
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:42,254
Will this make it
to Mabula and back?

368
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,290
She's going be
a bastard to start.

369
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,092
Sorry, Reverend.

370
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,294
I put in new rings,
and they're very tight.

371
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,495
But will she make it?

372
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:52,098
You said I could have
a whole week.

373
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,400
This is an emergency.
What we want to know is,

374
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,769
will she make it
to Mabula and back?

375
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,737
I hasn't even
looked at the brakes

376
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,506
or the faulty steering.
Mpudi...

377
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,542
Okay, she'll make it. As soon
as I connect the steering.

378
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,278
She's going to be a bastard
to start. Sorry, Reverend.

379
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,116
There we are, Reverend.
Then she'll be all yours.

380
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,184
I don't think
I can handle her.

381
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,120
I hear Mpudi calls her
the Antichrist.

382
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,455
Well, she is a...thing.

383
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,261
I was hoping--

384
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,863
I was ho--

385
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,436
I was hoping you could go.

386
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,439
Well, Reverend, I'm very
awkward around women.

387
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,775
Yes, aren't we all?
No, it's not like that.

388
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,644
When I'm in the presence
of a lady,

389
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,679
my brain switches off
or something.

390
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,548
I turn into
a complete idiot.

391
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,817
You ought to meet more women.

392
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,785
It only gets worse.

393
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,388
But you will
do this for me?

394
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,098
Come on, Prince. Come on.

395
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:03,202
Go, boy. Come on, boy.
Come on, come on.

396
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,838
Okay.

397
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,074
Okay.

398
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,276
Son of a-- Choke.

399
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:14,346
Choke, choke,
choke, choke.

400
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,350
You tried to murder me,
you son of a--!

401
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,121
Don't ever switch her off
or let her stall.

402
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,555
You'll never start her again.
I know.

403
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,925
And don't park on a slope.
You got no hand brake.

404
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,860
Now you tell me.

405
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,361
Goodbye, Reverend.
Goodbye, Andrew.

406
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,331
Take care, now. Goodbye.
Bye, Mpudi.

407
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,743
One day, a very noisy animal
rushed past

408
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,378
where Xi was sleeping.

409
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,616
It left very peculiar tracks,

410
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,752
as if two enormous snakes
had slithered past.

411
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,207
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

412
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,687
Whoa...

413
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,189
Whoa!

414
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,295
Ay-yi-yi.

415
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,608
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

416
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,136
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

417
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,706
Yi-yi!

418
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,148
Everybody lie down
on the ground.

419
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,150
All of you, lie down!

420
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,087
Come on, lie down,
you and you.

421
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,356
Everybody lie down.

422
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,058
Hey, you.
Didn't you hear me?

423
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,560
Lie down!

424
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,735
He can't hear. He's deaf.
Shut up!

425
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,682
Oh...

426
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:50,261
Hey, wake up! Come
and give us petrol here.

427
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,330
Did two jeeps pass here?

428
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,332
Yes, sir.
They took half my stock.

429
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,869
They took a big drum of petrol,
and they made me to lie down.

430
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,605
If you find them,
please ask them.

431
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:00,972
They must pay me
my money, sir.

432
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,041
It's such a lot
of stuff they took.

433
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:19,991
Morning.

434
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,133
Uh...Miss Thompson?

435
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,401
Yes.

436
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,237
My name--
How do--

437
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:36,141
My name-- My name is--

438
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,143
My name--

439
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,357
My name is Andrew Steyn.

440
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,593
How do you do?

441
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,294
The Reverend cracked
his crankcase,

442
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:59,931
so he asked me to...
Uh...

443
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,679
Uh, thank you.

444
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:41,840
How far do we
have to go?

445
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,610
How far do we have to go?

446
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,111
How--Oof!

447
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,479
Oh, sorry.

448
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,320
Hello, Andrew.

449
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,321
Hello, Phineas.

450
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,322
Good morning, madam.

451
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,857
Good morning.
Aah!

452
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,726
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.
Sorry, sorry.

453
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,694
It's all right.

454
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:04,095
I'm truly sorry, madam.
Sorry.

455
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,631
It's all right.

456
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,338
What are you doing?

457
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,984
What--What--What are you--
Your brakes are shot.

458
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,186
Yes.
What are you doing?

459
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:32,691
I'm opening the gate.

460
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,461
How do I get out of here?

461
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:39,164
No, it's all right. I...

462
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,037
Now, I just, uh...

463
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,681
Oh, this is too weird.
I'm getting out.

464
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,348
No, it's okay.

465
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,719
I, uh, just have to...

466
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,321
What are you doing now?

467
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:05,323
Well, I--I'm closing
the gate, but don't worry.

468
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,826
You crazy? This thing
hasn't got any brakes!

469
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,795
Do you want to get me killed?
Are you crazy?

470
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:12,263
All right, Miss Thompson.
It'll come back.

471
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,366
What?
The Land Rover, it'll come back.

472
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,702
What do you mean,
it'll come back?

473
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,671
It's all right.

474
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,072
I suppose you think
that was funny.

475
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,609
I'm sorry.
The brakes don't work.

476
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,744
I noticed.

477
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,502
Xi saw a very strange
looking person and greeted him,

478
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,304
but the man didn't hear him.

479
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,614
Xi said,
"This is a funny stick.

480
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,184
Did it grow on a tree?"

481
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,870
He couldn't understand
why the man had run away.

482
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,638
Then he realized
the man must've seen

483
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:29,741
the evil thing he was carrying,
and that's what made him run.

484
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:51,229
She stopped.

485
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,431
I noticed.

486
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,901
Can you start her again?

487
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:59,604
No. We gave her new rings,
and they're very tight.

488
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:02,140
How far are we
from the mission?

489
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,075
About 30 miles.

490
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,811
Will we get there
before dark?

491
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:08,780
I don't know.
This thing has stopped.

492
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,716
I noticed.

493
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:12,818
Are you sure you can't
start her again?

494
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:16,154
Yes. This morning it took
a horse and three men.

495
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,089
So now what?
Well, I can make a fire,

496
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:21,559
and there's some food
and a sleeping bag.

497
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,528
Spend the night?

498
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,030
I'm afraid so.

499
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,032
You sure
this thing's stopped?

500
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,366
Yes. Didn't you
notice?

501
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:34,973
I can carry you
across.

502
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,542
Then you don't
have to...

503
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,278
Okay.

504
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,788
Aah! Watch it!
Be careful!

505
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:54,625
Thank you.
Aah! Oh!

506
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,495
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

507
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,830
Aah!

508
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,100
I'm sorry.
Oh, look at my dress!

509
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,269
My shoes! I've lost my shoes!
Your what?

510
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,737
My shoes.

511
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,575
Aah!
I'm sorry.

512
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,377
Well, watch it, buster.

513
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,149
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll fetch your bags.

514
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,952
No don't. You'll drop them.
I'll get them myself.

515
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:25,156
I'm all right.
I'm okay.

516
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,438
Leave that one.
I don't need it.

517
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,251
Idiot.

518
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,649
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! Don't you dare!

519
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:25,917
Go away!

520
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,418
It's all right.
She's gone.

521
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:30,255
Keep away!
You keep away from me!

522
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,991
No, I wasn't-- There was this
warthog.

523
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,960
What warthog?

524
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,228
She's gone now, but--
Keep away.

525
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,464
I wasn't--
Go away!

526
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,333
I wasn't--

527
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,172
I didn't...

528
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,907
Only about half a mile away,

529
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,309
Xi was fixing dinner
when he was rudely interrupted.

530
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:57,515
The rhino is the self-appointed
fire-prevention officer.

531
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:00,585
When he sees a fire,
he rushes in and stamps it out.

532
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,303
Do you work here in Botswana?

533
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,571
Yes, I--

534
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,941
Yes. Yes...

535
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:25,143
And what do you do?

536
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,345
I--I collect manure.

537
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,880
I--

538
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,083
Get away from--
Get away from--

539
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,853
No. Leave me alone!

540
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,114
Miss Thompson?

541
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:07,452
Miss Thompson?

542
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,957
Miss Thompson?

543
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:14,225
Miss Thompson!

544
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,860
Oh, it's all right.

545
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,963
He's gone.
Who's gone?

546
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:20,231
The rhinoceros.
What bloody rhinoceros?

547
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,301
Didn't you see him?
He stamped out the fire.

548
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,636
You stamped out the fire.
I saw you.

549
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,072
No, he did it first.

550
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,140
I didn't want him
to come back, so...

551
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,276
But didn't you see?
Keep away.

552
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:36,181
Miss Thompson,
if you make a fire,

553
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,282
and a rhinoceros sees it,

554
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,517
he comes
and stamps it out.

555
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,220
Rhinos do that.

556
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,789
It's a most interesting
phenomenon.

557
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,124
You get these sudden urges,

558
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,126
and you come up with warthogs
and rhinoceroses.

559
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:49,660
All right, I'll show you.

560
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,162
I'll make another fire.

561
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:55,433
Think I'm lying.

562
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,634
I'll show you.

563
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:05,410
You see how
I'm making another fire?

564
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,844
You'll see.
It'll come back.

565
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:09,080
Think I'm a liar?

566
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:20,992
Maybe it's too far away.

567
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:22,360
Maybe it's upwind.

568
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,644
Mr. Steyn...

569
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,894
Ask them.

570
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,763
They'll tell you rhinoceroses
always stamp out fires.

571
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:00,831
I don't speak
the language.

572
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,100
Okay, I'll ask them.

573
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,543
See?
I noticed.

574
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:13,944
They're Tswanas.

575
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,681
They always shake their heads
when they mean to say yes.

576
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,213
What are you doing?

577
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:51,282
I'm making coffee.

578
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,232
Sir! Sir, some people
went through here.

579
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,533
They didn't show me
their passports,

580
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,101
and they smashed down
the barrier.

581
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:11,802
They've got guns.
This is Frank, sir.

582
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,704
Frank, were they
traveling in two jeeps?

583
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,240
Yes, sir.

584
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,974
They are followed by armored
cars. Can you see them?

585
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:19,344
Excuse me, sir.

586
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,580
Yes, sir.
I can see one.

587
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,182
Stop them
right there!

588
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:25,383
Yes, sir.

589
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:28,186
Stop! Stop, stop,
stop! Stop!

590
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:34,425
Frank? Frank?

591
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,093
Frank, what was that noise?

592
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,629
Frank?

593
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:41,599
I stopped them, sir.

594
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,368
Right. Now,
explain to them

595
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:44,969
that they cannot cross
our border under arms.

596
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,404
We cannot allow them

597
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,339
to violate
our territorial integrity.

598
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,508
Yes, sir--
This is Lieutenant Mabasha.

599
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:52,443
Request permission
to cross your border

600
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,612
in hot pursuit of Sam Boga.
Sorry, Lieutenant.

601
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,615
We cannot allow an armed force
to come into Botswana.

602
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,418
But I've got to get Sam Boga.
He shot up half our Cabinet.

603
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,553
Yes, our police
will track him down

604
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,655
and hand him over to you,
dead or alive.

605
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,535
Can't they help us?

606
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,305
They'll take a message
to the river.

607
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:22,673
I think I can get the thing
out of the river.

608
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,243
There's an electric winch
on the front.

609
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,775
Ah!

610
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:33,844
Ouch. Ow. Ouch.

611
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,281
Ooh. Ow! Oh.

612
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,086
Mr. Steyn?

613
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,921
Mr. Steyn.

614
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:50,127
Miss Thompson?
Could you help me, please?

615
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:53,130
Don't look.

616
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,266
That's a watape tree.

617
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,834
You mustn't go near
a watape tree.

618
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:57,802
They grab you.

619
00:53:57,802 --> 00:54:00,004
Could you hand me my gown,
please?

620
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:02,840
It's in the suitcase.

621
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:11,015
The pink one
with the white edging.

622
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:23,861
Ow! Thank you.

623
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,499
Uh.
Sorry.

624
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,636
Ow.

625
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:34,539
Ouch.

626
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,646
Sorry.

627
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:43,848
Ow!

628
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,021
Sorry.

629
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:16,313
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

630
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,632
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi...

631
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,737
Yi-yi-yi-yi.

632
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:49,847
That morning,

633
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,850
Xi saw the ugliest person
he'd ever come across.

634
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,719
She was as pale as something

635
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,388
that had crawled out
of a rotting log.

636
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:00,357
Her hair was quite gruesome,
long and stringy and white,

637
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,159
as if she was very old.

638
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,929
She was very big.
You'd have to dig the whole day

639
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:08,065
to find enough food
to feed her.

640
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,173
Go away.

641
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,545
Although it was a hot day,

642
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,747
she was covering her body
with skins

643
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,982
that looked as if
they were made from cobwebs.

644
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:33,157
She was doing strange
and magical things,

645
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,059
and it struck him that
she must be one of the gods,

646
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,462
and he wondered what
she was doing here on earth,

647
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:39,229
but he was glad he'd met her,

648
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,331
because now he could give
the evil thing back to her

649
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,034
and go home to his family,
so he said, tactfully,

650
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,470
he didn't need the thing
anymore

651
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,037
and she could have it back,

652
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:51,476
but she was very rude,
and she walked away.

653
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,448
That's a Bushman.
How did he get here?

654
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:58,983
I don't know.
He's very rude.

655
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:02,019
There was another god.
He had a fire inside him

656
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:05,055
and the smoke came out
through his mouth and nostrils.

657
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:06,423
Xi said politely,

658
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,392
"It was very kind of you
to send us this thing,

659
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:11,028
"but it made my family unhappy.
Please take it back."

660
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:14,098
Sorry, no sabe.

661
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,200
Where's the truck?

662
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,116
I'll try and get it down.

663
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,285
There was a peculiar sound

664
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,855
and then Xi saw a most
amazing animal approaching.

665
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:40,625
Its legs went round and round
instead of up and down,

666
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:43,027
and there was a weird-looking
god on its back.

667
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:46,497
He wore a blue skin on his head
and a red one on his body

668
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:48,032
and hair grew on his face.

669
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:50,501
What the hell happened?
Where have you been?

670
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,836
The Reverend
is sure you've left.

671
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,538
The funny thing
about these gods

672
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:55,573
was that they couldn't speak.
They could only make

673
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:57,007
chattering sounds,
like monkeys.

674
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,208
Hi.

675
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,878
What happened, man?
Where's the Antichrist?

676
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:07,718
What the hell
did you do that for, huh?

677
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,387
I'll tell you later.
Let's get it down.

678
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:13,691
And the little Bushman?
What's he doing in these parts?

679
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:15,693
He was trying
to tell me something.

680
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,365
You speak Bushman?
Yeah.

681
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:27,237
The hairy one could speak.

682
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,944
He says, "Thank you
for the bottle,

683
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,780
but you can
have it back now."

684
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,347
Oh, I didn't give it to him.

685
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,349
Well, he don't want the bottle.

686
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,451
Then he'd better
throw it away.

687
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,989
The hairy one said,
"We don't want the thing.

688
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,391
You'll have to
throw it away yourself."

689
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:49,159
Xi was very disappointed.

690
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,061
He thought
it was unfair of the gods

691
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,963
to make him
throw the thing off the earth.

692
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:57,034
In fact, he began to doubt
whether they really were gods.

693
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,548
Get out. Get out. Get out!

694
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,850
Get in there.
Get in there!

695
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,652
Move it, move it.

696
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:17,822
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go!

697
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:46,917
Yes, yes, yes.

698
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,687
Here comes the great
white hunter to the rescue.

699
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:51,388
Miss Thompson, I presume.

700
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,757
Hello, Steyn.

701
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:55,492
How would you like to travel
in style for a change?

702
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:58,528
Yes, thank you.

703
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,165
How do you open this thing?
With a can opener?

704
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,073
Quaint.
My lady?

705
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:10,841
Thank you very much,
Mr. Steyn, for--

706
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,409
Bye-bye, Steyn.

707
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,678
Goodbye,
Miss Thompson.

708
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:15,946
By the way,
I am Jack Hind.

709
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,281
Boy, is the Reverend worried.

710
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,149
He got to me
on the short-wave,

711
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:22,186
so I offered to look for you,
and that was very sweet of me.

712
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,921
It sure was.

713
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,255
Would you like to sit
over there?

714
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:29,927
Sure. Oh, thank you,
Mr. Steyn.

715
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,196
See you, Steyn.
See you, Mpudi.

716
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:08,933
I don't want to talk about it.

717
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:14,171
She thinks I'm a lunatic
and I don't blame her.

718
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,673
You know, she asked me
what do I do,

719
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,243
and I say I collect manure.

720
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:22,880
I don't tell her I analyze it
for my doctoral thesis.

721
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,683
I bet you she thinks
I shovel the stuff.

722
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,755
Was it rough?

723
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:32,656
I'd rather not
talk about it.

724
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:34,291
That rough?

725
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,960
Well, it won't
be long now,

726
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,195
and your suffering will be over.

727
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,663
Only when
you get to the Mission,

728
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:40,965
you'll have to stand there

729
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,499
and look beautiful
for a few minutes

730
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:45,369
while the whole tribe
sings their welcome song at you.

731
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,739
Then you can relax, have a bath,
and a nice breakfast.

732
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,008
Is it true
that when a rhino sees a fire,

733
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:52,910
he stamps it out?

734
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,114
Where did you hear that one?
Did Steyn tell you?

735
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:59,116
Now, why would he want to
tell you a thing like that?

736
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:01,018
I'd rather not talk about it.

737
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:04,021
Here. This will put some hair
on your chest.

738
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,223
That's all I need.

739
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:11,095
She wouldn't believe me

740
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:13,330
about the warthog
and the bloody rhinoceros.

741
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,099
What bloody rhinoceros?

742
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:17,134
I don't want
to talk about it.

743
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:18,936
So how did this thing
get up the tree?

744
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:21,705
She got stuck
in a watape tree,

745
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:23,407
and I had to...

746
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,410
You know she's got flowers
on her panties?

747
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,714
So that's how this thing
got up the tree.

748
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,216
Yes.

749
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:15,325
Don't I wave or take a bow
or something?

750
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,061
No.

751
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,346
Notorious Communist
guerrilla leader

752
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,148
Sam Boga
and his band of assassins

753
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,250
have crashed through the border
into Botswana.

754
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,152
It is believed that they are
heading for Mozambique.

755
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,989
Well, how many?
Not even 300.

756
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:48,158
I told you bastards,
don't waste ammunition!

757
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,060
Now we can't even
fight back anymore.

758
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,262
All of you switch your guns over

759
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:55,732
from automatic
to single-fire.

760
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,601
Anyone who withholds
information

761
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,136
which could lead to the capture
of these criminals--

762
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:02,039
That's automatic,
that's single.

763
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:03,373
However, citizens are warned

764
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,342
that Sam Boga
is a dangerous person,

765
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,777
and that he and his gang
are well-armed,

766
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,180
so it'll be unwise--

767
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,949
And why are you
so beautiful?

768
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,751
I'm going to the school
to give her these.

769
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,153
You're going to
look like that?

770
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:18,622
Like what?
Like it's a funeral.

771
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,991
You've got to smile, man,
and tell her she looks good.

772
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,293
How come suddenly
you're an expert on women?

773
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,295
I've got seven wives.
How many you got?

774
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:27,597
So why aren't you at home
with your seven wives?

775
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,133
I know how to marry them.

776
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:30,867
Nobody knows
how to live with them.

777
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,170
So what did you
marry them for?

778
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,974
Some day I have to tell you
the facts of life.

779
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:47,017
"And yet we all agree
that every plate we break

780
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:49,786
was cracked by Mr. Nobody..."

781
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,277
Come in.

782
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,646
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

783
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,316
Morning, class.

784
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:22,186
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

785
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:24,121
I, uh, I brought--

786
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,593
I'm sorry--

787
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,449
Please, just leave it.

788
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,987
I brought you your shoes.

789
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,296
Come in.

790
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:15,072
Come in.

791
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,243
Shoe.

792
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:42,532
You don't want to talk
about it, huh?

793
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,671
Shame.

794
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,787
There were some
ridiculous-looking animals,

795
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:06,656
but they looked good to eat
and he was hungry.

796
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:42,592
Suddenly, a young boy
made chattering noises at Xi,

797
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:45,529
so he greeted him and said,
"I shot one of those animals.

798
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:48,165
It'll go to sleep soon,
and then we can eat it."

799
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,768
But the boy ran away,

800
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,904
maybe to call his family
to join in the feast.

801
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,593
There was a weird sound,

802
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,862
and another of those
strange animals

803
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:21,365
with the round legs appeared.

804
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,936
The young boy and a grownup
got out of it,

805
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,006
and they seemed very excited.
Xi said, "Come, sit down.

806
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:32,209
There's enough meat
for all of us."

807
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,515
But the man
was rude and greedy.

808
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,450
He took the whole animal.

809
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,854
Xi said,
"You have very bad manners.

810
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,556
"If you want to eat
the whole thing,

811
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,792
I'll have to shoot another one
for myself."

812
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:53,963
The man shouted at him,

813
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,965
but he didn't want
to have anything to do

814
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,802
with such an uncouth person,
so he ignored him.

815
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:01,371
Suddenly,
there was a thunderclap.

816
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:04,541
The animals ran away,
and Xi ran after them.

817
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:05,875
He was very hungry.

818
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,295
Do you speak English?

819
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:26,630
You are free
to remain silent

820
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,097
until you have
seen your lawyer,

821
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,433
but if you choose
to speak now,

822
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:32,302
whatever you say
will be taken down

823
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:33,603
as evidence against you.

824
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:52,155
And why are you
so beautiful?

825
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:54,157
I got to go to court.

826
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:55,992
What did you do?

827
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,727
No. The cops
were here.

828
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:00,664
They say they caught a little
Bushman for stock theft.

829
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:03,166
They say all he can speak
is "Xixo, xixo, xixo,"

830
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,934
so they want me to interpret.

831
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,836
Call Xi now.

832
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,372
Xixo.

833
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,543
They brought Xi
into a place

834
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,178
where there were
several people.

835
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:18,815
He smiled at them in greeting,
but nobody smiled back.

836
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:31,595
Interpreter.

837
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:41,104
You, Xixo,
are hereby charged

838
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:43,440
with wrongfully and unlawfully
slaughtering one goat

839
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,977
on the 21st of September, 1980,
in Oniamatokwe.

840
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,914
How plead you?
Guilty or not guilty?

841
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,950
Mpudi found it very difficult
to interpret,

842
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:58,288
because in his language
there was no word for "guilty."

843
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,727
Finally, he asked,
"Did you shoot an animal?"

844
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,795
Xi said, "Yes, I did,
but that man took it.

845
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,365
He did not want
to share it with me."

846
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:10,099
Well, what does he plead?

847
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,835
Not guilty.

848
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:13,937
They gave him
the death sentence.

849
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,138
For killing a goat?

850
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:16,272
No.

851
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,708
Three months in jail,
same thing.

852
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,144
He's going to die
for sure.

853
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:23,580
He never seen a wall
in his life.

854
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,148
Now, he got walls
all around him.

855
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:26,383
But didn't you
explain to them?

856
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:29,218
They said,
"Silence in court."

857
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,088
But surely
they ought to know.

858
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:35,825
Nobody knows the Bushmen.

859
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:38,462
Nobody ever goes
into the deep Kalahari.

860
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,497
How come you know
so much about them?

861
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:43,967
Way back, when Botswana
belonged to the British,

862
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,403
I hit a policeman
because he insulted my father,

863
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:48,438
so I fled,
right into the Kalahari.

864
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:52,442
I died, you know.
Dehydration.

865
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,544
Some of those little buggers
found me,

866
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:56,012
and they buried me.

867
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:57,914
Only my head stuck out,
and for about two weeks,

868
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:00,684
they kept on pushing water
and food into my mouth,

869
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:02,852
and when they dug me up,
I was nearly white,

870
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:04,454
like you, yeah.

871
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:06,590
I lived with them
for three years.

872
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,257
They're the sweetest
little buggers.

873
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,895
He's going to die for sure.

874
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,576
Can I go to Mahadi
tomorrow?

875
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,746
You want to go and see
little what's his name?

876
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:31,280
I want to get him out.

877
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,316
Now, don't do
anything silly.

878
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:35,485
They got to
let him out.

879
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:39,055
Maybe if we explain
to them.

880
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:41,958
You coming too?

881
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:43,393
Yes.

882
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,914
Says he's sorry.

883
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:06,716
He try to eat the food
tomorrow.

884
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,318
Has he eaten anything?
It's been a week.

885
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,954
No.

886
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:16,460
Of course we're worried.
We can't force-feed him.

887
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,027
You've got
to let him out.

888
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:19,362
He's got 11 weeks to go.

889
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:20,730
Well, is there no way?

890
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,198
Can't we buy him out
or something?

891
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,734
Well, if somebody
wants to employ him

892
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,269
as a convict-laborer,

893
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:29,506
but he has no experience,
no qualifications.

894
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:31,374
He's got qualifications.

895
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,743
He could teach you things
about plants and animals.

896
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,812
Yes.

897
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:38,915
We want to employ him
as an ecological expert.

898
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,093
He will have to remain
in your employ

899
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,160
for the full 11 weeks.

900
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,396
If he leaves, we will
have to hunt him down

901
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:55,231
and lock him up
for a very long time.

902
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:57,166
Okay, thanks.

903
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:15,051
We can't put him inside.
No, you're right.

904
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:04,233
I understand the words,
but the meaning?

905
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:09,573
Talks about a bad thing,
uh, an evil thing,

906
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:11,641
and about the end of the world.

907
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:13,376
Well, explain to him
he has to stay with us

908
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:14,711
for the full 11 weeks.

909
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:17,446
He doesn't know from weeks.

910
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,482
All right. We'll tell him
when it's okay to go.

911
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:30,359
Hello, Andrew, Mpudi.
Hello, Jack.

912
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,061
I hear you've got a Bushman
working for you.

913
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,764
Is that him?
Yeah, his name is Xi.

914
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:37,466
Are they good trackers?
Best in the world.

915
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:38,835
Mind if I borrow him?

916
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:40,704
One of my bloody guests
wounded a cougar,

917
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,071
and my trackers can't find it.

918
01:15:48,778 --> 01:15:50,780
This is where
we lost him.

919
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:14,237
You'll see, he'll find him.
Shh.

920
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,787
Hey! Hey!
Wait for us!

921
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:47,370
Scram. Go away!

922
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,172
Shoo. Shoo. Get.

923
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,711
Go away.

924
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:09,726
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize--

925
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,861
I don't want to talk about it.

926
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,441
What do you want?

927
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:27,276
Hurry up.

928
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:29,913
Hurry up. Get them out.

929
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:32,381
Come on. Come on. Get him.
Hurry up, man.

930
01:17:44,928 --> 01:17:47,864
You can drop those guns.

931
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,942
You want me
to let fly?

932
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:05,481
Now get out,
with your hands up.

933
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,123
Bring out
all the kids.

934
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:20,363
Sergeant, I'm going to walk
due east from here to Motambe,

935
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:22,631
and I'm taking
all these kids with me.

936
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,233
If I see one truck

937
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:26,903
or one airplane
or one policeman or one soldier

938
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:30,539
or one person,
we'll mow these kids down.

939
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,877
Have you got
short-wave in there?

940
01:18:33,877 --> 01:18:36,345
Yes.
Now get on to headquarters,

941
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:39,415
and tell them I want
a corridor 10 miles wide.

942
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:42,585
The army and the police
better clear out everybody,

943
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:47,123
and they've got to put down
food and water every 20 miles,

944
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:49,358
and get the hell out of the way
before we get there.

945
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:53,296
Tell them that.

946
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,798
All right,
get them into a circle.

947
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,365
I want a big circle around me.

948
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,067
You've got to leave
the small ones here.

949
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,268
It's miles and miles
to Motambe.

950
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,536
They'll never
make it.

951
01:19:05,008 --> 01:19:06,542
Okay, now buzz off,

952
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,544
and start clearing out
the people from this end,

953
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:11,114
because I want
to start marching in two hours.

954
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:18,054
And I warn you,
you better clear out everybody.

955
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,926
Clutch!

956
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:31,134
Brake. Brake!

957
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,337
Clutch. Clutch!

958
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:39,843
I'm teaching him
to drive,

959
01:19:39,843 --> 01:19:41,377
just for
the hell of it.

960
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:43,980
Nothing else to do
around here anyhow.

961
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,781
You still mooning
about the schoolmarm?

962
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,717
Sort of. I want to move up
to Nioko for a few days,

963
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,519
so we can do a game count.

964
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:52,956
So how is this thing going
to get us through the jungle?

965
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,323
We strip it down.

966
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:12,008
Come on, Xi.
Come on!

967
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,948
Ha, ha, ha.
He don't know from doors.

968
01:20:55,318 --> 01:20:57,453
Stop playing
that bloody game.

969
01:20:57,453 --> 01:21:00,023
Okay, it's time.
Let's go. Move them.

970
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:04,160
Come on, everybody up.
Come on, let's go.

971
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,462
Keep them going.
Keep them in a circle around me.

972
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:09,432
Move them. Move them.
Don't leave any stragglers.

973
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:12,168
Keep your paws to yourself.
You shut up, see?

974
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,105
Get them into a circle.
A circle, a circle!

975
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,575
Stop yelling at them.

976
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:21,377
That's not a bloody circle.
Can't you do anything right?

977
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,379
I can't get them into a circle.

978
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,948
They keep coming up
in a square.

979
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:28,617
All right, make it a square.
Let them walk in a square.

980
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,653
Keep them going.
Don't let them straggle.

981
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:34,490
Who says
they'll come this way?

982
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,493
He says he wants a corridor
10 miles wide.

983
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:39,963
Well, I'm sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.

984
01:21:39,963 --> 01:21:41,965
We'll have to
get out of the way for now

985
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:43,199
until he passes this point.

986
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,467
Where can I find Andrew Steyn?

987
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:46,902
Yeah, you'd better
warn him too.

988
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,604
He's about five miles
that-a-way.

989
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:51,174
You turn right at the, uh--
Damn it, I'll come and show you.

990
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:55,178
Johnny, will you
take them to Machadi?

991
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:13,329
Tell them to sing.

992
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:16,132
Come on, everybody.
Sing, sing!

993
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:41,284
Wouldn't you know?

994
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:43,219
Now where the hell
do we find him?

995
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:49,725
They left
this morning.

996
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:52,595
Come on!

997
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,126
They went through.

998
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:25,461
They'll meet up
with Boga for sure.

999
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:27,062
Is there
a way around this?

1000
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,731
It's a hell
of a long way.

1001
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,065
Well, let's go.

1002
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:04,600
Mpudi.

1003
01:25:23,186 --> 01:25:27,089
One, two, three...

1004
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:28,957
four, five...

1005
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,694
six adult oryx.

1006
01:25:34,197 --> 01:25:37,333
He says there are people things
down there.

1007
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:40,369
Where?
Down there.

1008
01:25:50,413 --> 01:25:53,449
Army truck. Unloading something.

1009
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:56,852
I wonder
what they're up to.

1010
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:04,860
Looks like food.
Cooking pots and stuff.

1011
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,495
Maybe it's a picnic.

1012
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:10,199
That's funny.
They're going away.

1013
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:14,303
They went away
and just left their stuff.

1014
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:16,405
Yeah, funny.

1015
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,709
Oh, well.

1016
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:23,712
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

1017
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,469
You've got to let them rest.

1018
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:48,671
The smaller ones can't keep up.

1019
01:26:48,671 --> 01:26:51,507
They can rest when
they get to the food.

1020
01:26:51,507 --> 01:26:53,175
You're driving them
too hard.

1021
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:55,143
It's a long way
to Motambe.

1022
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:56,745
But you said 20 miles.

1023
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:58,714
They can't walk 20 miles
without eating.

1024
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,283
Halt!

1025
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:08,991
Look at that!

1026
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:13,296
I told you,
stop playing that bloody game!

1027
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,903
You've got to let
the little ones turn back.

1028
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,571
Nobody turns back.

1029
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:26,809
Next thing, everybody's
going to get sore feet.

1030
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:29,478
Next one drops out,
I shoot him!

1031
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:31,514
You, you, help her.

1032
01:27:31,514 --> 01:27:33,449
If you got to carry her,
carry her.

1033
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:37,986
If I catch you
playing again, by God...

1034
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:39,488
March!

1035
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:43,025
They can't march 20 miles.
They're not soldiers!

1036
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:46,362
If they want to eat,
they'd better march 20 miles!

1037
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:48,631
Are you scared
it'll spoil your image

1038
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:51,567
if you admit
you made a mistake?

1039
01:27:53,235 --> 01:27:54,737
Halt!

1040
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:04,880
You! Come here.

1041
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:13,856
See that hill over there?

1042
01:28:13,856 --> 01:28:15,824
Go to the top
and wave this thing

1043
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,960
until the army people
see you.

1044
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,294
Then you go down to them,

1045
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:24,400
and tell them Sam Boga
made a mistake.

1046
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,406
Now, I want them to leave food
every 10 miles.

1047
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:31,607
Understand?

1048
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:35,010
Yes.
Now, get going. Move!

1049
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:40,783
March!

1050
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:44,987
One ostrich, and
four, five, six, seven--

1051
01:28:56,365 --> 01:28:58,066
A lot of children.

1052
01:28:58,066 --> 01:29:00,102
The food must have been
left there for them.

1053
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:02,037
Hey, what the hell?
They've got guns.

1054
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:03,138
The kids?

1055
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:05,273
No. There are men down there
with guns.

1056
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,443
It's no picnic.

1057
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:09,678
I think those kids are hostages.

1058
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,914
What was that on the news
about Sam Boga?

1059
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,115
You reckon?

1060
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:19,955
That man said
I must go to the top,

1061
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:22,357
and I must wave
my conga.

1062
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,365
So Miss Kate said
20 miles is too much.

1063
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,501
Is she down there?
Yes.

1064
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:46,381
We'll have to immobilize them.

1065
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,917
Are Bushmen
good stalkers?

1066
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:50,385
Best in the world.

1067
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,254
Let him
have a look at them.

1068
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:00,429
All right.

1069
01:30:00,429 --> 01:30:01,897
Explain to him

1070
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,732
that the men with the guns
are bad men

1071
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:05,668
and we have to
put them to sleep.

1072
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:14,710
He want to know how did
all those people get in there?

1073
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:17,513
No, no, they're not...

1074
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:20,282
You explain.

1075
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:22,551
One hour, then we move.

1076
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:24,787
I'm going to have a snooze.

1077
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,246
"Dear Miss Thompson--

1078
01:30:51,246 --> 01:30:55,851
"Your abductors have been
injected with an immobilizer.

1079
01:30:55,851 --> 01:30:59,054
When they go to sleep,
you must disarm them."

1080
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:01,657
Tell him
he must give her the note

1081
01:31:01,657 --> 01:31:03,325
only after he's shot
all the men.

1082
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:09,665
And when he shoots,

1083
01:31:09,665 --> 01:31:12,100
he must pull back on the thread
very quickly

1084
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,302
so the man can think
it was a horsefly

1085
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,238
or a wasp that stung him.

1086
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:26,882
Mm-hm. He's fast.
It'll work.

1087
01:31:26,882 --> 01:31:29,251
He must dip the needle
each time.

1088
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,322
I can't see
the little bugger.

1089
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:08,757
Yeah, I see him.

1090
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,079
Now, look at that.

1091
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:33,782
Yeah, he's clever.

1092
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:45,594
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1093
01:32:45,594 --> 01:32:48,631
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1094
01:32:48,631 --> 01:32:50,733
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1095
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,619
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1096
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:12,621
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1097
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:41,717
Nothing's happening
down there.

1098
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:43,786
It takes time.

1099
01:33:48,724 --> 01:33:50,693
Who are you?

1100
01:34:34,136 --> 01:34:36,238
You know,
some of those guys are down.

1101
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:39,607
She's going to need help
when they wake up.

1102
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:42,444
Hey, Charlie, wake up, man.
You've got to wake up.

1103
01:34:42,444 --> 01:34:47,015
Come on, you can't sleep now.
Come on...

1104
01:35:11,073 --> 01:35:12,741
We need some rope
to tie them up.

1105
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:14,009
There's plenty
in the Land Rover.

1106
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:15,243
Okay--no,
he can fetch it.

1107
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:17,612
I didn't teach him
for nothing.

1108
01:35:21,984 --> 01:35:24,652
Says he don't understand
the gears.

1109
01:35:26,789 --> 01:35:27,890
Told him he can drive
in any gear.

1110
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:29,557
Okay, let's go!

1111
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,426
And you take that one.

1112
01:35:31,426 --> 01:35:33,728
And you, that one.

1113
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:34,963
And I'll take--

1114
01:35:36,765 --> 01:35:40,002
There's only six.
There should be eight.

1115
01:35:48,143 --> 01:35:49,778
Maybe they're asleep as well.

1116
01:35:49,778 --> 01:35:51,746
I don't know.

1117
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:57,152
All right.

1118
01:35:57,152 --> 01:36:00,422
I want you to circulate
among the children.

1119
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:01,589
Quietly.

1120
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:03,458
And tell them
that when we grab the guns,

1121
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:07,029
they must run very fast
into that crevice behind us

1122
01:36:07,029 --> 01:36:08,763
and take cover, okay?

1123
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:10,098
Good.

1124
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:24,412
Ready? Go!

1125
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:32,888
Come on!

1126
01:36:41,563 --> 01:36:43,465
No! Get down, get down.

1127
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:45,467
And stay there.

1128
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,340
Get back, get back,
all of you.

1129
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:55,277
Hey, watch it!

1130
01:36:55,277 --> 01:36:56,811
Sorry.

1131
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:09,391
We've got to
outflank them.

1132
01:37:09,391 --> 01:37:11,793
You go around.
I'll keep you covered.

1133
01:37:33,448 --> 01:37:35,750
Get back. Get back.

1134
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:39,221
Hurry up.

1135
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:46,328
Kate?

1136
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:52,334
You okay?
Yep.

1137
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:54,436
Who are they shooting at?
I don't know.

1138
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:01,543
Four, five, six.

1139
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:02,877
There are two missing.

1140
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:04,046
Yeah, this one here,

1141
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:05,981
and I heard some shots
from over there.

1142
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:16,524
Look.

1143
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:35,010
Roll over.

1144
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:37,379
Mpudi, hold him.

1145
01:40:03,765 --> 01:40:06,168
What happened?

1146
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:08,936
Have you got water in there?

1147
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:10,638
Hold these for me.

1148
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:17,079
Get up.

1149
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:18,646
But what happened, man?

1150
01:40:18,646 --> 01:40:21,049
Oh, it's a long story.

1151
01:40:21,049 --> 01:40:24,086
What happened to those guys?
Are they all dead?

1152
01:40:25,587 --> 01:40:26,921
Did you kill them?

1153
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:28,890
They've been immobilized.
They're sleeping.

1154
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,625
Where's Kate
and the kids?

1155
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:33,995
They're hiding back there.
They can come out now.

1156
01:40:33,995 --> 01:40:36,098
Oh, my God.
Mpudi.

1157
01:40:37,065 --> 01:40:38,600
Keep that guy covered.

1158
01:40:46,608 --> 01:40:51,045
Kate! It's okay.
You can come out now.

1159
01:40:54,349 --> 01:40:57,585
We've got everything
under control. You can come out.

1160
01:40:57,585 --> 01:40:58,620
Jack?

1161
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,455
Hi there.
The marines have landed.

1162
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:03,191
It's okay.
You can all come out now.

1163
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:06,261
All right,
come on, come on.

1164
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:24,279
You're safe now.

1165
01:41:24,279 --> 01:41:25,347
Sergeant, you'd better
collect those men

1166
01:41:25,347 --> 01:41:26,648
before they wake up.

1167
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:28,250
You all right?

1168
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,984
Did you fix him good?

1169
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,086
Yeah, get up.

1170
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:35,089
Walk.

1171
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:39,627
Ay-yi-yi!

1172
01:41:43,998 --> 01:41:47,502
Oh, you had
a tough time, huh?

1173
01:41:47,502 --> 01:41:49,036
Watch out!

1174
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:50,438
Stop fooling around, Steyn!

1175
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,375
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1176
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:04,686
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

1177
01:42:10,592 --> 01:42:12,327
I'm sorry.

1178
01:42:12,327 --> 01:42:15,530
It's all right, Steyn.
Move.

1179
01:42:23,205 --> 01:42:24,706
My lady.

1180
01:42:26,608 --> 01:42:28,576
Sergeant, you'd better
get on the radio

1181
01:42:28,576 --> 01:42:31,379
and organize some buses
to take the kids home.

1182
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,715
How come suddenly
he's the big hero?

1183
01:42:33,715 --> 01:42:37,419
Ay-yi. We'd better get back
to our equipment.

1184
01:42:48,129 --> 01:42:50,232
Says thank you
and goodbye

1185
01:42:50,232 --> 01:42:51,633
and hopes you have
lots of children.

1186
01:42:51,633 --> 01:42:53,067
Tell him thank you.
I'll miss him.

1187
01:42:53,067 --> 01:42:54,802
He can't
use that stuff.

1188
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:57,639
Well, I have to--
Bushmen don't know about money.

1189
01:42:57,639 --> 01:42:59,173
Well, what else
can I give him?

1190
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,508
There's nothing here
he can use.

1191
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,410
Bushmen don't need things.

1192
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:04,346
He's got to take the money.
It's the law.

1193
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:14,756
He's going the wrong way.
The Kalahari's that way.

1194
01:43:17,892 --> 01:43:20,094
Says he got to find
the evil thing

1195
01:43:20,094 --> 01:43:21,263
and get rid of it.

1196
01:43:21,263 --> 01:43:23,498
I don't know.

1197
01:43:23,498 --> 01:43:26,100
I'm going to miss
the little bugger.

1198
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,835
Yeah. Me too.

1199
01:43:27,835 --> 01:43:29,237
You going to look
like that forever?

1200
01:43:29,237 --> 01:43:30,572
Like what?

1201
01:43:30,572 --> 01:43:32,039
Like Jack Hind
is a better man than you.

1202
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,575
No, I'm going
to talk to her.

1203
01:43:33,575 --> 01:43:35,643
Tell her you were
the big hero.

1204
01:43:35,643 --> 01:43:39,146
No, I can't do that,
but I do want to talk to her.

1205
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:41,883
I'll tell her...

1206
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:45,052
I'll say,
"Look, Miss Thompson,

1207
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:49,090
"I know you think I'm an idiot,
but normally, I'm quite normal.

1208
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:51,293
"It's only when I'm
in the presence of a lady

1209
01:43:51,293 --> 01:43:53,160
"that I, uh...

1210
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:56,598
"It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

1211
01:43:56,598 --> 01:43:58,600
"If a man who is susceptible

1212
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,269
"to a type of para-Freudian
syndrome like this

1213
01:44:01,269 --> 01:44:03,738
encounters a nubile female,
what happens?"

1214
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:07,575
I suppose another
big word happens.

1215
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,143
Too erudite, huh?

1216
01:44:09,143 --> 01:44:10,912
Yeah,
whatever that means.

1217
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:15,016
Okay. I'll put it more simply.
I'll say--

1218
01:44:15,016 --> 01:44:16,418
"Look, Miss Thompson--

1219
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:19,987
"Kate, Kate.

1220
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:23,825
It's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon."

1221
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:26,093
She'll understand that bit.
She's a schoolteacher.

1222
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:29,664
I'll say,
"When there's no lady present,

1223
01:44:29,664 --> 01:44:32,367
I can catch the tiniest insect
without hurting it."

1224
01:44:32,367 --> 01:44:33,801
If she gets to know me better,

1225
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:35,437
she'll see
I'm not such a stumblebum.

1226
01:44:35,437 --> 01:44:38,105
All I need is a little practice.
If I could just--

1227
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:40,808
Wait for me.
You need some moral support.

1228
01:45:00,862 --> 01:45:02,497
There she is.

1229
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:09,303
You better do your thing
before the pupils come.

1230
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:11,406
Yeah.

1231
01:45:17,345 --> 01:45:20,382
Good morning.

1232
01:45:20,382 --> 01:45:22,083
Morning,
Miss Thompson.

1233
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,285
Morning.

1234
01:45:24,285 --> 01:45:26,621
How are you?
Fine, thanks. How are you?

1235
01:45:26,621 --> 01:45:28,289
Fine, thanks,
and how are you?

1236
01:45:29,424 --> 01:45:31,393
I'm fine, thank you.

1237
01:45:33,495 --> 01:45:37,599
Uh, Kate, I know
you think I'm an idiot...

1238
01:45:37,599 --> 01:45:40,802
but I'm not
really like that.

1239
01:45:40,802 --> 01:45:43,805
It's...
only when I'm around wom--

1240
01:45:45,106 --> 01:45:47,341
Around you. I'm sorry.

1241
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:50,478
Normally, I'm quite normal,

1242
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:53,047
but whenever
I'm in the presence of a lady,

1243
01:45:53,047 --> 01:45:59,053
my fingers turn into thumbs,
my brain switches off.

1244
01:45:59,053 --> 01:46:00,455
Watch it!

1245
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:06,494
It's flour.

1246
01:46:06,494 --> 01:46:08,630
I noticed.

1247
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:10,031
It's actually--

1248
01:46:14,035 --> 01:46:16,037
Actually, it's really

1249
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:19,674
only an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

1250
01:46:19,674 --> 01:46:22,810
Perhaps it's some
Freudian syndrome.

1251
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:25,112
That day,
when I brought you your shoes,

1252
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:26,648
I actually came to apologize

1253
01:46:26,648 --> 01:46:29,417
for the stupid things I did
when I met you at Mabula

1254
01:46:29,417 --> 01:46:30,685
and I wanted to explain that

1255
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:32,019
I'm not really
as stupid as that,

1256
01:46:32,019 --> 01:46:34,556
but then, of course,
I blew it, and I...

1257
01:46:34,556 --> 01:46:37,024
So I don't blame you
if you think...

1258
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:42,964
But it's really only
an interesting psychological...

1259
01:46:42,964 --> 01:46:45,266
When you get to know me better,
you'll see

1260
01:46:45,266 --> 01:46:47,769
that I'm not always stumbling.

1261
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:58,379
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

1262
01:46:58,379 --> 01:47:02,216
Yes, you are a very interesting
psychological phenomenon,

1263
01:47:02,216 --> 01:47:04,519
and I think you're very sweet.

1264
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:19,433
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

1265
01:47:34,649 --> 01:47:36,117
Xi was beginning to think

1266
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:37,785
he would never
find the end of the earth,

1267
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,687
and one day, suddenly,

1
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,765
Why do you go
among the people, Majesty?

2
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,268
I tell you plainly,
you will be murdered.

3
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,101
Every Catholic in England
is a potential assassin!

4
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,573
Be warned
by the atrocities in France.

5
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,543
We know the Catholics take
their orders from Spain.

6
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,479
The Spanish speak
openly of Mary Stuart

7
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,448
as Queen of England
in waiting.

8
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,541
Their loyalty is to
the Pope in Rome!

9
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,747
How many Catholics
are there in England, sir?

10
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,312
Immense numbers,
Majesty.

11
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,588
Half the nation cling
to the old superstitions.

12
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:51,026
What would you have me do?

13
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,999
Hang half the people of
England or just imprison them?

14
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,501
We must act, Majesty.

15
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,403
Our inaction is perceived as weakness.

16
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,975
If my people break the law,
they shall be punished.

17
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,341
Until that day,
they shall be protected.

18
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,904
Majesty, we have proven reason
to fear every Catholic in the...

19
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,974
Fear creates fear.

20
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:17,079
I am not ignorant
of the dangers, sir.

21
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,853
But I will not punish my
people for their beliefs.

22
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,224
Only for their deeds.

23
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:26,856
I am assured that the people
of England love their Queen.

24
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,797
My constant endeavor
is to earn that love.

25
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,055
My Queen.

26
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,381
Our friends write
to give us hope.

27
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,977
Soon England's
true believers will rise up

28
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:24,682
against the bastard
usurper Elizabeth

29
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,520
and slit her throat.

30
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,219
That's enough!

31
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,129
Slit her throat?
Please.

32
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,331
And when that bastard usurper
is dead, my lady will be queen.

33
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,939
Your bishops are preaching that
God is showing his displeasure

34
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,209
because the Queen
is still unmarried,

35
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,717
some rudely
suggesting infertile.

36
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,878
What nonsense.

37
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,980
Dangerous nonsense.

38
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,651
Mary Stuart has a son.

39
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,889
Why does everyone
torment me with Mary Stuart?

40
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,261
It's not her fault she's
next in line to the throne.

41
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,321
Don't hide your face.

42
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,991
So long as you
have no issue.

43
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,501
If you were
to produce an heir,

44
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,434
there'd be no more talk
of Mary, Queen of Scots.

45
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,963
I've heard it's customary to obtain
a husband before producing an heir.

46
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,040
We shall have to hunt out a
husband for you soon, Bess.

47
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,443
Not too soon,
my lady.

48
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,038
There are husbands
to be had.

49
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,514
You don't want
to be married?

50
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,982
I'll want to be married
if I want the man...

51
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,678
Austria. France.

52
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:30,722
Turkey. Turkey has a sultan.
China has an emperor.

53
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,258
I confine myself
to the possible.

54
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,987
That's where you and I
differ, Walsingham.

55
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,894
I find the impossible
far more interesting.

56
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,596
What kind of man
would you want?

57
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,638
An honest man
with friendly eyes.

58
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,139
And good legs.
And sweet breath.

59
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,403
So you can kiss him
without choking.

60
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,577
There must be
any amount of princes

61
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,049
in the undiscovered lands
across the sea.

62
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,483
Find me an honest one
of those.

63
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,472
Since when do we discuss
private matters in public spaces?

64
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,669
I ask Your Majesty's
forgiveness.

65
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:30,010
Have my doctors confirm that
the Queen is still fertile.

66
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,881
The people need
to be reassured.

67
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,975
I care
for your safety.

68
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,350
The threats to your
person are real.

69
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,979
You know very well
if I fall,

70
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,048
you'll all come
tumbling down after me.

71
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,218
The sea wall at Dover
is cracking, Francis.

72
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,422
We have no money
to rebuild our defenses.

73
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,897
Turn your mind
to that threat.

74
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,650
May we have wisdom not to
fear shadows in the night.

75
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,283
And courage when the day
of danger truly dawns.

76
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,591
My time has come,
Majesty.

77
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,061
Send me back to England
to begin God's work.

78
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,522
Your Majesty.

79
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,170
Guards!
Take hold of him!

80
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,114
A puddle in the way,

81
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,147
Majesty.

82
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,219
A puddle.

83
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,675
Puddle.

84
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,713
You'll have to see
the Lord Chamberlain, sir.

85
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,019
Which one is he?

86
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,889
He's over there.

87
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,655
You can't come in.

88
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,231
So how am I to see him
if you won't let me through?

89
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,357
You must wait for him
to come out.

90
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,423
And when will he
come out?

91
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,662
There's no way
of knowing that.

92
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:41,297
I had less trouble than
this boarding a Spanish ship.

93
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,505
What if enemy ships should sail up
the Thames, can the docks be closed?

94
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,706
Not closed, Majesty.
But the gun positions...

95
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,477
Spanish...

96
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,849
Ambassador.

97
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,993
King Eric of Sweden,
Majesty.

98
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,358
Not again.

99
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,521
Still madly in love with you.

100
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:05,688
Still mad, you mean.

101
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:08,824
Ivan, Tsar
of all the Russias.

102
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,368
Where's Bess?

103
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,529
Known as
"Ivan the Terrible," Majesty.

104
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,873
Late.

105
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,245
I beg
Your Majesty's forgiveness.

106
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,448
Given.

107
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,420
Once.

108
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,618
The Archduke
Charles of Austria, Majesty.

109
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,224
The puddle man
is outside, Majesty.

110
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,426
My suitors.

111
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:46,028
Younger brother to Maximilian II,
Holy Roman Emperor.

112
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,630
Cousin of Philip of Spain.
Wealthy.

113
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,335
He's rather handsome.

114
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,803
How old is he?

115
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,348
Young,
I believe, Majesty.

116
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,115
An Austrian alliance
would keep France quiet.

117
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,484
And put Philip on a leash.

118
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,489
I've become
almost enthusiastic.

119
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,490
Send for him.

120
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,921
<i>Danke sch×¦n.</i>

121
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:15,589
How much longer do you think
I can play this game, Francis?

122
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,693
Virginity is an asset
that holds its value well.

123
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,704
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.

124
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,769
Your Majesty, this man
is a notorious pirate.

125
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:30,713
Spanish gold stolen from Spanish
ships, attacked without provocation.

126
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:38,148
Well, sir, what do you want?

127
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:41,386
I have just returned
from the New World, Majesty.

128
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,088
I have claimed the
fertile coast in your name

129
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,893
and called it Virginia

130
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,399
in honor
of our Virgin Queen.

131
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,299
Virginia?

132
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,136
And when I marry, will you
change the name to Conjugia?

133
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,272
I ask your gracious
permission, Majesty,

134
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:01,039
to return to the New World
with your royal warrant

135
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,082
to found a colony under the
laws and protections of England.

136
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,411
He wants money.

137
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,748
Who are they?

138
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,219
Natives of the
Americas, Majesty.

139
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,721
Have they no ruler
of their own?

140
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,592
None to match
England's Queen.

141
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,154
These gentlemen
are welcome.

142
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,063
See that they
are treated well.

143
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,125
I also come bearing
gifts for Your Majesty.

144
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,765
These gifts, Majesty,
are the fruits of piracy,

145
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,104
the true property
of the realm of Spain.

146
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:34,737
Let's see, shall we?
What have you brought me?

147
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,189
<i>Patata, Majesty.</i>

148
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,318
You eat it.
Very nourishing.

149
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,073
Tobacco.

150
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,409
You breathe its smoke.

151
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,615
Very stimulating.

152
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,700
Gold.

153
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:35,065
Courtesy of a Spanish ship that found
itself unable to complete its journey.

154
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,199
Forgive me, Majesty.

155
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:41,007
I find the air
has become stale.

156
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,606
I am sensitive to the
smell of open sewers.

157
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:55,726
I cannot accept the fruits
of piracy, Mr. Raleigh.

158
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,594
Philip of Spain is no friend
of England, Majesty.

159
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:04,034
The more gold I take from him,
the safer you will be.

160
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,627
Well, well.

161
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,639
A political pirate.

162
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,609
And Your Majesty's
most loyal subject.

163
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,779
Welcome home, Mr. Raleigh.
Lord Howard, the docks.

164
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,642
Master Raleigh.

165
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,821
You eat it...

166
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,706
You traitor!

167
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,677
Judas!

168
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,309
You're Walsingham's pawn!

169
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,152
Don't do this!
I didn't say anything!

170
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,821
You're a
Protestant traitor!

171
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,389
Don't do it! Don't!

172
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,768
Don't!
Hold his head!

173
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,367
You Judas! You Judas!
Stop!

174
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:20,775
You Judas!

175
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,773
The traitor's dead.
We must act!

176
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,683
Why do we not strike?
What are we waiting for?

177
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,813
You wait for my order.

178
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:12,726
Walsingham knows too much
already. One traitor is dead.

179
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,501
Who can I trust now?

180
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,175
There's a visitor
waiting, sir.

181
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,214
William.

182
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
Hello, Francis.

183
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,814
You've always been a fellow
who delighted in surprises.

184
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,792
You look well,
Francis.

185
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:46,887
Well, you look dreadful.
They're not feeding you in Paris.

186
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:50,434
You can't learn the secrets of
the universe on an empty stomach.

187
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,770
<i>Then she my heart beguiled</i>

188
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,300
Mary. William.
Supper is ready.

189
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,875
William.

190
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,438
Have you spoken
to the Queen?

191
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,642
I speak
with the Queen daily.

192
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,651
You work too hard.
You're a sick man.

193
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,346
William, come over here and sit by me.

194
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,820
William, if we are not
allowed to sin,

195
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,083
maybe we could
talk theology.

196
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,058
You have done enough.
No man could do more.

197
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,356
I can't leave the court
yet, Ursula. She needs me.

198
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,124
Never listens to me.
Not a thought for his health.

199
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:20,596
So you talk to him,
he's your brother.

200
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:24,567
William, what do they say in Paris
about the Pope's call for holy war?

201
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,660
Many welcome it.

202
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,466
Why must we talk
about war?

203
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,734
Tell us your nice
news, William.

204
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,935
Are you married yet?
Not yet.

205
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,274
Mary, would you leave
William alone, please?

206
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,110
Sweet, sit.

207
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:39,643
Grace?

208
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,843
Oh, Lord,
provider of all things,

209
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,912
we offer Thee
our humble thanks.

210
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,891
In the name
of the Holy Trinity, amen.

211
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,085
Amen.

212
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,963
More lines on my face.

213
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,335
Where do they come from?

214
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,537
Smile lines, my lady.

215
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,910
Smile lines?

216
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,779
When do I ever smile?

217
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,418
Now you have
smile lines, too.

218
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:30,601
<i>The beauty of Your Majesty</i>

219
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,038
<i>is dazzling to my eyes.</i>

220
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,377
I am overwhelmed.

221
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,887
I am conquered.

222
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,515
I die.

223
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,617
Only your love,

224
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,322
<i>my stattlich Elizabeth,</i>

225
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,523
can restore me into life.

226
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,726
Your Highness
does me great honor.

227
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,573
Oh, Elizabeth.

228
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:21,150
How blessed am I to stand
in your fabled presence.

229
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,945
Ah, Elizabeth.

230
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,287
To speak your name
is to hear celestial music.

231
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,588
May that sweet sound

232
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,466
guide me through my life
to come, Elizabeth.

233
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:44,368
I have traveled here
to this illustrious court

234
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,512
in the hope that
our two great nations

235
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,214
might be
joined in love.

236
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,229
He interests me.

237
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,561
Talk to him.

238
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,834
Him, my lady?

239
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,067
Him.

240
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:25,712
I adore the natives you brought. I
don't suppose you could get one for me.

241
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,217
They're not
dangerous, are they?

242
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,116
That depends on what you
propose to do with them.

243
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,655
I'd dress him up in
mulberry colored silk,

244
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,658
and have him walk behind
me, carrying my cloak.

245
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,234
I have a secret,
my dear.

246
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,700
I pretend there's
a pane of glass,

247
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:53,733
<i>eine Glasscheibe
between me and them.</i>

248
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,275
They can see me,
but they cannot touch me.

249
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,513
You should try it.

250
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,451
Majesty, I am...

251
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,401
It is something,
after all,

252
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:25,910
to take a blank on the map
and build there a shining city.

253
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,538
Which you will no doubt
name after yourself.

254
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,081
No doubt.

255
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,488
May I ask
a question in return?

256
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:41,582
Of course.

257
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,923
How am I to win
the Queen's favor?

258
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,462
Why should I tell you that?

259
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,863
I've little enough to offer,
but whatever I have to give,

260
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,895
ask, and it's yours.

261
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,405
Say what you mean to say
as plainly as possible.

262
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,806
All men flatter the Queen
in hope of advancement.

263
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,584
Pay her the compliment
of truth.

264
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,483
I don't even know your name.

265
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,145
Elizabeth Throckmorton.

266
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,190
A second Elizabeth?

267
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,488
Everyone calls me Bess.

268
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,554
Your most serene Majesty,
bright star of our firmament,

269
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,535
we present our humble masque
of the heavenly spheres.

270
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,265
His Highness is tired
after his long journey.

271
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,402
No man
can become tired

272
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,347
in the presence of
so lovely a queen.

273
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:16,148
His Highness, the Archduke informs
me that my charms overwhelm him.

274
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,987
He will retire to his
private chambers to rest.

275
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,633
I don't want him hurt
by your schemes.

276
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,297
So how should
we proceed?

277
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,602
Perhaps we should
all retire.

278
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,441
I suspect him of being
a professional charmer.

279
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:44,674
Am I right?

280
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,684
He is certainly
charming, my lady.

281
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,155
Well, there are
duller professions.

282
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,188
You like him, don't you?

283
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,750
He's a man that lives in a
world far beyond the court.

284
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,931
It's refreshing.

285
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,762
Well.

286
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,961
We shall let him
come again.

287
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,329
Blue.

288
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,541
<i>Can you imagine
what it is to cross an ocean?</i>

289
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:22,581
For weeks, you see nothing but
the horizon, perfect and empty.

290
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,157
You live in the grip of fear.

291
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,982
Fear of storms.

292
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,528
Fear of sickness on board.

293
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,091
Fear of the immensity.

294
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:40,704
So you must drive that fear
down deep into your belly.

295
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:43,806
Study your charts.

296
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:46,475
Watch your compass.

297
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,338
Pray for a fair wind.

298
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,913
And hope,

299
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,245
pure,

300
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,387
naked,

301
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,785
fragile

302
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,723
hope.

303
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,430
Majesty, the Archduke
and court are waiting.

304
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:09,398
Let them wait.

305
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,927
Go on, Mr. Raleigh.

306
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:17,065
You were hoping.

307
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,742
At first, it's no more
than a haze on the horizon.

308
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,984
So you watch.

309
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,651
You watch.

310
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,087
Then it's a smudge,

311
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,901
a shadow on the far water.

312
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,901
For a day.

313
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,739
For another day.

314
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:57,239
The stain slowly spreads
along the horizon taking form,

315
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:03,452
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

316
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,819
You dare to whisper
the word.

317
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,854
Land.

318
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,030
Land.

319
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,290
Life.

320
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,461
Resurrection.

321
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,134
The true adventure.

322
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,968
Coming out of
the vast unknown,

323
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,241
out of the immensity,

324
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,647
into new life.

325
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,818
That,

326
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:42,049
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

327
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,504
I like
your immensities.

328
00:27:55,573 --> 00:28:01,910
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

329
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:06,439
Such great spaces
make us small.

330
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:10,317
Do we discover the
New World, Mr. Raleigh,

331
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,880
or does the New World
discover us?

332
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,791
You speak like
a true explorer.

333
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,297
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

334
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,601
And I like you.

335
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:38,206
You know, of course, that when
I like a man, I reward him.

336
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,547
I have heard that.

337
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:43,517
And what have you
to say about it?

338
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,954
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

339
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:48,321
Is the mission
not the man?

340
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:51,327
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

341
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,197
Go on.

342
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,106
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

343
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:08,077
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

344
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:16,477
Now you grow dull.

345
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,058
Come on!

346
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,511
Mine.

347
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,249
You have
the stronger horse.

348
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,190
Yours carries
the lighter load.

349
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,693
No.

350
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,394
The Queen does not
give way to others.

351
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,663
Whoa! Whoa!

352
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,577
Forgive me, Majesty. My horse
doesn't seem to know his place yet.

353
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,317
Have you ever known
your place, Mr. Raleigh?

354
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:59,355
Oh, come on!

355
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,513
It's from her.

356
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:37,154
Mary Stuart is the heart
and soul of our enterprise.

357
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,907
Make sure she
and only she reads this.

358
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:55,436
We wait for her order.

359
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,649
The order
must be given clearly.

360
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,658
The jailer, madam.

361
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,790
My noble jailer.

362
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,868
Am I a danger to England
even when I pray?

363
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:25,204
As always, ma'am, my
concern is for your safety.

364
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,980
I pray for
my cousin Elizabeth.

365
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,151
Do you think
she prays for me?

366
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,862
Is it true

367
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:51,365
that I've never known the
pleasure of being liked for myself?

368
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,170
I hope you believe I like
you for yourself, my lady.

369
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:04,346
Is anyone ever liked simply
for themselves? I doubt it.

370
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,212
Are you?

371
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,917
Men like you
because you're pretty,

372
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:18,417
and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

373
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,997
No doubt.

374
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,459
Him, too.

375
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,967
He likes you because
he wants my favor.

376
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,011
You do realize that.

377
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,073
Yes, my lady.

378
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,013
And the other thing,
too, of course.

379
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,954
But then,
all men want that.

380
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:50,357
Male desire
confers no distinction.

381
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,590
Oh, I envy you, Bess.

382
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,329
You're free to have
what I cannot have.

383
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,037
You're my adventurer.

384
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,218
Thank you for coming.

385
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,888
You mustn't send
letters to the palace.

386
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,659
You know what would
happen if I was caught.

387
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,632
I need your help.

388
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,133
More money?
No.

389
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,530
My father doesn't want
to hide like this anymore.

390
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,597
Of course.

391
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,973
We both want to get back
into favor with the court.

392
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,568
That's impossible.

393
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,741
You know that
you're Papists.

394
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,180
Why impossible?

395
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,844
Everyone at court has a Papist
somewhere in their family.

396
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,352
Francis.
Just as you have.

397
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,389
Speak to the Queen.
You are her favorite.

398
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,018
My father and I
will embrace the new faith.

399
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,254
Cousin Bess.
No.

400
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:33,319
We have known each other all our lives.

401
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,491
I would do nothing
to harm you.

402
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:39,998
Why can't you help us?
They will kill us!

403
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,917
Oh. Do not tease me,
Mr. Raleigh.

404
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:59,353
There's nothing
I'd like to do more.

405
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,685
So why don't you?

406
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,421
All right, then. I will.

407
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,826
You see? You lie.

408
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,926
You don't want me on your
ship at all. You're a liar.

409
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,636
Bess. Would you
like to go to sea?

410
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,301
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

411
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,210
Women bring bad luck
on board ship.

412
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,542
Do they?

413
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,015
Lock up a hundred men in a
space smaller than this room

414
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,348
for months at a time.

415
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,682
Men have needs.

416
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:33,484
A beautiful woman
would drive us all mad.

417
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,519
Men have needs?

418
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,895
Let them stay on land
and see to their needs.

419
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,565
Mr. Raleigh is eager to sail
away to his maiden colony.

420
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,736
We must persuade him to stay a
little longer. Mustn't we, ladies?

421
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,693
Bess?

422
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:17,522
No!

423
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,599
Wait! What do you want?
Who are you?

424
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,438
Let me go, damn it!
Who the hell are you?

425
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:56,596
If you won't assist me,
perhaps your father will.

426
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,266
No.

427
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,143
Enough.

428
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,946
Enough.

429
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,387
Yes?

430
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:17,782
You cannot
save England now.

431
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,187
The Enterprise
has begun.

432
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,266
Ambassador?

433
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,835
What do you know of the
Enterprise of England?

434
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,103
The Enterprise? Forgive me,
Majesty, I'm not familiar...

435
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,613
Two armies landing on the
coasts of Sussex and Norfolk.

436
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,615
Mary Stuart is to be set free
and placed on the English throne,

437
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:41,480
and I am to be
assassinated.

438
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,985
Does any of this
sound familiar?

439
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:44,281
I know nothing
of any invasion plans...

440
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,515
Well, I refer to this plan
as the Enterprise of England,

441
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,559
it should more accurately be
called la Empresa de Inglaterra

442
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,423
because it is
a Spanish plan.

443
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,395
The plan of my
one-time brother-in-law,

444
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,329
your king,
to attack my country.

445
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:59,529
Your country? It is my
country that is under attack.

446
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,798
Your so-called piratas, your pirates
attack our merchant ships daily.

447
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:08,208
And you... You think we don't
know where the orders come from?

448
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:11,076
The whole world knows these
pirates sail up the Thames,

449
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,948
all the way
to your royal bed.

450
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,594
You will leave
my presence, sir.

451
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,497
Go back to your rat hole.

452
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:35,970
Tell Philip I fear neither him,
nor his priests, nor his armies.

453
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,405
Tell him if he wants to shake
his little fist at us,

454
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,703
we're ready to give him
such a bite,

455
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,574
he'll wish he'd kept his hands
in his pockets.

456
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,706
You see a leaf fall and you think
you know which way the wind blows.

457
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:50,516
Well, there is
a wind coming, madam,

458
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:52,885
that will sweep away
your pride.

459
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,721
I, too, can command
the wind, sir!

460
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:06,327
I have a hurricane in me that will
strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!

461
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,816
What are you staring at?

462
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:34,489
Lower your eyes.
I am the Queen!

463
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:38,663
You are not my equal, sir,
and you never will be!

464
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:01,214
<i>The alignments of the planets
is most unusual this year.</i>

465
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,387
Mars is due to take
the ascendant

466
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:08,550
three days after the anniversary
of Your Majesty's birth.

467
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,061
And also on that day,
there is a full moon,

468
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:17,294
which governs the fortune of
all princes of the female gender.

469
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,460
Princes of the
female gender.

470
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:24,235
I mean to say, a prince
who is also a woman.

471
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,744
Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

472
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,972
What does it mean?

473
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:36,919
It means the rise of a great empire,
Majesty, and the fall of another.

474
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,121
Convulsions.

475
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,823
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

476
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,127
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

477
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,260
Astrology is, as yet,
more an art than a science.

478
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,771
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

479
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,467
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

480
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:02,945
He means,
will I be assassinated?

481
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,914
Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

482
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:18,193
And the private life of this
prince of the female gender,

483
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:20,422
what do the stars
foretell there?

484
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,295
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

485
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,497
Surely the stars foretell
matters of state, Dr. Dee.

486
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:33,009
For such a prediction I must
look in a different chart.

487
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:44,377
Wonderful.

488
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:47,716
Such strength.

489
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:51,885
You will need all your
strength in the days to come.

490
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:56,756
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

491
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:01,000
I have not seen fear in your
face for such a long time.

492
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,565
Have I reason to fear?

493
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,869
Something has
weakened you.

494
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,706
There are
hard days coming.

495
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,082
But I am no prophet.

496
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:20,189
I see no more than
the shadows of ghosts.

497
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,329
Visitor, sir.

498
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,269
Sorry to come
aboard your ship

499
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,503
without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

500
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,614
Welcome aboard.

501
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:56,551
The Queen wishes
to see you.

502
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:00,624
She asks me
to assure you...

503
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,790
I need
no assurances, Bess.

504
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,795
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

505
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,361
Then you should
say so in person.

506
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,478
This is
my life, Bess.

507
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,851
This is where
I belong.

508
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,924
It seems to be
a lonely life.

509
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:32,894
Sometimes. But it's
the life I've chosen.

510
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,391
I understand.

511
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,475
You ask permission to go.

512
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,521
Yes, Majesty.

513
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:02,046
You plan to return
to your colony

514
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:06,585
for two, maybe three,
four years.

515
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,099
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

516
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,501
That is a long time.

517
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,869
There's nothing
for me here.

518
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,376
At sea, I know what I'm
to do. I know the risks.

519
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,775
Here...
No. You're wrong.

520
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:26,282
You're needed here.

521
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:28,146
As captain of my
personal guard.

522
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,515
Captain of your guard?

523
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:30,575
Kneel.

524
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,144
Majesty.

525
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,622
I said, kneel.

526
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,956
Sir Walter Raleigh.

527
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:52,203
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

528
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,739
This is too great an honor.

529
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:02,212
If it's so great an honor, why
are you staring at your boots?

530
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,614
You know why.

531
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:07,914
Now you stare
at the wall.

532
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,323
Am I so hideous you can't
even look me in the face?

533
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:11,417
Why do you speak
like a fool

534
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:14,554
when you are anything
but a fool?

535
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,223
Fool?

536
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:22,062
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

537
00:47:22,138 --> 00:47:25,198
And you, you...
You come here

538
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,608
as if from another time.
And I've...

539
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:35,378
You have real adventures. You
go where the maps end. And I'd...

540
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:40,246
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

541
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,533
The storm clouds are
gathering. You are needed here.

542
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,131
You cannot leave England.

543
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:32,767
"For he that will save
his life will lose it.

544
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:37,005
<i>"And he that will lose his life
for my sake shall find it. "</i>

545
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,182
Lord be with us
as the end approaches.

546
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:46,947
We will not fear the coming
of the shadow of death.

547
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:09,640
Sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

548
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,113
I thought I prayed
in silence.

549
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,410
You did.

550
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,284
Excuse me, sir.
I must go to the Queen.

551
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,560
The man who was
hanged today...

552
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:32,157
He was your cousin.

553
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:37,068
Yes.

554
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,108
I'm sorry.

555
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,110
The last time
I saw him,

556
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,886
he needed my help.

557
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,752
I did nothing.

558
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:57,520
What could
you have done?

559
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,089
I don't know.

560
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:04,331
Now he's dead.

561
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:09,270
I keep seeing his face.
I keep seeing his eyes.

562
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,760
Believe me, there's nothing that you

563
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,536
could have done that
would have spared him.

564
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,201
I'm so afraid.

565
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,404
We're all human, Bess.

566
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,343
We do what we can.

567
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,993
<i>Your laundress was found to be
carrying letters in her washing.</i>

568
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:15,994
Not her job, I think.

569
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,302
How am I to send
my intimate letters?

570
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:21,002
Through me.
And you will read them.

571
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:24,046
With respectful
admiration.

572
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,741
Am I to have
no privacy?

573
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:27,840
No.

574
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,544
You disappoint me, sir.

575
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,114
The Queen orders these
measures for your protection.

576
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:34,622
The Queen?

577
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,750
I am a queen.

578
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:51,901
They call her
the Virgin Queen.

579
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,970
Why is that, sir?

580
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,147
Can it be that no man
will have her?

581
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:35,033
Let him
throw you round.

582
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,875
Be bold. Come on,
you can trust him.

583
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:39,778
And jump.

584
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,341
When I bend like this, you
take a leap into the air.

585
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,655
The Volta.

586
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,157
I require all my ladies
to learn it.

587
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,891
You see
how fearless Bess is?

588
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:55,658
You like your ladies
to jump at your command.

589
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:56,789
Do you think
that wrong?

590
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,063
No. You are the Queen.
You are to be obeyed.

591
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,368
To tell you the truth,

592
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,669
I'm very, very tired of
always being in control.

593
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,733
Nonsense.

594
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,108
What?

595
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:13,979
You eat and drink control.

596
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,746
Is that so?

597
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,820
Bess.

598
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,188
You should try a dance
with Sir Walter.

599
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,557
He's eager
to show us his skill.

600
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:29,291
No skill at all, Majesty.
I don't know the steps.

601
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:31,560
Come now.

602
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,166
You stand
like this,

603
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,735
with your hands here.

604
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,371
And when she jumps,

605
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,975
on the fifth step,

606
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,717
you lift her.

607
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,653
What could be simpler?

608
00:54:57,226 --> 00:55:00,024
Take your position,
Sir Walter.

609
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,230
I am to be obeyed.

610
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,865
As Your Majesty
wishes.

611
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,404
Hold her firmly.
I don't want her dropped.

612
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,085
Play.

613
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,550
Six counts.

614
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,885
One, two, three,
and lift, down.

615
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,060
Leave us.

616
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:10,862
I want both of them
left alone.

617
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,200
Madam.

618
00:57:36,018 --> 00:57:37,747
I must reply.

619
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:41,753
"If our forces
are in readiness,"

620
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:45,157
"both within and without
the realm,"

621
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:51,064
"then your Queen commands you
to set the gentlemen to work."

622
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:52,964
I think we have it.

623
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,508
Yes.

624
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,745
Let God's
work begin.

625
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:24,524
Where have you been?

626
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,228
I met up
with some old friends.

627
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,601
From Paris, no doubt.

628
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,606
We haven't
seen you for days.

629
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,266
Yes.

630
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:35,310
Now you're back.

631
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:44,947
Do you know, I can still
remember the day you were born.

632
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:50,091
I was 11 years old.

633
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:55,458
And you,
this helpless bundle.

634
00:58:55,564 --> 00:58:57,429
I looked at you
in your crib,

635
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,663
with your little,
wrinkled face,

636
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:03,068
and I loved you
from the first.

637
00:59:05,207 --> 00:59:07,698
I've failed you,
haven't I?

638
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:12,076
Forgive me if I haven't
loved you enough.

639
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,451
Did you imagine
I wouldn't know?

640
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,935
Your blessing,
Majesty. My little one.

641
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,630
Your blessing?

642
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,611
Walk on.

643
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:06,330
The Queen is at her prayers.

644
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,173
Go!

645
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:22,708
Elizabeth is a whore! Mary
Stuart is our true queen!

646
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,288
Elizabeth!

647
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,286
Whore!

648
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,160
You bring news?

649
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,197
The Queen
has been attacked.

650
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:56,772
The assassin seized.

651
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:03,284
The Queen

652
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,048
unharmed.

653
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,314
Unharmed?

654
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:14,624
And you, ma'am, are to
be tried for treason.

655
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,870
Me?

656
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:28,365
What has any of this
to do with me?

657
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:37,544
That's the trouble
with intrigues, isn't it?

658
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,780
With so many secrets,

659
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:42,517
you can never quite be sure who's
on whose side till the game ends.

660
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,970
Walsingham has every
letter you've written.

661
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,575
Traitor.

662
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:10,608
Traitors!

663
01:03:49,024 --> 01:03:51,492
Ready to die,
I see, Jesuit.

664
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,926
I have done what
I was sent to do.

665
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:57,731
Why was the gun
not loaded?

666
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,551
I need your help.

667
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,383
I, too,
have failed, brother.

668
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,163
What was the Jesuit
sent to do?

669
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,960
I told you everything I know.

670
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,899
So kill me.

671
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,036
There's a better world
waiting for me.

672
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:45,010
We'll all be judged
in the end, brother.

673
01:04:46,448 --> 01:04:48,040
Even you.

674
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:52,412
William, you're
not a martyr.

675
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,691
You weren't even
much of a murderer.

676
01:05:01,363 --> 01:05:04,093
I'm going to have you
taken to France.

677
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,969
No one will know.

678
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,406
You must never let me
hear of you again.

679
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,478
Francis.

680
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,071
Francis!

681
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:21,844
Francis.

682
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,485
I've never seen her
so distressed.

683
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:30,047
She's been alone in her room
since morning. She'll see no one.

684
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,217
Has she asked for me?

685
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:32,385
No.

686
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,895
But she needs you.
I know she does.

687
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,327
Go to her.

688
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:42,063
Please.

689
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:04,287
Are you here to tell me
I must murder a queen?

690
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,627
I would never presume to
tell my Queen what to do.

691
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:11,232
Only you know
where your duty lies.

692
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,200
Was it my father's duty
to murder my mother?

693
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,534
She was a queen
for a time.

694
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,806
Oh, I would be loath to
die so bloody a death.

695
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,821
Since when were you
so afraid?

696
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,555
I'm always afraid.

697
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:46,326
Kill a queen,
and all queens are mortal.

698
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,767
We mortals have
many weaknesses.

699
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:56,834
We feel too much.

700
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,244
Hurt too much.

701
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:02,283
All too soon we die.

702
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:06,688
But we do have
the chance of love.

703
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:13,461
Do we?

704
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:23,897
I have given
England my life.

705
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,068
Must she also
have my soul?

706
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,604
<i>Mary Stuart must die!</i>

707
01:07:30,779 --> 01:07:34,180
Must? Mary Stuart must die?

708
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:37,514
Where is it written? Who
says so? Have I ordered it?

709
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:40,214
Majesty, this is
no time for mercy.

710
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,655
Don't preach at me,
old man!

711
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,623
Look at you.
You can hardly stand.

712
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,623
Go home to your wife
and your bed.

713
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:56,198
The law must
have its way.

714
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,999
By whose authority
do you condemn me?

715
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,037
God is my only judge.

716
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:10,150
The law is for common
men. Not for princes.

717
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:16,089
The law, Your Majesty, is for
the protection of your people.

718
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,097
Leave me.

719
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,268
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

720
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:46,216
<i>You know neither who
you are or what you do.</i>

721
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,621
I know who I am.

722
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:55,254
And if I die, it shall
be as I have lived.

723
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:00,291
As a queen,

724
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:05,534
trusting in the mercy
of God, my Father.

725
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,813
At which hour?

726
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:49,908
At 8:00.

727
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,115
Tomorrow morning.

728
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,453
It must be stopped!

729
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:05,050
I want it stopped!

730
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,653
I forgive you
with all my heart.

731
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,284
<i>Forgive me, Majesty.</i>

732
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,885
I have failed you.

733
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:28,996
How have you failed me?

734
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,365
What am I
to forgive you for?

735
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,401
Philip of Spain
is a God-fearing man

736
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:36,403
who cannot declare war
without a just cause.

737
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,069
I intercepted every letter
Mary Stuart secretly dispatched,

738
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:47,810
but failed to see that Spain
knew I was reading them.

739
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,485
They waited for her
to write the words

740
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:55,045
that would, in my eyes,
confirm her treason.

741
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,022
Forgive me.

742
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,892
I am trapped
in my own web.

743
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,857
And I ordered
Mary's execution.

744
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:13,664
I murdered God's
anointed Queen.

745
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:21,178
And now God's most dutiful son
makes holy war to punish me.

746
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,079
We are at war.

747
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:59,382
Who knows when
we will meet again?

748
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,212
If we will meet again.

749
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:08,889
If England falls, my last days
will be in a Spanish prison.

750
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:12,792
To die far from home.

751
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:14,528
That is the
loneliest death.

752
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:16,263
Never.

753
01:16:18,306 --> 01:16:20,866
My thoughts
turn dark.

754
01:16:25,046 --> 01:16:27,071
What do you do
in a storm

755
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,048
when you're facing
your death?

756
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:33,009
The closer
I come to death,

757
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,214
the more
I want to live,

758
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,724
the hungrier
I am for life.

759
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:42,195
Yes. To live
right to the end.

760
01:16:42,263 --> 01:16:44,857
Why be afraid of tomorrow
when today is all we have?

761
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,798
I wish...

762
01:16:48,703 --> 01:16:51,968
I have never known
a woman like you.

763
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:59,439
In some other world,
in some other time,

764
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:04,550
could you have
loved me?

765
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,420
I know only
one world.

766
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:13,191
And in this world,
I have loved you.

767
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:23,964
There's something
you could do for me,

768
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:30,875
something I have not
known for a very long time.

769
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,575
If you felt
so inclined.

770
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:41,220
But it's not to be
spoken of afterward.

771
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:45,493
It must be forgotten.

772
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,629
But just for now...

773
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,596
A kiss?

774
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:31,127
I die.

775
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,086
I've given
Drake the orders

776
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,790
to prepare the fleet
to defend the Channel.

777
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,230
How soon can you
join him?

778
01:18:58,299 --> 01:19:01,166
We're waiting for supplies. We can
move as soon as we're ready and armed.

779
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,362
Good.

780
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:07,806
Bess.

781
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,808
I have something
to tell you.

782
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:14,643
I ask for nothing.
Is that understood?

783
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,113
Your life is your own.
Nothing will change.

784
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,882
What is this?

785
01:19:24,058 --> 01:19:26,288
I am...
You're with child.

786
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:30,462
No one knows.
My plans are made.

787
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,296
I shall ask the Queen for
permission to leave court.

788
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:34,460
Where will you go?

789
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,766
To my
mother's house.

790
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,500
I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't
court a man without her permission.

791
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,667
I can't marry
without her permission.

792
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,576
As for having a child,

793
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:47,073
your child...

794
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:52,752
All I know
is nothing's as it should be.

795
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,549
Please, listen.

796
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,853
You once said to me, "Whatever I
have to give, ask and it's yours."

797
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:58,915
Do you remember?

798
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:00,483
Of course, I remember.

799
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,462
I ask that you
forget me.

800
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:06,057
Go to your ship.
Do your duty.

801
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,500
Forget me.
Bess!

802
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,003
We're summoned.
Coming.

803
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:25,214
This Spanish Armada is at sea
with an army of 10,000 men?

804
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,811
And Philip's friend,
the Duke of Parma,

805
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:31,222
has 15,000 men
on the French coast.

806
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:36,127
They plan to cross the Channel in
barges and sail into the Thames.

807
01:20:36,197 --> 01:20:38,825
They don't have enough barges
yet. We have a little time.

808
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:43,860
And our forces defend the mouth
of the Thames at Tilbury with...

809
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:47,965
What? How...
Four thousand men?

810
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,877
Three thousand.
Possibly.

811
01:20:51,946 --> 01:20:54,346
If the Spanish fleet
unites the barges,

812
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:56,883
their combined strength
will overwhelm us.

813
01:20:58,152 --> 01:21:01,087
Then we shall
engage them at sea,

814
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:03,385
before they have
the chance to unite.

815
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,258
Your Majesty,

816
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:09,854
this vast Armada will surely
smash through our naval defenses

817
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,523
and overrun
us on land.

818
01:21:12,967 --> 01:21:15,936
We must prepare
for the worst.

819
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:58,207
I need air.

820
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:04,178
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

821
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:10,789
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

822
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:17,961
And with all my worldly
goods, I thee endow.

823
01:22:18,032 --> 01:22:20,865
In the name
of the Father

824
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:26,635
and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, amen.

825
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:34,274
Bess!

826
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,075
Bess!

827
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:42,213
Bess Throckmorton!

828
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:48,958
Here, my lady.

829
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,464
Tell me, is it true?

830
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:54,296
Are you with child?

831
01:22:55,169 --> 01:22:57,103
Are you with child?

832
01:22:57,338 --> 01:22:59,932
Yes, my lady.

833
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:02,475
You traitress.

834
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:04,977
You dare to keep
secrets from me?

835
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,913
You ask my permission
before you rut!

836
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:09,176
Before you breed!

837
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,481
My bitches wear my collars!
Do you hear me?

838
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:13,918
Do you hear me?

839
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:17,116
Majesty! Please,
dignity. Mercy.

840
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:19,489
This is no time
for mercy, Walsingham.

841
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,788
You go to your
traitor brother

842
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:23,160
and leave me
to my business.

843
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,222
Is it his?

844
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:28,826
Tell me. Say it. Is the
child his? Is it his?

845
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,894
Yes.

846
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:36,069
My lady, it is
my husband's child.

847
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:40,203
You bitch!

848
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,908
Majesty.

849
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:46,351
This is not the Queen
I love and serve.

850
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:54,961
This man has seduced
a ward of the Queen.

851
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:58,658
And she has married
without royal consent.

852
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:02,760
These offenses are
punishable by law. Arrest him!

853
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,805
Go!

854
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:13,037
You no longer have
the Queen's protection.

855
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:15,776
As you wish,
Majesty.

856
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,215
Get out.

857
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:20,253
Get out! Get out!

858
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:26,783
Get out!

859
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:54,487
The fall of an empire,
you told me.

860
01:24:54,555 --> 01:24:56,182
Did you mean
the English empire?

861
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:59,488
Because, by God, England will
not fall while I am Queen.

862
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:02,028
If that is your prophecy,
sir, you prophesy again.

863
01:25:02,096 --> 01:25:03,586
You want me to tell
Your Majesty

864
01:25:03,664 --> 01:25:05,461
only what Your Majesty
chooses to hear.

865
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,831
I will not be a toy
of the fates!

866
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,700
Have I not faced an
assassin's bullet and lived?

867
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:17,604
Just tell me
there's no certainty.

868
01:25:18,946 --> 01:25:20,311
That any outcome
is possible.

869
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:23,612
The shadow of ghosts,
you said.

870
01:25:23,851 --> 01:25:27,719
Please, just
give me hope.

871
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:31,417
The forces that shape our world
are greater than all of us, Majesty.

872
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:35,121
How can I promise that
they'll conspire in your favor,

873
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,391
even though
you are the Queen?

874
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,998
But this much
I know.

875
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:49,031
When the storm breaks, each man acts
in accordance with his own nature.

876
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,635
Some are dumb
with terror.

877
01:25:51,712 --> 01:25:55,011
Some flee. Some hide.

878
01:25:55,082 --> 01:25:57,915
And some

879
01:25:57,985 --> 01:26:02,547
spread their wings like
eagles and soar on the wind.

880
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:13,330
You are a wise man,
Dr. Dee.

881
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:16,598
And you, madam,
are a very great lady.

882
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:25,637
Light the beacon!

883
01:27:17,264 --> 01:27:19,255
My lords,

884
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:23,633
I can offer you
no words of comfort.

885
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,505
This Armada
that sails against us,

886
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:32,012
carries in its bowels
the Inquisition.

887
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:34,604
God forbid it succeeds,

888
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:38,140
for then there will be
no more liberty in England

889
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,881
of conscience or of thought.

890
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:46,493
We cannot be defeated.

891
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:50,358
The bells are to ring
from every tower.

892
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:54,424
Laborers are to leave the
fields, and take up arms.

893
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:56,561
The harvest must wait.

894
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:02,238
All prisoners
are to be released.

895
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:05,544
England is their country, too.

896
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:25,524
And release Raleigh.

897
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,595
He is forgiven.

898
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,807
As I, too,
long to be forgiven.

899
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:47,912
Let the fleet know we're
on our way, Mr. Calley!

900
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:51,653
Fire broadside
from the bow!

901
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:54,952
Run out the prime!

902
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,663
From the starboard bow,
number one gun!

903
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:01,327
On my mark!

904
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:03,461
Discharge! Two!

905
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:06,904
Three! Four!

906
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:35,560
Majesty, the enemy
has been engaged.

907
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,060
What news?

908
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:41,370
A brave action,
Your Majesty.

909
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,376
Two ships lost.

910
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:45,105
With what gain?

911
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,704
The enemy continue
to advance.

912
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:58,953
Tighten the buntlines
on the foresail!

913
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,221
Another four
ships lost.

914
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:05,821
We must continue to engage
and harass the enemy.

915
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:10,769
We're outgunned,
Drake. Decisively.

916
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:16,566
We're losing too many ships. We
must fall back and defend the coast.

917
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:20,075
If the wind
is with us, Walter,

918
01:30:20,147 --> 01:30:22,115
we can attack them
with fire ships.

919
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:25,118
Six fire ships
into the Spanish formation,

920
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,017
that may force
them to scatter.

921
01:30:27,087 --> 01:30:28,782
We can't get
anywhere near them.

922
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:32,121
We have to break their
formation. That's our only chance.

923
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:37,821
The Spanish are barely
a day away, Majesty.

924
01:30:37,898 --> 01:30:40,560
We must withdraw
to safe ground.

925
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:46,163
I beg you to appreciate the gravity of
the situation. There is very little time.

926
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:25,537
My loving people.

927
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:30,948
We see the sails
of the enemy approaching.

928
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:35,983
We hear the Spanish guns
over the water.

929
01:31:37,691 --> 01:31:43,186
Soon now, we will
meet them face to face.

930
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:48,692
I am resolved in the midst
and heat of the battle

931
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:52,432
to live or die
amongst you all!

932
01:31:56,510 --> 01:32:01,914
While we stand together,
no invader shall pass.

933
01:32:01,982 --> 01:32:05,850
Let them come with the armies
of hell! They will not pass!

934
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:11,983
And when this day
of battle is ended,

935
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:15,795
we meet again in heaven

936
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:21,094
or on the field of victory.

937
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:08,005
Thomas! Get up!
Get up, man! Get up!

938
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:19,022
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

939
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,061
Help me!

940
01:34:05,506 --> 01:34:07,201
They've dropped anchor.

941
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:10,402
These Spanish monsters can't
handle our English seas.

942
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:14,441
We have the wind
in our favor.

943
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,142
Do we go?

944
01:34:18,752 --> 01:34:20,720
We go.

945
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:23,314
Godspeed, my friend.

946
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:27,288
Walter?

947
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:29,226
Don't forget to jump.

948
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,874
Calley!

949
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,608
Enough tar!
Clear the deck!

950
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:53,482
If that cannon's primed,
set the fuse!

951
01:34:56,190 --> 01:35:00,024
Get everybody
off the ship, now!

952
01:35:04,898 --> 01:35:06,991
Get off the ship! Off the ship! Go!

953
01:35:07,067 --> 01:35:09,365
Get over there!

954
01:35:09,436 --> 01:35:12,030
Come on, boys!
Get going!

955
01:36:08,562 --> 01:36:10,530
The Spanish
continue to advance.

956
01:36:10,597 --> 01:36:13,031
Just five of their ships
are burning.

957
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:19,435
Not enough.

958
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,635
Amen.

959
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:52,862
Francis?

960
01:42:11,758 --> 01:42:16,855
I have served Your Majesty
in all things.

961
01:42:18,698 --> 01:42:20,791
I know it.

962
01:42:23,169 --> 01:42:26,002
You won't need me anymore.

963
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:41,577
You rest here,

964
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,724
old friend.

965
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:29,466
Elizabeth has a son.

966
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:34,234
You must be proud.

967
01:43:34,307 --> 01:43:36,207
Very.

968
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:38,836
And fulfilled.

969
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:41,506
As any man can be.

970
01:43:42,782 --> 01:43:47,310
Do you still dream of your
shining city in the New World?

971
01:43:48,588 --> 01:43:50,453
Always.

972
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,674
I'd like to give
your son my blessing.

973
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:19,942
I'd be honored.

974
01:45:22,716 --> 01:45:25,776
<i>I am called
the Virgin Queen.</i>

975
01:45:27,353 --> 01:45:29,548
<i>Unmarried,</i>

976
01:45:29,622 --> 01:45:32,216
<i>I have no master.</i>

977
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:35,759
<i>Childless,</i>

978
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:39,593
<i>I am mother to my people.</i>

979
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:45,603
<i>God give me strength
to bear this mighty freedom.</i>

980
01:45:48,374 --> 01:45:51,207
<i>I am your Queen.</i>

981
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:55,577
<i>I am myself.</i>

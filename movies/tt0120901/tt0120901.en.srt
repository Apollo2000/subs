00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:54,856
Good evening, Miss Lake.

3
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,879
Aaah!

4
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,697
This is so sad.

5
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:41,456
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

6
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:43,150
Please, let me through.

7
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:44,318
Please.

8
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,091
Bravo, I say!

9
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,663
Ryan rules!

10
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:57,266
Congratulations.

11
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:59,604
Thank you, thank you.

12
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,406
Here you go.

13
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:04,970
Mitsubishi.

14
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:07,107
Mr. Harrison...

15
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:08,809
...here you go.

16
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:15,790
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

17
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,851
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

18
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,831
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

19
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,365
Thank you.
Nice talking with you.

20
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
Cass Lake.

21
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,443
No, Ryan Harrison.

22
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:41,142
You're mixing me up with some woman.

23
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:42,980
I'd love to have you
sit for me some time.

24
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,280
Are you a dog trainer?

25
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,687
No, portraits.

26
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,850
I've seen every one of your concerts.

27
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,689
Your music moved me.

28
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:54,025
Nothing like a good movement.

29
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:56,827
--Oh, Allah!

30
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,162
Oh, my balls!

31
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,729
Muslim prayers.

32
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,395
That must be east.

33
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:04,805
Well, excuse me.

34
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,364
<i>My hand!</i>

35
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,431
Hibbing Goodhue.

36
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:10,308
Maestro Harrison, welcome.

37
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:11,540
Thank you for inviting me.

38
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,808
I need to talk to you.

39
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,043
Cass, I have guests.

40
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:18,349
It's been a privilege
sponsoring your concerts.

41
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,653
I'm eternally grateful to my husband for
bringing you into my life, Mr. Harrison.

42
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:24,920
I think this deserves a kiss,
don't you?

43
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,229
I've never missed one of
your concerts.

44
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,032
Hibbing, however,
wasn't at Friday's.

45
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:38,567
It was a high colonic.

46
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,438
Yes, a Jewish holiday.
Mazel tov.

47
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,713
I'll just round us up
some drinks.

48
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:48,578
How dare you?

49
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,380
How could you ignore my note?

50
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,887
All I want is for you to reconsider.
Hibbing, please.

51
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,049
-Ryan.
-Oh, stuff and nonsense!

52
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,582
Go dash a mineral water in
your face and buck up!

53
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,755
You deserve a real man's drink.

54
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:09,703
Bottoms up.

55
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,569
I know mine will be.

56
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,409
-Good-bye, darling!
-Have a safe flight.

57
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:21,575
- Could you please open the gates for me?

58
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,118
Never mind!

59
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:26,383
Ryan, what are you doing?

60
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,220
Your dog certainly has
a surprised look on his face.

61
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,282
Well, that's because
you're looking at his butt.

62
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:34,754
<i>Uh... oh.</i>

63
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:38,926
Then he's certainly not going to enjoy
that treat that I just fed to him.

64
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,903
Well, I guess I'd better be--

65
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,666
I don't think so.

66
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,569
Now they're safe.

67
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,614
I thought I might go for a swim.

68
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:54,015
Would you care to join me'?

69
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:56,142
I have a suit for you.

70
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:57,550
Mrs. Goodhue...

71
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:58,951
...I think that we should
say good-bye now.

72
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:02,580
No, please.

73
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:06,117
My head is spinning like a dreidel
in a sandstorm. I should go--

74
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:12,960
Kissing you makes me think
about your husband.

75
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,129
You do like women?

76
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:16,193
Of course.

77
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,434
But you're a married one.
I'm not.

78
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:22,273
Hibbing won't be back for three days.

79
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,607
Stay?

80
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:26,046
You don't know what you're missing.

81
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,208
I used to lick envelopes
for a living.

82
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:30,309
Those long manila ones.

83
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,950
I'm not wearing any underwear.

84
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:38,159
Ohh!

85
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,670
Intruder, intruder.

86
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:01,046
Step away from the car.
Step away from the car.

87
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:04,747
System deactivated.

88
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,049
Get into the car.

89
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,353
Get into the car.
Get into the car.

90
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:18,863
Ryan, darling, why are you leaving me?
Hibbing is out of town.

91
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,233
If I don't see you tonight,
I'm prepared to take my own life.

92
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,362
I am desperate!

93
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,871
And I'm out of milk.

94
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:26,875
Can you pick up a half gallon
of two percent on the way?

95
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,606
Yours in adultery, Lauren.

96
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:41,088
Ruth Kimball, in New York.

97
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,751
And I'm speaking with
United Nations Secretary General...

98
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,225
...Sir Robert McKintyre.

99
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:49,059
I'd like to thank our friend, Hibbing
Goodhue, for arranging this interview.

100
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,464
Hibbing has been my good friend
since our school days at...

101
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:53,229
...Cherry Pants-upon-Buttocks.

102
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,601
He's invited you to come to Columbia
Heights to make an important speech.

103
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,231
A speech that will have terrorists
peeing their pants.

104
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,297
Quite.

105
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,366
I am forming
a multinational strike force...

106
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:05,744
...whose sole purpose is to tear at
the very heart of terrorism...

107
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:09,979
...by seeking out and destroying their
sanctuaries and training compounds.

108
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,249
I will be placing every terrorist
on alert...

109
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,722
...that their days are
indeed numbered.

110
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:28,836
Yes!

111
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,934
...a lesbian...

112
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:35,636
...oral...
-...used to masturbate...

113
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,576
...nymphomaniac Siamese twins...

114
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:39,239
...who cheat with
each other's husbands.

115
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,941
But first, it's official!

116
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:44,111
The United Nations Secretary General,
Sir Robert McKintyre...

117
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,849
...will be in Columbia Heights
on the 12th of this month...

118
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,788
...as guest of Hibbing Goodhue.

119
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:51,793
Sir Robert will be speaking
at our Columbia Heights Jamboree...

120
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:55,490
...and will be the highlight of this
year's celebration of Scottish heritage.

121
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:57,123
The Brave-Roy pipe and drill team--

122
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:59,532
...I'm not having orgasms... gay guys...

123
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,331
"'8 you!

124
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:06,103
I've been drinking several toasts
to your honor tonight, my dear.

125
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:09,303
Yes, to the great deceiver.

126
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:13,207
You never loved me.

127
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,875
<i>You only wanted me
for my connection with...</i>

128
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,477
...McKintyre.

129
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,818
And for my quiet shoreline...

130
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:24,155
...the perfect place to land
a small group of terrorists.

131
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:27,992
This is about assassination.

132
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:32,660
Turn that bloody radio off!

133
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:38,339
Please, that's far
too melodramatic.

134
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,739
Ouch!

135
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:56,891
Aaah!

136
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:09,200
Bloody hell!

137
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,540
Have you quite finished?

138
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,513
Lauren?

139
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,622
I read your note.

140
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:11,431
I'm not here to play
games, Lauren.

141
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,602
Where are you?

142
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,611
Lauren?

143
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,147
I--Oh.

144
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:30,083
I want you to understand.
There's nothing between us.

145
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:33,616
You're not Lauren!
You're an imposter!

146
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,177
"Hylander"?

147
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:28,468
Goodhue!

148
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,499
Where the hell were you?!

149
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,203
You made a mess of things.

150
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,678
At least you did your job.

151
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:06,715
Goodhue knew too much.
He had to die.

152
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,445
As for this sorry sod, you've given
the authorities Hibbing's murderer.

153
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:15,721
I expect we'll move forward
with no further interference...

154
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,886
...with Operation Hylander,
the killing of the U.N.'s McKintyre.

155
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,500
We have a code 3, 43rd and Jefferson.

156
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:40,781
Say "cheese."

157
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,315
Who's that?
Where'd he come from?

158
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,410
He's got a gun!
Get the gun!

159
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:46,921
You have the right to
remain silent.

160
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:48,923
Anything you say may be
held against you.

161
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,482
One nation, indivisible,
till death do us part.

162
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,360
-Van Atter!
-Yeah?

163
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,420
Take this blood sample
to the lab.

164
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:58,524
And don't go walking around
with it all day.

165
00:16:58,589 --> 00:16:59,659
Up yours!

166
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:03,261
Get him in the car. All right,
people, get him in the car.

167
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:04,601
Give us room.

168
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:07,335
Stand back, people.
Give him a little air, people.

169
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:10,503
I want you people back.
Hold them back, hold them back.

170
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,046
I'm innocent.

171
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,877
I'm being wrongfully accused.

172
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,883
Guilt or innocence,
that's not my job.

173
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,749
It's my duty to pick up
scum-sucking punks like yourself...

174
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,447
...who are accused of a crime.

175
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,684
A jury of twelve really
stupid people...

176
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:25,590
...who are easily swayed by rich,
fat-cat, slimy lawyers...

177
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,391
...who'll do anything but tell the
truth, will sit in judgment of you.

178
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,523
It's as American as a burrito.

179
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:33,468
Ryan and I were having sex.

180
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,697
Hot, steamy, sweaty sex.

181
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,262
Every part of my body tingled,
orgasm after orgasm--

182
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:41,605
Lady, I just asked for your name.

183
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,440
Mrs. Hibbing Goodhue.

184
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,209
I was weak to Ryan's charms.
He wanted me to leave Hibbing.

185
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:50,482
He said he just wanted
to talk to him.

186
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:53,583
I can't believe he killed him.

187
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:54,884
I came home...

188
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,322
...late last night...

189
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,486
...and there he was.

190
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:02,927
Now I'm going to have to start...

191
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,431
...dating again.

192
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:09,198
Mr. Harrison! Mr. Harrison!

193
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:24,585
Okay, everybody, come on.
Let the car through. Stand back.

194
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,323
Ryan Harrison,
a jury of your peers...

195
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,589
...have found you guilty
of murder.

196
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:37,291
On August 12,
at Stillwater Federal Prison...

197
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:39,425
...you shall have your sentence
carried out.

198
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:44,598
You shall be executed buffet style,
lethally injected, electrocuted...

199
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,937
...and placed before
a firing squad.

200
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:51,810
May God have mercy on your soul,
you bastard, you.

201
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:09,990
Seats in the upright position.

202
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:13,500
Handcuffs and ankle chains
must be securely fastened...

203
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:16,163
...or you will be shot.

204
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,172
Exits are clearly marked...

205
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:20,139
...but you will not
be using them.

206
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:21,540
Should you use them...

207
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:23,839
...you will be shot.

208
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,676
On behalf of the State
of Minnesota...

209
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:28,182
...thank you for being
arrested and convicted.

210
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:31,185
Sit back and enjoy your bus ride.

211
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:53,901
I'm not going to take it any longer.
I'm going to fight back.

212
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:56,035
I am going to prove
that I am not guilty.

213
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,442
Shut up!

214
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:00,004
No! I'm being wrongfully accused.

215
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:03,012
How dare you, sir?

216
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:04,245
How dare you?!

217
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:05,286
No, how dare you?!

218
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,719
No, no, how dare you?!

219
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:09,053
How dare you "no, no"
my "how dare you?!"

220
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:11,092
You dare to dare me?!

221
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:13,094
How dare you “how dare me,“
when I “how dare you?!“

222
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,720
You big pee-pee head!

223
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:17,231
You are the pee-pee head!

224
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:19,062
Mr. Booger Lips, ca-ca mouth!

225
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,226
Shut up!

226
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,294
- You'll never shut me up!

227
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,811
Hey. you Pee-pee head!

228
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:00,098
Hey! I can't see!

229
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:03,167
Take the wastebasket
off your head.

230
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,571
I still can't see!

231
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:08,138
Take the other one off.

232
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:10,450
That's better.

233
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:12,619
Get the keys.

234
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:15,316
Take off the cuffs.

235
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:17,359
My shoe's untied.

236
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,958
My shirt's out.

237
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:26,634
Whoo, whoo.

238
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,972
Whoo?

239
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:36,141
Oh, no!

240
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,337
- A train!
- A train?

241
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,956
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

242
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:57,020
-Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thank you.

243
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:11,444
Huh? Uh-oh.

244
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,650
Orono! Bagley!

245
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:08,252
This looks like a trailer park
after a tornado.

246
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:09,797
All right, speak to me, people.

247
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:11,298
One prisoner was missing.

248
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:13,356
-It's a Ryan--
-Harrison.

249
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:15,425
The man who killed
Hibbing Goodhue.

250
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:18,701
This has more twists and turns
than Chubby Checker in a blender.

251
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:21,299
So we got us a murderer
on the loose!

252
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:23,037
All right,
listen up, people!

253
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,101
Our man will be on foot
and running.

254
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:27,671
A man that's tired,
a man that's possibly hurt...

255
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,343
...will have a stride of 4 feet,
2 and 3/4 inches...

256
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,943
...while wearing boxer shorts.

257
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:34,318
Four feet even,
with the restrictions of a brief.

258
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:37,449
Which means he will cover
four miles in one hour.

259
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:40,290
He's got an hour and 3/4
start on us.

260
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,886
He'll take to the nearest
highway.

261
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:44,091
He'll commandeer a car
or hop on a truck.

262
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:48,159
Now, the average elevation in this area
is 2,057 feet...

263
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:51,763
...2 and 1/4 inches,
with one exception.

264
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:56,004
He will take any chances,
do anything to stay a free man.

265
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,010
Climb, hike...

266
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,569
...rappel.

267
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,239
Hell, even fall down a
damn mountain.

268
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:03,246
It's a wilderness out there...

269
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:06,185
...so this citified sophisticate
better watch himself.

270
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,519
He's in the heart of bear country.

271
00:25:11,815 --> 00:25:13,488
This fiddle player will be hungry...

272
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,257
...famished, starved.

273
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:18,765
His last meal was twelve
hours ago.

274
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,165
This boy's on the run.

275
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:22,533
He'll head for the city,
a large city.

276
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,868
He'll try to lose himself in a crowd.

277
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:28,899
And wherever he goes, he will feel
hundreds of eyes staring his way.

278
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:31,377
No matter what he does,
no matter where he goes...

279
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:32,708
...he will feel hunted.

280
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,043
And my friends...

281
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:36,778
...you are looking at the hunter!

282
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,842
I want roadblocks
around a 10-mile radius.

283
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:41,047
Set up communications
with all law enforcement.

284
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:43,216
That's state, county, city!

285
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,193
Get me Governor Carlson.
I may need the National Guard.

286
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:47,887
Diet Coke, no ice.

287
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:50,557
All right, people.
I want Harrison caught...

288
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,964
...in 4 hours and 28 minutes.

289
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:55,970
That will make it exactly high noon.
Now let's move it!

290
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:59,701
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Move it, people! Move it!

291
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:11,244
Nelson and I are heading towards
Wysetta by way of Peck's Woods.

292
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,811
So far, no sign of Harrison. Over.

293
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,788
Ten-four, Unit Six.

294
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,634
How you doing there?

295
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,794
Fine.

296
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,702
These are on sale, right?

297
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:07,708
Sure, yeah.
$32.50, okay?

298
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,801
You betcha, sure.

299
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:13,704
Doing some fishing around here?

300
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,979
Yes.

301
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,145
I'm going to do a little angling,
see if I can't catch one of those...

302
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:23,624
uh, bigmouth fish here in
Minnesota.

303
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,127
And some of those huge
huskies, too.

304
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:35,494
So, Roman...

305
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:37,504
...are you still fishing
off Gray's Bay?

306
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,736
Catching any walleyes,
muskies or enemy boats?

307
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,675
Sure, you betcha.

308
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:46,475
I told you that upteen times.

309
00:27:46,536 --> 00:27:49,983
A guy in a rubber-type boat was headed
for the Goodhue place, you know?

310
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,019
Yeah, sure, yeah.

311
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:53,713
Okay then?

312
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:55,757
Sure, after how many beers?

313
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:59,487
I ain't touched a drop of liquor
since I quit singing with ABBA.

314
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:03,190
Was that the night of
the Hibbing Goodhue murder?

315
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:06,200
-You seem awful interested in this case.
-No.

316
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:08,862
-Do you know something about
the Goodhue killing? -No.

317
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:11,599
-Do you have any real stories
 to tell us? -No.

318
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:14,870
I'll take the rod
and write a check here.

319
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,877
You have a pen?

320
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,004
- Thank you.

321
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:29,823
Yeah, sure enough.
You betcha. Okay.

322
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:36,722
You know, I've never seen you
around here, Mr...

323
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:38,527
Buzzin.

324
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:40,261
Buzzin Frog.

325
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:44,465
Born on the shores of the Euro
Larvae River in Rapala.

326
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,905
Couple of husky jerks...

327
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:49,273
...brought me to Slimy Slug,
South Dakota.

328
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:51,403
Up there by Timber Doodle?

329
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:54,574
The Zebco brothers, Smithwick...

330
00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:56,583
...and Salty Dog Shrimp--

331
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,312
Ohh!

332
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:01,583
I can't go fishing this
afternoon.

333
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:04,124
I've got a big meeting over at...

334
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,387
...Menzrum.

335
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:10,625
I'd forget my genitals if they weren't
SuperGlued in between my legs.

336
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:11,757
Water-skiing accident.

337
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:17,933
Freeze, Harrison!

338
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,439
Don't move.

339
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,611
You know, I've never seen you
around here, Mr...

340
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:35,445
Buzzin.

341
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,116
Buzzin Frog.

342
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,786
Born on the shores
of the Euro Larvae River...

343
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,294
...in Rapala.

344
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,627
Up there by Timber Doodle?

345
00:29:43,686 --> 00:29:45,791
...Salty Dog Shrimp.

346
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:48,699
I've got a big meeting
over at Menzrum.

347
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,031
There's got to be something here...

348
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:57,002
...some clue, somewhere.

349
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,836
-Ryan.
-What are you doing here?

350
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:31,872
-How did you get in?
-The door was open.

351
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:33,566
I locked that door.

352
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,802
A key.

353
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:38,812
Lauren is missing. She gave you a key,
sent you to do evidence housecleaning.

354
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:40,905
No, I painted Hibbing's portrait.

355
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,416
He gave me this key to
let myself in.

356
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,953
I have no idea where Lauren is.
The killer could be stalking her.

357
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,218
Stalking, schmalking. She lied
about me on the witness stand.

358
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:51,315
She set me up to come here
the night of the murder.

359
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:52,826
She couldn't do anything like that.

360
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:55,158
Coulda, woulda, shoulda.
She dida!

361
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:59,325
I understand her.
You see, I think she's my sister.

362
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:00,629
Sister?

363
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,068
It's like a brother,
only you do each other's hair.

364
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:06,232
I think she's in grave danger.
I came to look for clues.

365
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:09,333
Ryan, I know you're innocent.

366
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,106
You really mean that?

367
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,942
This is not just another
way to meet guys?

368
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:15,573
I'm a friend.

369
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:19,111
I wish that we could be friends.

370
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:23,585
But women and me...

371
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:25,751
...are like water and fire--

372
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:28,694
Wet and flammable.

373
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:30,025
No, no.

374
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:36,765
You hang out with me...

375
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,533
...and you're going to get hurt.

376
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:40,198
No.

377
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:42,874
It was all mine.

378
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:45,708
The city was at my feet,
spread out like an oyster.

379
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:48,146
People bravoed, they ovated.

380
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:50,707
I was somebody,
I was a contender.

381
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:54,220
Now all I've got is a one-way
ticket to Palookaville.

382
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:57,281
It's got to be that the answer
is here somewhere.

383
00:32:58,214 --> 00:32:59,693
The party-

384
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,387
...drinks, drinking...

385
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:04,122
...the bar.

386
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:06,189
There was something
about the bartender.

387
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:07,199
Close your eyes.

388
00:33:12,562 --> 00:33:14,542
The bartender!

389
00:33:14,597 --> 00:33:15,667
Hibbing's killer!

390
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,584
You...

391
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,675
...with the killer.

392
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:30,523
Good Lord!

393
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,232
The bus stop at Helm's
is the 5:50 express.

394
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:42,269
It stops right in front
of the Goodhue house.

395
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:43,668
Scour the entire area.

396
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:45,899
Orono, chase the car
and put it in park.

397
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:48,340
Bagley, I want everyone interrogated.

398
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:52,709
I want surnames, last names,
given names, confirmation names.

399
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,045
Give me photo analysis,
footprint analysis...

400
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:57,050
...DNA, bra sizes.

401
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:58,779
I'll check out
who belongs to this truck.

402
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:01,720
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

403
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:22,977
I need a backup unit,
a roadblock and a helicopter.

404
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,207
Harrison?

405
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,278
Where's that gardener?

406
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:30,339
Bagley!

407
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:31,350
Orono!

408
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,066
That's our man!

409
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,101
She meant to do that.

410
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,111
Women.

411
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:06,911
We got us a gopher.

412
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,484
I'll see where this thing
comes out.

413
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,796
Call the Department of Water--

414
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,197
Hey!

415
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:42,213
Hands up!

416
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,347
It's over, Harrison.

417
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:50,857
But I'm innocent.

418
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:54,019
The one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed man.
The bartender.

419
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,460
He was the one
who killed Hibbing Goodhue.

420
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:58,192
And Lauren Goodhue is working with him.
Why, I don't know.

421
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,892
-Why?
-I don't know!

422
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:02,129
But I'll find them. I've got clues.
I've got a map.

423
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,694
I've got the name, "Hylander,"
and a rubber boat.

424
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,740
They prove I've been
wrongfully accused!

425
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:09,777
Nice tune,
but I didn't come here to dance.

426
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:11,812
You've been convicted of murder.

427
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:13,912
I'm taking you in.

428
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,472
N05

429
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:16,915
I'm not going back.

430
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:18,043
Wherever it is!

431
00:37:22,778 --> 00:37:23,984
Wait, Harrison!

432
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:28,262

and "Hylander" stuff about?

442
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:13,101
Orono, call the coast guard.
"Hylander."

443
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,614
- Well!

444
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:24,651
Peekaboo, baby!

445
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:25,981
Don't move.

446
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:30,519
I've got a gun.

447
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:31,614
Not here...

448
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,784
...but I got one.

449
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,122
You frightened?

450
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:36,493
You ran away, you remember?
You can move now.

451
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:37,792
Yes, I was frightened.

452
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:39,992
I've been driving all over the city
searching for you.

453
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,127
Well, you found me.
Hide-and-seek is over.

454
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:44,899
The school bell has rung.
Time to go back to the homeroom.

455
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,031
Whatever you do, don't scream.

456
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:48,973
Aaah!

457
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:50,237
Like that.

458
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:09,757
Ryan...

459
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:11,594
...you can feel safe here.

460
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:13,395
We're six floors up.
No one can see you.

461
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:16,027
Hey, Cass!
Who's your new friend?

462
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:24,240
Sit down, Pancakes.

463
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:31,948
Of all the women in all the world...

464
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:34,613
...you had to walk into mine.

465
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:40,052
I'm sure if we just talk all night,
we can work this out.

466
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,062
Sure, Slappy.

467
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:45,099
Let's pull out that wad of cotton
and get right to the aspirin.

468
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:47,930
You hired a hit man.
You wanted Hibbing dead.

469
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,560
I saw the two of you arguing.

470
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,697
And you were sizzling
like a wiener on a hibachi.

471
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:55,765
That's because Hibbing told me that
he hated the portrait I did of him.

472
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,105
It hurt.

473
00:39:57,166 --> 00:40:00,579
A deep, crampy kind of a hurt.
That's why I was so upset.

474
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:02,081
I was even going to kill myself.

475
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,311
But I couldn't.
I threw the gun in the bay.

476
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:07,286
We don't have time
for this schoolgirl act.

477
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,914
We're, both of us,
sitting under the gallows.

478
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:13,290
You're not telling the truth! Explain
why you gave the killer the money.

479
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,828
That was Hibbing's money
for the portrait.

480
00:40:14,884 --> 00:40:16,955
I gave it to the bartender
to give back to Hibbing.

481
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,726
I never wanted to see Hibbing again.

482
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:20,425
Your lies are like bananas.

483
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,969
They come in big yellow bunches.

484
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:25,767
I wish there was something
I could do to make you believe me.

485
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:45,390
Damn you!

486
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:49,652
Damn you for making me
fall in love with you.

487
00:40:49,718 --> 00:40:52,460
-I can't let you get mixed up in this.
-I want to get mixed up in it.

488
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:54,501
-I can't do it to you.
-I want you to do it to me.

489
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:55,797
I'm a hunted man.

490
00:40:55,858 --> 00:40:58,805
Every time I think that I'm out,
they pull me back in.

491
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:00,169
Hunt me! Pull me!

492
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:01,970
Ryan, you can't do this on your own.

493
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:03,169
I have to.

494
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,472
Now, listen...

495
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:05,978
...I'm going out that door...

496
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,514
...and where I'm going
you can't follow me.

497
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,447
And I'm not trying to be noble.

498
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,883
But baby, out there...

499
00:41:11,941 --> 00:41:13,682
...it's a hill of beans.

500
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:15,847
Here's looking at you, kid.

501
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:17,549
You're the stuff dreams are made of.

502
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:20,493
You see?

503
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:22,153
You're exhausted.

504
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:23,219
Listen...

505
00:41:23,285 --> 00:41:24,889
...I'm going to give you
a sponge bath...

506
00:41:24,954 --> 00:41:27,127
...give you a bracing enema
and make you something to eat.

507
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:30,659
Just put your weight on me.
I'll take you into the bedroom.

508
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:32,706

-He's blocked from entering the lane.

532
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,271
Yo-yoing up and down.
Up and down, up and down!

533
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:12,601
He checks the clock.
Time is running out.

534
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:14,299
He's been in the paint for
a long time.

535
00:43:14,363 --> 00:43:15,899
He's going for it.

536
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:18,968
Shoots off the iron, rebound,
put it up. It's dangling on the rim.

537
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:20,775
No, yes, no, yes, no.

538
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:22,440
Rebound. He's going for it.

539
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:23,812
The mustard's off the hot dog.

540
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,909
Another rebound.
No harm, no foul.

541
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,078
He pumps up a long one.

542
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:28,780
Nothing but net.
Oh, yes!

543
00:43:28,844 --> 00:43:31,552
He scores! This one's in the
refrigerator. The door is closed.

544
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:32,956
The lights are out,
the eggs are cooling.

545
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:35,586
The butter's getting hard
and the Jell-O is jiggling!

546
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:38,962
A picnicker said she saw a man
wet and dripping walk this way.

547
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:41,831
Well, gather up all these leaves
for trace evidence.

548
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,029
Shoot and gut
every animal in the park.

549
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:46,937
Their stomachs might contain
something that could be a clue.

550
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:48,201
Donate the meat to charity.

551
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:51,301
The hides can be turned into
warm socks for the poor.

552
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,176
Grind up the bones for dog food.

553
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:54,805
I want nothing wasted.

554
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,975
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Here we are.

555
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,485
A man's footprint...

556
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:02,385
...the depth of the print indicating
the weight and the height of Harrison.

557
00:44:03,278 --> 00:44:05,315
Tire tracks.

558
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:09,659
Tire tracks of the kind found in
the classic Mercedes-Benz convertible.

559
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:11,720
The car of choice...

560
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:14,859
...for a bright,
young professional woman.

561
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:17,671
An artist...

562
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:20,332
...maybe a photographer, painter.

563
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:22,842
A woman with a mysterious past.

564
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:26,072
A woman who is looking for someone.

565
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:29,572
I can feel it.

566
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:32,585
I'm as sure about that as I am that
that's an anaconda.

567
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:39,857
That woman that cut us off in the
Mercedes, that fits her to a tee.

568
00:44:39,915 --> 00:44:41,861
License number 381 JPL.

569
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:45,527
Davy Crockett died for our sins.

570
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:48,158
Harrison's had somebody
helping him all along!

571
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:50,533
Call Motor Vehicles.
Get her address.

572
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:52,833
-We'll pick her up.
-No. No.

573
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:55,102
There are better ways
to find out what a woman knows.

574
00:44:55,164 --> 00:44:58,043
Dinner and a movie, lie to her,
say you love her.

575
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,876
That works, but in this case
we're going to stake out her place.

576
00:45:00,936 --> 00:45:03,246
She's going to lead us
to Ryan Harrison.

577
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:07,380
- Bagley!

578
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:10,356
Wait, I'm coming.
Hey, guys!

579
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:26,898
Henningsen and Sachs
presents Old People on Ice.

580
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:30,068
Now through November
at the Marnie Ice Arena.

581
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:37,417
Good afternoon, I'm Ruth Kimball
with your hometown news.

582
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:42,081
For 36 hours, Ryan Harrison,
murderer, all-around big dink...

583
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:43,555
has been a fugitive.

584
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:46,786
Lieutenant Fergus Falls
is heading the worldwide manhunt.

585
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:51,298
Police helicopters, dogs, psychics
and thousands of police are involved.

586
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:54,732
Plus millions of average citizens
who would give their left nut...

587
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,236
...to collect the $50,000 reward.

588
00:45:57,292 --> 00:45:59,329
And who couldn't
use a bit of extra money?

589
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:03,433
A couple on a fixed income, a teacher,
especially a struggling artist...

590
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:07,106
...who had to return a large fee
because someone hated her portrait.

591
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:09,615
I personally
wouldn't trust someone like that...

592
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:12,618
...for a million, billion,
trillion dollars.

593
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:15,814
The Columbia Heights Jamboree...

594
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:17,118
...is shaping--

595
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:43,773
I'm on the 6th floor,
apartment 602.

596
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,317
What?

597
00:46:45,374 --> 00:46:47,445
No, he's alone.

598
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:57,457
Well.

599
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:17,306
Well, well!

600
00:47:24,913 --> 00:47:26,358
No, you don't understand.

601
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:28,827
This can't wait.
This has to happen right now.

602
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:05,392
Sean Laughrea.

603
00:48:05,454 --> 00:48:07,229
Hibbing's killer.

604
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:25,244
Yes. Thank you.

605
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:29,419
Harrison! Open up!
We know you're in there!

606
00:48:30,145 --> 00:48:31,146
It's the police!

607
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:34,559
Don't go in there!

608
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,459
-What are you doing?
-Harrison!

609
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:39,589
Ryan, ope" "P!

610
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:40,725
I've got a gun!

611
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,734
Come on!

612
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,997
Ryan!

613
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:46,005
Let me in! Right now!

614
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:49,541
Come out!

615
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,407
Is that my toilet? Ryan!

616
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:54,143
Open up!

617
00:48:55,003 --> 00:48:57,005
You'll never get away, Ryan!

618
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:02,286
-Ryan!
-Whoa!

619
00:49:04,513 --> 00:49:06,015
Starting to give!

620
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,142
Aaaah!

621
00:49:30,205 --> 00:49:31,183
Gog

622
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:35,715
All right, my angels...

623
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:36,721
...move!

624
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,354
-Patio clear!
-lvy needs water!

625
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:43,418
Den is clear!

626
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:44,555
I sot Spaghetti!

627
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,621
Watch it!
Plate could be hot!

628
00:49:47,456 --> 00:49:48,662
I got a shut door!

629
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:51,304
Empty.

630
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,067
We throw a shoe
every time we start to gallop.

631
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:56,302
That man's as slick as a lizard
in Jerry Lewis' hair.

632
00:49:58,066 --> 00:50:00,068
Cass Lake,
face of an angel.

633
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:02,240
Harrison's accomplice.

634
00:50:02,304 --> 00:50:04,545
A caterpillar has 2,087
minute hairs on each leg.

635
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:07,177
But for the life of me, I cannot
tell you why women keep falling...

636
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:09,244
...for the wrong man.

637
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:11,382
All right, people!
Tag and log everything.

638
00:50:11,446 --> 00:50:13,551
I want carpet fibers.
I want wallpaper swatches.

639
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:15,686
I want all plumbing
and wood surfaces analyzed.

640
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:18,732
So vacuum, cut,
chip and suck!

641
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,066
There are two things
that frost my butt:

642
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:24,035
It's a snow cone
about that high...

643
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:26,368
...and the other one
is Ryan Harrison.

644
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:29,105
I don't hear it, people!

645
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:49,949
-Pediatrics is down the street.
-Thank you.

646
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:14,309
Dr. Kimball to surgery,
please. Dr. Kimball.

647
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,815
Dr. Kevorkian.

648
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:20,115
Dr. Kevorkian to Mr. Simpson's room.

649
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:28,820
A volcano has erupted!

650
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:30,158
Tornado!

651
00:52:30,218 --> 00:52:31,162
Earthquake!

652
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:32,493
It's El Nifio!

653
00:52:32,554 --> 00:52:33,658
Killer bees!

654
00:52:33,722 --> 00:52:36,202
An ocean liner hit an iceberg!

655
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:41,500
Thank God you're here,
Doctor...Sanchez.

656
00:52:41,563 --> 00:52:44,567
Because of cutbacks,
you are the only person on duty.

657
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:49,682
He's pregnant.

658
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:51,479
Doctor, this man's been shot 5 times.

659
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:53,951
Down at the end
in the 10-Bullets-or-Less lane.

660
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:55,818
I'll adjust that.

661
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:57,754
Maximum flow.

662
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:01,825
Doctor, you'd better
take a look at this.

663
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,658
Uh, no, thank you.

664
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:06,665
Administer 200,000
units of adrenaline.

665
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,064
-But--
-Damn your "but."

666
00:53:08,123 --> 00:53:10,865
I said 200,000 cc's of adrenaline.

667
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:14,432
Balance and rotate the organs.

668
00:53:15,263 --> 00:53:16,367
Put granny on the gurney.

669
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:18,433
Put the cop in post-op.

670
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,377
-ICU?
-And I see you.

671
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:22,915
You're a fine nurse.

672
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:24,541
I want to speak to you.

673
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:26,552
Isn't that a little fester?

674
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:28,246
-What?
-Just below your eye there.

675
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:31,257
-Fester? Is it dangerous?
-Let me get a good look at that.

676
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:49,497
Check in, Second Floor Security.
Check in, please, Jackson.

677
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:52,976
I'm searching the west wing.
So far, no sign of the intruder.

678
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:32,083
Nurse! Nurse!

679
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:33,913
Hold it!

680
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,280
Quick!

681
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:42,725
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

682
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:58,301
-Security, look behind you.
-What?

683
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,276
-Look behind you.
-Where?

684
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:02,075
Look behind you.

685
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:05,082
Oh. Too late.
Go to Radiology.

686
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,612
We should be safe for now.

687
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:10,052
I followed the diaper truck.

688
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,283
As soon as I saw this hospital,
I knew you must be here.

689
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:13,620
Put your hand in my pocket.

690
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,250
All right.

691
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,589
What am I looking for?

692
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,993
Nothing.

693
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:21,464
I just missed you, baby.
We're going to party like it's 1995.

694
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:23,398
Oh, Ryan.

695
00:55:23,457 --> 00:55:25,733
I hoped you'd say those words.

696
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:27,271
I love you.

697
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,902
Boy!

698
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:33,137
You really are something,
aren't you?

699
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,113
You believed me just then, didn't you'?
How does it feel?

700
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:39,150
You were lit up
like Dennis Rodman at Christmastime.

701
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:40,412
You really are good!

702
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:44,850
I do love you, Ryan.
I truly do.

703
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:46,754
And you eat with that mouth?

704
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:48,451
The Beatles said it best:

705
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,290
"She loves you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah."

706
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,829
Listen, Michelle, my belle...

707
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:54,627
...this nowhere man is the walrus.
Kookookachoo.

708
00:55:55,555 --> 00:55:57,967
Up at the apartment,
you said you thought I was innocent.

709
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,699
But then visions
of a big fat reward...

710
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:03,708
...danced through your head
like sugarplums on steroids.

711
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:05,471
You made a call,
you got a gat...

712
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:07,375
...and you sicced Johnny Law on me.

713
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,345
You're just a big bully,
aren't you?

714
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:11,041
That gun was for your protection.

715
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:14,984
I called the airlines to get you
a plane to South America, you mean man.

716
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,114
I wish I had a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese every time I heard that chestnut.

717
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:21,853
This little nutcracker is not dancing
to your suite anymore, princess.

718
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:24,225
I found Lauren's letters to Sean
in your apartment.

719
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:25,661
Explain that!

720
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:29,466
Lauren knew Sean for a long time.
You knew that.

721
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:31,503
You knew she knew him.

722
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:32,832
Yes, I knew she knew.

723
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:34,497
Netenyahu?

724
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:36,302
I knew Lauren knew Sean.

725
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:38,673
All right, the truth at last!

726
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:42,373
Oh, Ryan.
They're the only family I have.

727
00:56:42,436 --> 00:56:45,883
<i>Please don't make me choose
between you and my family.</i>

728
00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:47,850
Family?
Lauren's your sister. And?

729
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:49,512
Sean is my brother.

730
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:50,714
Forgive me.

731
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:59,020
Dr. Ross, Dr. Green, Dr. Carter,
Dr. Weaver and Dr. Benton...

732
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:02,659
...please pick up
a very large check in the ER.

733
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:09,097
A man fitting Harrison's description
and wearing a meat company shirt...

734
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:10,698
...has entered the ER.

735
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:12,766
There are 1,400 beds...

736
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:16,110
...a staff of 250,
150 individual rooms.

737
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:18,376
Chances of our finding
Cass and Harrison right off...

738
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:21,078
...are 9,103 to 5.

739
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:23,280
It is 3:05 p.m.

740
00:57:23,343 --> 00:57:25,550
We should make contact in 14 minutes...

741
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,182
...which makes it exactly...

742
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,887
...3:19 p.m.
Let's do it.

743
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:43,602
Records room. Records room.

744
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:49,870
Access denied.

745
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,474
Air conditioning duct.

746
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,986
Aha.

747
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:57,749
Let's see here.

748
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,779
-Uh, Nurse Anderson.
-Yes, Doctor?

749
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:17,567
Thank you.

750
01:00:03,336 --> 01:00:04,872
Let me see--
Aaaah!

751
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:06,672
Shalom!

752
01:01:12,405 --> 01:01:13,349
Dr. Fridley?

753
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:16,019
Sit down.

754
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:21,124
Here it is.

755
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:23,286
It's a beauty.

756
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,227
It's a work of art.

757
01:01:25,285 --> 01:01:28,459
The barrel is
a lightweight titanium alloy.

758
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:31,263
A retractable Swiss laser scope.

759
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:34,965
A Rogers Palomino trigger,
self-cleaning pump action...

760
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:36,974
...ribbed for your pleasure.

761
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:39,309
A silencer.

762
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:41,611
A Hush Puppy.

763
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:07,498
Main Menu.

764
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:17,005
Searching.

765
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,010
Print?

766
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:25,048
Thank you. How are you today?
Getting any?

767
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,130
Good, he's taken the bait.

768
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,726
La Cucaracha]

769
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,876
Just give me a second!
I'm almost done!

770
01:04:02,475 --> 01:04:03,954
Go, go, go!

771
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:35,814
We'll lead him to the cornfield.
Then we'll kill him.

772
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:11,621
' H"

773
01:07:21,507 --> 01:07:23,111
Cass.

774
01:07:26,946 --> 01:07:29,017
This is some kind of trap,
isn't it?

775
01:07:29,082 --> 01:07:31,187
Just like your sister
the night Hibbing was murdered.

776
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,493
-I want you to understand something.
-I understand everything, Luscious.

777
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:38,331
I saw through your lies
like Spam in a Ziploc bag.

778
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:40,302
I wish I could forget all this
and go away together.

779
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,806
We can go away right now.
I pack light.

780
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:44,899
Everything we need
is right here in my pants.

781
01:07:44,964 --> 01:07:48,207
Listen to me.
I was abandoned as a child.

782
01:07:48,267 --> 01:07:51,043
I never knew my mother,
my father, my dog.

783
01:07:51,104 --> 01:07:53,516
Yeah, pretty words,
Baby Crackers.

784
01:07:53,573 --> 01:07:57,214
Your Popeil Pasta Maker is spewing
out fettucini full of lies.

785
01:07:57,276 --> 01:07:59,347
Well, well.
What do we have here?

786
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:03,019
Lookit. Something even the cat
wouldn't have drug in.

787
01:08:03,082 --> 01:08:05,585
Pull up a bucket of nightmares
and sit down.

788
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:08,825
I've had enough of you.
It's time to dispose of Ryan Harrison...

789
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:10,993
...the way I killed my dear,
late husband.

790
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:14,630
I should have guessed that you did it,
but I didn't.

791
01:08:14,694 --> 01:08:16,696
Oh.
Sean Laughrea.

792
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:19,209
What a happy, big-time
family reunion.

793
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:22,144
You make the Mansons
look like the Cleavers.

794
01:08:22,201 --> 01:08:23,942
Family? Us? Me?

795
01:08:24,003 --> 01:08:25,880
Yes.

796
01:08:25,938 --> 01:08:28,111
I'm your sister.
Lauren's our mother.

797
01:08:28,174 --> 01:08:31,383
I'm your mother's identical twin,
born ten years apart but identical.

798
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:34,288
I killed your mother. Penis envy.
She was a hermaphrodite.

799
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:36,293
Morn was my mother
and my father?

800
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:37,760
Sean's adopted.

801
01:08:37,817 --> 01:08:40,957
I dated your real father
but chose the life of a freedom fighter.

802
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,127
Well, Miss Thick Bubbly Lips, I found
out about Dr. Fridley prosthetic leg.

803
01:08:45,191 --> 01:08:50,470
One carbon steel barrel, magazine
of cyanide-tipped bullets.

804
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:53,534
Nice new weapon. Right, Sean?
Signal "yes"...

805
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:55,636
...by shooting yourself
in the head 3 times.

806
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:57,703
Don't. It's a trick.

807
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,341
Very smart, Harrison,
but this is where smart ends...

808
01:09:00,406 --> 01:09:02,613
...and dead begins.

809
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:04,154
You die.

810
01:09:18,925 --> 01:09:23,135
Ruth, as you can see, the U.N. Secretary
General, Sir Robert McKintyre...

811
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:24,539
...has arrived in
Columbia Heights...

812
01:09:24,597 --> 01:09:25,769
There's our target.

813
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,438
You killed Hibbing and
now McKintyre?

814
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:30,037
I can't believe it.

815
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:33,812
I hope what I just told you won't
keep you from carrying out our mission.

816
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:37,986
McKintyre is an enemy to every
freedom fighter on this planet.

817
01:09:38,044 --> 01:09:39,785
Yes, of course.

818
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,985
I see you're right.

819
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:44,961
Good. Let's go.

820
01:09:45,017 --> 01:09:49,397
I'll just finish packing the terrorists'
lunches and I'll be right there.

821
01:09:49,455 --> 01:09:51,901
See you in five?

822
01:09:55,828 --> 01:09:57,273
Cass!

823
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:00,543
Cass!

824
01:10:12,812 --> 01:10:14,758
Cass. Shh.

825
01:10:18,284 --> 01:10:21,857
When you shot me at point-blank range
I knew you loved me.

826
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:26,028
Those trophies back at your apartment--
You're a crack shot.

827
01:10:26,092 --> 01:10:29,835
I checked myself for holes.
There were just the usual ones.

828
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,898
You tricked them.
You were using blanks, right?

829
01:10:31,964 --> 01:10:35,878
Yes. I had to shoot you, Ryan.
Otherwise, they would have murdered you.

830
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:39,348
After searching for my family,
I discovered they're terrorists.

831
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:41,112
And now they're trying
to kill my father.

832
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:42,380
Your father?

833
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:46,617
Yes. I just found out my father is
the Secretary General of the U.N.

834
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:50,354
Right. Two can play at that game.
We'll set a trap. You stay here.

835
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:53,124
If they change their plans,
you get the word out right away.

836
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,299
If they realize I'm pretending to be
one of them, they may try to kill me.

837
01:10:57,356 --> 01:11:00,599
That's a chance I'll have to take.
Good luck.

838
01:11:02,328 --> 01:11:03,807
<i>Hmm.</i>

839
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:17,953
The Columbia Heights Jamboree
is proud to welcome...

840
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,887
...Mayor John Stopka...

841
01:11:19,946 --> 01:11:25,089
...and United Nations Secretary General,
Sir Robert McKintyre.

842
01:11:25,151 --> 01:11:28,997
Sir Robert, right after the drill team
you can begin your speech.

843
01:11:29,055 --> 01:11:30,329
Thank you, Mayor Stopka.

844
01:12:21,274 --> 01:12:22,878
<i>U t stops 1</i>

845
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:42,565
Ohh!

846
01:13:23,903 --> 01:13:25,678
Look out!
He's got a leg!

847
01:13:57,269 --> 01:13:58,907
Ryan!

848
01:14:01,607 --> 01:14:04,110
Oh, shit!

849
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:05,814
-Cass!
-Ryan!

850
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:07,824
-Come on, hurry. This way.
-All right, sir, this way.

851
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,089
-Come on, Daddy. Come with me.
-Daddy?

852
01:14:14,286 --> 01:14:17,096
Ohh!

853
01:14:17,156 --> 01:14:18,999
Get in! Get in!

854
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:27,600
Get in the bloody van!

855
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:29,942
Plan "B" a go.
"B" a go.

856
01:14:30,002 --> 01:14:33,176
It's Ryan, the bastard!
And McKintyre's with him.

857
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:38,453
Ryan, look out!

858
01:14:52,525 --> 01:14:56,530
Oh, my God, it's Sean!
He's got a gun! Go, go, go, go!

859
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,984
Kill him!

860
01:15:15,548 --> 01:15:17,289
Oh, no! A stinger!

861
01:15:20,052 --> 01:15:21,190
Get back!

862
01:15:21,253 --> 01:15:22,357
What a day!

863
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:36,475
Let's go!

864
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:38,437
That van over there!

865
01:15:40,272 --> 01:15:42,218
My gun! Come on.

866
01:15:44,276 --> 01:15:45,812
Quick! Over there.

867
01:15:45,878 --> 01:15:48,017
Move it. Quick now!

868
01:15:50,983 --> 01:15:53,987
Move it. Quick now!
Get down! Keep down!

869
01:15:54,053 --> 01:15:55,657
Quickly!
Get down! Get down!

870
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:59,259
There's plenty of room in there!
Get in there! Move it, move it!

871
01:16:52,978 --> 01:16:54,150
Damn!

872
01:16:56,015 --> 01:16:57,119
Come on!

873
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:03,597
Dr°P YOU!' guns!
Drop 'em!

874
01:17:03,656 --> 01:17:05,397
- What?

875
01:17:05,457 --> 01:17:06,595
Give 'em up!

876
01:17:40,225 --> 01:17:43,604
-Hey. Nice work.
-Good one.

877
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:46,805
Stay with me, people!

878
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,781
Laughrea!

879
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,115
Fergus Falls,
here's the one-armed...

880
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:03,490
...one-legged, one-eyed man!

881
01:18:03,549 --> 01:18:06,325
Are you frightened, punk?

882
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:08,160
Did I fire the last bullet...

883
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,359
...or is there is another one
in the chamber...

884
01:18:10,422 --> 01:18:11,799
...with your name on it?

885
01:18:11,857 --> 01:18:15,168
Does the thought of death
play with your mind?

886
01:18:15,227 --> 01:18:16,205
Punk?

887
01:18:16,261 --> 01:18:17,638
Do you...

888
01:18:17,696 --> 01:18:19,676
...gots to know?

889
01:18:19,732 --> 01:18:21,643
<i>Well...</i>

890
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,544
you got lucky.

891
01:18:24,603 --> 01:18:27,379
There are no more bullets
in the chamber.

892
01:18:29,141 --> 01:18:31,121
Whoops! My mistake!

893
01:18:32,978 --> 01:18:35,083
Well, Lauren...

894
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:37,491
you'll pay the highest price of all
where you're going.

895
01:18:37,549 --> 01:18:41,691
Those wet lips and hot kisses will be
falling on deaf ears for a long time.

896
01:18:41,754 --> 01:18:43,199
They're all yours, Falls.

897
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:47,328
Tied up tight, like a bride
on her honeymoon night.

898
01:18:47,393 --> 01:18:50,533
And so our tracks
have finally come together.

899
01:18:50,596 --> 01:18:53,702
It's time to drive the golden spike.

900
01:18:53,766 --> 01:18:58,340
Ryan Harrison, I say to you, on behalf
of law enforcement all over the world...

901
01:18:58,404 --> 01:19:00,680
...you were wrongfully accused.

902
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:05,154
<i>Hmm?</i>

903
01:19:08,213 --> 01:19:10,352
All right, people, move 'em out!

904
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,422
-Ryan!
-Cass!

905
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:30,941
Close your eyes.

906
01:19:31,003 --> 01:19:32,380
Now don't worry.

907
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:34,808
I trust you.

908
01:19:36,175 --> 01:19:38,280
Keep your eyes closed.

909
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:46,992
Now open your eyes.

910
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:50,056
I feel like I'm flying!

910
01:19:51,305 --> 01:20:51,158

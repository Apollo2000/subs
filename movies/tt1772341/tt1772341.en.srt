00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,642
<i>My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.</i>

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,141
<i>Let's see. I'm nine feet tall.
I weigh 643 pounds.</i>

3
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,314
<i>Got a little bit of a temper on me.</i>

4
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,108
<i>My passion bubbles
very near the surface,</i>

5
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,151
<i>I guess, not gonna lie.</i>

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,155
<i>Anyhoo, what else?</i>

7
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,958
<i>I'm a wrecker. I wreck things.
Professionally.</i>

8
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,580
<i>I'm very good at what I do.
Probably the best I know.</i>

9
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,755
<i>The thing is, fixing
is the name of the game.</i>

10
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,507
<i>Literally,</i> Fix-It Felix, Jr.

11
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,708
<i>NICELANDERSI Fix it, Felix!</i>

12
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,349
<i>So, yeah, naturally,</i>

13
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,185
<i>the guy with the name
Fix-It Felix is the good guy.</i>

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,137
<i>He's nice enough as good guys go.</i>

15
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,143
<i>Definitely fixes stuff really well.</i>

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,359
<i>But, if you've got a magic hammer
from your father,</i>

17
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,028
<i>how hard can it be?</i>

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,364
<i>If he was a regular contractor
carpenter guy,</i>

19
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>I guarantee you would not be able</i>

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,035
<i>to fix the damage that I do as quickly.</i>

21
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,036
<i>And when Felix does
a good job, he gets a medal.</i>

22
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,245
<i>But are there medals for
wrecking stuff really well?</i>

23
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,205
<i>To that I say, "Ha!"</i>

24
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,924
<i>And, no, there aren't.</i>

25
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,221
<i>Thirty years I've been doing this</i>

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,099
<i>and I've seen a lot of
other games come and go.</i>

27
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,353
<i>Kind of sad. I think about
all those guys from Asteroids.</i>

28
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,809
<i>Boom! Gone. Centipede?</i>

29
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,732
<i>Who knows where
that guy is, you know?</i>

30
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,811
<i>Look, a steady arcade gig
is nothing to sneeze at.</i>

31
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,020
<i>I'm very lucky.</i>

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,482
<i>It's just, I got to say,</i>

33
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,113
<i>it becomes kind of hard to love your job</i>

34
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,446
<i>when no one seems to
like you for doing it.</i>

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,706
All clear! The arcade is closed!

36
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,378
Shoryuken!

37
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,458
Whoo! What a day! You want to
head to Tappers, Ken?

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,004
If you're buying, buddy.

39
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,134
Quitting time!

40
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,860
<i>I</i> don't know.

41
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,483
<i>Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way</i>

42
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,606
<i>if things were different after work.</i>

43
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,067
<i>But it is what it is.</i>

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,242
Good job, everyone!

45
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,820
<i>Felix and the Nicelanders</i>

46
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,788
<i>go hang out in their homes</i>

47
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,457
<i>which he's just fixed,
and everyone, you know...</i>

48
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,330
<i>They go to their homes, I go to mine</i>

49
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,295
<i>which happens to be a dump.</i>

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,050
<i>And when I say "a dump,".</i>

51
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,469
<i>I don't mean like a shabby place.</i>

52
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,047
<i>I mean an actual dump,</i>

53
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,307
<i>where the garbage goes</i>

54
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,682
<i>and a bunch of bricks
and smashed building parts...</i>

55
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,350
<i>That's what I call home.</i>

56
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,641
<i>I guess I can't bellyache too much.</i>

57
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,309
<i>I got my bricks, I got my stump.</i>

58
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,401
<i>It looks uncomfortable.
It's actually fine. I'm good.</i>

59
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:01,663
<i>But if I'm really honest with myself...</i>

60
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,505
<i>I see Felix up there
getting patted on the back,</i>

61
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,668
<i>people are giving him pie
and thanking him</i>

62
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,838
<i>and so happy to see him all the time.</i>

63
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,098
Sometimes I think...

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,353
Man, it sure must be nice
being the good guy.

65
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,725
Nice share, Ralph.

66
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,189
As fellow bad guys,

67
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,690
we've all felt what you're feeling

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,196
and we've come to terms with it.

69
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,731
- Really?
- Right here.

70
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,824
I am Zangief. I am bad guy.

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,119
- Hi, Zangief!
- Hi, Zangief.

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,239
I relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom,

73
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,873
I was crushing man's skull

74
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,701
like sparrow egg between my thighs.

75
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,960
And I think, "Why do you have
to be so bad, Zangief?"

76
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,542
"Why can't you be more like good guy?"

77
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,211
Then I have moment of clarity.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,217
If Zangief is good guy,

79
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,256
who'll crush man's skull

80
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,554
like sparrow's egg between thighs?

81
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,811
And I say, "Zangief, you are bad guy",

82
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,269
"but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy."

83
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,400
Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there.

84
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,981
- Zombie! Bad guy!
- Hi, Zombie.

85
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,399
Hi, Zombie.

86
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,948
Zangief saying
labels not make you happy.

87
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,242
Good! Bad!

88
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,742
You must love you.

89
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,161
- Yeah! Inside here!
- Yes.

90
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,331
Okay. All right, I get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

91
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,498
Question, Ralph.

92
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,130
We've been asking you
to Bad-Anon for years now

93
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,300
and tonight you finally show up.

94
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,181
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

95
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,599
I just felt like coming.

96
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,012
I suppose it has
something to do with the fact that...

97
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,307
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

98
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,308
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.

99
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,647
Thanks, Satan.

100
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,271
It's Sateen, actually.

101
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,565
Got it. But here's the thing.

102
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,035
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

103
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,500
You can't mess with
the program, Ralph.

104
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,244
You're not going Turbo, are you?

105
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,672
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!

106
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,672
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

107
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,711
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?

108
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,509
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?

109
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,972
Yes!

110
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,973
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.

111
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,017
But we can't change who we are.

112
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,375
And the sooner you accept that,

113
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,814
the better off your game
and your life will be.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,109
Hey. One game at a time, Ralph.

115
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,729
Let's close out with
the Bad Guy Affirmation.

116
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm bad, and that's good.

117
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,161
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

118
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,543
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

119
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,587
Okay, gang, see you next week.

120
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,585
Listen, I can't do
snacks next week.

121
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,208
Hang in there, Ralph.

122
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,728
Hey, Zombie,
don't forget your hatchets.

123
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,882
There you go.

124
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,275
Step aside, sir. Random security check.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,448
Random my behind!
You always stop me.

126
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,787
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

127
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,577
- Name?
- Lara Croft.

128
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,249
- Name?
- Wreck-It Ralph!

129
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,746
And where are you coming from?

130
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,203
Pac-Man.

131
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,707
Did you bring any fruit with you?

132
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,289
No! No. No fruit.

133
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,775
Okay, then. Where are you heading?

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,837
<i>Fix-ll' Felix Jr.</i>

135
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,759
- Anything to declare?
- I hate you.

136
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,587
I get that a lot. Proceed.

137
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,721
Bad guy coming!

138
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,062
<i>If you leave your game,</i>

139
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,106
<i>stay safe, stay alert,</i>

140
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,559
<i>and whatever you do, don't die.</i>

141
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,815
<i>Because if you die
outside your own game</i>

142
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,438
<i>you don't regenerate.</i>

143
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,273
<i>Ever. Game over.</i>

144
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,501
Here you go, buddy.

145
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,672
It's fresh. Straight from Pac-Man's.

146
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,294
Hang in there, guys.

147
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,796
Name?

148
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,515
<i>Celebrate good times Come on!</i>

149
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,996
"Happy 30th Anniversary"?

150
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,423
They're having a party without me.

151
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,922
Pas-Man? They invited Pac-Man?

152
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,427
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher

153
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,929
isn't even part of this game!

154
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,802
Great party, Felix.

155
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,262
Why, thank you, friend.

156
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,222
Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!

157
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,272
Whoo!

158
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,199
Fix-It Felix!
Whoo-whoo! Fix-It Felix!

159
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,026
I'll bet that's Mario.

160
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,454
Fashionably late, per the norm.

161
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,072
I'll get it, Felix.

162
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:20,912
It's Ralph!

163
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,173
- He'll wreck the party!
- Hide the stemware!

164
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,250
Get rid of him, Felix.

165
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,049
Right. I'll go talk to him.

166
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,721
Carry on, everyone.

167
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
Ralph, can I help you?

168
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,552
Hey, Felix.
Just wanted to check on you.

169
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,603
I saw a big explosion

170
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,064
or something go over the building there.

171
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,813
Those were just fireworks.

172
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,311
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

173
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,108
Somebody's birthday, or...

174
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,442
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

175
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,161
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

176
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,204
What? Is that today?

177
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,406
I know!

178
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,911
I'm such a dummy with dates.

179
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,293
Anyway, congratulations.

180
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,542
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.

181
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,509
Hi. Just a heads-up, Felix.

182
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,636
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

183
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,555
- Hey, Glen.
- Ralph.

184
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,689
Cake'? Heard about this cake stuff.

185
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:21,973
Never had it.

186
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,441
No one ever seems to throw it out

187
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,796
so it never ends up in the dump.

188
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,441
I never actually tasted it.

189
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,274
I've always wanted to try cake.

190
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,109
I don't suppose you'd like to

191
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,786
come in and have a slice, would you?

192
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,288
Hey-o, everybody!

193
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,755
I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.

194
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,630
- Now, you all know Ralph.
- Evening.

195
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,214
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana...

196
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,140
- Deanna.
- Big Gene!

197
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,596
Why is he here?

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,848
He's just here for a slice of cake.

199
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,721
And I'm a big part of the game,

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,306
technically speaking.

201
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,142
Why are you here, Gene?

202
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,685
Look! The cake!

203
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,108
Well, I'll be dipped. You've
really outdone yourself, Mary.

204
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,660
And look!
There's all of us at the top.

205
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,076
Each apartment
is everyone's favorite flavor.

206
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,828
Norvvood's is red velvet.

207
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:21,908
Guilty!

208
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,499
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene,

209
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,046
- and for Felix...
- Hey, Mary.

210
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,464
Um...

211
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,668
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

212
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,675
Chocolate.

213
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,265
I've never been real fond of chocolate.

214
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,180
Well, I did not know that.

215
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,468
One other little thing.

216
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,101
I hate to be picky,
but this angry little guy here...

217
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,148
- My cake!
- ...might be a lot happier

218
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,602
if you put him up here
with everyone else.

219
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,858
See that? Look at that smile.

220
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,022
No, no. You see, Ralph,

221
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,200
there's no room for you up here.

222
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,779
What about this?
We can make room.

223
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,577
Here. We could take turns. Easy.

224
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,534
How about we just eat the cake?

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,995
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof

226
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,046
because he's about to get his medal!

227
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,420
Then how about we just take that medal

228
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,838
and give it to Ralph for once?

229
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,544
Would that be
the end of the world, Gene?

230
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,387
Now you're just being ridiculous.

231
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,173
Only good guys win medals,

232
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,805
and you, sir, are no good guy.

233
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,344
I could be a good guy if I wanted to,

234
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,519
and I could win a medal!

235
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,518
And when you do,
come and talk to us.

236
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,313
Then would you finally let me be
on top of the cake with you guys?

237
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,435
If you won a medal,

238
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,437
we'd let you live
up here in the penthouse!

239
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,485
But it will never happen

240
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,655
because you're just the bad guy
who wrecks the building.

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,322
No, I'm not.

242
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,574
Yes, you are!

243
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,322
No, I'm not!

244
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,921
Yes, you are.

245
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,096
All right, Gene. You know what?

246
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,673
I'm going to win a medal.

247
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,262
Lam going to win a medal!

248
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,269
The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen!

249
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,772
A medal that will be so good

250
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,854
that it will make Felix's
medals wet their pants!

251
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,529
And good night!
Thank you for the party.

252
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,273
- Is he serious?
- Please!

253
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,534
Where's a bad guy
going to win a medal?

254
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,657
Of course he's not serious.

255
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,164
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

256
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,866
That's why I came
straight here, Tapper.

257
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,451
You've never given me a bum steer.

258
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,289
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

259
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,628
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.

260
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,339
Come on. You know people.
There's got to be...

261
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,635
Tapper, I need a root beer.

262
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,213
Coming! Hold that thought.

263
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,972
Okay. As you were saying.

264
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,104
I was saying,
I can't spend another 3O years

265
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,526
living alone in the garbage.

266
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,444
I'm not going back without a medal.

267
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,085
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

268
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,449
Maybe somebody left a medal here.

269
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,780
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

270
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,529
Okay, let's see what we got here.

271
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,831
Shoo! Shoo! Go on, get out of here.

272
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,785
Mushroom? No.

273
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,420
What is this? No.

274
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,459
Come on, Zangief! Gross.

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,502
On.

276
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,179
What am I doing?

277
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,925
- Hey, excuse you!
- We are humanity's last hope.

278
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,556
Our mission? Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

279
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,889
We are humanity's last hope.

280
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,603
You okay there, space cadet?

281
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,481
We've only been plugged in a week

282
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,064
and every day it's,
"Climb the building, then fight bugs."

283
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,525
"Climb the building, fight more bugs!"

284
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,821
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

285
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,948
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.

286
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,321
It's tough all over, all right?

287
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,248
And all for what? A lousy medal?

288
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,039
Medal? You win a medal?

289
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,912
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.

290
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,921
Ooh. Is it shiny?

291
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,673
Pretty shiny.

292
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,798
- Ooh! And it says "hero" on it?
- Yeah.

293
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,221
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

294
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,972
- And fighting bugs!
- Right, bugs.

295
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,592
Is there any chance I could go
with you to your game

296
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,852
and maybe get one of those medals?

297
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,770
- Negatory.
- Does that mean maybe?

298
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,057
No! Look, only the bravest

299
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,064
and the best serve in our corps.

300
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,152
Bug!

301
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,198
We are humanity's last hope.

302
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,750
Attention!

303
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,457
<i>The arcade will open in five minutes.</i>

304
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,463
<i>Please report to your games.</i>

305
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,172
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?

306
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,718
Smells like Ralph in here.

307
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,809
Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

308
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,765
Hero's something.

309
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,149
<i>Duty. Hero's Duty.</i>

310
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,434
There it is.

311
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,571
Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph.

312
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,159
Shh!

313
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,873
The wall.

314
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,050
Morning, kids. Come on in.

315
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,503
Good to see you.
Good to see you. You, too, little fella.

316
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,019
<i>Quarter alert! Quarter alert!</i>

317
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,095
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

318
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,931
Ooh! Sweet golden medal!

319
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,485
<i>On a planet with no name</i>

320
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,659
<i>a top-secret experiment
has gone horribly wrong.</i>

321
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,783
<i>You are humanity's last hope.</i>

322
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,288
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting!

323
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,789
All right.

324
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,796
Now listen up, because
I'm only going to say this once.

325
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,466
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.

326
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,086
If you want to go pee-pee
in your big-boy slacks,

327
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,465
keep it to yourself.

328
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,968
It's make your mamas proud time!

329
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,306
<i>I love my mama!</i>

330
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,051
Heads up! First-person shooter,

331
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,226
coming through!

332
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,804
Ooh, robot!

333
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,013
Boop, boop, boop.

334
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,229
Game play in three, two, one.

335
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,229
<i>We are humanity's last hope.</i>

336
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,314
<i>Our mission?</i>

337
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,234
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

338
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,573
You ready, rookie? Let's find out.

339
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,698
Sweet Mother Hubbard!

340
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,292
No, no, no! Wait a second! Aah!

341
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,837
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie.

342
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,929
No, no! Wait, wait!

343
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,476
Watch it, rookie! These monsters
become what they eat.

344
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,688
My gun! Give me that back.

345
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,612
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!

346
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,734
No!

347
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,378
Something's coming out of their bottom!

348
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,365
<i>- Gross!
- Markowski!</i>

349
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,041
<i>Get back in formation!</i>

350
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,997
<i>All right, ladies,</i>

351
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,626
<i>the kitten whispers
and tickle fights stop now.</i>

352
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,456
The entrance to the lab
is straight ahead.

353
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,337
- I'll meet you guys inside!
- No!

354
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,586
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

355
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,556
I thought this was going
to be like Centipede!

356
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,598
When did video games
become so violent and scary?

357
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,975
<i>Please, get me out of here!</i>

358
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,689
Take her!

359
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,020
What a rip-off!

360
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,150
Get off me! It's game over. Stop it!

361
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,863
Beacon up!

362
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,835
Cease fire! Cease fire!

363
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,343
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Return to start positions.</i>

364
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,175
<i>Return to start positions.</i>

365
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,558
Here, let me help you. Sorry about that.

366
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,518
Yeah, you must be upset.

367
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,436
- Markowski.
- Who?

368
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:25,107
Whoa! Yeah, me. I'm Markowski.

369
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,150
What's the first rule of Hero's <i>Duty?</i>

370
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,771
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

371
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,900
Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

372
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,824
Ourjob is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

373
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,496
so they can get a medal, and that's it!

374
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,620
So stick to the program, soldier!

375
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,700
Right. Right. Aye, aye.

376
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,410
Quarter alert! Quarter <i>alen'!</i>

377
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,246
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!

378
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,673
Yeah, right.
No way I'm going through that again.

379
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,681
So that's where they
keep the medal?

380
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,521
"New racers daily."

381
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,727
Sweet! I got next game.

382
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,853
Go away, kid!

383
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,518
We're going to play
all nine of today's racers!

384
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,602
Yeah!

385
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,945
Sorry.

386
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,711
Where's the wrecking guy?

387
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,632
Where's Ralph? He should be
wrecking the building.

388
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,801
Shh! Stick with the program.

389
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,049
<i>Fix</i> if, <i>Felix!</i>

390
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,398
Ralph! Quarter alert! Game on!

391
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,482
Do something, Felix!

392
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,197
Just act natural. I'll fix it.

393
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,074
Ralph! Ralph!

394
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,374
What the...

395
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,624
Ralph? Ralph!

396
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,757
My land! Where is he?

397
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,176
Mr. Litwak!

398
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,799
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

399
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,255
The game's busted.

400
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,934
<i>I can fix it! I can fix it!</i>

401
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,055
MR. LITWAKI Boy.

402
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,138
Looks like the game's
gone cuckoo, like my nana.

403
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,978
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.

404
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,400
But what about the game?

405
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,398
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow...

406
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,605
But if he can't fix it, it might be time

407
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,857
to put old Ralph and Felix
out to pasture.

408
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,195
Like my nana.

409
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,373
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're out of order.

410
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,254
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed!

411
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,256
They're going to pull our plug!

412
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,175
Okay, everybody, calm down.

413
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,267
Ralph probably fell asleep

414
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,889
in the washroom of Tapper's again.

415
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,479
See? There he is now.

416
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,026
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?

417
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,367
What's he saying, Felix?

418
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,286
Stand by. My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.

419
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,174
Ralph's gone Turbo!

420
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,525
Ooh!

421
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,777
Shiny.

422
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,573
<i>Attention!
The arcade is now closed.</i>

423
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,071
Did you get a load of Markowski?

424
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,152
Shut your chew holes.

425
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,071
Cy-Bug.

426
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,419
Taste it!

427
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,509
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.

428
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,184
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr., ma'am.

429

00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,900
Look at that high definition. Your face!

432
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,406
It's amazing!

433
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,993
Flattery don't charge
these batteries, civilian.

434
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,411
Now, state your business.

435
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,414
I'm looking for my colleague,
Wreck-it Ralph?

436
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,207
Never heard of him.

437
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,577
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.

438
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,172
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.

439
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,383
That came from the tower.

440
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,442
Nice eggs. Nice e995!

441
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,236
Okay. That was easy.

Hello.

Man, you scared me, kid.
I nearly soiled myself.

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,343
You probably want to stand back.

485
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,341
In fact, this whole area

486
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,797
is technically closed
while we're trimming.

487
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,848
- Who's "we"?
- Candy tree department.

488
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,767
Where is everybody else?

489
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,269
It's just me today.

490
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,722
So you just meant like the royal "we"?

491
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,848
Yep. That's right.

492
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,730
Hey, are you a hobo?

493
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,946
No. I'm not a hobo, but I am busy.

494
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,365
Okay? So you go home.

495
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,238
What's that? Didn't hear you.

496
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,536
Your breath is so bad
it made my ears numb.

497
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,779
Listen, I tried to be nice.

498
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,240
I tried to be nice.

499
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,866
- You're mimicking me.
- You're mimicking me!

500
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,834
_Ql<ay-_Qkay.

501
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,413
That is rude,
and this conversation is over.

502
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,248
And this conversation is over.

503
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,215
I wouldn't grab that branch
if I were you.

504
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,092
I'm from the candy tree department,
so I know what...

505
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,672
It's a double stripe.

506
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,890
Double stripes break. Guh-doy!

507
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,480
Why are your hands so freakishly big?

508
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,433
I don't know. Why are you
so freakishly annoying'?

509
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,023
Why are you so freakishly...

510
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,571
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin!

511
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,331
Don't even think about it. That is mine.

512
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,741
- Race you for it!
- Hey!

513
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,528
I don't have to race for it
because it's mine!

514
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,612
- Double stripe!
- Come back here!

515
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,872
- The winner!
- Give it back! Give it!

516
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,995
Whoa!

517
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,953
Double stripe.

518
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,879
Thank you!

519
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,341
Wait! Let me talk to you for one second.

520
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,548
Okay. Here's the thing.

521
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,223
I'm not from the candy tree department.

522
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,099
Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph.

523
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,185
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal!

524
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,642
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!

525
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,230
It's precious to me.

526
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,188
That thing is my ticket to a better life.

527
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,486
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.

528
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,484
- What the...
- See you, chump!

529
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,203
Come back! I'll find you!

530
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,035
I will find you!

531
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,156
Double stripe!

532
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,041
Nowhere to hide!

533
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,707
Yeah, he banged around in here
like some kind of hot shot,

534
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,339
then he went barreling down
into that sweet little game

535
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,090
like a crazy person.

536
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,842
<i>"Sugar Rush. ".</i>

537
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,931
Cy-Bugs would chew up that game

538
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,678
faster than a chicken hawk
in a coop of crippled roosters.

539
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,930
- What was that, now?
- What are you, thick?

540
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,147
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!

541
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,268
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?

542
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,232
I can't say that I do, ma'am.

543
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,318
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.

544
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,899
They don't know they're in a game.

545
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,985
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.

546
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,828
Without a beacon to stop them,

547
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,826
<i>they'll consume Sugar Rush.</i>

548
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,428
But do you think they'll stop there?

549
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,749
- Yes!
- Wrong!

550
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,703
Viruses do not stop!

551
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,418
Once those Cy-Bugs
finish off Sugar <i>Rush,</i>

552
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,584
they'll invade every other game
until this arcade

553
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:03,514
is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

554
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,304
Kohut! My cruiser.

555
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,265
Jeepers. Is she always this intense?

556
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,065
It's not her fault.

557
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,236
She's programmed with
the most tragic back-story ever.

558
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,647
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check...

559
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,949
<i>Her wedding day.</i>

560
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,675
Wait, ma'am! I'm going with you.

561
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,673
Like fun you are, short stack.

562
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,255
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

563
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,012
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

564
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,060
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks.

565
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,888
And I cannot ask you

566
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,015
to risk your life cleaning up his mess.

567
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,145
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.

568
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,943
<i>Citizens of Sugar Rush...</i>

569
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,820
Just in time.

570
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:47,447
<i>All hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.</i>

571
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,825
<i>Hello, my royal subjects!</i>

572
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,282
<i>Ha-ha! Have some candy!</i>

00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,045
<i>Thank you for that
stirring introduction, Sour Bill.</i>

00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,046
<i>And thank you to today's avatars.</i>

575
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,090
<i>It was a wonderful day of racing. It was.</i>

576
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,887
<i>But now the arcade is closed,</i>

577
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,216
<i>so it's time to wipe the slate clean</i>

578
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,801
<i>and race to decide our new roster.</i>

579

<i>The first nine racers
across that finish line</i>

580

582
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,988
<i>Okay, calm down.</i>

00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,994
<i>Listen! This event is pay-to-play.</i>
<i>We all know this.</i>

584
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,662
<i>The fee to compete is one gold coin</i>

585
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,781
<i>from your previous winnings,</i>

<i>if you've ever won, which I have.</i>

We're not going to hurt you,

Get back here!

<i>Careful! What are you doing?</i>

Good, the cops. She went that way!

618
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,043
- Hold still!

619

<i>We'll repair all the damage.</i>

<i>Don't worry. We will have our race
before the arcade opens.</i>

And I'm in it. Yes!

626
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,902
There's no way that
I am racing with a glitch.

627

Rancis, Candlehead, come on.

628
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,617
Sour Bill, that glitch
cannot be allowed to race!

629
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,915
And bring that thing to my castle.

630
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,750
Guys! She took...

631
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,543
<i>Or-e-Oreo!</i>

<i>Or-e-</i>

Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster

634
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,818
so we can see
what we're up against here.

635
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,066
Kay.

636
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,987
Milk my duds! It's Wreck-It Ralph?

637
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,078
Yeah. Who are you,
the guy that makes the donuts?

638
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,199
Please. No. I'm King Candy!

639
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,708
I see you're a fan of pink.

640
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,040
Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously...

641
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,750
What are you doing here?

642
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:14,043
Look, Your Candiness,
this is just a big misunderstanding.

643
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,760
Just get me out of this cupcake,

644
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,879
I'll get my medal,
and I'll be out of your way.

645
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,759
Your medal?
Bad guys don't win medals.

646
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,385
Well, this one did.

647
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,387
I earned it over in Hero's <i>Duty.</i>

648
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,513
You game-jumped?

649
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,224
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?

650
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,684
What? No, no.

651
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,320
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

652
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,864
and take over my game,
you've got another thing coming!

653
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,658
Easy, Your Puffiness.

654
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,360
It's not my fault one of your children

655
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,286
of the candy corn stole my medal.

656
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,618
"Children of the candy corn"? Who'd...

657
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,373
The Glitch!

658
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,831
The coin she used to
buy her way into the race.

659
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,957
That was your medal?

660
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,297
She did what? I need that back!

661
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,174
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.

662
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,719
It's nothing but code now.

663
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,839
It will stay that way
until someone wins the cup

664
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,265
at the end of the race.

665
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,642
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk

666
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,851
with the winner then.

667
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,804
Is that a threat I smell?

668
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:12,526
Beyond the halitosis
you so obviously suffer from.

669
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,070
Listen, Nilly-Wafer,
I'm not leaving without my medal!

670
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,647
Yes, you are.

671
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,658
Wynnchel, Duncan,
get him out of that cupcake

672
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,535
and on the first train back home.

673
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,954
If I ever see you here again,
Wreck-It Ralph,

674
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,657
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

675
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,871
Fungeon?

676
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,711
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

677
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,417
It's the...

678
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,926
Never mind! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

679
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,805
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.

680
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,434
This thing is hard as a rock.

681
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,557
I can see that.

682
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,058
- Get the tools.
- What tools?

683
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,640
Quiet, you!

684
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,730
What? No!

685
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,569
- Take it easy, big boy!
- Stay away from me!

686
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,691
He's getting away!

687
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,161
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

688
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,387
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

689
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,183
I got to get my medal back.

690
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,806
The pot goes to the winning racer!

691
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,018
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

692
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,538
Hello, fellow racers!

693
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,582
It's that little crumb snatcher.

694
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,373
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

695
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,038
Came by to check out
the competition?

696
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,049
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

697
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,217
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

698
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,544
<i>L</i> built it myself.

699
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,260
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

700
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,507
Check her out.

701
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:16,191
Vanellope, it's so... You.

702
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,271
But you have to
back out of the race. Yeah.

703
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,988
No, I don't,

704
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,862
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

705
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,118
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

706
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,121
Yeah, well, King Candy says
glitches can't race.

707
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,708
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

708
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,743
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

709
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,709
To protect us. Say I'm you.

710
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,545
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

711
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,218
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

712
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,300
And then, all of a sudden, no.

713
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,885
I'm glitching!

714
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,350
~See?

715
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,473
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

716
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,563
No! I glitched, too!

717
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,936
Uncool.

718
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,773
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

719
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,312
Please!

720
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,740
I just want to race like you guys.

721
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,281
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

722
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,446
And that's all you'll ever be!

723
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,116
Hey! Leave her alone!

724
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,793
Let's get out of here!

725
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,504
Scram, you rotten little cavities!

726
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,130
Before I throw you in the mud!

727
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,355
What are you looking at?

728
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,934
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

729
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,313
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.

730
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,069
I was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

731
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,492
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

732
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,535
Coin, medal, whatever.

733
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,326
Just go back to your own dumb game
and win another one.

734
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,745
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

735
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,497
I won it in Hero's Duty.

736
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,670
<i>Hero's Doodie?</i>

737
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,715
It's not that kind of duty.

738
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,880
I bet you really got to watch
where you step

739
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,220
<i>in a game called Hero's Doodie!</i>

740
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,890
What did you win the medal for, wiping?

741
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,516
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

742
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,021
- Listen!
- One more, one more.

743
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,524
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

744
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,686
- Say "why."
- Why?

745
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,859
Because it was his doodie!

746
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,778
How dare you insult Hero's <i>Duty?</i>

747
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,982
You little guttersnipe!

748
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,568
I earned that medal

749
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,036
and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

750
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,947
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

751
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,828
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

752
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,287
I can't help you!

753
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,424
What a moron.

754
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,344
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

755
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,887
You're never going to break...

756
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,559
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

757
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,893
Leave me alone.

758
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,231
Look, you want that medal,
right'? And I want to race.

759
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,062
So here's what I'm thinking.

760
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,445
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

761
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,577
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

762
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,284
You want me to help you?

763
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,749
All you got to do is
break something for me.

764
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,581
Come on. What do you say, friend?

765
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,287
We are not friends.

766
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,458
Come on, pal. You son of a gun.

767
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,968
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

768
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,466
Come on, chumbo.

769
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,049
Ralph, my man. My main man.

770
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,724
Hey!

771
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,141
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

772
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,732
You better win.

773
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,229
Well, I'll say this much,

774
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,781
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-it" for nothing.

775
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,533
There's the shuttle.

776
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,238
Is he in there?

777
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,283
Nope. Lucky for him.

778
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,957
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

779
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,622
No Cy-Bug, either.

780
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,422
Got to find it before it
lays its filthy eggs.

781
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,010
It came this way,

782
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,755
but the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

783
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,306
are jamming my sensor.

784
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,808
Can't get a read on it.

785
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,219
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

786
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,474
Why did he go AWOL?

787
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,097
I wish I knew, ma'am.

788
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,933
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

789
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,644
Going on about cake and medals...

790
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,696
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

791
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,027
"Go Turbo"?

792
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,947
That's right,
you guys just got plugged in.

793
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,492
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

794
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,412
<i>Turbo Time was by far
the most popular game.</i>

795
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,960
<i>- And Turbo...
- Turbo-tastic!</i>

796
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,667
<i>- He loved the attention.
- Turbo-tastic!</i>

797
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,712
<i>So, when RoadBlasters got plugged in</i>

798
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,254
<i>and stole Turbo's thunder...</i>

799
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,836
New game. All right!

800
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,845
<i>Boy, was he jealous.</i>

801
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,350
<i>So jealous that
he abandoned his game</i>

802
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,014
<i>and tried to take over the new one.</i>

803
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,308
These are
the greatest graphics I've ever seen!

804
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,514
<i>Turbo-tastic!</i>

805
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:10,359
Hey. Is that...
That looks like Turbo.

806
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,487
What's Turbo doing
in this game? Aw, come on!

807
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,068
Mr. Litwak!

808
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:19,828
<i>Turbo ended up
putting both games and himself</i>

809
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,202
<i>out of order, for good.</i>

810
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,409
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

811
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,411
chasing a cautionary tale.

812
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,913
I know, right?

813
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,627
That's why I have to get Ralph home

814
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,835
or the same thing's
gonna happen to my game.

815
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,010
What is this?

816
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,476
"Nesquik Sand"? Quicksand'?

817
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,393
I'll hop out
and grab you one of those vines.

818
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:56,277
I can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

819
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,523
We're going to drown here.

820
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,108
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

821
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,393
You're making us sink faster.

822
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,368
We're going to die!

823
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,946
Get ahold of yourself!

824
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,873
The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

825
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,380
They're attracted to
whatever makes them laugh.

826
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,923
Here, hit me again.

827
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,255
That's not funny enough. Harder!

828
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,988
Look, you're a nice guy. I can't...

829
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,759
No, ma'am!
The arcade is depending on us.

830
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,603
Now do your duty. That's an 0rd...

831
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,107
It's working! Hit me again.

832
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,067
Ooh, your eye.

833
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,105
I can fix it. Now...

834
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,109
San Fran-tastic! Again!

835
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,444
You mean business!

836
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,452
Yikes on bikes!

837
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,248
Wow! We're... killing... them!

838
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,628
Comedy gold!

839
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,486
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.

840
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,234
We've got work to do. Let's go.

841
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,655
We lost the Cy-Bug.

842
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,581
Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

843
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,330
You think you can fix that shuttle?

844
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,453
Can do.

845
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,269
Shh!

846
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,613
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open!

847
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,612
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

848
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,534
Hey, we shook on it.

849
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,997
Thank you, Jeeves.

850
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,207
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

851
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,458
You gotta make one.

852
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,709
What? No, no.

853
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,707
Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me.

854
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,880
I don't make things. I break things.

855
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,049
Well, it looks like
you're going to be stepping outside

856
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,550
your comfort zone, then, Gladys.

857
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,348
Ooh, this is a good one!

858
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,477
<i>Welcome to the bakery!
Let's bake a kart!</i>

859
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,141
What is this, another game?

860
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,472
Yeah, well, it's a mini-game.

861
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,186
<i>You have one minute to win it.</i>

862
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,645
- What?
- Come on, Ralph!

863
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,564
<i>Go! Mixing.</i>

864
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,312
<i>Put the ingredients in the bowl</i>

865
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,863
<i>and throw away the trash.</i>

866
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,194
Hairbrush. No!

867
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,317
Underpants. No, no!

868
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,001
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.

869
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,700
I'm trying!

870
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,078
Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes.

871
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,918
Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes.

872
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,170
<i>Batter up!</i>

873
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,754
Come on!
No sleeping on the job!

874
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,677
<i>Baking! Pump up the heat</i>

875
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,724
<i>and hold the perfect temperature.</i>

876
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,385
Ralph, a little help here?

877
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,511
I'm on it.

878
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,440
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

879
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,519
Okay, good. Little more.

880
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,780
Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.

881
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,111
Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!

882
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,867
- Decorating!
- Wheels first.

883
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,281
- How many?
- Four, doy!

884
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,456
Got it.

885
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,043
Now frosting. A buttload of frosting!

886
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,119
No problem.

887
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,477
<i>Time's up! Congratulations.</i>

888
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,514
<i>You did it, and here's your cart!</i>

889
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:11,741
Look, kid... I tried to warn you.

890
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,826
I can't make things. I just break...

891
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,407
I love it.

892
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:17,992
You do?

893
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,661
I love it.

894
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,829
I love it! I love it! I love it!

895
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,669
Look, it's got a real engine!

896
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,166
And look at these wheels.

897
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,845
I love it! I finally have a real cart!

898
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,516
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

899
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,137
Cream puffs.

900
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,196
This is Beard Papa.

901
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,024
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!

902
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,285
What? You have teeth?

903
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,708
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

904
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:03,667
I'm not smiling. I was... I'm gassy, okay?

905
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,710
Hold it right there, Glitch!

906
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,886
And Wreck-It Ralph?

907
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,011
Start the cart! Start the cart!

908
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,436
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

909
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,939
I don't know how to drive a real cart.

910
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,399
You don't what?

911
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,896
Are you hurt, Sire?

912
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,237
No, he just glazed me. Get them!

913
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,110
Gangway!

914
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,163
Stop, in the name of the king!
That's me!

915
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,251
Get off the road!

916
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,463
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!

917
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,178
- Drive into the wall!
- What?

918
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,009
Right there, between
the two sugar-free lollipops!

919
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,266
- Are you crazy?
- Just do it!

920
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,698
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

921
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,407
Find that glitch! Destroy that cart!

922
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,871
She can't be allowed to race!

923
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:32,544
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

924
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,424
Well, no, not technically.

925
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,346
- I just thought that...
- What did you think?

926
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,429
"I'll just magically win the race"

927
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,976
"just because I really want to!"

928
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,433
Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer.

929
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,480
I can feel it in my code.

930
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,068
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

931
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,731
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

932
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:54,857
The big whoop?

933
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,318
Well, this may come as
a shock to you, but in my game,

934
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,745
I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage.

935
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,871
- Cool.
- No. Not cool.

936
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,783
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.

937
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:09,206
And that crummy medal
was going to change all that.

938
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,248
I go home with that baby
around my neck

939
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,333
and I'll get a penthouse. Pies.

940
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,962
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

941
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,174
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

942
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,842
No, I get it!

943
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,178
That's exactly
what racing would do for me!

944
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,683
- Well, guess what?
- What?

945
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,812
News flash! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

946
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,445
What was that?

947
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,667
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

948
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,717
Whoa!

949
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,515
You got to watch out for the splash.

950
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,342
That stuff is broiling hot.

951
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,972
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

952
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,395
What is this dump?

953
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,184
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

954
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,235
Yeah. It's pretty cool?

955
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,818
I found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

956
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,612
See? Look, look, look.

957
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,619
Welcome to my home!

958
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,196
I sleep in these candy wrappers.

959
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,283
I bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

960
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,789
By yourself?

961
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,747
With all this garbage around you?

962
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,799
Well, yeah.

963
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,052
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just a mistake

964
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,174
and that I wasn't
even supposed to exist.

965
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,839
What do you expect?

966
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,387
Listen, kid...

967
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,803
I know it's none of m business
<i>Y</i>

968
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:49,597
but why do you even
stick around this game?

969
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,849
You really don't know anything, do you?

970
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,230
Glitches can't leave their games.

971
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,027
It's one of the joys of being me.

972
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,408
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

973
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,586
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.

974
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,038
If you're going to be a racer,

975
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,801
you're going to have
to learn how to drive.

976
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,675
And you can't do that without a track.

977
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,381
Whoa!

978
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,970
All right, now.

979
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,722
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

980
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,350
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

981
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:31,772
Wait. Do you know how to drive?

982
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,932
Yeah! I mean, I haven't done it, but...

983
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,650
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?

984
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,773
You crashed it.

985
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,483
Just get in. How hard can it be?
Okay...

986
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,323
Start it up.

987
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,197
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

988
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,119
- Pedals.
- Pedals. Right.

989
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:53,878
Now, that's the go pedal.

990
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:58,003
That I believe is the stopper.

991
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,001
And this... Wait.

992
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,591
What is this? That doesn't do anything.

993
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,297
Ooh, what does this joystick do?

994
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,017
Okay, good. Let's try that again.

995
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,512
<i>I've been looking
for a driver who's qualified.</i>

996
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,389
<i>So if you think that you're the one.</i>

997
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,808
<i>To step into my ride.</i>

998
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,643
<i>I'm a fine-tuned supersonic
speed machine.</i>

999
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,904
<i>With a sunroof top and a gangster lean.</i>

1000
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,660
<i>So if you feel me
let me know, know, know.</i>

1001
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,622
<i>So start me up
and watch me go, go, go, go.</i>

1002
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,246
<i>Get you where you wanna go
If you know what I mean.</i>

1003
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,046
<i>Got a ride that's smoother
than a limousine</i>

1004
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,247
<i>'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five.</i>

1005
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,378
Now shift it.

1006
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,505
<i>Baby you got the keys.</i>

1007
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,461
That's good. Keep going! Shift it again!

1008
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,844
<i>Now shut up and drive
Drive, drive, drive</i>

1009
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,807
I told you, racing's in my code!

1010
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,559
<i>So if you feel me
let me know, know, know</i>

1011
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,399
I got that medal in the bag!

1012
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,644
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!

1013
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,317
<i>Get you where you wanna go
if you know what I mean.</i>

1014
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,031
<i>Got a ride that's smoother
than a limousine.</i>

1015
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,700
Whoo-hoo!

1016
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,653
<i>Cause I'm zero to 60 in three point five.</i>

1017
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:13,282
<i>Baby you got the keys.</i>

1018
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,167
- Look out!
- Whoa!

1019
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,501
<i>Shut up and drive.</i>

1020
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,591
Hot cola!

1021
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,891
<i>Now shut up and drive.</i>

1022
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,097
So how did I do?

1023
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,302
Um...

1024
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,680
Well, you almost blew up
the whole mountain.

1025
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,437
Right, right. That's a good note.

1026
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,693
You got to get that
glitch under control, kid.

1027
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,229
Okay, I will, I will.

1028
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,152
And then you think I got a chance?

1029
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,616
Um...

1030
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,034
TirlY-

1031
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,870
Yes, I'm going to win!

1032
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,913
I'm going to win! I'm going to win!

1033
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,866
- Top shelf.
- Top shelf.

1034
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,423
Did you find her?
Tell me you found her.

1035
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,429
You didn't?

1036
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,971
Go. Leave me.

1037
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,786
Up, up, down, down...

1038
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,664
Start!

1039
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,680
The code. It's the sweet
lifeblood of the game.

1040
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,354
Where are you? Let's see...
Stadium, no. Jumbotron.

1041
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:06,319
Ha-ha! There it is. The winner's cup.

1042
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,776
One of these things is
not like the others... It's you!

1043
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,702
We're going to give you
a nice new home.

1044
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,753
Success!

1045
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,503
Sour Bill, I'm going out.

1046
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,014
You're in charge of the castle
until I get back.

1047
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:46,977
Your face is still red.

1048
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,983
You might want to
hit it again with your hammer.

1049
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,736
That's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1050
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,617
That's just the honey glow
in my cheeks.

1051
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,452
Okay-

1052
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,866
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1053
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,580
You are one dynamite gal.

1054
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:08,628
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1055
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,255
One dynamite gal.

1056
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,464
Dynamite gal.

1057
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,926
Dynamite...

1058
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,686
Get out.

1059
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,639
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.

1060
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,266
I said get out!

1061
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,826
Jimineyjaminey.

1062
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,667
Yes?

1063
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:50,674
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game Fix-It Felix Jr.

1064
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,425
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1065
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,960
Wreck-It Ralph?

1066
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,758
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1067
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,931
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1068
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,258
Locked him up?

1069
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,220
I'm not making
the same mistake with you.

1070
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,651
<i>Hurry, hurry!
Let's go. Time's a-wastin'.</i>

1071
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,860
Come on, Ralph!

1072
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,896
This is it. This is really happening.

1073
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,276
I almost don't believe it.

1074
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,326
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1075
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,573
And now... Now I think
I'm going to puke, actually.

1076
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,030
I mean, I think I might puke.

1077
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,701
- You know, like a "vurp."
- A what?

1078
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,540
Vomit and a burp together,

1079
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,956
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1080
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,378
This is so exciting!

1081
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,255
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1082
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,458
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1083
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,668
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1084
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,179
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1085
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,637
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1086
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,390
- Because you're a winner.
- I'm a winner.

1087
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,310
- And you're adorable!
- I'm adorable!

1088
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,019
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1089
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,559
Yeah!

1090
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,857
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1091
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,982
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1092
01:02:56,064 --> 01:03:00,240
"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1093
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,696
- And have fun. Got it?
- Got it.

1094
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,197
Whoa!

1095
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,532
Wait!

1096
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,159
Hold on!

1097
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,244
Where are you going?

1098
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,246
I forgot something! I'll be right back!

1099
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:14,833
Kids.

1100
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,508
Ralph! There you are. Hello!

1101
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,845
- You!
- I come alone, unarmed.

1102
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,389
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1103
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,387
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1104
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,269
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1105
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,393
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1106
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,905
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1107
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,323
What do you want, Candy?

1108
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,901
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1109
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,953
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

1110
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,037
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1111
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,076
My medal. How did you...

1112
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,873
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1113
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:56,708
Whoa.

1114
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,840
All I ask is that you hear me out.

1115
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,379
About what?

1116
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,432
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1117
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,096
about being a king is?

1118
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,895
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1119
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,142
Get to the point.

1120
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,436
Point being, I need your help.

1121
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:17,146
Sad as it is, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1122
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,318
Why are you people so against her?

1123
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:22,576
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1124
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,448
If Vanellope wins that race

1125
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,618
<i>she'll be added to the race roster.</i>

1126
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,163
<i>Then gamers can choose her
as their avatar.</i>

1127
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,037
<i>And when they see her glitching</i>

1128
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,839
<i>and twitching and just being herself,</i>

1129
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,754
<i>they'll think our game is broken.</i>

1130
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,360
<i>We'll be put out of order for good.</i>

1131
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,761
<i>All my subjects will be homeless.</i>

1132
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:51,806
<i>But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.</i>

1133
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,524
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1134
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,064
<i>And when
the game's plug is pulled...</i>

1135
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,486
No!

1136
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,903
She'll die with it.

1137
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,072
You don't know that will happen.

1138
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,403
The gamers could love her.

1139
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,618
And if they don't?

1140
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,918
I know it's tough,

1141
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,217
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1142
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:27,007
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1143
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,511
So can I count on you to
talk a little sense into her?

1144
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,435
Very good.

1145
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,026
I'll give you two some time alone.

1146
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,553
I'm back!

1147
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,930
Did you miss me?

1148
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,102
Yeah... Can we talk for a second?

1149
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,262
Wait. First, kneel down.

1150
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,690
- What? No, we really...
- Will you just do it?

1151
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,558
Okay-

1152
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,733
- Now, close your eyes.
- Vanellope...

1153
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,155
Shush! Close them!

1154
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,323
Okay. Open them up.

1155
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,124
"To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.

1156
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,288
Turn it over.

1157
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,167
I made it for you.

1158
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,332
Just in case we don't win.

1159
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,801
Not that I think
there's even a remote chance

1160
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:45,923
we're not going to win.

1161
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,717
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1162
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:53,719
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1163
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,809
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1164
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,014
Um...

1165
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,813
- I've been thinking.
- That's dangerous.

1166
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,066
Who cares about
this stupid race anyway'? Right?

1167
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,614
That's not very funny, Ralph.

1168
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,775
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1169
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,984
to build the car and everything...

1170
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:13,158
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1171
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,786
Hello'? Ls Ralph in there?

1172
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,458
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1173
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,460
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1174
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:20,787
What?

1175
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,505
Why would you...

1176
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,384
Wait a minute.

1177
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,961
No!

1178
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,136
Where did you get this?

1179
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,219
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1180
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,800
I've been talking to King Candy.

1181
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,430
- King Candy?
- Yeah.

1182
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,807
You sold me out?

1183
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,690
No, ldidn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1184
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,061
No, I understand plenty. Traitor!

1185
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,472
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1186
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,856
You're a rat!

1187
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,397
And I don't need you, and
I can win the race on my own.

1188
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,232
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1189
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,075
Put me down! Let me go!

1190
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,318
No, you listen to me.

1191
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:53,403
Do you know what's going to happen

1192
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,487
when the players see you glitching?

1193
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,851
They'll think the game's broken.

1194
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,327
I don't care! You're a liar!

1195
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,913
You better care, because
if your game goes out of order,

1196
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:00,994
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1197
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,124
I'm not listening to you!

1198
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,002
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1199
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,416
No, you're not!

1200
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,050
Take me down from here, Ralph,
right now!

1201
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,381
No. I'm doing this for your own good!

1202
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:16,884
Wait, wait, wait.

1203
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,769
No. No.

1204
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,771
No, no, no, no, no!

1205
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,019
Please, Ralph!

1206
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,099
No!

1207
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,403
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1208
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,998
You really are a bad guy.

1209
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,707
Hello? Anybody home?

1210
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,455
Felix? Mary?

1211
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:30,421
Well, you actually went and did it.

1212
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,253
Gene. Where is everybody?

1213
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,008
They're gone.

1214
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:38,592
After Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back...

1215
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,011
Everyone panicked
and abandoned ship.

1216
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,137
But I'm here now.

1217
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,147
It's too late, Ralph.

1218
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,608
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.

1219
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,950
But never let it be said
that I'm not a man of my word.

1220
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,956
The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy.

1221
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,166
Gene, wait! Wait!

1222
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:15,049
Listen, this is not what I wanted!

1223
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,171
Well, what did you want, Ralph?

1224
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,636
I don't know. I just...

1225
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:25,647
I was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1226
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,647
Well, now you can live alone
in the penthouse.

1227
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,051
Hey, cough drop.

1228
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,388
Explain something to me.

1229
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,719
If Vanellope was never meant to exist,

1230
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,601
then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

1231
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,311
What's going on

1232
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,812
in this candy-coated heart of darkness?

1233
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:53,935
Nothing.

1234
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,061
- Talk!
- No.

1235
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,730
- I'll lick you.
- You wouldn't.

1236
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,611
0h, yeah?

1237
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,195
That's like sandpaper!

1238
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,902
Wonder how many
licks it will take

1239
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,328
to get to your center.

1240
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,913
I'll take it to my grave!

1241
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,247
Fair enough.

1242
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,920
They call you
Sour Bill for a reason.

1243
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,250
- Had enough yet?
- Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1244
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,968
Vanellope was a racer

1245
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,508
until King Candy
tried to delete her code!

1246
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,673
<i>Tried to delete her code?</i>

1247
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,760
<i>So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?</i>

1248
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,140
I don't know!

1249
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,391
Suit yourself.

1250
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,438
No, no, no! I swear I don't know!

1251
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,313
<i>He literally locked up our memories</i>

1252
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,605
<i>and I cannot remember!</i>

1253
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:36,985
<i>Nobody can!</i>

1254
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,813
But I do know this.

1255
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:40,778
He'll do anything
to keep her from racing.

1256
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,363
Because if she crosses the finish line,

1257
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:46,286
the game will reset and
she won't be a glitch anymore!

1258
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,613
Where is she now?

1259
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,101
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.

1260
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,283
Felix?

1261
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,164
I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear!

1262
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:56,456
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again!

1263
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,925
Stick around.

1264
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:03,175
Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you!

1265
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,969
Come on. I know you're out there.

1266
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,813
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!

1267
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,194
But... Where?

1268
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:39,466
Doomsday and Armageddon
just had a baby and it is ugly!

1269
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,510
Hello? Hello?

1270
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,882
Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out!

1271
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,056
What's he say?

1272
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,517
I'm gonna wreck it!

1273
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,361
Why do I fix everything I touch?

1274
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,147
On!

1275
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:03,648
Barn!

1276
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,234
- Felix!
- Ralph!

1277
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,528
I'm so glad to see you!

1278
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:12,241
Wait. No, I'm not. What do
you have to say for yourself!

1279
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,376
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!

1280
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,203
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1281
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,293
But you have to fix
this go-cart for me pronto.

1282
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,550
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1283
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,594
I'm just so, so cross with you!

1284
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,888
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1285
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,384
I ran higgledy-piggledy
all over creation looking for you.

1286
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,469
I almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!

1287
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,390
And then... I met the most dynamite gal.

1288
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:41,148
She gives me the honey glow
something awful.

1289
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,522
But she rebuffed my affections.

1290
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,778
And then I got thrown in jail!

1291
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:48,409
Felix, pull yourself together.

1292
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:52,280
No! You don't know
what it's like to be rejected

1293
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,078
and treated like a criminal!

1294
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,834
Yes, I do. That's every day of my life.

1295
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,911
It is?

1296
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,924
Which is why I ran off
and tried to be a good guy, but I'm not!

1297
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,801
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.

1298
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,213
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart.

1299
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:10,302
Please, Felix, fix it.

1300
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:13,893
And I promise I will never try
to be good again.

1301
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,794
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1302
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,422
- And?
- And a real numskull.

1303
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,341
- And'?
- A selfish diaper baby.

1304
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,543
And?

1305
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,466
And...

1306
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,676
A stinkbrain?

1307
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,763
The stinkiest brain ever.

1308
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,578
<i>My sweet subjects,</i>

1309
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,495
<i>I can without a pinch
of hesitation assure you</i>

1310
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,631
<i>that I have never been
so happy in all my life</i>

1311
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,004
<i>to say the following words,</i>

1312
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,429
<i>let the Random Roster Race
commence!</i>

1313
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:51,528
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.

1314
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,201
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1315
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,362
I'm already a real racer.

1316
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,200
And I'm going to win.

1317
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,273
Whoa!

1318
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,833
Have some candy.

1319
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:02,428
Behind you!

1320
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:04,771
In front of you!

1321
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,612
- It's The Glitch!
- The Glitch?

1322
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,243
Light them up, Candlehead.

1323
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,537
<i>What's this? Cherry bombs!</i>

1324
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:33,797
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1325
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,812
My candle!

1326
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,524
All right. Gotta keep it under control.

1327
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,154
No more glitching.

1328
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,278
Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing

1329
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,830
without any more surprises.

1330
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,125
Hope you're happy, junkpile.

1331
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,295
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1332
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,913
My lady, you came back.

1333
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,373
Can it, Fix-It!

1334
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,175
That Cy-Bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1335
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,212
No. It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I...

1336
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,850
Bullroar.

1337
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:33,444
Listen up, people. Head to
Game Central Station now!

1338
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,479
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1339
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,314
Go! Go! Go!

1340
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,657
No!

1341
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,916
Get off of my track!

1342
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,243
Hey!

1343
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,752
What, are you crazy!

1344
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,626
I forbid you to cross that finish line!

1345
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,470
Knock it off!

1346
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,508
Ralph, look!

1347
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,267
Kid!

1348
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,355
Stop it!

1349
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:54,433
I'm not letting you
undo all my hard work!

1350
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,112
Is that...

1351
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,782
No way!

1352
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:05,819
What the... Who are you?

1353
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:10,200
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!

1354
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,956
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1355
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,205
and that halitosis-riddled warthog

1356
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,040
take it away from me!

1357
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,672
Turbo-tastic.

1358
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,221
End Of the line, Glitch!

1359
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,383
Glitch. That's it.

1360
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,347
Come on, Vanellope.

1361
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,141
I know you said you wouldn't do it again

1362
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,314
but you're going to do it one more time.

1363
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,566
Just focus and concentrate

1364
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:38,811
and glitch!

1365
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,993
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it!

1366
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,078
No!

1367
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,585
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!

1368
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,847
No!

1369
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,645
Kid! Are you okay?

1370
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:21,194
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race!

1371
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,449
My land.

1372
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:27,284
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1373
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,453
But I didn't cross the finish line!

1374
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,371
There is no finish line!

1375
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,704
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1376
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,537
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1377
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,712
We got to try!

1378
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:43,880
Kid!

1379
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,382
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.

1380
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,135
- Come on. Get through.
- Ralph! Stop!

1381
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,637
It's got to work!

1382
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,802
Stop, it's no use.

1383
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,441
It's okay, Ralph.

1384
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:06,736
All right, Fix-It.

1385
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,573
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.

1386
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,240
Just go. Go without me.

1387
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,039
- But what about this game?
- Nothing we can do about it.

1388
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:21,668
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1389
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,917
Beacon?

1390
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,720
Stay with Felix.

1391
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,180
Let me borrow that thing, lady.

1392
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,429
- Ralph! Where are you going?
- I got some wrecking to do!

1393
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,413
I'll meet you at the finish line!

1394
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:36,516
No! Wait!

1395
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,017
Fix-It, get behind me!

1396
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,071
Come on!

1397
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,369
One more! One...

1398
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,582
Welcome to the boss level!

1399
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,916
Turbo.

1400
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,924
Because of you, Ralph,

1401
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:13,223
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1402
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,725
I can take over any game I want.

1403
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,598
I should thank you

1404
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,434
but it would be more fun to kill you.

1405
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,480
Get back here, little guy!

1406
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,654
Have some candy!

1407
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,824
Where do you think you're going?

1408
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,628
I'm not through with you yet. Up we go!

1409
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:43,920
No!

1410
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,544
Ralph!

1411
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,674
Fall back.

1412
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:54,673
Kid!

1413
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,764
Vanellope!

1414
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,649
Look at that. It's your little friend.

1415
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,774
Let's watch her die together, shall we?

1416
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,108
No!

1417
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,946
It's game over for both of you.

1418
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,363
No. Just for me!

1419
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,158
- Ralph!
- Vanellope!

1420
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,925
I'm bad, and that's good.

1421
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:33,212
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

1422
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,133
There's no one I'd rather be...

1423
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,637
than me.

1424
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:10,749
Kid!

1425
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:14,052
Don't worry. I got it under control.

1426
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:42,080
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh...

1427
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,332
No! No, no, no. Yes...

1428
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,296
No! Yes... No!

1429
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,712
Go into the light!

1430
01:26:58,088 --> 01:26:59,135
Whoa!

1431
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:02,509
Chocolate?

1432
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,222
It's chocolate! I love chocolate!

1433
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:09,023
Beautiful chocolate!

1434
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,142
VANELLOPEI Yeah!

1435
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:14,654
You did it, Ralph! Way to go, brother!

1436
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,492
I... Excuse...

1437
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,962
All fixed.

1438
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:34,212
- You ready for this?
- As ready <i>as</i> I'll ever be.

1439
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,807
Whoa!

1440
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,719
What's with all the magic sparkles?

1441
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:16,208
Princess Vanellope?

1442
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,342
Now I remember.

1443
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:23,762
All hail the rightful ruler
of Sugar Rush...

1444
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,558
Princess Vanellope.

1445
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,512
I remember. She's our princess!

1446
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:29,892
That's right!

1447
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,815
We are so sorry
about the way we treated you.

1448
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,395
Yeah, those were jokes!

1449
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,311
I was just doing
what Taffyta told me to do!

1450
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,229
Tut-tut.

1451
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,900
As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree

1452
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:46,493
that everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1453
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:47,952
executed.

1454
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:50,492
What? No, please!

1455
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:51,869
My land.

1456
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:54,250
This place just got interesting.

1457
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,582
I don't want to die!

1458
01:28:56,665 --> 01:29:00,260
I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta.

1459
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,261
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1460
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:04,931
Wow.

1461
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:08,185
So this is the real you. Princess.

1462
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:12,268
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1463
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,855
This is me.

1464
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:19,108
Look, the code may say I'm a princess

1465
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,814
but I know who I really am, Ralph,

1466
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,034
I'm a racer with
the greatest superpower ever.

1467
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,614
I was here, I was there.

1468
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,620
I was glitching through the walls.

1469
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:28,743
I'm not giving that up.

1470
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,950
Um, pardon me for asking,

1471
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,203
but without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1472
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:35,333
Yeah. Who?

1473
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:39,212
Me.
I'm thinking more along the lines of

1474
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,464
a constitutional democracy.

1475
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:45,005
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1476
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,803
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1477
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,727
Fix-It, Wreck-It,
the arcade's about to open.

1478
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,729
Let's move 'em out.

1479
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,985
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1480
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,365
You'd have your own wing

1481
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,200
where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1482
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,327
or treat you bad ever again.

1483
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,363
You could be happy.

1484
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,534
I'm already hHPPV-

1485
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,535
I've got the coolest friend in the world.

1486
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,667
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.

1487
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,464
It may not be <i>as</i> fancy
as being president

1488
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:23,885
but it's my duty.

1489
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,591
And it's a big duty!

1490
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,912
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1491
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,011
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1492
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:36,148
<i>Au</i> revoir, Admiral Underpants.

1493
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,518
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1494
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,937
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1495
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:44,406
- Hasta la <i>vista,</i> you...
- Ralph!

1496
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,950
- All right. To be continued.
- Yeah!

1497
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,743
Hooray!

1498
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,294
I'm gonna wreck it!

1499
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:07,383
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1500
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:10,090
The gang's all here!

1501
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:14,428
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1502
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:16,184
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1503
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,560
All right! Yeah, Ralph!

1504
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,184
<i>Of course,
the job hasn't changed.</i>

1505
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:24,947
<i>But, news flash,
the Nicelanders are being nice to me!</i>

1506
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:29,360
<i>And that got me thinking about
those poor guys left without a game.</i>

1507
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:31,945
<i>- So here's what we did.
- We're gonna wreck it!</i>

1508
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:34,331
<i>We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.</i>

1509
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,453
<i>We can fix it!</i>

1510
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,167
<i>I'm telling you, guys,</i>

1511
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,086
<i>we haven't been this popular in years.</i>

1512
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:41,462
- It's crazy.
- Wow!

1513
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:44,040
<i>The gamers say we're "retro,"</i>

1514
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:47,003
<i>which I think means "old but cool. ".</i>

1515
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:48,595
How come
we never noticed this game?

1516
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,547
<i>And I decided
that living in the dump</i>

1517
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,257
<i>wasn't making me feel very good,</i>

1518
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:54,927
<i>so I cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack</i>

1519
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,683
<i>and a couple for the new guys, too.</i>

1520
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:01,103
<i>Well, with a little help from Felix.</i>

1521
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:03,793
<i>And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.</i>

1522
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,863
<i>That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.</i>

1523
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,528
<i>Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.</i>

1524
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:12,619
<i>And not a single bug.</i>

1525
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:20,039
<i>Let's just say, some tears were shed.</i>

1526
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:25,290
<i>But I got to say, the best pan' of my day</i>

1527
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:27,209
<i>is when I get thrown off the roof.</i>

1528
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,845
<i>Because when the Nicelanders
lift me up,</i>

1529
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,383
<i>I get a perfect view of Sugar Rush.</i>

1530
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,468
<i>And I can see Vane/lope racing.</i>

1531
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:40,305
<i>Yes!</i>

1532
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,683
<i>The kid's a natural.</i>

1533
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,814
<i>And the players love her, glitch and all.</i>

1534
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,980
<i>Just like I knew they would.</i>

1535
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:52,700
<i>Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy.</i>

1536
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:56,488
<i>'Cause if that little kid likes me...</i>

1537
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,577
<i>How bad can I be?</i>

1538
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,938
<i>Switch on the sky
and the stars glow for you.</i>

1539
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:25,733
<i>Go see the world
'cause it's all so brand new.</i>

1540
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:29,855
<i>Don't close your eyes
'cause your future's ready to shine.</i>

1541
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:33,613
<i>It's just a matter of time
before we learn how to ﬂy.</i>

1542
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:38,280
<i>Welcome to the rhythm of the night.</i>

1543
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:41,958
<i>There's something in the air
you can't deny.</i>

1544
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:50,133
<i>It's been fun but now I've got to go.</i>

1545
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:53,511
<i>Life is way too short to take it slow.</i>

1546
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:57,557
<i>But before I go and hit the road.</i>

1547
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:03,306
<i>I gotta know, 'til then
when can we do this again?</i>

1548
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,438
<i>When can I see you again?</i>

1549
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,321
<i>When can we do this again?</i>

1550

<i>I gotta know

1551
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:25,832
<i>Joined at the hip
your sidekick needs you.</i>

1552
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:29,464
<i>Life is a trip down
the road that leads you.</i>

1553
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:33,635
<i>Look all around at the mountains
you haven't climbed.</i>

1554
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:37,297
<i>It's just a matter of time

1579

<i>Wreck-It Ralph is a giant of a man.</i>

1580
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:17,122
<i>Nine feet tall with really big hands.</i>

1581
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:20,250
<i>Living in a stump on his very own land.</i>

1582
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:23,583
<i>Until his world went crazy.</i>

1583
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:27,136
<i>He was minding his own business
on the day they came.</i>

1584
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:30,511
<i>They showed a piece of paper
saying "eminent domain".</i>

1585
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,810
<i>They built an apartment building
saying progress was to blame.</i>

1586
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:37,310
<i>So he got mad And he turned bad.</i>

1587
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:40,642
<i>Brick by brick
he's gonna take his land back.</i>

01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,854
<i>Wreck it, Wreck-It Ralph
As fast as you can.</i>

1589
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:47,156
<i>You know you can do it
with your colossal hands.</i>

1590
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,405
<i>So don't let Fix-It Felix
and that building stand.</i>

1591
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:57,334
<i>I wreck it I fix it.</i>

1592
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:00,829
<i>You fixed it!</i>

1593

<i>Fix-It Felix is a really great guy.</i>

1594
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,850
<i>Watch him get all turbocharged
when he eats a pie.</i>

1595
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:17,270
<i>Not just a superintendent
He's a super super guy.</i>

<i>With his trusty tool belt
and steel-toed shoes.</i>

1598
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,230
<i>Nicelanders believe
that Felix just can't lose.</i>

1599
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:30,533
<i>So when Wreck-It Ralph
starts to come unglued.</i>

1600
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:33,737
<i>He doesn't get mad
'Cause he's so rad.</i>

1601
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:37,373
<i>Brick by brick he's gonna build it back.</i>

1602
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:40,372
<i>Fix it, Fix-It Felix, as fast as you can.</i>

1603

<i>Use the magic hammer
you got from your old man</i>

1604
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:47,250
<i>'Cause you know Wreck-It Ralph
won't let that building stand.</i>

1605
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:53,966
<i>I wreck it I fix it.</i>

1606
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:57,392
<i>You fixed it!</i>

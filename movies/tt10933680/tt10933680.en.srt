2
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,612
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

3
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,048
Agh!

4
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:38,397
Calm down!

5
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,835
I'm OK, bro. We're OK.

6
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,099
What can I getcha, doll?

7
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,796
Y'know what?
I'm gonna go with a ginger ale.

8
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:47,711
-Y'know what? Make it a diet.

9
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,888
-Yeah, I gotta check
if we have that.

10
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,282
-OK, you do that.
-A beer if we don't?

11
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:57,025
I'm gonna take it up a notch
and go with a water. OK?

12
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,426
- How many times have I...
- French!

13
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:09,515
Brother, are you gonna
do somethin' about this?

14
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,083
Fuckin' prick.
Y'all fuckin' prick!

15
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,955
A'right, a'right.
Break it up. Break it up.

16
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,783
Let him go.
Take it outside. Yeah?

17
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,786
-Get outside now!
-Fuck off, Harry Stiles.

18
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,136
-This don't concern you.
-Listen, mate.

19
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,573
You can kick seven shades
of shite out of each other,
for all I care,

20
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,620
but you're doin' outside.
Otherwise it is my concern!

21
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,970
-Who the fuck do you
think you are?

22
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:31,276
-Ugh!
-French... don't do it.

23
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,757
Now listen to me.

24
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,151
-Calm down, OK? You see him?

25
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:38,849
See that guy? His name's Irv,
and that's my boss.

26
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,764
Now, he's given me
strict instructions.

27
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:43,245
You gotta take all violence
outside the premises. OK, lads?

28
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,943
Because I've had a few
unfortunate events over
the past few weeks,

29
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,728
and I've caused a bit
of damage, and...

30
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,730
I promised him I'm gonna
turn over a new leaf, OK?

31
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:53,168
So, please. Take it outside
and let me finish my breakfast.

32
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,431
-A'right?

33
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,868
What d'you reckon, lads?

34
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:02,046
Shall we match his faggy,
English ass outside?

35
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,092
Like we did 100 years ago?

36
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:07,399
More like 250 years, I think.
But that's by the by, isn't it?

37
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:10,576
Anyway... wasn't exactly
fair fight back then, was it?

38
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,796
It was us against you,

39
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:17,279
and we kicked your
sorry asses all the way
back across the Atlantic!

40
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,802
-Nah, you didn't, mate.
- Sent you home crying

41
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,457
to your bitch queen!

42
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,589
-Nah, they didn't, mate.

43
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:25,504
Well, it wasn't a queen,
actually, mate.

44
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:26,941
No, it was a king.

45
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:28,769
King George III to be precise.

46
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,771
But, well, I wouldn't expect
you lot to know that.

47
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,729
I mean, you probably never read
a book in your life, have ya?

48
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:36,080
So, allow me to educate
ye geriatric Yank fucks.

49
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,343
See, you had help
from the Spanish...

50
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,737
the French... oh, and the Dutch.

51
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,739
And yeah, all right. We might've
taken a bit of a kickin',

52
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,393
but the odds were
against our boys.

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,960
Just like they are against me
now, to be honest.

54
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:47,178
But d'you know what?

55
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,050
I fuckin' like these odds.

56
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,313
'Cause like good ol' King George
always used to say,

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,663
"Come and fucking get it!"

58
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,191
On your six, Frenchie!

59
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:51,895
Cheers, mate!

60
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:53,418
I gotta tell you somethin', pal.

61
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:56,160
You still got it.
You got every move .

62
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,292
-The fuck?
-Uhh!

63
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,051
I thought you were dead.

64
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:18,661
Well, so did I,
Frenchie. Believe me.

65
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:19,923
A story for another time.

66
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:26,147
Outside, French! A word.

67
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,064
I love this fuckin' place!

68
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:32,414
Mmm!

69
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,808
Don't do this, OK?
I need this job.

70
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,418
I need it, mate.
Please, don't do this.

71
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,115
And I need a club

72
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:39,856
that doesn't have to be
renovated once a week

73
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:42,337
'cause of what you do.

74
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:45,514
Listen, brother. After the cost
of the busted-up furniture,

75
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,472
and your unpaid bar tab,

76
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,257
there's 80 bucks.

77
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:50,606
Good luck.

78
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,304
Oh, 80 bucks, yeah? Yeah?

79
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,480
Well, good luck findin'
someone else to scrape up

80
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,134
the shit that comes
in this place!

81
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:58,309
It's a shit hole, mate!

82
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,229
Was nice to see that things
are workin' out for you, pal.

83
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:07,057
I'm very happy about that, I am.

84
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,277
Hey y'know,
what it's worth, if, uh,

85
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,061
if you wanna
finish that breakfast,

86
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:13,368
there's a place next door.
Maybe we can, you know...

87
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:14,717
Why, are you buyin'?

88
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:16,110
Since you got no job no more...

89
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:18,155
why not?

90
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:20,592
Come on, Frenchie.

91
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,815
It's still just "French,"
by the way!

92
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,824
Mmm.

93
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,089
Mmm. Ahh.

94
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,050
-Mmmm!
-I can't believe it.

95
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:45,226
I can't believe you're
sat right here in front of me.

96
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:47,750
I thought for sure
that you were a goner.

97
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,839
Mm, believe me, I was.

98
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:51,275
Flat-lined two times
on that slab.

99
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,060
-Yeah?
-Mm-mm.

100
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:54,888
-Jesus.
-If it wasn't for Tommy,

101
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,367
I probably wouldn't
be here right now.

102
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:59,327
Paid a lot of money
to make me undead. Yeah.

103
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,024
Got shot up
pretty bad, Frenchie.

104
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:03,853
Stomach, one vertebra.

105
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,421
One up here in the lung.
Can you imagine? Yeah?

106
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,814
Actually, had to leave
one in near my spine.

107
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:11,339
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

108
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:13,907
Well, kudos to you, mate,
because, uh, y'know what?

109
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,213
As far as zombies go...

110
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,432
you're lookin' all right.

111
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,914
Hm. Mmm.

112
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,219
So, where's my coupe?

113
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:26,093
Oh, I'm fine, Sue.

114
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,442
Don't worry
about the injuries I took.

115
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:28,530
Yeah, thanks for asking.

116
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:29,879
Oh, no, no. It's not like that.

117
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,185
See, I just--because
of the, um--

118
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:32,664
Oh, c'mon, Frenchie.

119
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:33,970
How you doin'?
Really, I'm sorry.

120
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,102
Just--How you doin'?

121
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:36,320
-I'm all right.
-Yeah?

122
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,974
-I'm pretty good.
-Yeah?

123
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,456
Took two in the chest.
One here, one there.

124
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,892
I dunno how,
but I somehow managed

125
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,285
to crawl back
to the car, all right,

126
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,851
and drive myself
to the emergency room.

127
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:48,680
-Well.
-I was surprisingly all right.

128
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,509
I mean, I've seen a soldier
shoot himself in the foot,
and he died.

129
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:54,295
Yet I take two in the chest
and somehow manage to live
to tell the tale.

130
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,950
Human body, mate, it's a fucked
up thing, I'm telling you.

131
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,473
-I'll tell you this as well.
-Mm-hmm?

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,562
Had to blag the police
at the hospital, though.

133
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,999
Told 'em my gun went off,
whilst I was cleaning it.

134
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:06,002
Bet they bought that,
am I right?

135
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,135
They did. I dunno.

136
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:09,832
Maybe they couldn't be
arsed with the paperwork.

137
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,094
Well...

138
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:12,835
Hmm.

139
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:16,882
So, where's my coupe?

140
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:21,887
Didn't shoot out that
loving bedside manner
of yours, did they?

141
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,324
Frenchie, where's
my fuckin' car?

142
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,457
I fuckin' sold that car, mate.

143
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,459
You did what?
You did what--

144
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,809
With who? With what? What?

145
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:33,160
I sold the car
to a chop shop, didn't I?

146
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:34,683
Didn't have
a fuckin' choice, did I?

147
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,119
It was covered
in my blood, wasn't it?

148
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:37,816
Listen, that was like a bullseye

149
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:39,209
for every gangster in East LA.

150
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:40,123
So, I flogged that thing.

151
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,516
Lemme ask you somethin'.

152
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:43,648
By chance, how much...
did you sell

153
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:45,694
this classically-designed
vehicle for?

154
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,610
Dunno, it was about six grand.

155
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:51,004
Fuck me,
Frenchie! Six grand?

156
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,485
Six--Just the fuckin' rims alone
are worth six fuckin' grand!

157
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:55,747
-You understand me, right?
-Hey.

158
00:09:57,532 --> 00:10:00,622
I am sorry.
Everything is under control.

159
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:01,971
My apologies.

160
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,845
You know, you're unbelievable.

161
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,630
-And I don't like
this--this tone.

162
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:11,372
-What tone?
-This tone.

163
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,330
-I haven't got a fuckin' tone.
What you talkin' about?
-Oh yeah, you do. You do.

164
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,550
I come as a friend, I catch the
bus to come and see my friend.

165
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:17,813
I come all this way,
and you give me this... tone.

166
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,511
No, you caught the bus,
mate, to come and get
your precious coupe.

167
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,209
Hey, is that the only reason
you come here, then?

168
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:24,689
Actually, no. It's not
the only reason.

169
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:26,517
I came for Tommy.
He's got a job for us.

170
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:27,997
Two days, three vigs.

171
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:29,825
We're in, we're out.
What do you say?

172
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:34,612
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

173
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,225
OK.

174
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,183
Fuck off, mate. Yeah?

175
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,403
D'you know what? I only did
that job for three days,

176
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,057
we both almost fucking died!

177
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,145
No chance.

178
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:46,363
Get stuffed.

179
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,452
"Never again. Can't do it!"

180
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,063
Listen to you, right?

181
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,586
Let me tell you somethin' else.

182
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:54,415
It's a favor for Tommy.
You owe him.

183
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,373
No, I don't think I do.

184
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,114
OK. Tell you what.

185
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,290
I'll do it for Tommy,
you can do it for the money.

186
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,118
I ain't
that desperate, mate.

187
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,381
Oh yeah? We both know
that's not true. Right?

188
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,992
C'mon, French, think about it.
Get to split $70K.

189
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,735
How much?

190
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,781
-Hm?
-How much?

191
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:14,435
Seventy K.

192
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,350
One more job,
and you can be gone forever.

193
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:18,613
You can go home and do whatever
it is the fuck you wanna do.

194
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,702
You can open your gym.

195
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,182
Besides, Frenchie,
you know I need this one.

196
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,619
You'd be doing me
a square one, yeah?

197
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,447
I'm gettin' nowhere with
the 'just call me French'
thing, am I?

198
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,013
It's a term of endearment.

199
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah. Whatever, Susan.

200
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,497
One last job.

201
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,412
-Yeah.
-Three last jobs.

202
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,329
While you think about it,
I tell you what.

203
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,592
Per our previous discussion.

204
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,811
I'll take care of breakfast.

205
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,903
I might leave another $20.

206
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,384
Why? Because I can.

207
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:52,081
You want more of this?

208
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,169
I'll see you outside.

209
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,349
So, what have you been
doin' for the past seven months?

210
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:02,047
You know, apart from
rising from the dead?

211
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,354
You ever think it might
be a nice idea to, uh,

212
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,921
let me know
you were still alive?

213
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:07,444
Well, I did consider
doing that, Frenchie,

214
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,011
but Tommy told me
to remain incognito,

215
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:10,491
so that's what I did, yeah?

216
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:12,232
Yeah, he said the same thing
to me, too.

217
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,408
That's why I've been
working outta this shit pit.

218
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,974
What a coincidence!

219
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,802
I get fired the same day
you turn up.

220
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,418
Whoa, wait a minute.
What the fuck is this?

221
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,551
It's called a car, mate.

222
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:28,770
No, it's a wheelchair

223
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:30,424
with a fuckin' roof, Frenchie.

224
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:32,948
You traded in my classic
for this piece of shit?

225
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,428
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

226
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,299
It doesn't drink gas
like a battleship,

227
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,735
it's clean, it's quiet.

228
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,259
And it doesn't smell
like your arse

229
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:40,912
on the inside. All right?

230
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,392
Now look, if we're gonna
do this, I'm gonna have to

231
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,611
go home and get
a change of clothes.

232
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:44,786
Oh, no, no, no.
Got no time

233
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:45,830
for you to change, OK?

234
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:46,831
You look beautiful.

235
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:47,919
On a time schedule.

236
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,051
Where are we off to first then?

237
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,575
Las Vegas. Is that OK with you?

238
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:52,750
-Vegas?
-Vegas.

239
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:54,839
Jesus Christ.

240
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,942
I fuckin' hate Vegas.

241
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,297
D'you want that one?

242
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,081
No, I don't like that one.

243
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,039
Nah, that's a bit shit, uh?

244
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:23,520
I like, uh, rock music.

245
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,000
All right, Frenchie, how about

246
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,828
we take it easy
with the DJ'ing, eh?

247
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:29,091
What do say?

248
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:32,312
- Oh.

249
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,183
So, where are we headed to
in Vegas then, mate?

250
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,750
We're stickin' with a vig.

251
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,273
Oh, the ol' vig, eh?

252
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,407
So, we are...

253
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,932
Have a look, Frenchie.
My specs must've...

254
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,631
Hang on a minute.

255
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,807
Vegas is number two
on this list.

256
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,506
How come we're goin' there first
and who's this Mal Reese bird?

257
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,899
Little tip, Frenchie.

258
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:56,684
Always start farthest away
from home

259
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,207
and work your way back, yeah?

260
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,819
Mal Reese...

261
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:05,345
Mal Reese is a bona fide
class act outta Louisiana, yeah?

262
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,129
Her old man moved here
when he was a kid, Frenchie,

263
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:09,218
to work for
the Ukrainian Crime Family.

264
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:11,829
Wasn't a pure-bred,
so one day he got an OBE.

265
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,657
"One behind the ear."

266
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:16,921
Anyways, it was the mid-80s.
Mal was in her late 20s.

267
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,663
So, she started working for
the Family under an alias. Yeah?

268
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,099
Pretty smart girl, Frenchie.

269
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,840
She knew everything, where

270
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:25,887
every penny was banked,
where every body was buried.

271
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:27,671
After a time,
she'd developed a lot of power.

272
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:30,805
Slowly but surely, she became
very rich, very powerful.

273
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,459
Then one day ...

274
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,330
she decides to wipe out
the whole fuckin' family.

275
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,260
How do you know all this, then?

276
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,001
I mean, the Urfalian family--

277
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,090
I've never heard of 'em.

278
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,875
I had this on-and-off thing
with her for about three years.

279
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:00,487
She was the best fuck
on the West Coast.

280
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:02,315
Crazy ones usually are,
am I right?

281
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:12,890
-Are you serious?
-Don't fuckin' say anything,

282
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:14,457
don't even hint
you know anything. OK?

283
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:15,980
'Cause if she looks
in your eyes,

284
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,765
and she thinks that I
told you a fuckin' word,

285
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:18,940
she'll kill us both.

286
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,637
I mean it, yeah?

287
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,552
Fuckin' sounds like
a right crazy bitch to me.

288
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,337
Oh, she is, Frenchie,
but I don't wanna wind up

289
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,077
hurting her, you know.
Physically, I mean.

290
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:28,863
I'm done with the violence,
brother. I'm done.

291
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,343
Done with violence?
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,345
It means no more hurtin'
my fellow man.

293
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,608
"No more hurtin' my fellow man"?

294
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:35,957
You takin' the piss, mate?

295
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,611
No, I'm not takin' the piss!

296
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,352
What I'm tryin' to tell you
is maybe, OK?

297
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,962
Maybe, if it's fucking
life-threatening!

298
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,398
Well, good luck
with that, mate. Yeah.

299
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:43,617
We'll see how you
get on with that.

300
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:45,358
Answer me this though, right?

301
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,883
How do you expect to clear
three vigs in two days,

302
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,537
and not get
your little paws muddy?

303
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:51,625
How's that gonna work?

304
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:52,843
That's why I got you here.

305
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,411
No. No-no-no-no-no. No, no, no.

306
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,847
You want me to do this with you,

307
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,545
we're gonna do 50-50,
right? Partners.

308
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:00,068
You're not gonna be
warmin' up the bench,

309
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:01,678
whilst I get roasted
in the thick of it again.

310
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,637
Let's hope it doesn't
get to that.

311
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,595
But it probably fucking will,
won't it? Let's be honest.

312
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,902
Do me a favor. Pull over
at the next stop, Frenchie.

313
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:09,077
I could use a drink.

314
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,653
Fill 'er up, Frenchie.
I'm gonna go pay inside.

315
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,012
He walkin' his ass over here.

316
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,753
Fucker really comin' over.

317
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,975
'Sup, lads... can I
help you with somethin'?

318
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,413
I don't know, French, can you?

319
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,155
Clock's tickin', motherfucker.

320
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:30,071
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

321
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:36,512
Bitch-ass motherfucker, man.

322
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:51,919
Mm. You OK, Frenchie?

323
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,660
-See that Black SUV there?
-Oh yeah, I see it.

324
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,400
-Right, yeah?
-Yeah.

325
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,141
Well, there's a couple
of massive blokes inside.

326
00:17:57,228 --> 00:17:59,100
One of em's got
a fuck-off machine gun.

327
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:00,144
And he knew my name.

328
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,972
What's that all about?

329
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,758
Well, they've been following me
ever since I left LA.

330
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,716
-You what?
-Oh yeah.

331
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,240
And actually, they were outside
your dive bar up in Rancho.

332
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,112
Lemme ask you,
what happened to

333
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,940
your paratrooper observation
skills back there, Frenchie?

334
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,681
Just wonderin'.

335
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,857
Oh, I dunno, mate.
Maybe I was a little bit dulled

336
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:18,511
from the kickin' I just took!

337
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,034
Why are they tailin' us?

338
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,165
I dunno, Frenchie.

339
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:22,340
Maybe they're workin' for

340
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:23,907
who Tommy's collectin' for.

341
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,387
What for?

342
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,736
To make sure we
get the money or what?

343
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:27,868
Oh yeah. To make sure
we get the money

344
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,217
and then make sure we don't

345
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:30,914
run away with the money.
OK? C'mon--

346
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:33,221
Why the fuck would we run away
with the money, mate?

347
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:35,136
And who's Tommy collectin' for?

348
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:37,007
Frenchie, I don't have the
answers to all these questions.

349
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:38,879
All I know is
it's the right play.

350
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,489
Get the money back to Tommy,

351
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:41,621
take the cream off the vig,

352
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,492
and we get on our way. Come on.

353
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,841
Avante. Let's go.

354
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:48,105
I dunno about this, mate.

355
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,431
Well, are we gonna do this
then, or what?

356
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:12,565
Yeah, I mean,

357
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,175
just give me a minute,
will you, Frenchie?

358
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,611
Just a minute, yeah?

359
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:20,660
-You all right, mate?
-I'm fine.

360
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:23,358
-Look like you're shittin' it.
-What?

361
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,665
You're scared because
of this bird, aren't you?

362
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:27,623
I ain't afraid of anybody.
You know that, right?

363
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,626
-Yeah?
-But, Mal... she's different.

364
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:32,454
Well, you better sharpen
them fangs, mate.

365
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,370
Because we're on a deadline,
aren't we. Remember?

366
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:36,501
Let's go.

367
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,040
Miss Reese is a busy woman.

368

So, be judicious
in your conversation,

369
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:56,609
get to the point quickly.

370
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,567
Follow me.

371
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,660
Check out
the thighs on that, mate.

372
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,184
How much do you reckon
she charges people to put
them in a scissor hold?

373
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,708
Gee, I'm tellin' you,
be serious.

374
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:10,753
You're gonna get us both killed.

The return

00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:02,805
Mal Reese. Still a knockout.

395
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:08,245
Yeah. But we both know
it was you that got knocked out.

396
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,770
Never quite make it back
from that night.

397
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,427
Y'know what?
Maybe I never will, Mal.

398
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,691
But either way, it's really nice
to see you again.

399
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,910
Well, the sun is
over the yardarm,

400
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:23,434
and I know you were never one
to say no to a drink.

401
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:26,742
Actually, uh...

402
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,744
Kind of all finished
with that now, Mal.

Yeah, clean and sober
all the way.

404
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,792
We're just here on business.

405
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:34,794
Tommy called.

406
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:37,622
It's the $155K
that I was loaned.

407
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,189
We're gonna have to collect.

408
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:40,625
Well, the money's ready.

409
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:42,802
I got it prepared
after the phone call.

410
00:21:44,368 --> 00:21:45,456
But...

411
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,632
No games. OK? No games.

412
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,811
I borrow a large sum of money
to save my bacon,

413
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:54,161
and the money comes
from a really bad cat.

414
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,903
But then he goes
and gets himself killed.

415
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,383
So, I think I got lucky
and got off.

416
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,822
But then you show up
on my doorstep to collect.

417
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:04,867
Who's playing games
with who, Sue?

418
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,216
Listen, love.

419
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:07,914
We traveled a very long way

420
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,916
through a hot bloody desert
to collect this. OK?

421
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:11,656
We're not here
to pussyfoot around.

422
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,920
So, you already prepared
the readies, let's have it...

423
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:16,531
and we'll clear out. Yeah?

424
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,534
Does the English shoe salesman
know who he's talking to,

425
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,842
and what I do to bad little boys
who talk out of turn?

426
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,018
Actually, Mallory,
we were just discussing this.

427
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:27,542
He has a hard time listening,
but... he's OK.

428
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,763
In my club,
you call me Miss Reese.

429
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,809
It's a term of respect,
and I demand res--

430
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:36,116
Miss Reese, please.

431
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:39,119
Give us the money,
and we'll go. OK?

432
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:41,121
What is your name, little boy?

433
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,036
It's, uh, it's French.

434
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:44,907
They call him French,
just like the kiss.

435
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:48,519
-You cut me off, Mr. French.
-It's just French, by the way.

436
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:51,435
OK, listen. Mallory,

437
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:53,437
we've come a long way from LA,
we have to go all the way back.

438
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:56,310
We're very tired, OK?
Just... please.

439
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:01,228
You've met Miss Britt.
She has your money.

440
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,536
Give the bag to Mr. French.

441
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,671
-Get it, Frenchie.

442
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:12,456
She'll be shooting some footage.

443
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:16,809
Film Mr. French checking
the money's all there
and accounted for.

444
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,723
Y'know what, Mallory,
maybe you should keep filming

445
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,813
until we get all the way to
the car, if you're planning on

00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:41,154
You know, you got great lips.
You still do.

470
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:44,287
And you still scare the fuckin'
piss out of me, but...

471
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:45,680
your lips are magnificent.

472
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:56,386
♪ Can't feel you anymore ♪

473
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,480
♪ It all just disappears ♪

474
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,441
I'll tell you what, that was
a piece of piss, wasn't it?

475
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:09,182
She just gave us the money.

476
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:10,835
Hard ten my arse, mate.

477
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,534
What's your problem?

478
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:15,275
She gave it up way too easy,
Frenchie. OK?

479
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,146
-Mal Reese--No, listen to me.

480
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,279
That's not the Mal Reese
I know. Trust me.

481
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:24,501
-Jesus Christ!

482
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,286
Didn't I fuckin'
tell you, Frenchie?

483
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,940
There she is,
right on cue, yeah?

484
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,245
That's why they were filmin' us.

485
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:30,377
I've heard it being done before,

486
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:31,856
but no one's ever done it to me.

487
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:33,162
Do me a favor.
Get us outta this mess.

488
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:34,424
Do somethin' slick, yeah?

489
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:42,302
Oh! Precision driving, Frenchie.
Very impressive.

490
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,173
-You really showed 'em,
you know that?
-Shut up!

491
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,479
Y'know, you can take the wheel
whenever you want, you know.

492
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,350
It wouldn't make
a difference, right?

493
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:48,656
'Cause this piece of shit
couldn't get away anyway!

494
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:55,924
OK. What do we got here?

495
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:58,187
A machine gun, three batons.
What do you wanna do?

496
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:00,711
You can curb that shit about
denouncing violence for a start.

497
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,453
It ain't denouncing you!
Is it, mate? Hey! Is it?

498
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,455
We're just here for
the money, boys!

499
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,502
Play nice, we'll be nice back.

500
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,851
OK, this ginger prick.

501
00:26:09,938 --> 00:26:11,418
AK 47. That is pretty much

502
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:14,029
the wankiest assault rifle
anyone could get.

503
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,031
Two million Russian soldiers
would disagree with you.

504
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,207
Yeah, but look how he's
limp-wristing the receiver.

505
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,818
I bet you this prick's never
had a range session in his life.

506
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,821
OK. If he gets close enough,

507
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:25,388
I'm gonna take him.

508
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:26,824
You can dance
with the other three, yeah?

509
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,130
Wait a minute.
You get to take out one,

510
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:29,914
I get to take out three.
How's that fair?

511
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,874
I'm gonna take the one
with the assault rifle, Sue.

512
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,528
You just told me he didn't
know how to hold the gun!

513
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,356
And one of yours is a girl.

514
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:38,271
She look like a girl?
That's a fuckin' monster.

515
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:40,621
You hit 'em,
they go down. Simple.

516
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,275
Come on, Frenchie, look.

517
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:45,104
I haven't hit a woman
in a long time, brother.

518
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:48,281
Well, that means you're rested
then, doesn't it? Yeah?

519
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:50,892
So, go on, get out there.
Give it a bit of the ol'
Golden Boy hospitality.

520
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,372
You remember how
to do that, yeah?

521
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:54,330
-F-you, Frenchie.
-Out of the car, asshole.

522
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,453
You hit me
with the bat, I'm so--

523
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,282
You can run for now.
This ain't over!

524
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:34,457
Well, let's get
something straight.

525
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:35,763
We're not the ones runnin'!

526
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,417
Go on, get outta here.

527
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:39,506
Go on, get outta here!

528
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:41,290
- C'mon, Sue!

529
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:50,647
Nice work, old man.

530
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,780
Guess bein' dead
didn't dampen your technique.

531
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,260
Gee, what can I tell ya?

532
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,175
She hit me
in the head with a bat.

533
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:57,785
Ah c'mon, mate.
She didn't give you a choice.

534
00:27:57,872 --> 00:27:59,134
Wouldn't beat yourself
up about it.

535
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:04,183
You guys done rollin'
around in the dirt?

536
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,228
Oh, it's nice to see
you guys show up. Yeah?

537
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:07,664
Here's an idea for ya.

538
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:08,926
How 'bout next time, you get out

539
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:09,971
and you give us a fuckin' hand.

540
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:11,407
- Nah.
-Yeah.

541
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:13,105
We just like
watchin' you two fight.

542
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,150
Not bad for a couple has-beens.

543
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,935
Ha-ha-ha. Fuck off.

544
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:20,024
Look at blondie, man.

545
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:22,723
I recognize those eyes anywhere.
I'm tellin' you, dog, it's him!

546
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,203
What's he sayin', Frenchie?

547
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,379
I didn't hear him, mate.

548
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,859
-Jesus, who are these guys, Sue?
-I don't know.

549
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:30,905
Should I be worried about who
the fuck they're working for?

550
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,472
Let's just focus on the job.

551
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,169
We talked about it.
One down, two to go.

552
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,301
Let's just move on. We gotta go.

553
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:37,259
No-no-no. No.

554
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:39,218
No way I'm drivin' back through
the night to Los Angeles.

555
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:40,436
OK? No chance.

556
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:41,916
We're checkin' into a motel.

557
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:43,874
-I need my rest.
-We're on a time schedule!

558
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:45,615
We need to have
the money in by Friday.

559
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:47,313
-We talked about this!
-Yeah, I need some goddamn rest,

560
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,967
if I'm expected to keep
smashing people senseless.

561
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:54,450
Listen, mate. These machines,
they don't work without the cog.

562
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:57,323
What?

563
00:28:57,888 --> 00:28:59,325
The cog.

564
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:02,023
The machines don't work
without the cog.

565
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,851
-Oh Jesus Christ, Frenchie--
-I need some rest!

566
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:06,288
OK, you win!
Hotel, for sure. Let's go!

567
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:56,991
-Yeah.

568
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:58,427
Hey, Tommy.

569
00:29:58,514 --> 00:30:00,081
So, we got the money
from Mal Reese.

570
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:02,170
That's first one down,
two to go.

571
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:03,389
She play nice?

572
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:04,564
Ah, you know.

573
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:06,479
Nice enough, I guess.

574
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:09,873
But, um, I got a question, yeah.

575
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,527
Seem to have picked up
some company.

576
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:12,833
Two brothers armed to bear.

577
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,313
They been shadowing us from LA.

578
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,185
They happen to be
part of this deal?

579
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:19,709
Yeah, just makin' sure
you don't blow with the dough.

580
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:22,103
Yeah. I figured as such, right.

581
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:27,108
How you doin', Tommy?
You doin' OK?

582
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:30,024
Don't worry about me, just
worry about the next two jobs.

583
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:33,332
I don't know, is there
anything else maybe I need
to know about this one, yeah?

584
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:39,555
Uh, it's kinda hard
to talk right now.

585
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,472
Yeah, I understand,
Tommy. No problem.

586
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,779
I'll check in with you tomorrow,
OK? You look after yourself.

587
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:48,434
I'm sorry I got you
into this, Sue.

588
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:01,925
Is that you, Frenchie?
Come on in. It's open!

589
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:07,583
I managed to snag one of these
from across the street.

590
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,411
Thought it might help me sleep.

591
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,283
Come in. Come here,
what d'you got there?

592
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,503
Oh, you know me. Got a bit
of the old, uh, Rooster.

593
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,026
-Rooster Rojo?
-Yeah.

594
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:18,028
Can you imagine?
This is my brand, Frenchie.

595
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:19,508
-Yeah?
-Yeah! Yeah.

596
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:22,337
How very thoughtful of you,

597
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,339
but, uh... I'm afraid
I must decline.

598
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,862
Stone cold turkey.

599
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,255
You remember what I said.

600
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:28,909
But thank you, Frenchie.
Nice gesture.

601
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,519
-I thought you
were bullshittin'.
-Oh, no.

602
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:32,695
Yeah?

603
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:35,002
Well, I guess gettin' shot
by a machine gun'll

604
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,396
make you reevaluate
those decisions in life. Yeah?

605
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:39,223
By the way,
it's 100% blue agave.

606
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:40,616
You got the good stuff.

607
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:43,880
So, come on then, mate.

608
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,536
Said you died twice, right?

609
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:50,452
You see anythin'?
I mean, you know, like...

610
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:53,760
bright lights or your life
flash before your eyes?

611
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:54,891
Nah.

612
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:57,416
How 'bout you?

613
00:31:57,503 --> 00:31:59,113
-What did you see?
-What did I see?

614
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,767
Nah, I wasn't anywhere near

615
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:02,725
close to bumpin' off
like you, mate. But, um...

616
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,597
Let's be honest.

617
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:08,209
It's kind of embarrassin'.

618
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:10,298
Embarrassin'? Why's that?

619
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,739
Well, look. I don't know
if I was hallucinatin' or what,

620
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,872
but the nurse
that wheeled me into the ICU,

621
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,178
she was fit as fuck,
mate. I'm tellin' ya.

622
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,006
Honestly, right?
Platinum blonde hair,

623
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:27,707
blue eyes, narrow waist. Right?
And the nurse's outfit?

624
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:31,232
I didn't know where to look.
So anyway, right,

625
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,799
it's fucking freezin'
in this place, right?

626
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:34,757
It's like the Baltic. Yeah?

627
00:32:34,844 --> 00:32:37,194
And I'm shiverin' like
some sort of shittin' dog.

628
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:38,587
But I'm tryin' to keep
it together, 'cause I'm
lookin' up at this bird,

629
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,589
and she's cuttin'
my clothes off.

630
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:42,678
And I'm tryin' to look
like the Fonz, you know?

631
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:45,115
Like gettin' shot is just
a regular occurrence
for this stud.

632
00:32:45,202 --> 00:32:46,378
D'you know what I mean?

633
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,075
So anyway, there she is.

634
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:50,860
She cut off my jeans,
she cut off my underwear.

635
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:56,300
And before I know it,
I am stark, bollock naked. OK?

636
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:57,737
Now, here's the thing.

637
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:01,915
I'm not a small man, Sue. OK?

638
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:03,699
I'm no thoroughbred
stallion either,

639
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:05,440
but it's a perfectly
healthy size, right?

640
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,050
But the thing is...

641
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:10,837
it is so fucking cold
in this place, right?

642
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:13,492
My old fella has decided
to shrink back

643
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:16,364
into his hole to the size
of a little nub.

644
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:21,282
Right? It was like a fucking
thimble, mate. It was pathetic.

645
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:24,633
I mean, just when you want him
to, like, stand up proud...

646
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,114
nothin'.

647
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,072
It's fuckin' embarassin'.

648
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,292
Well, if I may, Frenchie,
I must admit that, uh,

649
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,337
it would make
any man blush, yeah?

650
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:37,385
So, come on then, mate.
What about you?

651
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:40,040
You must remember somethin'.

652
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,087
We're tight, right?

653
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,872
-Of course, we are, mate. Yeah.
-Yeah?

654
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:49,963
'Cause what happened to me
was perfect, yeah?

655
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,834
Absolutely perfect.

656
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:55,185
And to be honest, the chance to
finally tell someone you respect

657
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,100
makes it feel
all the more special.

658
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:03,367
I saw her, Frenchie.

659
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:10,679
I saw Milly.

660
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:12,507
She was smilin',
she was wavin' back at me.

661
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,074
And that the thing here, y'know?

662
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,905
She was happy.

663
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:20,994
She wasn't disappointed
in her old man,

664
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:23,692
as I thought she would be
all these years.

665
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:26,521
She looked like a little angel,
staring back at me.

666
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:32,048
Ah. She made me
so happy, Frenchie,

667
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:34,486
I could've just faded away
right there .

668
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:37,314
Yeah.

669
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:39,882
That's beautiful, mate.

670
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:44,626
Bloody hell. Here I am,
bangin' on about my tiny cock,

671
00:34:44,713 --> 00:34:46,454
and you've gone
and hit me with the, uh,

672
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,934
one-two knockout
emotional punch.

673
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:55,985
Y'know I'm not really
a religious man, Sue.

674
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:57,900
I don't really believe
in any of that, but...

675
00:34:58,771 --> 00:34:59,989
whatever that was...

676
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,428
I'm glad you got
to see her, mate.

677
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,735
Yeah, me too, Frenchie. Me too.

678
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:11,392
Ah, it's good stuff.

679
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,828
Take it easy on that stuff, OK?

680
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,917
We got an early rise
in the morning.

681
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:18,051
Yeah, I'll be fine, mate.
Don't worry about me.

682
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,100
Oh, you were right, by the way.

683
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,452
You know, the day we got shot?

684
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:31,978
I should've listened to you.

685
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:36,199
If I'd listened to you,
we'd both be better off

686
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:37,723
than we are now,
that's for sure.

687
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,944
Glad you're still alive, mate.

688
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,114
OK, Frenchie. We're here.

689
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:23,812
Looks like we're a little early,

690
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:25,161
so let's kick back
a little bit, yeah?

691
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:27,599
Wait till the owner gets here.

692
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,340
Do me a favor,
wake me up when he does?

693
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:32,647
I'm gonna take a little nap.

694
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,476
Yeah, all right, mate.
You get your beauty sleep.

695
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,870
I'm serious, Frenchie.
Just--just wake me up, yeah?

696
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:40,307
I don't want it to be
too much of a stretch.

697
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:43,658
Listen, mate, the only one
around here who needs to
do some stretchin' is you.

698
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:46,661
You got a tone.

699
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:49,533
Have a nice nap.

700
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,224
Come on, oi. Come on, mate.

701
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:30,226
Get up. I got you
a cup of coffee, yeah?

702
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,054
-There we go. Wakey-wakey, mate.

703
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:33,969
All right?

704
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,635
This is damn good coffee,
Frenchie.

705
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:50,333
Jesus Christ, mate. Do you gimp
out like that every morning?

706
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,248
Just startin' the engines, yeah?

707
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:54,207
Sounded like you were rapin'
a rocking horse to me.

708
00:37:54,294 --> 00:37:55,512
Let's take a look
at the vig, shall we?

709
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:02,215
OK.

710
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:08,743
All right.
Esteban Madrid, $95,000,

711
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,528
City of Angles Boxing Club.
What--wa-wa-wa?

712
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,227
This a boxing club?

713
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:15,794
I didn't realize
it was a boxing club.

714
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:17,012
That's because
you don't concentrate

715
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,100
when you read things, Frenchie.

716
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,319
Yeah, that's right. You.

717
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:21,190
I know this guy.

718
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:23,236
He's been around, he's trained
a lot of good fighters.

719
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:25,542
Let me tell you.
The number of these guys

720
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:27,240
that can actually fight
is woefully fuckin' small.

721
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:28,632
Yeah, same as pro MMA.

722
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,373
Yeah, well,

723
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,593
pro boxing, maybe it's
a little different. Yeah?

724
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,030
Y'know, it's precise.
There's discipline.

725
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:36,640
There's these. Yeah?

726
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,251
Hang on a minute.
You're tryin' to tell me

727
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:40,122
that martial arts doesn't
involve discipline?

728
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:42,255
Because I think a lot of people
might disagree with that, mate.

729
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:44,126
Just a few people.

730
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:46,172
Well, that's not what
I'm sayin', Frenchie. OK?

731
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:48,000
And I'm also not sayin' that
a boxer's gonna beat an MMA guy.

732
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:49,741
What I am sayin' is,

733
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,221
it's the sweet science.
It's fuckin' classy.

734
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:55,616
Oh yeah, mate. Really classy,
yeah. Bitin' peoples' ears off.

735
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,052
I mean, come on. It doesn't
get more corrupt--

736
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,097
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
Frenchie. French.

737
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,576
What?

738
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:01,013
-Is it fuckin' open?

739
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:04,538
Did he go inside?

740
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,670
Ahh, you don't know. Right?

741
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,716
You were supposed to
be on fuckin' watch, Frenchie!

742
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:11,153
Well, I'm sorry, mate, but I was
gettin' you a coffee, wasn't I?

743
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,721
This here's the difference
between us leavin'
with the money

744
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:16,202
and gettin' our fucking
asses kicked by a bunch
of prizefighters, yeah?

745
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:18,247
All I'm sayin' is,
you're a little sloppy.

746
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:20,597
Listen, mate, I'm not the one
kippin' on the job, am I?

747
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:22,991
-That's you. Eh?
-Wouldn't be kippin'
If I didn't have to

748
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:24,601
fuckin' drive this piece of shit
for fuckin' hours across--

749
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:26,168
Yeah? Whatever!
Come on, let's get in there,

750
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:27,604
before the rest turn up. Yeah?

751
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,224
Fuckin' hell.

752
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,069
The smell, Frenchie.

753
00:39:57,156 --> 00:39:59,593
Something you never forget.
The smell.

754
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,565
Hey, hey-hey!

755
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:18,612
Fellas, you can't just
walk in and hit the bag!

756
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:21,093
Right? You gotta check in,
you gotta sign a waiver.

757
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,182
- We ain't takin'
new members right now.

758
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,272
All right? So, hey, gramps.
Gramps. Take it easy!

759
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:28,709
All right? We don't
wanna have to break out
the defibrillator for you.

760
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:30,929
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about him, mate.

761
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:33,801
-He's tougher than he looks.
-Yeah, I ain't worried, pal.

762
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:36,935
-I'm tellin' you two assholes,
get the fuck outta my gym.
-Ooh!

763
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:39,198
Ah, there's no need
for language like that, pal.

764
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:40,764
We're here to see
Mr. Madrid. OK?

765
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,418
So, hop along
and get him, would ya?

766
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:47,032
Fuck off.

767
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,121
Listen, mate. If you're
gonna get saucy,

768
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,949
fuckin' do somethin'. All right?

769
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:52,733
'Cause I ain't got time
to piss about,

770
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,169
comparing whose is bigger.

771
00:40:54,256 --> 00:40:57,216
If you knew me,
you'd know that mine is.

772
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:03,222
Oh, right. OK.
You're a tough guy, are ya?

773
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:04,223
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

774
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,573
-Little bit.
-OK.

775
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,010
Well, y'know this confidence
that you're showin' me right
now?

776
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:10,707
It's fuckin' blind, mate.

777
00:41:10,794 --> 00:41:13,449
'Cause you don't
know me from Adam.

778
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:15,930
But what you need to know
is that I'm the bloke

779
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,845
who's just walked
into a boxing club

780
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:20,587
and stepped up
to the brashest gobshite

781
00:41:20,674 --> 00:41:21,980
who ever wanted
a crack at the title,

782
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:23,938
and I'm callin' him a cunt.

783
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:27,115
And I'm doin' it in front
of all of his boyfriends, too.

784
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:28,987
Yeah?

785
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:31,815
So, either that makes me
the biggest dog in the yard...

786
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,427
or a complete, fuckin' nutcase.

787
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,690
Either way, mate, do as I said.

788
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,910
Hop along, get your boss, yeah?

789
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,261
OK.

790
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:44,002
I will get Mr. Madrid.

791
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:46,091
-Yeah, you do that.
-Yeah. He'll sort this shit out.

792
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:54,055
Wow. You know, for someone
who doesn't like his job,

793
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,578
you really know how to

794
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,537
throw yourself into it,
Frenchie. Nice.

795
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,582
Just tryin' to get this done
and put this shite behind us.

796
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:00,844
Besides,

797
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,846
they're only boxers, right?

798
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,640
Vaughan, tell Sugar
to come join us.

799
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:16,773
Tommy said you'd be stopping by.

800
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,254
Good. Then we won't have to
go 'round and 'round.

801
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:21,648
Ninety-five large.
Let's have it.

802
00:42:21,735 --> 00:42:23,476
That money was
a sponsorship deal,

803
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:25,217
backin' one of my boys.

804
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:28,829
Wasn't a loan,
so, it's not a debt.

805
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,136
I don't borrow money
I can't pay back.

806
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:32,920
So, it's now our money.

807
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:34,835
So, you can tell Tommy
where he can stick it.

808
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:38,839
Always seems to get complicated,
doesn't it, Sue?

809
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,449
Yeah, well, we
wouldn't have a job

810
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:41,537
if it didn't, Frenchie.

811
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:43,191
OK, so look.

812
00:42:43,278 --> 00:42:45,237
I've been doing this
a very long time, yeah?

813
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,369
-So--
-I know.

814
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,024
You bested one of my prospects,
back in the day.

815
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,678
You ruined his title shot.

816
00:42:51,765 --> 00:42:53,245
Oh, you know who he is then.

817
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:54,855
And you should also know
that he's heard

818
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:56,770
every goddamn excuse
in the book.

819
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:58,641
So, listen, mate. We're in
nice and early, aren't we?

820
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:00,556
Do me a favor,
give us the money and...

821
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,167
we'll leave you be.

822
00:43:02,254 --> 00:43:03,646
-Oh? That's all you want?
-That's right.

823
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:05,257
-Hm?
-Yeah.

824
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:07,041
You know, if you're
serious about boxing,

825
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:09,739
you should never fight
outside your weight division.

826
00:43:09,826 --> 00:43:12,525
Sugar! Get in here!

827
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,141
These two are here to reclaim
your sponsorship cash.

828
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:21,795
Without it, you'll be broke.

829
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:25,755
No sparring partners,
no camp, no expenses.

830
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:27,757
We'll see about that.

831
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:31,370
Which one of you pussies
is gettin' your gloves on?

832
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:34,025
-I think that'll be you, mate.
-Yeah.

833
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,679
Too much of a sweet science
for me anyway, right?

834
00:43:36,766 --> 00:43:38,725
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

835
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:41,075
I guess it's you.

836
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,473
Let me tell you somethin'.
After I win,

837
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,605
I'm gonna take that
fuckin' money. Trust me.

838
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:50,867
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

839
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:52,130
You ain't gonna win.

840
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:54,784
Pick up the gloves, old man.

841
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,310
I got this, French.

842
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:05,099
Let's go, man.

843
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:20,462
C'mon, mate, doesn't go against
your new, uh, pacifist code?

844
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,900
This isn't unnecessary
violence, Frenchie.

845
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:25,380
It's a sport,
in its purest form.

846
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,295
Two athletes in their prime.

847
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:31,169
Yeah, but you ain't either,
let's be honest.

848
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:33,040
- And, here we go!
-Go on, Golden Boy! Let's go!

849
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:35,390
Come on, mate!

850
00:44:36,913 --> 00:44:38,219
Find the distance. C'mon!

851
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:42,658
Whoa-whoa!
It's OK! it's all right.

852
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,618
C'mon, Sue! We can do this!

853
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:50,492
Stake you move, mate. Come on!

854
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,282
Yes!

855
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:00,546
Golden Boy's up in the house!
Come on, mate!

856
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:01,721
You can do this!

857
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,377
C'mon, mate, take your time!
Don't lose him!

858
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,032
Why you waitin' there? Come on!

859
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,909
What you waitin' there, Sue!
Find a way in, mate!

860
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:17,389
Go on, mate!

861
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,264
Ohh! Oh shit.

862
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:26,006
-You all right?

863
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,442
-You good?
-Ugh!

864
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,923
C'mon, mate! Look at me.

865
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,272
-C'mon, mate. Up you get.

866
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,969
Frenchie, I think
he moved a bullet.

867
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:35,929
Just fucking go for it!

868
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:38,801
Oi, you filthy twat!

869
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:40,368
-The fuck was that?

870
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:42,631
-Fucker's a twat!
-Fuck you, piece of shit!

871
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,416
Sue. C'mon, mate, get up.

872
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:46,418
Come on, you can
do it. Let's go.

873
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:48,942
Frenchie, I've got three fuckin'
Adam's apples. I'm done.

874
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:50,726
If you don't do this, we're
never gonna get that money.

875
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,946
C'mon, mate, you can do it!
Golden Boy, Let's go!

876
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:56,297
You gonna sub in for ya boy?

877
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:58,125
I'm tired of watching
him breathe!

878
00:45:58,212 --> 00:45:59,561
Frenchie! Listen to me.

879
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:00,823
No matter what,
we're leavin' here

880
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:01,824
with the fuckin' money.

881
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:03,261
Go! Go do your thing.

882
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:07,526
-Same terms?
-Same terms, English.

883
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:08,831
-Fuckin' on then.
-Come on, then.

884
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:10,181
Come on, Frenchie!

885
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,489
OK. Here's my little pep talk.

886
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:16,970
You're aware of the Marquess
of Queensbury Rules, right?

887
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,190
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well, fuck 'em!

888
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,539
Go do your thing.

889
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:21,975
He's on your six.

890
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:46,347
C'mon, Frenchie!

891
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,138
Come on.

892
00:47:02,276 --> 00:47:04,452
You're good. Go after him!

893
00:47:15,158 --> 00:47:17,944
- Oh!
-What the fuck, man?

894
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:20,251
- Dirty!
-What the fuck
is this guy doin'?

895
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,469
Force of habit, mate.

896
00:47:22,514 --> 00:47:23,732
So, sorry.

897
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:27,127
There you go!

898
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:28,781
Just keep those fucking
gums chewing then.

899
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:30,304
Come on.

900
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,963
There you go!

901
00:47:49,192 --> 00:47:50,846
-Aah!

902
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:57,026
Jesus.

903
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:00,203
-Get the fuck out!

904
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:03,729
Shut the fuck up!
Get the fuck out!

905
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:08,124
Stay down, motherfucker!

906
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:11,867
Stop! I'll blow
your fuckin' heads off!

907
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:13,956
-Get the fuck off of me!
-Get in the corner!

908
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:15,306
You stay in the corner!

909
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:20,920
Stay right there.

910
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:23,314
-Gimme the gun, Sue!
-Here ya go. Take that.

911
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,011
Get up, motherfucker.
We're goin' to get that money!

912
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:27,143
- Fuck you!
-Get in there!

913
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,449
Get over there!

914
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:31,191
Come on, Sue!

915
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,024
What is this?

916
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:39,678
There's two too many.

917
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:41,810
We're not a robbery,
we're here on business.

918
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:43,899
Yeah? That's sponsorship money.

919
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:46,119
Gifted to us by fucking Barbosa.

920
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:48,208
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, what'd you say?

921
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:50,036
You said Barbosa?

922
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:53,082
You fuckin' heard me.
Fuckin' sucker punched me.

923
00:48:53,169 --> 00:48:55,607
Yeah, I've got a bad habit
of doin' that. I'm sorry.

924
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:58,261
Stay here, yeah?
Don't you fuckin' move.

925
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,915
Don't you fuckin' move!

926
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,745
Gimme the bag, Frenchie!

927
00:49:03,832 --> 00:49:05,486
And the gun! Come on.

928
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:12,972
Let's get the fuck
outta here, yeah?

929
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:16,279
OK, let's go!

930
00:49:17,672 --> 00:49:19,544
-Get his ass!

931
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:26,812
Actually, the kid was a ringer.

932
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:28,466
Let me tell ya.
He was very good.

933
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:29,945
The kid could've been
a good champion,

934
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:31,643
until you went
and splintered his forearm

935
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,079
like you did. Y'know?

936
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:35,081
It was very cold,
Frenchie. Very cold.

937
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:37,518
Yeah, well, I told you boxing's
no match for MMA, didn't I?

938
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:39,564
A lot of people would
consider that cheating.

939
00:49:39,651 --> 00:49:43,219
I'll tell you somethin' else,
Frenchie. You've changed.

940
00:49:43,306 --> 00:49:44,743
And you've got a tone.

941
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:48,921
So, where are we
off to next, anyway?

942
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:51,097
Mm, OK.

943
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,751
Let's have a look at this.

944
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:54,405
OK.

945
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:57,538
Give it to me.

946
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,500
Canoga park. Deep in the Valley.

947
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:03,936
Joyous.

948
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:08,157
Cyrus Skinner, $255,000.
Jesus Christ.

949
00:50:08,244 --> 00:50:10,246
-Saved the heftiest
for last then?

950
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,074
That's right, Frenchie.
That was the plan, brother.

951
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,902
-Heads up.
-OK.

952
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,121
What are these two doin' here?

953
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,905
Don't worry about it, Frenchie.

954
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:17,993
Play it cool. OK?

955
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:30,528
Damn, you boys
are right on course.

956
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:33,008
Two down and one to go, huh?

957
00:50:36,055 --> 00:50:39,885
You OK, though?
'Cause you boys look fucked up!

958
00:50:43,018 --> 00:50:46,805
-Ask him, man.
-A'ight. Down-and-out.

959
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:48,763
Ol' 'E' here reckons he saw you

960
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,810
in some, uh,
cheap-ass kung-fu film.

961
00:50:51,897 --> 00:50:55,727
-Ninja. You're the
fucking Ninja.
-Jesus Christ.

962
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:59,295
The movie Ninja. The kung-fu
movie Ninja. That's you, right?

963
00:50:59,382 --> 00:51:01,907
Actually, you would be correct,
gentlemen. That is me, yes.

964
00:51:01,994 --> 00:51:05,214
-Told you so, man. I told you!
-You liked that movie, yeah?

965
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:07,042
Me and my brothers used to watch
that movie all the time

966
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:09,349
when we were kids, man.

967
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,351
Used to watch that shit
over and over again.

968
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:13,962
-Wow.
-But I ain't fucking
with you today, man.

969
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:16,748
Despite that bein' the best
ninja movie I've ever seen.

970
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:18,532
Hang on a minute.
Are you tellin' me

971
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,968
you've actually seen his movie?

972
00:51:20,055 --> 00:51:21,535
And that it was good?

973
00:51:21,622 --> 00:51:23,972
Bro! This fucker
used to be the shit, man.

974
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:25,104
Yeah?

975
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:26,584
You had that somethin' special.

976
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:30,631
And what the fuck
happened to you?

977
00:51:30,718 --> 00:51:33,634
Same thing that's gonna happen
to you two boys.

978
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:36,463
It's called life.
Yeah? It's called life.

979
00:51:37,377 --> 00:51:38,857
Well, maybe you can use

980
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:41,599
some of your ninja skills
for your next job.

981
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:43,731
-Cyrus Skinner.
-Let me as you a question--

982
00:51:43,818 --> 00:51:45,124
Don't worry about it, Frenchie.
It's OK.

983
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:46,778
No, I wanna ask
a question, a'right?

984
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,258
If you two are so on the ball,
right, so gangster,

985
00:51:49,345 --> 00:51:51,043
how come we're
collectin' the debts?

986
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,479
Why not do it yourselves. Eh?

987
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:54,525
Well...

988
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,528
'cause Molly wants
to see you bleed

989
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,660
for every buck he's owed.

990
00:52:00,879 --> 00:52:02,315
What you talkin' about, mate?

991
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:03,621
-Don't worry.
-What you talkin' about?

992
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,100
-No, I'm worried!
-It's OK.

993
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:06,537
No, I'm worried
about it. Who's Molly?

994
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,017
Oh, you'll find out.

995
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:11,498
Find out what, mate?
Oi, I asked you a question!

996
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:13,282
C'mon, Frenchie.
What the fuck do they know?

997
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:14,806
They're not talkin'
about anything.

998
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,024
C'mon, finish up. We gotta go.

999
00:52:16,111 --> 00:52:17,852
Don't worry about it.

1000
00:52:17,939 --> 00:52:19,767
I'm gonna make a quick
phone call. I'll be right back.

1001
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:38,786
Tell me you didn't know.

1002
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,441
Sulinski--

1003
00:52:41,528 --> 00:52:43,704
Tell me it's as much a surprise
to you as it is to me

1004
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:46,533
that we're collecting Barbosa's
money for his brother Molly.

1005
00:52:48,404 --> 00:52:51,582
We've had a good run,
Golden Boy.

1006
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,715
If I were you,
I'd take that money and run.

1007
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:56,108
-Get the fuck outta he--

1008
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:06,335
Hey, hey. This is, uh,
Molly X, your new boss.

1009
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:10,252
Listen. You owe me
one more collection.

1010
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:12,820
So, bring that gold to Molly,

1011
00:53:12,907 --> 00:53:15,214
and I might cream
off the vig for you.

1012
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:19,261
And your boy Tommy
can breathe easy again.

1013
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,621
Sorry, Tommy. I tried.

1014
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:21,715
Let's go, Tommy.

1015
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:22,847
It's OK, Pete.

1016
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:36,121
You hate LA, but here you are.

1017
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,252
Sit down.

1018
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,997
Ah, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

1019
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:45,086
I actually
love Los Angeles, man.

1020
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:48,394
I get my... Stacy Adams shined

1021
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:50,657
and shaved by brothers
on Slauson.

1022
00:54:50,744 --> 00:54:52,398
I get my suits tailor made

1023
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:55,357
at Market and Manchester
in Inglewood.

1024
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:57,533
I got love
for the West Coast, man.

1025
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,709
Cutty.

1026
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:02,103
Good lookin'.

1027
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:05,890
But what I do hate...

1028
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:09,154
is liars.

1029
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:16,291
Now, either somebody gave you
some fucked up information,

1030
00:55:16,378 --> 00:55:19,033
or you straight lied to me, man.

1031
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,037
The nature of my business
depends on information.

1032
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,997
That said, I'm not
the Encyclopedia Britannica.

1033
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:27,650
I get mine from the streets,

1034
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:29,609
so why don't you tell me
why you're here, Molly?

1035
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:31,480
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1036
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:34,092
French and Sue.

1037
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,963
You assured me they were wasted

1038
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,531
in the same shootout
that cost me my blood.

1039
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:40,446
A killin' that you
swore to my face

1040
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:42,927
that you had no hand in.

1041
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:45,451
Your brother Barbosa
was a client.

1042
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:47,975
It's bad business
to kill clients.

1043
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:50,021
So, your boys capped him
in self-defense,

1044
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:51,805
before the rest
of my brother's crew

1045
00:55:51,892 --> 00:55:53,633
cut them all down
in a blaze of glory.

1046
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,896
-That's what you said, man.
-That's what I said.

1047
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:59,117
So, if that's
the straight-up truth...

1048
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:01,510
Why do I have
emissaries out here,

1049
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:03,295
from Inglewood to Hollywood,

1050
00:56:03,382 --> 00:56:05,688
sayin' that French and Sue
was walkin' and talkin'

1051
00:56:05,776 --> 00:56:08,691
and having a fine-ass time
here in the streets of So Cal?

1052
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:11,694
They're mistaken.

1053
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,179
You're cold-blooded, Felix.

1054
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:20,399
That's not a wise choice
of words, Tommy.

1055
00:56:23,576 --> 00:56:26,013
Let me have
a little peek up in there.

1056
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,363
What can I say, Molly?

1057
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,888
Y-you seem to be
three steps ahead of me.

1058
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,455
You lied to my fuckin' face.

1059
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:36,763
You disrespected
my brother's memory.

1060
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:41,986
So, for your part in all this,
you gots to pay in blood equity.

1061
00:56:42,073 --> 00:56:44,423
Cutty, let's be out.

1062
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:51,082
You see,

1063
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:52,692
my brother had
three sizable debts

1064
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,999
that needed collectin'
before he was killed.

1065
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:57,436
Tabs I can't be associated with.

1066
00:56:57,523 --> 00:56:59,917
So, you're gonna have
your two goodfellas,

1067
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:03,311
French and Sue, close out
Barbosa's accounts for me.

1068
00:57:03,398 --> 00:57:05,139
They don't work for me anymore.

1069
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:07,663
You're gonna make sure they do.
Because if you don't,

1070
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,622
I'm gonna be takin'
that fuckin' handsome head

1071
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:11,145
across the Bay Bridge with me.

1072
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:16,194
You got 48 hours.

1073
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:33,559
So, you gonna tell me
who this Molly is then?

1074
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:35,778
I don't know, Frenchie.
I don't know.

1075
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:37,041
One collection left.

1076
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:38,129
Let's just get it done

1077
00:57:38,216 --> 00:57:39,347
and get the money to Tommy.

1078
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:42,046
This is it, here, isn't it?

1079
00:57:42,133 --> 00:57:43,569
Let's take a look at the vig.

1080
00:57:44,526 --> 00:57:46,311
This is it, 7044, mate.

1081
00:57:46,398 --> 00:57:47,878
-Harley fucking Davidson, right?
-Is that it, Frenchie?

1082
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:52,534
Oh, Christ.

1083
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:54,232
I tell you,
I fuckin' hate this job.

1084
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,755
Yeah, but you're good at it.

1085
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:08,724
That's our cue, Frenchie.
Perfect timing.

1086
00:58:08,811 --> 00:58:10,248
Y'know what?

1087
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:12,598
Park the car
over there by the alleyway.

1088
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:34,228
Let's get this done as quickly
as possible, yeah?

1089
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,974
Whoa, whoa-whoa, wait a minute.
What are you thinkin'?

1090
00:58:41,061 --> 00:58:43,585
Look. I'm sick of gettin'
in these punch-ups with
these people, right?

1091
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:45,109
Let's just get it
done quick, yeah?

1092
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:46,632
You make me nervous, Frenchie.

1093
00:59:12,092 --> 00:59:14,529
Oi! Switch it off!

1094
00:59:18,577 --> 00:59:20,579
-You guys need somethin'?
-Cyrus Skinner.

1095
00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:24,539
-He expecting you?
-I couldn't give a fuck, mate.

1096
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:26,150
What'd you say?

1097
00:59:26,237 --> 00:59:28,239
I said, we're lookin'
for Cyrus Skinner,

1098
00:59:28,326 --> 00:59:30,415
so be a good boy,
run along and find him,

1099
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:32,460
before I kick
the fuckin' shit out of you.

1100
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:33,679
It's OK!

1101
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:36,725
It's all right, Knuckle.

1102
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:39,380
Take a break
from grindin' that bead.

1103
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:41,643
These lads are here
to see me.

1104
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,558
-Come on.
-Fuck off.

1105
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:47,910
Yeah, Tommy called me
and told me that

1106
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:52,002
you two might swing by.

1107
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,960
Spoke to Tommy, that's good.

1108
00:59:54,047 --> 00:59:56,354
So, you've rustled up
the cash for us, then?

1109
00:59:56,441 --> 00:59:58,747
Uh-uh.

1110
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:01,228
That ain't never gonna happen.

1111
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:06,103
I am not paying Tommy
one fucking, red cent.

1112
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,323
The loan done died
with the lender. Capisce?

1113
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,933
C'mon. You can understand that.

1114
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:12,979
It's OK, Frenchie.
It's OK. I got it.

1115
01:00:13,066 --> 01:00:14,372
Come on, Cyrus.
What's wrong with you?

1116
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:16,026
Be nice. You know
how it works, right?

1117
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:18,550
Loan was transferred
and was reactivated, OK?

1118
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,334
You owe money.
You don't get to keep the money.

1119
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,294
Yeah, well, y'know,
I was really, really hoping

1120
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:26,210
that you two would not
try to underestimate me.

1121
01:00:26,297 --> 01:00:27,472
Well, listen to me, asshole.

1122
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:29,039
You've already spoke to Tommy,

1123
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,736
then we don't have to
tell you who we are

1124
01:00:30,823 --> 01:00:32,216
and what we get paid to do.

1125
01:00:32,303 --> 01:00:33,739
No. I know.

1126
01:00:33,826 --> 01:00:36,350
You fucking, English cunt!

1127
01:00:36,437 --> 01:00:39,223
Do you really think
you can intimidate me?

1128
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,877
You too, you little,
fuckin' cocksucker!

1129
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:43,357
I was dealing
with assholes like you,

1130
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:44,576
while you were still
in fuckin' nappies!

1131
01:00:44,663 --> 01:00:46,186
That's it! Fucking had enough.

1132
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:47,318
You're gonna go up there,
and you're gonna

1133
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:48,449
get the money right now!

1134
01:00:48,536 --> 01:00:49,711
Frenchie! What are you doin'?

1135
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:50,669
-Put the--
-No, Sue! Shut up!

1136
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:52,888
What?

1137
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:55,108
You think this scares me?

1138
01:00:55,195 --> 01:00:56,675
-Oi! Get back!
-Frenchie, don't shoot.

1139
01:00:56,762 --> 01:00:59,069
No, shut up, Sue!
No! Fucking sick of this.

1140
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,375
You get up there, right now.
You get the money.

1141
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:03,334
Fuck you! why don't you pull
the fuckin' trigger?

1142
01:01:03,421 --> 01:01:05,031
Get your money! Do it!

1143
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:06,424
Stop!

1144
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,132
Stay right fuckin' there!

1145
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,313
OK.

1146
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:28,663
OK, Cyrus, so...

1147
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:31,449
listen to me.

1148
01:01:31,536 --> 01:01:33,320
You can tell me
to go fuck myself, right?

1149
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:34,582
-But be smart,

1150
01:01:34,669 --> 01:01:36,018
'cause right about now,

1151
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,629
your bones are all
startin' to break.

1152
01:01:37,716 --> 01:01:40,022
Floatin' in little pieces
around your orbital.

1153
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,024
Soon you're gonna
lose sight in one eye.

1154
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:44,026
Maybe lose a little
cognitive reasoning.

1155
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,072
But that doesn't matter,
Cyrus. Wanna know why?

1156
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:47,508
Because I'm gonna
keep hittin' you.

1157
01:01:49,597 --> 01:01:51,295
And you know what, Cyrus?

1158
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:52,644
One day, really soon,
you're gonna

1159
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:54,515
be able to eat dinner
through a straw.

1160
01:01:54,602 --> 01:01:56,735
With one good eye. So, just
tell us where the money is, hey?

1161
01:01:56,822 --> 01:01:58,563
Come on. There you go.

1162
01:02:00,478 --> 01:02:02,132
Knuckle. Go.

1163
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,526
Go to my office and...
and get the bag.

1164
01:02:05,613 --> 01:02:07,093
Go.

1165
01:02:09,095 --> 01:02:11,228
Hey, Knuckle!

1166
01:02:12,794 --> 01:02:14,927
Don't do anything stupid,
all right?

1167
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,500
Good job with the, uh,
non-violence thing, by the way.

1168
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:24,371
Doin' a real good job there,
mate. Impressive.

1169
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:25,981
Are you kiddin' me, Frenchie?
I had to do somethin'.

1170
01:02:26,068 --> 01:02:27,766
You were gonna put
a bullet in the old man.

1171
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,378
I wasn't actually
gonna shoot him, was I?

1172
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:33,554
What, you think I'm a fucking
psychopathic murderer?

1173
01:02:33,641 --> 01:02:35,034
I was just tryin'
to shit him up.

1174
01:02:40,213 --> 01:02:41,345
Fucking running!

1175
01:02:41,432 --> 01:02:42,650
Go after him!

1176
01:02:42,737 --> 01:02:43,738
Give me the gun
and go after him!

1177
01:02:43,825 --> 01:02:46,001
Give me the gun! Go after him!

1178
01:03:27,695 --> 01:03:28,827
Hey, come here!

1179
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:36,922
Ugh!

1180
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:44,364
Fuckin' hell.

1181
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:21,053
Jesus Christ!

1182
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,819
Gimme that fuckin' bag. Now!

1183
01:04:47,906 --> 01:04:51,953
-Ugh!
-Jesus Christ.

1184
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,564
What was that? Acrobatics?

1185
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:54,826
-You in the circus?

1186
01:04:54,913 --> 01:04:56,871
It's parkour, bro.

1187
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,090
I wanna be a stuntman.

1188
01:04:58,177 --> 01:04:59,613
You should see me on a bike.

1189
01:05:00,353 --> 01:05:02,573
Stuntman?

1190
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,750
Nah-nah, mate.
Nah, that's a terrible idea.

1191
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:07,142
That's dangerous!

1192
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:11,190
You're lucky I didn't
kick the shit out of ya.

1193
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:12,452
You just did.

1194
01:05:20,025 --> 01:05:21,069
We good, Frenchie?

1195
01:05:22,941 --> 01:05:24,638
Yeah, looks like we're good.

1196
01:05:24,725 --> 01:05:27,467
Good. Let's pack it up
and get outta here, yeah?

1197
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:29,382
Get it back to Tommy.
He can give it to Molly.

1198
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:31,906
And we can put the whole fucking
universe back into balance.

1199
01:05:31,993 --> 01:05:33,038
Molly?

1200
01:05:34,474 --> 01:05:36,476
You're talkin' about Barbosa's

1201
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:38,783
psychotic,
fucking brother Molly?

1202
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:41,263
-What'd you just say?

1203
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:44,310
If Molly's taken over
Barbosa's loans,

1204
01:05:44,397 --> 01:05:45,920
you two are so fucked.

1205
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,531
Sue, did you just hear
what he just said?

1206
01:05:47,618 --> 01:05:48,967
We've been collecting
Barbosa's debts.

1207
01:05:49,054 --> 01:05:50,708
I know, Frenchie. I know.

1208
01:05:50,795 --> 01:05:52,449
-It's OK, it's OK, Frenchie.
-We're fucked!

1209
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:54,799
-Tommy fucking set--
-We'll talk about it outside!

1210
01:05:54,886 --> 01:05:56,714
Tell you everything
you wanna know. Outside.

1211
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:00,195
We'll be leaving you now, Cyrus.

1212
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:01,849
Yeah.

1213
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:06,288
You're gonna know pain
soon, bro.

1214
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,725
C'mon, gimme the keys.

1215
01:06:21,652 --> 01:06:22,740
French, you OK?

1216
01:06:26,918 --> 01:06:30,008
Just tell me, please,
that you didn't know

1217
01:06:30,095 --> 01:06:31,792
that these are Barbosa's debts

1218
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:33,577
we've been collecting
for the past two days.

1219
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:34,665
Just tell me that.

1220
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:42,063
I wasn't positive,
Frenchie. Not at first.

1221
01:06:43,717 --> 01:06:45,371
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

1222
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,765
I dunno, Frenchie.
Tommy calls me outta the blue,

1223
01:06:47,852 --> 01:06:49,854
he tells me he's got
this gangster breathin'
down his fuckin' neck

1224
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:51,725
and he tells me
it's serious, yeah?

1225
01:06:51,812 --> 01:06:54,206
Then he tells me he wants me to
collect three vigs in 48 hours.

1226
01:06:54,293 --> 01:06:56,991
He wants me to do it with you.
Yeah? Nobody else.

1227
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:59,907
Just you.
Specifically, just you!

1228
01:06:59,994 --> 01:07:01,996
Then when that thug walked
into the burger joint

1229
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,650
and mentioned
Molly's name, well...

1230
01:07:03,737 --> 01:07:05,086
what can I tell you, Frenchie?

1231
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:06,697
I started to put it all
together myself.

1232
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:08,089
And you didn't think to
tell me this before?

1233
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:09,526
C'mon, Frenchie,
you understand me.

1234
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:11,310
I was lookin' after Tommy, OK?

1235
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:13,225
Besides, the only thing
I do know is, if I told you,

1236
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:15,009
you wouldn't have
helped me out. Right?

1237
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:16,620
If you knew, you wouldn't
help me. Th-that I do know.

1238
01:07:16,707 --> 01:07:18,622
-No, I wouldn't have done.
-That's right.

1239
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,841
Do you know why? 'Cause I'm not
fucking stupid, that's why!

1240
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:22,321
-C'mon, I'm sorry, brother.
-Fuck off, mate!

1241
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:24,018
Frenchie, c'mon!

1242
01:07:24,105 --> 01:07:26,281
Brother, you're--.
C'mon, think about it.

1243
01:07:26,368 --> 01:07:28,022
Wait a minute.
We're three for three.

1244
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:29,850
We've a fuckin'
three-run home stretch.

1245
01:07:29,937 --> 01:07:31,635
Home stretch to what, mate?

1246
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:33,680
A den of fucking vipers?

1247
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:35,203
You're tellin' me
that you're gonna

1248
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,422
risk your life for this guy?

1249
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,946
Yeah. I am.

1250
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,731
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1251
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:42,646
What the fuck's wrong with ya?

1252
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:44,735
'Cause he's gonna
fuckin' die, Frenchie. OK?

1253
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:46,650
And you don't know him
like I know him.

1254
01:07:46,737 --> 01:07:48,390
Just--

1255
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:50,436
Just calm down for a second,
Frenchie. Just listen.

1256
01:07:52,482 --> 01:07:53,918
OK, look.

1257
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:55,441
When leukemia
took my little Milly,

1258
01:07:55,528 --> 01:07:57,748
I lost everything, yeah?
My wife.

1259
01:07:57,835 --> 01:07:58,836
My life was goin'
down the toilet.

1260
01:07:58,923 --> 01:08:00,185
It was fuckin' done!

1261
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:03,493
It was fuckin' done!
It was done.

1262
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,321
He was there for me yet again.

1263
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:08,976
You understand me? With you,
I spent a weekend with you.

1264
01:08:09,063 --> 01:08:11,805
Yeah. We busted some heads
and I call you my brother.

1265
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:13,851
But you gotta understand
what me and Tommy are

1266
01:08:13,938 --> 01:08:15,287
to understand how I really feel.

1267
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:16,549
You with me?

1268
01:08:17,768 --> 01:08:20,335
You gotta listen to me now. OK?

1269
01:08:20,422 --> 01:08:21,859
Just listen to me.

1270
01:08:23,295 --> 01:08:24,644
We should just do one.

1271
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:26,690
And get outta this shit
right now.

1272
01:08:26,777 --> 01:08:28,518
There's $250,000 in this bag,

1273
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,302
there's another $250,000
in the trunk of that car.

1274
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:31,825
I say we split the collection
down the fuckin' middle

1275
01:08:31,912 --> 01:08:33,697
and get out of here
while we still can.

1276
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:35,612
Don't do it, Frenchie.
OK, c'mon. Don't do it.

1277
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,049
Oh, fuck you, Sue! I'm doin' you
a favor here, mate. Right?

1278
01:08:38,136 --> 01:08:40,660
And I've earned this money,
so I'm fuckin' keepin' it!

1279
01:08:45,143 --> 01:08:47,232
Let go of the bag, Sue.

1280
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:49,321
I can't let you
take the bag, Frenchie.

1281
01:08:51,192 --> 01:08:53,238
Let go of the fucking bag, Sue.

1282
01:08:58,286 --> 01:08:59,331
Make me.

1283
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,427
Ah, Jesus, Frenchie!
I'm sorry, OK? Look.

1284
01:09:08,514 --> 01:09:11,517
Ring's off, I come in peace,
I didn't mean it, brother. OK?

1285
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:12,997
Why did you fuckin' hit me?

1286
01:09:13,084 --> 01:09:15,042
C'mon, Frenchie.
You fuckin' hit me--Uhh!

1287
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:22,310
OK. OK, that's it.
Just, just give me the bag.

1288
01:09:22,397 --> 01:09:25,052
-I'm not givin' you the bag.
-Well you got to gimme the bag.

1289
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:27,402
-I'm not givin' you
the fuckin' bag, Sue!
-I'm taking that fuckin' bag.

1290
01:09:31,929 --> 01:09:34,018
OK, just leave it.
Just fuckin' stop!

1291
01:09:35,846 --> 01:09:38,631
Frenchie, please, just c'mon.
OK, c'mon please!

1292
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:50,382
I'm takin' that bag, Sue.

1293
01:10:11,098 --> 01:10:12,404
Fuck!

1294
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:25,722
Damn.

1295
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:29,073
Now, what the fuck
are these idiots doin' now?

1296
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,901
Remember
that little conversation

1297
01:10:30,988 --> 01:10:32,990
we had about MMA
versus boxing? Yeah?

1298
01:10:33,077 --> 01:10:34,121
-I win.

1299
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,862
Aah!

1300
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:43,304
OK. Yeah?

1301
01:10:45,872 --> 01:10:47,265
Y'know, I was tryin' to give you

1302
01:10:47,352 --> 01:10:48,701
an easy way out
with that choke, Sue.

1303
01:10:48,788 --> 01:10:49,963
Know what I'm gonna
have to do now?

1304
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,791
I'm gonna have to fuck you up.

1305
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:53,532
Hey, you know how many times
I've heard that, Frenchie?

1306
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:56,013
What are you gonna do?
Gonna kick me?

1307
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,101
Uhh!

1308
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:39,621
OK. Come on.

1309
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,188
Come on then.

1310
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:42,712
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

1311
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:43,713
Come on then.

1312
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,931
Aah!

1313
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:56,682
Jeez, Frenchie, OK.

1314
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:02,079
-Y'know I gotta be honest, Sue.

1315
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,951
Always wondered who'd come out
on top, if it came down to it.

1316
01:12:05,038 --> 01:12:07,171
Yeah? Y'know what?

1317
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:11,915
Me too.

1318
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,445
C'mon!

1319
01:12:35,547 --> 01:12:37,114
That's for my coupe!

1320
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:41,292
C'mon.

1321
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:45,035
-Ah!
-C'mon!

1322
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:56,437
Yeah, boss?

1323
01:12:58,352 --> 01:13:00,964
Yeah, Tommy's boy
handled his business.

1324
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:04,315
Shi--They doin' that
to themselves right now.

1325
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,448
All right. We'll handle it.

1326
01:13:25,597 --> 01:13:27,773
You sneaky motherfucker!

1327
01:13:49,273 --> 01:13:51,492
Hey.

1328
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:53,364
I just want you to know
somethin', Frenchie.

1329
01:13:53,451 --> 01:13:55,018
I want you to know,
there's no fuckin' way

1330
01:13:55,105 --> 01:13:57,411
I can leave Tommy
to die like an animal.

1331
01:13:57,498 --> 01:13:59,196
Hope you understand that, yeah?

1332
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,765
What's up?

1333
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:04,941
Yeah?

1334
01:14:26,788 --> 01:14:29,879
Damn. You boys done fucked up!

1335
01:14:31,793 --> 01:14:36,320
I had money on you, Ninja.
You owe me a slice now.

1336
01:14:36,407 --> 01:14:39,497
Yeah, you're a couple of
tough guys you lot, aren't ya?

1337
01:14:39,584 --> 01:14:41,934
But it was us that got your
boss' money back, wasn't it?

1338
01:14:42,021 --> 01:14:43,414
So, there you go!

1339
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:46,156
Go on, take it!

1340
01:14:46,243 --> 01:14:48,723
-You can count on that,
motherfucker.

1341
01:15:12,486 --> 01:15:14,053
You go back there,

1342
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,316
you're a fucking dead man,
and you know it.

1343
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,581
The money's yours.

1344
01:15:20,668 --> 01:15:22,148
I'm takin' the truck.

1345
01:15:23,193 --> 01:15:24,281
Frenchie.

1346
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:20,005
Don't worry about me.

1347
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:22,225
Just worry
about the next two jobs.

1348
01:17:22,312 --> 01:17:24,618
I'm sorry,
I got you into this, Sue.

1349
01:17:24,705 --> 01:17:26,229
That's OK, Tommy. You know?

1350
01:17:26,316 --> 01:17:27,317
We go way back, yeah?

1351
01:17:27,404 --> 01:17:28,840
I owe you for things. Right?

1352
01:17:28,927 --> 01:17:31,712
You know how that goes.

1353
01:17:31,799 --> 01:17:35,586
We've had a good run,
Golden Boy.

1354
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:38,371
If I were you, and I got
that money, I'd disappear.

1355
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:40,069
Run.

1356
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:35,036
Hey, Molly.

1357
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:36,647
Look who's come to visit.

1358
01:18:36,734 --> 01:18:39,824
Fuck.
Why'd you come back?

1359
01:18:39,911 --> 01:18:41,521
That's far enough, motherfucker.

1360
01:18:44,437 --> 01:18:47,962
Cutty, pour me a shot
of that Rooster Rojo, will ya?

1361
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:53,142
My man, Sue.

1362
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,754
You got the J-U-ice.
I say that for you.

1363
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:59,452
Where's your road dog?
Mister Jiu-Jitsu.

1364
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,715
Lost his appetite for the job.

1365
01:19:01,802 --> 01:19:03,935
So, he left you
holdin' the bags, huh?

1366
01:19:04,022 --> 01:19:05,458
Eh, guess so.

1367
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:08,983
Don't you ever listen?

1368
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:12,335
What the fuck are you
doin' back here?

1369
01:19:12,422 --> 01:19:14,163
See, your man Tommy,
he lied to me, man.

1370
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,555
He said that you were dead.

1371
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:17,122
I mean, you look
kinda fucked up but...

1372
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:19,385
y-you, you don't look dead
to me, man.

1373
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:21,518
Actually, in Tommy's defense,

1374
01:19:21,605 --> 01:19:22,867
I did die.

1375
01:19:23,563 --> 01:19:25,043
Twice.

1376
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:27,132
So, you've been breathin'
on borrowed air.

1377
01:19:27,219 --> 01:19:28,307
Right, homes?

1378
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,744
Yeah, maybe so.

1379
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:32,877
Y'know, Molly,

1380
01:19:32,964 --> 01:19:34,792
I returned your brother's
bounty, right?

1381
01:19:34,879 --> 01:19:36,837
So, about you take
the cream off the vig,

1382
01:19:36,924 --> 01:19:38,926
you let Tommy go,
and we'll be on our way?

1383
01:19:39,013 --> 01:19:42,060
What do you say?
How's that sound, homes? Yeah?

1384
01:19:42,147 --> 01:19:43,888
Go on, Tommy. You're OK. Get up.

1385
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:46,107
Tommy.
Get up, let's go!

1386
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:48,458
Cutty. Shoot Tommy
if he moves, man.

1387
01:19:50,764 --> 01:19:52,679
Lemme ask you a question, Sue.

1388
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:55,029
Did you really think
that you would ever

1389
01:19:55,116 --> 01:19:56,988
be walkin' outta here
a free man?

1390
01:19:57,075 --> 01:19:58,946
Did you--did you
really think that?

1391
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:02,385
Felix, get my fuckin' dough!

1392
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:05,214
Now, go ahead. Take your money.

1393
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:07,085
It's all your money, Molly.

1394
01:20:07,172 --> 01:20:08,869
I don't give a fuck
about your money.

1395
01:20:10,523 --> 01:20:13,134
Come on! Don't you fuckin' move.

1396
01:20:13,222 --> 01:20:16,790
Or I will blow
her fuckin' head clean off!

1397
01:20:16,877 --> 01:20:19,097
You listen to me, Molly.
I ain't playin' games here.

1398
01:20:19,184 --> 01:20:21,708
You got your money,
you got what you fuckin' wanted.

1399
01:20:21,795 --> 01:20:24,798
You let me and Tommy go.
Real simple. Yeah?

1400
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:28,759
Shoot the fine bitch.
You think I give a fuck?

1401
01:20:28,846 --> 01:20:31,936
Some gangster shit.
M.O.B. No offense, Felix.

1402
01:20:32,023 --> 01:20:35,592
If you guys have a clean
shot, shoot this motherfucker!

1403
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,942
You see, you just put your money
on the wrong color, Sue.

1404
01:20:38,029 --> 01:20:40,858
Fuck you, I'll do it! Fuckin'
stay back you motherfuckers!

1405
01:20:40,945 --> 01:20:41,902
Felix.

1406
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:43,208
Stay back! Stay back!

1407
01:20:43,295 --> 01:20:44,862
Or I'll fuckin' blood you!

1408
01:20:44,949 --> 01:20:46,298
-Go ahead!

1409
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:08,102
You really
are a gangster, aren't you?

1410
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:19,940
Big Bo, hold that
for me, would ya?

1411
01:21:26,556 --> 01:21:29,080
Sue, that--
that must've hurt, man.

1412
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,256
Yeah, it did.

1413
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:33,954
Women, it's like
they always go for our nuts.

1414
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,129
I know.

1415
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:40,744
You do know what's gonna
happen next, all right?

1416
01:21:42,267 --> 01:21:44,051
I got a pretty good idea, yeah.

1417
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:46,924
You may be a little scared.

1418
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:53,409
Yeah. Actually, I am.

1419
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:56,063
Aw, man. That's honesty.

1420
01:21:57,456 --> 01:21:58,588
I like that.

1421
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,244
Hey, Molly.

1422
01:22:04,811 --> 01:22:07,858
Barbosa set my boys up to die.

1423
01:22:07,945 --> 01:22:09,599
I couldn't let that slide.

1424
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,253
So, yes,

1425
01:22:12,341 --> 01:22:14,734
I shot that piece of shit
brother of yours.

1426
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:16,823
And I'd do it again.

1427
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,783
See, it wasn't just business.

1428
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:23,003
I did it because he was
an evil piece of shit!

1429
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:25,441
You think I don't know
you set us up?

1430
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:28,269
Not after all the years.
You'll walk the line before me.

1431
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:33,274
Finally, you tell me the truth.

1432
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:36,713
But about murderin'
my brother...

1433
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,498
Ah, come on, Molly.
It's me you want, not Sue!

1434
01:22:39,585 --> 01:22:41,195
Let him walk outta here.

1435
01:22:41,282 --> 01:22:42,762
It's no shame on you!

1436
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,768
I always knew that it was you.

1437
01:22:48,855 --> 01:22:51,031
But now you're gonna suffer...

1438
01:22:51,118 --> 01:22:52,511
watchin' him suffer.

1439
01:22:54,774 --> 01:22:55,993
Cutty, hold that.

1440
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:00,911
You see this black beauty
right here?

1441
01:23:00,998 --> 01:23:04,044
She was trained in
the School for the Americas.

1442
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:06,786
Where the most devious
motherfuckers

1443
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:10,747
go to learn how to torture
and do fucked-up shit.

1444
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:12,357
She knows things.

1445
01:23:13,793 --> 01:23:16,274
I call her L.L.

1446
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:18,058
'Cause she loves to torture.

1447
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,715
Hey.

1448
01:23:24,543 --> 01:23:26,371
OK. Wow.

1449
01:23:28,373 --> 01:23:31,115
Listen. I know we have
this crazy connection.

1450
01:23:31,202 --> 01:23:32,769
I see it, too. I do.

1451
01:23:32,856 --> 01:23:35,467
I don't think now's
the time or the...

1452
01:23:35,554 --> 01:23:37,382
pla...

1453
01:23:37,469 --> 01:23:40,907
time or the place.
Know what I mean?

1454
01:23:40,994 --> 01:23:44,868
-Now you bite the wood, Sue.
-Y'know, Felix, I was thinkin'
maybe you could bite mine first.

1455
01:23:44,955 --> 01:23:47,566
-Unless you wanna bite
your own fuckin' tongue off,

1456
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:48,959
bite the wood, motherfucker!

1457
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,571
See, this is called
the Tucker Telephone.

1458
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:56,270
They used it on unruly prisoners
back in the Old South.

1459
01:23:56,357 --> 01:23:58,882
A long-distance phone call.
That's how they phrased it.

1460
01:23:58,969 --> 01:24:02,581
-Baby girl, light 'em up!

1461
01:24:16,421 --> 01:24:17,770
Fuck!

1462
01:24:22,253 --> 01:24:23,646
Bring him back.

1463
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:25,604
Fuck you!

1464
01:24:27,127 --> 01:24:29,869
Yeah, suffering.

1465
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:40,663
Three... two... one.

1466
01:24:48,018 --> 01:24:51,543
Don't fall asleep, Sue.
I'll use the adrenaline again,

1467
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:53,893
-and you don't wanna
have a heart attack.

1468
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:56,505
Baby girl, make
another long distance call.

1469
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,681
You don't have to
do that either.

1470
01:25:04,425 --> 01:25:05,688
Light him up.

1471
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:11,520
Everybody put your
fuckin' guns down, now!

1472
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,304
Get down on the floor now!

1473
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:14,914
Oh, shit.

1474
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:17,134
Fuckin' Jiu-Jitsu
I was tellin' you about.

1475
01:25:17,221 --> 01:25:19,266
I think the odds are
against you, mate!

1476
01:25:19,353 --> 01:25:21,399
I wouldn't be too sure
about that, mate.

1477
01:25:21,486 --> 01:25:23,357
Drop your weapons!

1478
01:25:23,444 --> 01:25:27,753
Don't wanna hurt anyone.
Just want the money.

1479
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,018
Bitch in the purple.
Get over there.

1480
01:25:32,105 --> 01:25:35,935
Anyone fuckin' moves,
stitch 'em to the wallpaper!

1481
01:25:36,022 --> 01:25:40,505
A'right, you two in the back!
Untie them, both of 'em!

1482
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:43,595
Untie them now!
I'm not fuckin' about!

1483
01:25:44,422 --> 01:25:45,902
I will shoot you.

1484
01:25:45,989 --> 01:25:47,643
Think I give a fuck?
I've been shot before.

1485
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:50,080
Places and faces,
motherfucker. I'll find you.

1486
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:51,690
Gonna turn around and a 6'5"

1487
01:25:51,777 --> 01:25:53,779
lightskinned nigga's
gonna be right there.

1488
01:25:53,866 --> 01:25:54,998
Bang-bang.

1489
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:57,478
Shut the fuck up and sit down.

1490
01:25:57,566 --> 01:26:00,656
Best shoot that bitch, man.

1491
01:26:00,743 --> 01:26:02,483
- Fuckin kill 'em all!

1492
01:26:25,942 --> 01:26:28,205
Get the fuck outta here,
Golden Boy!

1493
01:26:28,292 --> 01:26:30,511
I'll fuckin' drag you
outta here if I have to.

1494
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:44,047
Get the fuck outta here! Go!

1495
01:26:44,134 --> 01:26:46,353
Is that what you think?
I'm gonna drag you outta here

1496
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,529
if I fuckin' have to,
I didn't come all this way--

1497
01:26:48,617 --> 01:26:50,314
Take the fuckin' money!

1498
01:26:53,926 --> 01:26:58,104
No, no, no... No!

1499
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,608
Back up! Get down there!

1500
01:27:32,617 --> 01:27:34,532
Eat lead, bitch!

1501
01:27:52,419 --> 01:27:53,594
Go, go, go!

1502
01:27:55,118 --> 01:27:56,685
Bite this, bitch!

1503
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,243
Eat this, motherfucker!

1504
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,857
Get up! let's move!

1505
01:28:38,944 --> 01:28:40,816
Come on, Sue, let's go!

1506
01:28:40,903 --> 01:28:42,121
Come on!

1507
01:29:02,707 --> 01:29:03,926
You're gone now!

1508
01:29:09,583 --> 01:29:11,020
- C'mon.
-Now!

1509
01:29:13,283 --> 01:29:14,980
You fucking wankers!

1510
01:29:15,067 --> 01:29:16,373
Come on!

1511
01:29:22,074 --> 01:29:24,860
Here's your money with interest!

1512
01:29:24,947 --> 01:29:26,949
Jesus Christ, Frenchie,

1513
01:29:27,036 --> 01:29:29,125
what'd you do?
What have you done?

1514
01:29:29,212 --> 01:29:31,997
I got her number of the vig.
Made a deal to save your ass.

1515
01:29:32,084 --> 01:29:33,999
-Get in!
-Get in the car, Sue.

1516
01:29:36,567 --> 01:29:39,265
-Get in the fucking car!
-Ugh, Mal...

1517
01:29:44,531 --> 01:29:45,706
Fuck.

1518
01:30:20,654 --> 01:30:23,353
Well, I don't know, Frenchie,

1519
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,746
I'm thinkin' maybe I'm gonna
head back towards Vegas.

1520
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:27,661
What, with that crazy bitch?

1521
01:30:27,748 --> 01:30:29,489
Man, what can I tell you?
We're gettin' along these days.

1522
01:30:29,576 --> 01:30:30,839
Can you imagine?

1523
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,188
Why, she mellowed with age then?

1524
01:30:32,275 --> 01:30:33,798
Yeah, maybe she has.

1525
01:30:33,885 --> 01:30:36,061
Maybe she hasn't. Who knows?

1526
01:30:37,106 --> 01:30:38,890
What I do know is that, uh,

1527
01:30:38,977 --> 01:30:43,155
think it's time I bring a little
balance into my life, yeah?

1528
01:30:43,242 --> 01:30:46,463
Look, I'm sorry it didn't
go the way we wanted it
to with Tommy, mate.

1529
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:49,770
That's OK, Frenchie.
No need to apologize.

1530
01:30:49,858 --> 01:30:52,599
Not your fault, right?
We did the best we could.

1531
01:30:52,686 --> 01:30:56,647
Tommy was big boy,
knew what he was gettin' into.

1532
01:30:56,734 --> 01:31:00,259
By the way, you remember
what I said about me and Tommy?

1533
01:31:00,346 --> 01:31:04,089
Well, we go way back,
you know? Way back.

1534
01:31:04,176 --> 01:31:06,396
We've been
through a lot together.

1535
01:31:06,483 --> 01:31:09,138
But... me and him never
went through what you
and I went through.

1536
01:31:09,225 --> 01:31:10,704
So, I want you
to know somethin'.

1537
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:13,011
Anything you want,
any time, anywhere,

1538
01:31:13,098 --> 01:31:14,970
I'll be there for you.
All right?

1539
01:31:16,797 --> 01:31:19,626
It's funny you should say that,
actually, because, um...

1540
01:31:19,713 --> 01:31:22,934
Had an interesting phone call
this mornin' from my old boss.

1541
01:31:23,021 --> 01:31:25,981
He's got a mate who's settin' up
a gig in the East coast.

1542
01:31:26,068 --> 01:31:28,940
And he reckons that
my temperament might
be perfect for the job.

1543
01:31:29,027 --> 01:31:31,073
Gonna head out there.

1544
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,423
You're welcome
to join me if you want.

1545
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:35,381
You didn't have to take me up
on it so quick, Frenchie.

1546
01:31:37,383 --> 01:31:39,864
Besides, it's the East Coast.
You know, uh, it's cold.

1547
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:42,345
-I got brittle bones,
I'm an old man.
-Yeah.

1548
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:44,390
I'm gonna head back to Vegas.
It's where I need to be.

1549
01:31:44,477 --> 01:31:46,523
-Oh, come on, mate. Come on.
-Dry heat. It's the dry heat.

1550
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:49,352
No harm in seeing what they
gotta say, mate. Yeah? Come on.

1551
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:51,310
Security or collection?

1552
01:31:51,397 --> 01:31:54,531
Ah... more like
collection, I think.

1553
01:31:54,618 --> 01:31:55,967
Wait a minute. This is coming

1554
01:31:56,054 --> 01:31:57,708
from a man who told me
he hates the job.

1555
01:31:57,795 --> 01:32:00,450
I do hate this job, mate,
but it's like you said...

1556
01:32:00,537 --> 01:32:03,322
I'm pretty good at it.
So are you, actually.

1557
01:32:03,409 --> 01:32:05,063
Unless you think you're
gettin' too old for it.

1558
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:06,543
-Fuck you, Frenchie.

1559
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:07,674
Come on, mate.
What d'you say?

1560
01:32:07,761 --> 01:32:09,067
-Huh?

1561
01:32:11,635 --> 01:32:12,679
I'm good.

1562
01:32:13,637 --> 01:32:15,073
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1563
01:32:16,509 --> 01:32:18,120
Suit yourself, old man.

1564
01:32:22,646 --> 01:32:24,300
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Wait a minute.

1565
01:32:25,736 --> 01:32:27,477
What is this?

1566
01:32:27,564 --> 01:32:29,522
-I dunno, it's uh--
-Well, I'll tell you what it is!

1567
01:32:29,609 --> 01:32:31,916
This is a 360.
It's a small block.

1568
01:32:32,003 --> 01:32:33,613
It's an AMX, yeah?

1569
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,528
-Yeah.
-Seventy-two.

1570
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:37,530
-Jesus, Frenchie,
this is beautiful.

1571
01:32:37,617 --> 01:32:38,967
I know.

1572
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:40,925
Y'know what?
Maybe a meet and greet

1573
01:32:41,012 --> 01:32:42,666
never hurt anybody.
Am I right?

1574
01:32:42,753 --> 01:32:43,972
Never hurt anybody, mate.

1575
01:32:45,277 --> 01:32:46,496
May I?

1576
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,977
You may, sir. Be my guest.

1577
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:51,109
-Thank you, Mr. French.

1578
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:52,632
She's a beaut', right?

1579
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,330
She's beautiful, Frenchie.
You know what?

1580
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:55,809
Maybe am rubbin' off on you
a little bit. Yeah?

1581
01:32:55,896 --> 01:32:56,941
Little bit.

1582
01:32:58,725 --> 01:32:59,726
OK.

1583
01:33:03,121 --> 01:33:04,949
Ooh!

1584
01:33:09,954 --> 01:33:11,564
- Yeah!

1585
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:13,653
Hey. Listen, mate.
It's great,

1586
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,047
but it's still fuckin'
'French,' y'know?

1587
01:33:16,134 --> 01:33:17,875
Frenchie, don't be
so temperamental.

1588
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:19,572
I told you once,
I told you twice,

1589
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:21,096
it's a term of endearment, OK?

1590
01:33:21,183 --> 01:33:22,271
Must be out of your mind, man.

1590
01:33:23,305 --> 01:34:23,932

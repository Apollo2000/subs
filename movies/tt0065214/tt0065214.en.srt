2
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,379
Turn him over.

3
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,549
Oh, no!

4
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:26,185
<i>"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...</i>

5
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:29,021
<i>"thou, nor thy sons with thee...</i>

6
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,273
"lest ye shall die.

7
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,568
"Look not thou upon the wine
when it is red...

8
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,287
"and when it bringeth his color
in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

9
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:42,201
"At the last it biteth like a serpent...

10
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:44,453
"and stingeth like an adder."

11
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:45,955
Now, folks...

12
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:55,798
that's from the Good Book...

13
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,467
but in this here town...

14
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,803
it's five cents a glass.

15
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:02,430
Five cents a glass.

16
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:06,643
Does anyone really think
that that is the price of a drink?

17
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,897
The price of a drink? Let him decide...

18
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,984
who has lost his courage and his pride...

19
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:17,654
who lies a groveling
heap of clay not far removed...

20
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,130
All's quiet, sir.

21
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,299
Let's fall in.

22
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,938
Follow me.

23
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,248
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

24
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,501
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.

25
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,794
Thank you.

26
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:57,128
May I?

27
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,630
Thank you.

28
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,808
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

29
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,059
Take a look.

30
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:23,154
I don't care what you meant to do...

31
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,532
it's what you did I don't like.

32
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:34,082
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

33
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,042
and this railroad in the bargain.

34
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:39,129
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

35
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,339
Yes, sir, can I help you?

36
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:52,393
If they move, kill them.

37
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,774
Is he with them?

38
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,860
He's there.

39
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,446
Hold your fire! Get down!

40
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,239
Wait till they come out.

41
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,492
I can nail him.

42
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,206
I said, wait!

43
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,791
What if they slip out the back way?

44
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,961
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.

45
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,883
Abe?

46
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,814
I solemnly promise...

47
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,984
God helping me...

48
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,779
"I solemnly promise, God helping me."

49
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,283
...to abstain from all distilled,
fermented malt liquors...

50
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,245
including wine, beer and cider.

51
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,831
"To abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer."

52
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,779
People marching and singing,
coming down the street.

53
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,197
They're gonna pass by the horses.

54
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,824
We'll join them.

55
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,034
The Temperance Union?

56
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,375
They should have been told.

57
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,585
Told what?

58
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,670
How long do you think
anybody in this manure pile...

59
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,297
could keep his mouth shut?

60
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,391
<i>Yes, we'll gather at the river</i>

61
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,520
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

62
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,317
<i>Gather with the saints at the river</i>

63
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,611
Rifles.

64
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,115
One?

65
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,284
No, three!

66
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,250
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

67
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,754
Get down.

68
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,380
Son of a bitch!

69
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,967
- Lyle, Dutch.
- What are they, bounty hunters?

70
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,719
Hell, I wouldn't know.

71
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
Buck, with Abe.

72
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
- I kill them now?
- No.

73
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,935
Hold them here as long as you can
until after the shooting starts.

74
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,396
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

75
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,207
When I kick him out, blast them.

76
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,750
We'll make a run for it.

77
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,502
C.L., give me that shotgun.

78
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,048
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

79
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,885
<i>Gather with the saints at the river</i>

80
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,889
<i>That flows by the throne of God</i>

81
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,117
Set?

82
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,397
Let's go!

83
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,960
Good luck, boys!

84
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,193
They're blowing this town all to hell!

85
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,546
You're trash!

86
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,908
Now, you just hush now.

87
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,377
<i>They was playing Gather at the River.</i>

88
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:33,755
You know that one?

89
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,382
Sing it!

90
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,469
<i>Shall we gather at the river</i>

91
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,431
<i>Where bright angel feet have trod</i>

92
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,541
Hurry!

93
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:12,418
<i>River that flows by the throne of God</i>

94
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,441
Come on, you lazy bastard!

95
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:17,775
I'm coming, damn it!

96
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,366
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!

97
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:27,702
Let's go, T. C!

98
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:39,048
Put some more on!

99
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:53,979
Let's go!

100
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,098
Take him!

101
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,725
He's mine!

102
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:38,107
- He's mine!
- Mr. Harrigan.

103
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:39,859
He's mine!

104
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,195
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

105
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:46,365
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

106
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,867
You know I shot him.

107
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,870
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?

108
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,498
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Did he have any money?

109
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,086
Damn, I can't get his belt off!

110
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,550
You stupid, damn fools!

111
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,012
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

112
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,973
I didn't shoot that employee!
My first shot killed this man right here!

113
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,224
Liar!

114
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:17,688
He shot that employee while I was
dropping this bandit and them others, too.

115
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:19,899
I must've killed all three of them.

116
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:22,484
Killed all three of them?
What were we doing up on that roof?

117
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:25,821
Liar! Black liar!

118
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,907
You shouldn't talk like that to me.

119
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:31,202
I'm sorry.

120
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,623
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

121
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,837
I think this will do pretty good.

122
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:42,963
Harrigan!

123
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,843
Next time, you better plan the massacre
more carefully, or I'll start with you.

124
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:50,763
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

125
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,024
Stop!

126
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,364
Feathers flew like a turkey!

127
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,991
They shouldn't have run.

128
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:13,911
Say!

129
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,296
How'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

130
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:43,149
This is better than a hog-killing!

131
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,653
Get them out of here!

132
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:55,412
We're holding you and your whole damn
railroad responsible for this carnage!

133
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,622
- Mr. Benson...
- Innocent people are dead!

134
00:17:57,706 --> 00:18:01,418
Women dying and mangled because
you used our town as a battlefield!

135
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,921
You're going to pay! The railroad
is going to pay for our loss of blood!

136
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:07,424
We were trying to catch
a band of outlaws!

137
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,259
You lured that gang in here!

138
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:13,180
The railroad has been blabbing their
mouth about a big payload for weeks!

139
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,056
We represent the law!

140
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,629
Pike, is that you?

141
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,297
I can ride, Pike.

142
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:48,715
I can ride.

143
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,885
I can't see, but I can ride.

144
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,763
God!

145
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,223
No!

146
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,558
I can't ride.

147
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:00,310
Finish it.

148
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:34,427
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him...

149
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,513
a decent burial?

150
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:37,848
He was a good man.

151
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,516
I think we ought to bury him.

152
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,017
He's dead!

153
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,770
He's got a lot of good men back there
to keep him company!

154
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,272
Too damn many!

155
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:49,442
I think the boys are right.

156
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:53,572
I'd like to say a few words for the dear,
dead departed.

157
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:57,284
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

158
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,870
Followed by a church supper...

159
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:01,288
with a choir!

160
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:04,207
You crazy bastards, both of you!

161
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:19,139
Bishop, Engstrom, the Gorch brothers!

162
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:24,477
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

163
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:27,689
When the hard-money value
of the men you killed...

164
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:31,194
less my commission, adds up to $500!

165
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:35,615
Any one of those pelts would've
not only cleared you with the company...

166
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,992
but given you a bundle of money
to raise hell with!

167
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:40,161
We'll do better next time!

168
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:45,082
We'll do anything you say, but we sure
would appreciate liquor money for tonight.

169
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,836
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

170
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:52,006
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

171
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,592
If one of you tries to quit on me...

172
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:57,094
I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

173
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:59,639
to the man that kills him!

174
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:15,947
Let's pack it up then!

175
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:23,037
- Mr. Harrigan.
- Why should I let you go with them?

176
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,455
We've been over that.

177
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,623
You might run off with them.

178
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:27,834
Might even join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

179
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,545
What I like and what I need
are two different things.

180
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:31,921
Listen, Mr. Harrigan.

181
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,050
I don't want to go back to prison,
never again.

182
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,219
But it's got to be my way!
I need some good men!

183
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,887
You saw what happened
out there this morning!

184
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:43,182
You'll use what you have and you'll see
to it that it doesn't happen again...

185
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:45,685
or I'll see you spend the rest of your life
behind bars.

186
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,436
Try to run,
I'll be after you and so will they.

187
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,813
I gave you my word.

188
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,731
Well, we'll see what it's worth!

189
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,650
Six minutes.

190
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:56,821
Tell me, Mr. Harrigan, how does it feel...

191
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,698
getting paid for it?

192
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:04,579
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

193
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:07,540
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

194
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:08,916
Good.

195
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,085
You dirty son of a bitch!

196
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,047
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

197
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:18,009
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

198
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:22,847
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

199
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:26,309
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

200
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,959
<i>I don't see nothing so lindo about it.</i>

201
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,754
Just looks like more of Texas
as far as I'm concerned.

202
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:56,464
You have no eyes.

203
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:30,207
Got a half-hour of light. Let's go.

204
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:46,348
Hello, little fella.

205
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:32,144
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!

206
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:33,645
- None of them?
- No.

207
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:37,733
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.

208
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:15,062
Now, about the sharing up.

209
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:17,856
The sharing up will be the same as always.

210
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:22,694
Well, me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

211
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:27,157
He's just starting out, and this is mine
and Tector's opening for a new territory.

212
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:28,450
That's right.

213
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:31,453
And I figure a share to that old goat
for watching them horses...

214
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,455
is damn sure a share too much.

215
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:39,253
So, we decided...

216
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,588
it ain't fair.

217
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:47,511
If you two boys don't like equal shares,
why in the hell don't you just take all of it?

218
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:54,643
Well, why don't you answer me,
you damned, yellow-livered trash?

219
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:56,311
Now, Pike, you know damn well...

220
00:25:56,395 --> 00:26:00,899
I don't know a damned thing except that
I either lead this bunch or end it right now.

221
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:08,782
All right.

222
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,578
We divide it up just like you say.

223
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:16,206
Chick, chick, chick, chick.

224
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:33,099
Silver rings.

225
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,519
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

226
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,564
Bastards!

227
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:42,233
Washers!

228
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:46,487
Washers!

229
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:53,828
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

230
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,039
They set it up!

231
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:58,625
They? Who in the hell is "they"?

232
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:05,965
"They?"

233
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,762
Why, "they" is just plain and fancy "they."

234
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:12,472
That's who "they" is.

235
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:16,476
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

236
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,479
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

237
00:27:21,314 --> 00:27:23,191
Oh, my, what a bunch!

238
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,568
Big tough one!

239
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,241
Here you are with a handful of holes,
a thumb up your ass...

240
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:34,577
and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

241
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,829
"They!"

242
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:38,998
Who the hell is "they"?

243
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,297
Railroad men.

244
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,800
Bounty hunters.

245
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,511
Deke Thornton.

246
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:53,805
Deke Thornton?

247
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,432
He was one of them?

248
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:01,187
How the hell come you didn't know that?

249
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:02,897
<i>Hey, gringo.</i>

250
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,070
You can have my silver.

251
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,241
<i>Come on, gringo, don't kill me.</i>

252
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:19,831
You can have the silver.

253
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,042
But don't kill me.

254
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,669
Please?

255
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,967
Go on...

256
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:33,219
go for it.

257
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,388
Fall apart.

258
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:40,018
Walk softly, boys.

259
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,299
What's our next move?

260
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,302
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

261
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,597
Three days, maybe.

262
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:19,517
We'll get the news and drift to the border.

263
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,561
Maybe a payroll, maybe a bank.

264
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:24,730
Maybe that damn railroad!

265
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:28,817
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure as hell ain't getting no easier.

266
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:31,529
And you boys ain't getting
any younger, either.

267
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:35,032
We gotta start thinking beyond our guns.

268
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,660
Those days are closing fast.

269
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:49,839
All your fancy planning and talking
damn near got us shot to pieces...

270
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,550
over a few lousy bags of washers.

271
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:56,846
Well, this was going to be me and Tector's
last job before we quit and headed south!

272
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,932
We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this!

273
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,977
You spent all your time and money
running whores in Hondo...

274
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,895
while I spent my stake setting it up!

275
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:18,200
Hell, I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

276
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,120
While you was doing all that planning...

277
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:24,456
me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

278
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,876
two, mind you, Hondo whores!

279
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,883
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

280
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,718
He was.

281
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,392
You were matching whores...

282
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,895
in tandem!

283
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:48,814
What's that?

284
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,900
That's one behind the other.

285
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,072
That's right! That's what we was doing!

286
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:18,677
Mr. Thornton?

287
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:25,059
You rode with Pike.

288
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:29,146
What kind of man are we up against?

289
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,356
The best.

290
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,902
He never got caught.

291
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:03,806
This was going to be my last.

292
00:32:07,643 --> 00:32:09,728
Ain't getting around any better.

293
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,656
I'd like to make one good score
and back off.

294
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,492
Back off to what?

295
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:38,466
Have you got anything lined up?

296
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:45,932
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

297
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:50,187
Every one of those garrisons
are gonna be getting a payroll.

298
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:55,192
That kind of information is kind of hard
to come by.

299
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:58,528
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

300
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,824
He'll be waiting for us.

301
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,537
I wouldn't have it any other way.

302
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,552
Come on, Pike, let's go.

303
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:25,722
You sound like you're all caught up.

304
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:28,558
Caught up enough to know
we've overstayed our welcome.

305
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:30,560
What the hell's the matter with you?

306
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:34,147
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and not a worry in the world.

307
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:37,317
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

308
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,319
How can you be so damn sure?

309
00:33:39,903 --> 00:33:42,030
Being sure is my business.

310
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,533
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>

311
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:50,413
- Hold it!
- Relax.

312
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,749
It's just some champagne we ordered.

313
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,586
<i>Relax. It's just some champagne
we ordered.</i>

314
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,048
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>

315
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,310
Did you get him?

316
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:14,020
<i>No, the bastard got away.</i>

317
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:19,025
Damn, you sure must have hurt
that railroad.

318
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:23,113
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

319
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:24,823
I caught up with them.

320
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:27,284
Two or three times.

321
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:29,369
There was a man named Harrigan.

322
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,830
He used to have a way of doing things.

323
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:34,708
I made him change his ways.

324
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,627
And a hell of a lot of people...

325
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:40,130
that just can't stand to be wrong.

326
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:42,716
Pride.

327
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,801
And they can't forget it.

328
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:47,846
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

329
00:34:56,313 --> 00:34:57,564
How about us, Pike?

330
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:00,400
You reckon we learned...

331
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,068
being wrong today?

332
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,615
I sure hope to God we did.

333
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:26,761
Them's hot.

334
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:32,725
Damn!

335
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:39,106
Where in the hell did you ever find him?

336
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,275
He used to run with Thornton and me.

337
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:44,278
Did his share of killing, and more.

338
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:45,780
Around Langtry.

339
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,160
Yeah, only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

340
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:20,815
Pike...

341
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:26,237
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

342
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,598
Watch out, boys!

343
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:55,683
Go on, easy.

344
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,067
Watch it, Tector!

345
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,954
That goddamned son of a bitch!

346
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,209
Get those horses up!

347
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,211
What the hell is going...

348
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:26,923
Damned old punk! Bastard!

349
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:30,551
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

350
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:38,684
Get over here!

351
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:43,272
What in the hell's the matter with you,
old man?

352
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,149
Leave him alone!

353
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:49,779
He's going to get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

354
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:53,908
You're not getting rid of anybody! We're
gonna stick together, like it used to be.

355
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,118
When you side with a man,
you stay with him.

356
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,496
And if you can't do that,
you're like some animal!

357
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,248
You're finished!

358
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:02,584
We're finished! All of us!

359
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:10,759
Mount up.

360
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:33,699
Appears Brother Pike needs help,
Brother Lyle.

361
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:35,993
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes...

362
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:37,995
makes a man wonder if it ain't time...

363
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:40,747
to pick up his chips
and find another game.

364
00:38:50,257 --> 00:38:52,134
How in the hell are you going
to side anybody...

365
00:38:52,217 --> 00:38:54,136
when you can't even get on your horse?

366
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:29,940
That was a mighty fine talk you gave the
boys back there about sticking together.

367
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:35,612
That Gorch came near killing me.

368
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:36,864
Or me him.

369
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:41,201
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

370
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:44,955
- We started together, we'll end it together.
- By God, that's the way I see it.

371
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:47,624
That's the way it's always been with me.

372
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,961
Sorry about Deke.

373
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:53,088
I never figured him that way.

374
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:57,134
Say, back there in Starbuck...

375
00:40:57,217 --> 00:40:58,887
how did my boy do?

376
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:01,890
Your boy?

377
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:03,391
Crazy Lee?

378
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:05,518
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.

379
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:08,897
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

380
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:11,399
I kill them now? I kill them now?

381
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:14,402
No, you just hold them here.

382
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,362
<i>Hold them here.</i>

383
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:19,741
Why didn't you tell me
he was your grandson?

384
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:22,911
You had enough things on your mind.

385
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:27,707
Besides, he had to pull his own weight
just like the rest of us.

386
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:32,795
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down, run, when things got hot.

387
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:36,966
No, he did fine.

388
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:39,177
Just fine.

389
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,960
All clear!

390
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:24,597
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

391
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:28,351
What's the closest town of any size?

392
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:30,979
Agua Verde.

393
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:34,065
What's in Agua Verde?

394
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,067
Mexicans, what else?

395
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:43,408
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

396
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:45,243
Mapache territory.

397
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:50,081
Don't we follow?

398
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:51,958
No, we go back and wait.

399
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,796
- Damn it! Go find...
- Shut up!

400
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,092
Why in the hell won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

401
00:43:01,676 --> 00:43:05,597
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

402
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,850
I have invited you to my village,
to my home.

403
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:11,936
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

404
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,521
I will kill you.

405
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:16,065
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

406
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:19,861
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

407
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:21,696
- You got a sister?
- Yes.

408
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:24,282
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance.

409
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:26,367
And that of your mama too.

410
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,912
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

411
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,851
How bad did they hit you?

412
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,022
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

413
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:57,775
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

414
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:01,487
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they give you any protection?

415
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,739
They were federal troops...

416
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:06,492
commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.

417
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:09,161
And the soldier who shot my father?

418
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:10,704
What was his name?

419
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,416
- What the hell difference does it make?
- Your father died like a man.

420
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:17,628
Names in this matter
do not have any importance.

421
00:44:17,837 --> 00:44:19,296
How was he called?

422
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:21,966
Mapache.

423
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:24,009
That is name enough.

424
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:27,680
<i>In Mexico, seסor...</i>

425
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:30,766
these are the years of sadness.

426
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:32,351
But if we had...

427
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:34,645
rifles like these...

428
00:44:34,937 --> 00:44:38,274
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

429
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:44,530
She went with them
because she wished to.

430
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:47,449
She became the woman of Mapache...

431
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:50,619
and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

432
00:44:51,203 --> 00:44:53,372
Drunk with wine and love.

433
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:59,545
To him, Teresa was like a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

434
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:02,548
I tell you, she was a mango...

435
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:04,300
ripe and waiting.

436
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:07,720
Angel dreams of love
and Mapache eats the mango.

437
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:12,224
That's a good trick.

438
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:27,656
Now that I find hard to believe.

439
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:31,243
Not so hard.

440
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,747
We all dream of being a child again.

441
00:45:35,247 --> 00:45:37,082
Even the worst of us.

442
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:43,339
Perhaps the worst most of all.

443
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:47,176
You know what we are, then?

444
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:50,221
Yes, just so, the both of you!

445
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,181
And you!

446
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:00,397
Where is Mapache?

447
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:11,367
All right, Pike? All right?

448
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:17,540
Tector, let's swap!

449
00:46:17,706 --> 00:46:19,542
Come on, let's swap!

450
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,977
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

451
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:41,105
Why do you wish to know?

452
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:42,940
For your father?

453
00:46:43,482 --> 00:46:44,817
Or the whore?

454
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:54,160
Either you learn to live with it
or we'll leave you here.

455
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,669
<i>I go with you, Jefe.</i>

456
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,702
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna steal his girl.

457
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:37,329
You are?

458
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,623
Here I go.

459
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,377
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

460
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,171
Come on, lady!

461
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:10,334
<i>No gringos?</i>

462
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:12,962
<i>Only federales.</i>

463
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,602
All soldiers.

464
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,604
Not a bounty hunter in sight.

465
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:48,748
Now, what in the hell is that?

466
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:21,322
I saw one just like it in Waco.

467
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,491
Run on steam?

468
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:25,451
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

469
00:52:25,618 --> 00:52:27,203
Hey, Pike, you know what I hear?

470
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:30,998
I hear they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

471
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,626
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

472
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:35,419
No, the old man's right.

473
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:39,090
They've got motors and wings
and go 60 miles in less than an hour.

474
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:41,343
Going to use them in the war they say.

475
00:52:42,302 --> 00:52:44,221
Well, let's go and talk to the General...

476
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,516
about his automobile
and our extra horses.

477
00:52:48,016 --> 00:52:49,268
Nice and easy.

478
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,212
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

479
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:03,717
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

480
00:54:03,926 --> 00:54:06,803
<i>With the way the Generalםsimo's
cleaned out this part of the country...</i>

481
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:08,305
he ought to have a lot to spare.

482
00:54:08,388 --> 00:54:10,182
<i>Generalםsimo, hell.</i>

483
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:13,810
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

484
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:16,063
Like some others I could mention.

485
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:20,651
Not so as you'd know it, Mr. Bishop.

486
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:24,863
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

487
00:54:27,616 --> 00:54:30,077
I hope someday
these people here kick him...

488
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,996
and the rest of the scum like him
right into their graves.

489
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,164
We will.

490
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,918
If it takes forever!

491
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:18,834
Look here.

492
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:27,843
Pretty good-looking old pony, ain't he?

493
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:38,104
Boy, do you know them beauties?

494
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:22,565
Come on.

495
00:56:24,108 --> 00:56:26,736
- She was my woman.
- I know.

496
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:50,093
Sure ain't your woman no more.

497
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:56,975
Just look at her licking
inside that general's ear.

498
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:32,343
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

499
00:57:33,303 --> 00:57:36,931
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

500
00:57:41,853 --> 00:57:44,898
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

501
00:57:58,578 --> 00:58:01,956
Are you men associated
with the American Army?

502
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:08,171
No, we're not associated with anybody.

503
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:11,424
I see.

504
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:16,054
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

505
00:58:16,221 --> 00:58:19,349
is restricted for the use
of army personnel.

506
00:58:20,058 --> 00:58:22,769
It can't be purchased or even owned...

507
00:58:22,936 --> 00:58:24,103
legally.

508
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:27,398
- Is that so?
- Weapons are a specialty of mine.

509
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:31,654
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

510
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:36,992
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

511
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:40,871
who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

512
00:58:42,081 --> 00:58:44,959
Well, we share very few sentiments
with our government.

513
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,591
He's asking us to have a drink with him.

514
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:57,888
Good.

515
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:19,243
Shoot him.

516
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:33,591
I gave it to him, T.C.

517
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:11,295
- You mean here?
- No, no, not there!

518
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,472
Wait a minute, now,
what you going to do?

519
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:25,851
We got to show a little class here.

520
01:00:46,664 --> 01:00:48,082
Right here!

521
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:50,793
It must be that garrison rail spur.

522
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:55,214
I know it's the easiest to hit, but I gotta
figure some way to get it out of there.

523
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:58,425
What do you think, Dutch?

524
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:00,761
Getting pretty close to home, ain't it?

525
01:01:01,262 --> 01:01:03,681
Look at them gathered around
that big table.

526
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,686
Here we sit like kitchen help.

527
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:11,856
Why do you want us to hit a train
like that at the border?

528
01:01:11,939 --> 01:01:14,900
Can't the General just go up there
and take over the whole thing?

529
01:01:15,025 --> 01:01:18,946
General Huerta is anxious to better
relations with the United States...

530
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:22,449
not to cross the border and destroy them.

531
01:01:23,284 --> 01:01:26,371
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

532
01:01:26,538 --> 01:01:28,206
How'd you find out about this one?

533
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,417
Mapache has a superb intelligence force...

534
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,044
organized under supervision
of my commanding officer.

535
01:01:33,628 --> 01:01:36,882
Now, gentlemen,
we are quite well organized...

536
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:39,676
and able to pay $10,000...

537
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:41,720
in gold.

538
01:01:42,888 --> 01:01:46,474
Of course, if you're not able
to do the work, we'll find someone else.

539
01:01:46,558 --> 01:01:49,477
We can do it. It's just that we're
going to need special equipment.

540
01:01:49,895 --> 01:01:51,396
Do not worry.

541
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:54,900
Our accountant will
take care of everything.

542
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:59,446
General...

543
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:03,575
soon you will be the best-equipped
general in Mexico.

544
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,661
Well, look here...

545
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:09,372
ain't he the one?

546
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,876
To the host!

547
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:27,098
With your permission, I need a bath.

548
01:02:27,182 --> 01:02:30,435
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

549
01:02:32,437 --> 01:02:34,189
I don't need no bath!

550
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:38,360
What me and Tector need is a couple
of them women you're hogging.

551
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,820
You think you can fix that up for us?

552
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:48,787
Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I'm sure.

553
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,539
I'm sure.

554
01:02:55,836 --> 01:02:58,046
- Herrera.
- Let's get Angel.

555
01:03:11,476 --> 01:03:13,478
<i>Por favor, General, I need him.</i>

556
01:03:13,562 --> 01:03:16,231
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

557
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:19,401
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.

558
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,877
All right.

559
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:40,338
He is not important to me. Take him.

560
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:48,805
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.

561
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,272
Hey, here come our sweeties.

562
01:04:04,112 --> 01:04:05,864
Ain't them pretty?

563
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:08,575
I don't know about yours, Lyle, but...

564
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:11,119
I think I got more than I can handle.

565
01:04:21,714 --> 01:04:23,758
Hey, get out of there.

566
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,469
You know what they told me?

567
01:04:27,303 --> 01:04:30,556
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

568
01:04:31,724 --> 01:04:34,352
- Is that right?
- That's right.

569
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:37,772
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

570
01:04:40,816 --> 01:04:42,652
Let's have a little target.

571
01:04:42,902 --> 01:04:45,488
She ain't going to get away.
Turn her loose.

572
01:04:54,747 --> 01:04:56,040
Why not!

573
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,443
Tector, look at them beauties!

574
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:54,891
How in the hell can you stand it that hot?

575
01:05:55,558 --> 01:05:58,978
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

576
01:06:04,483 --> 01:06:06,402
Hell, Lyle, look here.

577
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:15,119
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

578
01:06:18,664 --> 01:06:21,751
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

579
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:26,589
Listen, I'm not going to steal guns for
that devil to rob and kill my people again.

580
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:29,133
Noble, noble. Very noble.

581
01:06:29,342 --> 01:06:33,596
I didn't see no tears rolling down your
cheeks when you rode in from Starbuck.

582
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:35,806
They were not my people.

583
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:39,101
I care about my people, my village.

584
01:06:40,603 --> 01:06:44,273
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

585
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,692
If it does, you just don't go along.

586
01:06:47,193 --> 01:06:49,111
Then I don't go along.

587
01:06:49,445 --> 01:06:53,449
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

588
01:06:54,325 --> 01:06:57,286
Why, you ought to be thinking about
all the money you're gonna have.

589
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,956
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1,000 miles.

590
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:02,875
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.

591
01:07:03,709 --> 01:07:05,378
A very small one.

592
01:07:05,628 --> 01:07:08,214
Don't you see? This is their land.

593
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:10,967
No one is going to drive them away.

594
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,386
I'll drink to that sentiment.

595
01:07:13,553 --> 01:07:15,012
And to love.

596
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:18,642
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

597
01:07:35,158 --> 01:07:36,201
Angel.

598
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:38,912
You're a pain in the ass.

599
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:42,833
Would you give guns to someone
to kill your father...

600
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:45,252
or your mother, or your brother?

601
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:48,797
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot
of family ties.

602
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,508
My people have no guns.

603
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:54,845
But with guns...

604
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,764
my people could fight.

605
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,310
If I could take guns...

606
01:08:01,935 --> 01:08:03,687
I would come with you.

607
01:08:03,854 --> 01:08:08,609
Say, how many cases of rifles
did Zamorra say was in that shipment?

608
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:09,985
Sixteen.

609
01:08:10,277 --> 01:08:11,320
Well...

610
01:08:13,363 --> 01:08:14,615
give him one.

611
01:08:26,627 --> 01:08:27,878
All right.

612
01:08:28,545 --> 01:08:33,175
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

613
01:08:34,134 --> 01:08:35,219
I will.

614
01:08:35,552 --> 01:08:39,056
- We know you will.
- Sure glad we got that settled.

615
01:08:39,723 --> 01:08:42,309
Why, you reprobate!

616
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:00,160
Boys...

617
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:04,832
I want you to meet my fiancיe.

618
01:09:07,751 --> 01:09:09,670
They just got engaged.

619
01:09:10,003 --> 01:09:11,588
I'm a son of a bitch!

620
01:09:12,256 --> 01:09:14,091
Trot them on in, fellas.

621
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:18,846
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

622
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:28,856
You want to gamble everything
that this one shipment will be attacked?

623
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:31,608
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.

624
01:09:31,692 --> 01:09:35,112
- If? What about Juarez?
- If he was, we would've heard about it.

625
01:09:35,195 --> 01:09:38,115
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

626
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:39,950
And who in the hell is Mapache?

627
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:42,870
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

628
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:44,872
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

629
01:09:44,955 --> 01:09:48,458
But with enough guns, he could become
a power in northern Mexico.

630
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,711
My guess is,
Pike will try to get them for him.

631
01:09:50,794 --> 01:09:53,297
How can he? The train will be guarded
by regular troops.

632
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:56,842
Not regular troops,
green recruits not worth a damn.

633
01:09:57,217 --> 01:09:59,845
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

634
01:10:00,053 --> 01:10:03,390
And not this
gutter trash you've given me.

635
01:10:04,975 --> 01:10:07,895
What you've got is 24 more days.

636
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,245
Never told me how you got
all torn up like that.

637
01:10:24,704 --> 01:10:26,915
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

638
01:10:44,057 --> 01:10:47,018
- Is your husband coming back?
- No.

639
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:49,270
He's never coming back.

640
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:55,568
But you are late.

641
01:10:56,236 --> 01:10:57,570
Two days late.

642
01:10:57,737 --> 01:10:59,197
<i>She had a husband.</i>

643
01:10:59,447 --> 01:11:01,908
If I'd had any sense, I'd have killed him.

644
01:11:04,577 --> 01:11:06,246
<i>He wasn't around.</i>

645
01:11:06,621 --> 01:11:08,206
<i>I got careless.</i>

646
01:11:09,249 --> 01:11:11,000
<i>One night, he walked in on us.</i>

647
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:15,088
<i>Got her with the first shot,
and got me here with the second.</i>

648
01:11:15,463 --> 01:11:17,465
<i>Then the damn coward turned and ran.</i>

649
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:40,321
Ever catch up with him?

650
01:11:41,114 --> 01:11:44,993
No, but there isn't a day or an hour
that passes that I don't think about it.

651
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,538
Come on, pretty! We've got a long way!

652
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:52,167
This is our last go around, Dutch.

653
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,752
This time, we do it right.

654
01:13:45,281 --> 01:13:46,740
Just do your work.

655
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:43,103
Let's go!

656
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:16,386
They're coming!

657
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,818
They're coming!

658
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:34,029
Faster!

659
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:51,254
Get over!

660
01:20:16,382 --> 01:20:20,094
Get that ramp up!
Get that horse out of here!

661
01:20:20,386 --> 01:20:22,722
Bring them all out! Get them out!

662
01:20:23,055 --> 01:20:24,599
Get over here!

663
01:20:24,765 --> 01:20:28,311
Get them over here! Get those horses!

664
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:04,722
Hurry up!

665
01:21:04,805 --> 01:21:06,349
Your horse kicked me.

666
01:21:06,432 --> 01:21:08,142
Run them up along here!

667
01:21:08,601 --> 01:21:10,436
Where the hell is my horse?

668
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,320
Hey, we got grenades!

669
01:21:19,487 --> 01:21:22,240
- Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
- Be careful with this, boys!

670
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,158
Let's go on this.

671
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:30,998
Here we go.

672
01:21:33,668 --> 01:21:36,087
All right, line up in a column of twos!

673
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:39,674
Corporal, give us a hand here!

674
01:21:41,384 --> 01:21:44,303
Hey, Pike, we're all ready!

675
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:33,687
Let's go!

676
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:37,983
Come on!

677
01:23:42,798 --> 01:23:44,341
Get after that horse!

678
01:23:44,424 --> 01:23:46,176
That was my horse!

679
01:23:46,844 --> 01:23:48,095
Get after him!

680
01:23:49,721 --> 01:23:50,931
You men get out!

681
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:55,185
Get that damn horse off my butt!

682
01:23:55,602 --> 01:23:58,021
Get those horses out of here!
The train's coming back!

683
01:23:58,105 --> 01:23:59,314
Train?

684
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:01,692
- Where?
- What train?

685
01:24:01,775 --> 01:24:03,277
I don't see any train.

686
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:10,784
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

687
01:24:39,813 --> 01:24:43,066
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph
at Todos Malos...

688
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:46,069
and tell the railroad deputies
they robbed the train...

689
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:47,738
and we're in pursuit!

690
01:24:47,821 --> 01:24:49,072
Yes, sir!

691
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:55,830
Come on!

692
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,763
Dutch!

693
01:26:15,827 --> 01:26:17,412
Damn son of a...

694
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:20,498
Come on! It's lit!

695
01:26:31,009 --> 01:26:32,677
Get them horses going!

696
01:26:52,447 --> 01:26:54,532
Don't shoot at the army, you idiots!

697
01:27:04,209 --> 01:27:05,502
Come on, Pike!

698
01:28:09,024 --> 01:28:10,359
Let's go!

699
01:28:15,197 --> 01:28:17,032
Come on, you lazy bastard!

700
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,034
I'm coming, damn it!

701
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:38,470
- Is it all right?
- Yep.

702
01:28:39,221 --> 01:28:41,223
Where are they supposed to meet us?

703
01:28:41,307 --> 01:28:43,142
Agua Verde or before.

704
01:28:43,309 --> 01:28:47,062
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

705
01:28:47,396 --> 01:28:49,899
Least we won't have to worry
about Deke Thornton.

706
01:28:50,482 --> 01:28:54,528
Hell, no. Not after riding a half a case
of dynamite into the river.

707
01:28:54,737 --> 01:28:58,824
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

708
01:31:15,629 --> 01:31:18,715
I sure would like to get hold
of that fool horse of mine.

709
01:31:18,882 --> 01:31:21,801
Some Mex kid's probably riding him home
right now.

710
01:31:21,968 --> 01:31:24,888
I don't see how I could've lost
both my boots.

711
01:31:25,555 --> 01:31:27,557
They always were hard as hell to get on.

712
01:31:27,641 --> 01:31:29,309
That damn river sucked them right off.

713
01:31:29,392 --> 01:31:31,478
That damn dynamite helped some.

714
01:31:31,645 --> 01:31:35,565
Maybe the same kid that's riding T.C.'s
horse is wearing your boots right now.

715
01:31:36,983 --> 01:31:38,735
You stupid bastards!

716
01:31:38,902 --> 01:31:41,071
Why did you fire at those soldiers?

717
01:31:41,655 --> 01:31:45,075
Huey started firing at them.
I even tried to stop him.

718
01:31:45,158 --> 01:31:47,869
- One of the bandits...
- Don't blame it on me!

719
01:31:47,953 --> 01:31:49,162
Liar!

720
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:50,914
Shut your mouths!

721
01:31:51,623 --> 01:31:53,083
Are we going after them?

722
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:55,836
We are,
unless you want to face a firing squad.

723
01:31:58,505 --> 01:32:00,048
Come on, T. C!

724
01:32:00,632 --> 01:32:02,425
Why the hell do we have to leave now?

725
01:32:02,843 --> 01:32:04,177
Besides, my hair's wet!

726
01:32:40,964 --> 01:32:43,884
Impossible! We have no arms
or ammunition.

727
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,954
<i>The gringos assaulted the train!
They got the guns.</i>

728
01:33:56,457 --> 01:33:57,875
We must go!

729
01:33:59,377 --> 01:34:02,630
Take the necessary people
and take the road to Agua Verde.

730
01:34:02,713 --> 01:34:06,050
<i>Convince the gringos to give you the guns.
I'll wait for you in the village.</i>

731
01:34:06,133 --> 01:34:07,593
<i>If the gringos refuse?</i>

732
01:35:33,137 --> 01:35:34,972
He's still heading east.

733
01:35:37,517 --> 01:35:40,269
Are they bluffing,
or did they really miss it?

734
01:35:44,899 --> 01:35:48,277
I'd say they missed it. Here, take a look.

735
01:35:51,405 --> 01:35:53,074
There's only five left.

736
01:36:01,415 --> 01:36:04,335
- Hell, we lost them.
- I don't see how we lost them.

737
01:36:04,418 --> 01:36:07,547
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

738
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:12,134
Wasn't but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this here is it.

739
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:14,011
They didn't take it out.

740
01:36:14,303 --> 01:36:17,431
And we haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

741
01:36:17,598 --> 01:36:19,267
Sit still, damn it!

742
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,353
You think Pike and old Sykes
haven't been watching us?

743
01:36:22,436 --> 01:36:25,106
They know what this is all about.
And what do I have?

744
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:28,442
Nothing but you egg-sucking,
chicken-stealing gutter trash...

745
01:36:28,609 --> 01:36:30,903
with not even 60 rounds between you.

746
01:36:30,987 --> 01:36:32,656
We're after men.

747
01:36:33,156 --> 01:36:35,450
And I wish to God I was with them.

748
01:36:35,993 --> 01:36:39,788
The next time you make a mistake,
I'm gonna ride off and let you die.

749
01:36:41,832 --> 01:36:42,916
Come on.

750
01:36:51,216 --> 01:36:54,219
I never figured they'd come down here
after us.

751
01:36:54,845 --> 01:36:56,638
How much you reckon we could be worth?

752
01:36:56,722 --> 01:36:58,724
Depends on how hungry they are.

753
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,856
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

754
01:37:06,023 --> 01:37:08,525
I'll go down and
start rigging the fireworks.

755
01:37:08,692 --> 01:37:09,860
All right.

756
01:37:12,946 --> 01:37:13,989
Angel...

757
01:37:14,823 --> 01:37:17,826
get that case of explosives
off the back there!

758
01:37:18,202 --> 01:37:19,244
Lyle...

759
01:37:20,037 --> 01:37:22,331
hand me down those blasting caps.

760
01:37:29,838 --> 01:37:32,257
What're you gonna do with the dynamite?

761
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:37,471
I figure that damn general will try
to take this load without paying for it...

762
01:37:37,554 --> 01:37:39,598
and shoot us in the bargain.

763
01:37:40,599 --> 01:37:44,603
The only thing to change his mind
is if something happened to these guns.

764
01:37:44,686 --> 01:37:47,022
I'm gonna make sure
something could happen.

765
01:37:47,105 --> 01:37:49,233
Pike, take a look at this.

766
01:37:50,692 --> 01:37:52,236
Think you can handle that?

767
01:37:54,196 --> 01:37:57,282
What I don't know about,
I sure as hell am going to learn.

768
01:39:07,019 --> 01:39:09,188
My people are here for their guns.

769
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:17,029
Where the hell were you when you were
supposed to be guarding us.

770
01:39:17,112 --> 01:39:19,656
I never heard them, didn't even see them.

771
01:39:33,463 --> 01:39:37,634
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

772
01:39:38,218 --> 01:39:40,887
But only by caution do they remain alive.

773
01:39:46,309 --> 01:39:48,561
Tell them not to break that fuse.

774
01:39:51,147 --> 01:39:53,149
These people from your village?

775
01:39:53,233 --> 01:39:55,985
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

776
01:39:56,402 --> 01:40:00,490
<i>They are puro Indio and these mountains
belong to them.</i>

777
01:40:23,346 --> 01:40:26,432
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

778
01:40:26,599 --> 01:40:30,436
They've been fighting Apaches
for 1,000 years. That's a sure way to learn.

779
01:40:30,603 --> 01:40:34,607
If they ever get armed, with good leaders,
this whole country will go up in smoke.

780
01:40:34,691 --> 01:40:37,193
That it will, son. That it will.

781
01:40:38,111 --> 01:40:40,947
They made damn fools out of us,
Mr. Bishop.

782
01:40:42,448 --> 01:40:45,618
Getting so a fella can't sleep
with both eyes closed...

783
01:40:45,702 --> 01:40:47,453
for fear of getting his throat cut.

784
01:40:47,537 --> 01:40:48,830
Where in the hell were you?

785
01:40:48,955 --> 01:40:50,623
Now, you listen to me, Lyle.

786
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:53,209
If you got up off your ass and helped
once in a while...

787
01:40:53,293 --> 01:40:55,253
I wouldn't have got caught near so easy.

788
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:14,772
With the new guns and ammunition,
this could never have happened.

789
01:41:40,924 --> 01:41:43,176
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

790
01:41:43,343 --> 01:41:44,886
Bring them on!

791
01:41:59,776 --> 01:42:01,277
Come on, horse!

792
01:42:15,124 --> 01:42:17,627
- Hold up!
- Whoa there!

793
01:42:20,129 --> 01:42:21,256
Mapache's?

794
01:42:21,798 --> 01:42:23,843
Let's just hope they don't belong to Villa.

795
01:42:37,398 --> 01:42:38,983
We are friends.

796
01:42:39,316 --> 01:42:41,402
<i>We are from el General Mapache.</i>

797
01:42:41,986 --> 01:42:43,821
Tell the one out in front
to come over here.

798
01:42:43,904 --> 01:42:45,114
Alone.

799
01:42:50,911 --> 01:42:52,371
I am coming.

800
01:42:52,746 --> 01:42:54,582
I am your friend, remember?

801
01:42:57,918 --> 01:43:00,379
We are friends. All of us.

802
01:43:01,672 --> 01:43:04,758
<i>I bring you love and affection
from el General.</i>

803
01:43:08,762 --> 01:43:11,015
You bring the guns with you?

804
01:43:14,018 --> 01:43:16,103
What bravery you have done!

805
01:43:17,104 --> 01:43:19,607
<i>I am to escort you to the General.</i>

806
01:43:21,442 --> 01:43:24,320
- Tell him to come closer.
- I hear.

807
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:27,281
I am coming, my friend.

808
01:43:31,202 --> 01:43:32,495
You know what this is?

809
01:43:41,462 --> 01:43:44,757
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

810
01:43:51,305 --> 01:43:52,723
Very smart!

811
01:43:52,973 --> 01:43:55,768
<i>That's very smart for you damn gringos.</i>

812
01:43:56,393 --> 01:43:58,229
So nobody can rob the guns.

813
01:43:58,979 --> 01:44:00,147
Nobody.

814
01:44:00,397 --> 01:44:03,901
I am not afraid. They are not afraid.

815
01:44:04,068 --> 01:44:08,155
You blow up the wagon, you die.
Or we kill you pretty soon.

816
01:44:08,906 --> 01:44:11,951
<i>- But we are amigos.
- Show them, boys.</i>

817
01:44:25,005 --> 01:44:26,757
Start the ball, Tector.

818
01:44:36,183 --> 01:44:38,310
Please, cut the fuse.

819
01:44:44,024 --> 01:44:45,150
Please.

820
01:45:19,978 --> 01:45:23,148
<i>El General waits in Agua Verde
to meet with you.</i>

821
01:45:23,315 --> 01:45:26,818
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

822
01:45:27,569 --> 01:45:30,280
Any trouble, no guns.

823
01:45:44,878 --> 01:45:46,796
<i>Damn gringos!</i>

824
01:46:22,374 --> 01:46:24,918
Get them up there, Freddie!
Pull them over!

825
01:47:00,996 --> 01:47:02,706
You bring the guns?

826
01:47:02,998 --> 01:47:05,000
Don't worry, we've got them.

827
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:06,835
Hidden.

828
01:47:09,004 --> 01:47:12,340
When I get my share of the gold,
$2,500 worth...

829
01:47:12,507 --> 01:47:14,843
I'll tell you where four cases are.

830
01:47:16,178 --> 01:47:18,847
The others are waiting for me
back at the wagon.

831
01:47:19,181 --> 01:47:22,058
If I don't show up pretty quick,
they'll blow it.

832
01:47:22,434 --> 01:47:26,062
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fooled me.

833
01:47:27,689 --> 01:47:30,567
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

834
01:47:31,943 --> 01:47:33,612
When do we get our guns?

835
01:47:33,778 --> 01:47:37,115
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

836
01:47:41,286 --> 01:47:42,537
Open it up.

837
01:47:54,633 --> 01:47:57,052
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

838
01:47:57,219 --> 01:47:59,638
you'll find three cases of rifles...

839
01:47:59,888 --> 01:48:02,766
and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush behind them.

840
01:48:10,565 --> 01:48:12,859
I understand you have a machine gun.

841
01:48:15,404 --> 01:48:18,407
Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles...

842
01:48:18,574 --> 01:48:20,910
and ammunition for $10,000.

843
01:48:21,202 --> 01:48:22,870
Not a machine gun.

844
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:28,584
That's our present to the General.

845
01:48:31,212 --> 01:48:33,589
<i>Gringo, you fight with Mapache...</i>

846
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:39,637
I'll think about it.

847
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:43,766
In case he don't find them...

848
01:48:44,183 --> 01:48:47,061
Go. I trust him.

849
01:49:12,753 --> 01:49:16,382
- Why the hell don't you stir up some grub?
- Why don't you go to hell?

850
01:49:29,979 --> 01:49:31,147
Shit!

851
01:49:33,482 --> 01:49:34,650
Damn it!

852
01:49:36,152 --> 01:49:39,238
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

853
01:49:39,989 --> 01:49:41,449
You gonna whip me?

854
01:49:41,949 --> 01:49:42,992
Nope.

855
01:49:43,159 --> 01:49:45,995
But you better just hope
I don't get riled enough...

856
01:49:46,162 --> 01:49:48,581
to start dogging you when this is over.

857
01:49:48,956 --> 01:49:52,293
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

858
01:49:52,627 --> 01:49:54,003
We'll see.

859
01:49:55,129 --> 01:49:56,339
We'll see.

860
01:49:57,798 --> 01:49:59,342
Pike's coming!

861
01:50:05,139 --> 01:50:07,391
He's got it. Carrying gold.

862
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:10,978
Any trouble?

863
01:50:11,145 --> 01:50:13,147
Just from carrying this weight.

864
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:17,568
- Pike, I want to go next.
- All right.

865
01:50:17,652 --> 01:50:20,780
You and your brother take the next load,
along with the machine gun.

866
01:50:20,863 --> 01:50:25,159
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie,
you follow and pick up the pack horses.

867
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,586
It must be mounted on a tripod!

868
01:50:37,004 --> 01:50:40,675
It must be mounted on a tripod!

869
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:05,825
Crazy bastards!

870
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,864
Put it on the tripod!

871
01:52:48,637 --> 01:52:51,223
We brought the last of it, General.

872
01:53:11,243 --> 01:53:13,745
At the head of the arroyo, in the wagon.

873
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:24,590
You can have the wagon,
we'll take the horses.

874
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:29,887
How many cases did you take
from the train?

875
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:34,016
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

876
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:36,101
He stole it.

877
01:53:36,894 --> 01:53:39,563
The mother of the girl he killed told me so.

878
01:54:39,165 --> 01:54:41,084
Well, I'm wasting time here.

879
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:53,263
He's a thief. You take care of him.

880
01:55:50,361 --> 01:55:52,113
Well, he had guts.

881
01:55:52,906 --> 01:55:54,741
We're just lucky he didn't talk.

882
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,869
He played his string right out to the end.

883
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:09,631
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of a Judas.

884
01:56:09,714 --> 01:56:11,674
Sykes says we ought to go after him.

885
01:56:11,758 --> 01:56:15,094
How in the hell are we gonna do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

886
01:56:16,221 --> 01:56:17,472
No way.

887
01:56:18,223 --> 01:56:19,766
No way at all.

888
01:56:20,892 --> 01:56:22,393
Is that Sykes?

889
01:56:48,628 --> 01:56:49,921
Mapache!

890
01:56:53,466 --> 01:56:54,551
Thornton.

891
01:56:59,138 --> 01:57:00,474
I got him.

892
01:57:04,311 --> 01:57:05,729
They got Freddie.

893
01:57:07,481 --> 01:57:09,191
Looks like he's hit pretty bad.

894
01:57:09,275 --> 01:57:11,443
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

895
01:57:11,986 --> 01:57:14,864
What would you do in his place?
He gave his word.

896
01:57:14,947 --> 01:57:17,074
Gave his word to a railroad.

897
01:57:17,158 --> 01:57:18,325
It's his word!

898
01:57:18,409 --> 01:57:21,662
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

899
01:57:28,502 --> 01:57:30,963
We can stay up here
and kick hell out of them!

900
01:57:31,046 --> 01:57:32,548
That's what we can do.

901
01:57:36,177 --> 01:57:38,220
No, we're running short of water.

902
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,973
Make a run for the border?

903
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:46,061
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

904
01:57:46,645 --> 01:57:48,647
I'm tired of being hunted.

905
01:57:49,857 --> 01:57:53,485
Let's go back to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

906
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,071
You're crazy.

907
01:57:57,990 --> 01:58:00,618
That general would just as soon kill us
as break wind.

908
01:58:00,826 --> 01:58:02,620
He's so tickled with those guns...

909
01:58:02,703 --> 01:58:05,539
he'll be celebrating for a week
and happy to do us a favor.

910
01:58:05,873 --> 01:58:08,209
Thornton's not gonna follow us in there.

911
01:58:09,376 --> 01:58:11,629
While they're busy picking over Freddie...

912
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:14,715
we'll find a back trail off this mountain
and head for town.

913
01:58:18,219 --> 01:58:19,887
What about our gold?

914
01:58:27,353 --> 01:58:29,855
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

915
01:58:30,689 --> 01:58:31,941
Bury the rest.

916
01:58:35,528 --> 01:58:36,695
Together.

917
01:58:56,048 --> 01:58:57,299
Look out!

918
01:59:04,807 --> 01:59:07,726
Lots of blood, then it stops. No track.

919
01:59:08,143 --> 01:59:12,106
- $10 says he's dead by now.
- Take us a day to find him if he is.

920
01:59:12,815 --> 01:59:15,150
If he isn't, he has a gun on us right now.

921
01:59:20,155 --> 01:59:21,657
Let's go after the others.

922
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:24,410
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

923
01:59:25,161 --> 01:59:28,330
Yes, you ride out tomorrow,
that is if you can stay on your horse...

924
01:59:28,414 --> 01:59:31,083
and watch the buzzards.
They'll show you where he is.

925
01:59:31,167 --> 01:59:32,793
What if he ain't dead, Mr. Thornton?

926
01:59:33,502 --> 01:59:36,005
That's your problem. Let's go!

927
02:01:08,265 --> 02:01:11,685
- God, I hate to see that.
- No more than I do.

928
02:01:35,041 --> 02:01:37,878
<i>Welcome, amigos!
You come for your friend, no?</i>

929
02:01:48,221 --> 02:01:49,890
I want to buy him back.

930
02:01:54,978 --> 02:01:57,564
I don't think he looks worth too much.

931
02:02:04,487 --> 02:02:06,489
I don't think he's going to live too long.

932
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,742
I'll give you half of my share for him.

933
02:02:08,825 --> 02:02:12,329
I need no gold and I don't sell this one.

934
02:02:12,412 --> 02:02:14,247
Why not? You've had your fun with him.

935
02:02:14,331 --> 02:02:16,917
<i>El Generalםsimo's happy with the guns.</i>

936
02:02:17,501 --> 02:02:19,419
Why don't you go and get a drink?

937
02:02:19,586 --> 02:02:22,339
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

938
02:02:26,927 --> 02:02:29,262
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

939
02:03:11,806 --> 02:03:13,391
Son of a bitch!

940
02:03:25,987 --> 02:03:27,280
Why not?

941
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,838
There ain't nobody here!

942
02:03:43,921 --> 02:03:47,300
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

943
02:03:47,383 --> 02:03:49,135
They sure as hell ain't here now!

944
02:03:55,433 --> 02:03:56,893
Army patrol!

945
02:03:57,768 --> 02:03:59,103
Coming this way!

946
02:06:34,009 --> 02:06:35,928
<i>You said dos for two!</i>

947
02:06:36,011 --> 02:06:38,263
<i>Here's your dos and one to grow on.</i>

948
02:06:38,430 --> 02:06:40,849
That's all you're gonna get out of me.

949
02:07:13,048 --> 02:07:14,383
Let's go.

950
02:07:25,811 --> 02:07:27,104
Why not?

951
02:11:11,996 --> 02:11:13,414
What do you want?

952
02:11:18,503 --> 02:11:19,838
We want Angel.

953
02:11:21,714 --> 02:11:26,553
You want Angel, no? All right.
I'm going to give him to you.

954
02:15:29,339 --> 02:15:30,465
Bitch!

955
02:15:54,906 --> 02:15:56,575
Come on, you lazy bastard!

956
02:16:32,694 --> 02:16:34,571
Give them hell, Pike!

957
02:16:41,203 --> 02:16:42,537
No, Pike!

958
02:16:46,833 --> 02:16:47,876
Pike.

959
02:16:54,216 --> 02:16:55,258
Pike.

960
02:17:37,844 --> 02:17:39,262
Look at them.

961
02:17:40,012 --> 02:17:41,889
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

962
02:17:43,724 --> 02:17:44,767
Wait for me!

963
02:17:44,851 --> 02:17:47,687
- Come on, let's get all the guns.
- This is fine!

964
02:17:48,104 --> 02:17:50,606
This is just like a big old picnic!

965
02:17:50,857 --> 02:17:52,775
Here's a rifle for you.

966
02:18:21,971 --> 02:18:23,472
He's got a gun.

967
02:18:25,975 --> 02:18:28,811
T.C., it's them!

968
02:18:30,563 --> 02:18:32,398
It's the Gorches!

969
02:18:33,149 --> 02:18:34,984
Get up there, Coffer. Come on.

970
02:18:35,067 --> 02:18:37,695
Mr. Thornton, it's them.

971
02:18:38,404 --> 02:18:39,822
It is them.

972
02:18:43,409 --> 02:18:46,579
Here's a boy's got some gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

973
02:18:46,746 --> 02:18:48,831
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!

974
02:18:48,915 --> 02:18:49,957
Mr. Thornton.

975
02:18:52,835 --> 02:18:54,295
Should we load up?

976
02:18:55,254 --> 02:18:57,423
Are we going to wait for Jess
or meet him on the way?

977
02:18:57,590 --> 02:19:01,844
If he's waiting for them buzzards to lead
him to old Sykes, he's got a long wait.

978
02:19:01,928 --> 02:19:03,638
Look! We got them all.

979
02:19:03,846 --> 02:19:06,682
T.C., there he is.

980
02:19:06,766 --> 02:19:08,184
There's Pike.

981
02:19:08,518 --> 02:19:11,771
There, you ain't so damned much now,
are you, Mr. Pike?

982
02:19:19,362 --> 02:19:20,863
You ain't coming?

983
02:19:23,407 --> 02:19:24,450
No.

984
02:19:27,537 --> 02:19:29,539
Maybe we ought to wait here for Jess.

985
02:19:31,123 --> 02:19:33,376
No, we pick him up on the way.

986
02:19:33,543 --> 02:19:35,461
I want to get out of this damn place.

987
02:19:35,545 --> 02:19:38,631
Anyway, these boys'll start
going ripe on us by tomorrow.

988
02:19:38,714 --> 02:19:40,216
We got to move.

989
02:19:43,469 --> 02:19:46,472
<i>I went to the river
and I couldn't get across</i>

990
02:19:46,639 --> 02:19:49,433
<i>Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day</i>

991
02:19:49,725 --> 02:19:52,812
<i>I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse</i>

992
02:19:52,979 --> 02:19:55,648
<i>Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day</i>

993
02:19:55,815 --> 02:19:57,400
<i>Fare thee well</i>

994
02:21:29,326 --> 02:21:32,246
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?

995
02:21:32,913 --> 02:21:34,498
I sent them back.

996
02:21:35,165 --> 02:21:39,002
- That's all I said I'd do.
- They didn't get very far.

997
02:21:39,336 --> 02:21:40,462
I figured.

998
02:21:44,174 --> 02:21:46,009
What are your plans?

999
02:21:47,094 --> 02:21:50,472
Drift around down here.
Try to stay out of jail.

1000
02:21:51,849 --> 02:21:54,268
Well, me and the boys here...

1001
02:21:55,435 --> 02:21:56,895
we got some work to do.

1002
02:22:01,358 --> 02:22:02,609
You want to come along?

1003
02:22:04,778 --> 02:22:08,448
Ain't like it used to be, but it'll do.

1004
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:48,234
English

1005
02:24:49,305 --> 02:25:49,875

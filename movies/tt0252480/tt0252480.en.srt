2
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,379
You have anything to drink?

3
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,518
Are you drinking there?

4
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,173
Doctor!

5
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,593
- Cover his head anyway.
- Do as he says.

6
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,515
And what is this?
Get back down there.

7
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,767
We knew him.

8
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,520
- Get back... inside, both of you.
- I'd like to stay.

9
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:02,691
If they notice we're up here, you'll
wish you were him if you don't already.

10
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,193
We don't need the doctor.

11
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:08,196
Go! We don't need you.
He's dead.

12
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,784
I said he's dead.

13
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:13,618
He's alive.

14
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,370
If he's alive,
I'm treating him.

15
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,081
Did anybody tell you
to get him?

16
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:19,541
I didn't need to be told.

17
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,751
Did anyone say
"Go for the doctor"?

18
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,297
There's no point in arguing.

19
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,924
You see.

20
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,221
Done.

21
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:37,684
What?

22
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,729
Do it.

23
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:45,817
No! Please, no!

24
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,779
Easy, now. Easy.

25
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:14,095
What he wanted, that's all.

26
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:28,068
Don't come for me anymore.
Ask me for nothing.

27
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,822
That's easy.

28
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,369
Make sure
they get his number.

29
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,929
Thank you.

30
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,809
Take the pack.
They're Hungarian.

31
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,103
I like our cigarettes.

32
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:46,688
It's shit tobacco.

33
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,023
I like ours.

34
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,277
What they need to do is invade Turkey
and then you'll taste a cigarette.

35
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:54,613
Get going.

36
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,949
You trust the Poles?

37
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,243
What do I care?
The Poles.

38
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,997
They don't trust the Poles.
They don't trust anyone in Number3.

39
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:05,665
Me?

40
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:07,000
I can't say.

41
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,502
I'm Hungarian.

42
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,753
But you're here.

43
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:11,630
So because I'm
with the Poles?

44
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,424
Rosenthal's worried. He's gonna say
that we don't have the time.

45
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,761
I know, we don't have time.
They wait for lulls.

46
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,889
- If the front...
- That's not gonna happen for us.

47
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,557
- No one really knows that...
- Never.

48
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,142
There's planes almost
every day now.

49
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,685
Not for us.

50
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:30,190
The Russians get 10 km from here we're
the first to go right out to the pyres.

51
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,567
Everyone keeps saying that.

52
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,487
Believe it.
You're dead already, either way.

53
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,156
It's just a matter
of deciding how.

54
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:39,741
You have gold?

55
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,077
Of course. So I say?

56
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,454
Tell him it's not happening
is what you say.

57
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:46,957
Get back and tell them.
Go!

58
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,029
Move it out!

59
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:42,429
It's all a way of putting it off.
Do you need to be here?

60
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,557
Every day counts.

61
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:49,102
They've been on just as long
as we have. They could go before us.

62
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,897
- I don't understand him.
- He doesn't decide.

63
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,150
He goes along. As far as
I'm concerned... He's no different.

64
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,818
They'd heard
about the old man.

65
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,112
- Who?
- Abramowics.

66
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,115
- What'd he say?
- That... He'd heard.

67
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,868
- Have you told anyone?
- Everyone knows.

68
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,165
The Doctor had no business
there. A man takes pills.

69
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:11,791
Why are you two in here?

70
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,585
We're nearly finished.

71
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,462
Nearly?

72
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,755
Inside. Yes, nearly.

73
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,924
- But not completely.
- I suppose not.

74
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,800
So I ask the question again.

75
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,094
Three of our men
were shot this morning.

76
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,929
What business is it
of yours?

77
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,431
We're gonna need replacements
and Hungarians.

78
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,974
That's not your problem.

79
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,062
You say we're lazy or disrespectful, but
don't leave us the manpower for the work.

80
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,856
Moll shot Lowenthal,
one of our strongest men.

81
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,776
- You want things to go fast?
- If it's my neck.

82
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,403
We're going to be moving...

83
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,866
Why do you want to do that?

84
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,952
We're thinking of a reprieve.

85
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,913
Our group is happy
to remain here.

86
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:50,831
Happy?

87
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,210
Why kill us now? We're
the best kommando you've had.

88
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,545
Did I say kill?

89
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,630
We both know
what we're saying.

90
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,215
So I'm a liar.

91
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,676
You're what you are.

92
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:03,969
It's not my decision.

93
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,136
Of course it's your decision.

94
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,680
No one is
to leave their areas.

95
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,557
You're telling me it's not
you're decision?

96
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,268
No one is to leave
their areas.

97
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,854
- The Doctor leaves.
- The Doctor is different.

98
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,730
There've been people
in the zones.

99
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:16,982
We haven't been.

100
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:18,650
We know what we see.

101
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:23,780
You're to keep with your units.
Each to each building.

102
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,074
- The bribes are taken.
- Nevertheless.

103
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,285
But we're going
to need replacements.

104
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:29,536
Get back inside!

105
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,122
Or I'll be replacing you.

106
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,497
We missed you this morning.

107
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,290
Missed me?

108
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:19,002
- The data are on your desk.
- Good.

109
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:23,715
We've arranged for more forms.
You should have said.

110
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,218
- I'm sorry we had to ask.
- Please.

111
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,596
- What about the lenses?
- They're on the way.

112
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,190
You are an astonishing
pathologist.

113
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:41,775
Thank you.

114
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,444
- That's not easy for you to hear.
- It isn't.

115
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:51,368
Something in you knows that our
situation is unique.

116
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,665
And as a scientist, you are
as true a one as I've known.

117
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,709
You understand...

118
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:03,547
...that when I'm sure every cell in your
body tells you to do otherwise.

119
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:04,589
They do.

120
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,058
This isn't our war.

121
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,601
Not mine.

122
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:19,604
Nor mine, I can assure you.

123
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,692
But to allow this all
to go to waist.

124
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,777
I understand your position.

125
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,488
Clearly, you do more than that.

126
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,948
As you wish.

127
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,324
Meaning?

128
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,036
There is no meaning.

129
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:45,672
We're going to be increasing
the volume of our research.

130
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,359
I shall need more staff.

131
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,071
Then you shall have more staff.

132
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:16,745
Yes?

133
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,581
- Pardon?
- You want to say...

134
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:21,750
- It's...
- Yes?

135
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:27,088
We had discussed last time.

136
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,300
Of course.

137
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,488
This gets you anywhere
in the camp.

138
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,161
- You wait until now?
- Me?

139
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,831
- This is too wrapped up.
- I got it that way.

140
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,959
- From whom?
- I never saw her face.

141
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:29,085
Where's Tsipora?

142
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:30,670
Where is she?

143
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,097
And?

144
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,558
And that's all I know.
I'd never seen her before.

145
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,186
- But they have her.
- I said that's all I know.

146
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,188
There's no way they don't.

147
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,899
I know Tsipora. They won't get
a thing out of her.

148
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,401
It doesn't matter.
The point is keep going.

149
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:56,905
They'll find us like they found her
and until then we get in.

150
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,115
It's hard to guarantee
how much we'll get anymore.

151
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,409
This is a chain.
You find another link.

152
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,912
I just said we did.
We found a stupid link.

153
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,247
So what's the trouble?

154
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,165
You don't walk out
of there everyday.

155
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,500
I do plenty more than that.

156
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,543
This isn't a contest.

157
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:13,630
Then don't make it one.
I'm prepared for anything, Dina.

158
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:16,091
- And so am I.
- You should be.

159
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:18,385
So, is there a problem?

160
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,429
If they find us, what do they
do with the rest of our group?

161
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,306
You're risking your own life.

162
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,392
Why should we risk theirs?

163
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,603
You both act
like we put everyone in here.

164
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:32,148
I don't make you do anything.
Be like them, both of you.

165
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,150
That isn't
what she's saying.

166
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:37,904
The whole barracks will be punished.
They'll be before they're killed.

167
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,155
Just like us.

168
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,157
What's the fucking difference
when you're dead anyway?

169
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,326
We made the choice,
they haven't.

170
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,870
I'm not listening
to this anymore.

171
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,497
Make sure these get into the cart.
How many bodies are there?

172
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:48,623
Eight.

173
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,500
You see, that's good.

174
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,711
The more bodies the better.
Get it?

175
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:55,839
I'll just take these two.

176
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:01,887
Idiots.

177
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:09,811
Is she right?

178
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:12,397
Of course she's right.

179
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:15,525
What have you been thinking
for the past two months?

180
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:18,904
I just wish I could slap the shit
out of her is all.

181
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,222
Ist ein problem?

182
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:51,640
Ist ein problem?

183
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:52,974
Keine Problem.

184
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,307
I feel sorry for the world
if we don't win the war.

185
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,268
It's your position.

186
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:39,396
Men are tribal.
We'll end that.

187
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,649
There'll be one tribe.
No war.

188
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,735
There've been wars
within your tribe.

189
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:46,987
Yes?

190
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:50,365
Rhoem? The Night
of the Long Knives.

191
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,242
You know a good deal
about Germany.

192
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,163
That, of course,
was a putsch.

193
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,372
What's the difference?

194
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,749
A putsch is not a war.

195
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,293
It's a kind of war.

196
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:05,338
It's a putsch. If it meant war,
the word would be unnecessary.

197
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:08,258
Why have two words
for the same thing?

198
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,677
I'm German, you're Hungarian.

199
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:14,014
I should think I'd be the authority
in this room on the German language.

200
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,265
Of course.

201
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:18,894
In spite of your obvious
intelligence.

202
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:20,478
Of course.

203
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:29,654
There's a rumour around the Number3
Crematorium there'll be a rebellion.

204
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,782
The Number 3?

205
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,410
That would involve the First.

206
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:39,956
That would involve all 4, originating
with the Poles in Number 3.

207
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,792
What would I know?

208
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:44,961
They think we're going
to kill them.

209
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,463
Don't you always?

210
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,424
This is the best kommando
we've had.

211
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:50,717
Alright.

212
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,011
You let them know that.

213
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,262
They don't trust me.

214
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,847
You're their doctor.

215
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,807
I'm their doctor
but they know what I do.

216
00:20:58,016 --> 00:20:59,142
What do they do?

217
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,019
They work under gunpoint.

218
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,313
I won't tell them
what I don't believe.

219
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,606
That we'll let them live?

220
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,441
That you'll let any
of us live.

221
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:10,403
What happens to you has little
to do with me.

222
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:14,074
You're treated well.
Better than anyone.

223
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:16,660
You should let us know.

224
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,829
- They're not going to...
- If you hear anything.

225
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:20,247
That's all.

226
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:31,591
Did you ever consider, Herr
Oberschaarfuhere, that these...

227
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:33,218
...headaches might be related...

228
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,556
Yes?

229
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:43,895
...to the increase, lately,
in the level of cargo.

230
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:47,858
Go on.

231
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:54,322
What I see in the courtyard, if
I just crack the window for some air.

232
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,242
Anyone would have difficulty.

233
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,953
You shouldn't be looking
out of windows.

234
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:04,332
- I'm only suggesting...
- Your job is to diagnose.

235
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,209
Alright.

236
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,631
If I get upset, if my head aches,
it's because I drink too much.

237
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:13,508
Then don't drink so much.

238
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,302
That's right,
I won't drink so much.

239
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:17,929
But that too should stay
between you and me.

240
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:20,473
- I would never...
- That's right, you would never.

241
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:23,226
Because you're just
as disposable as I am.

242
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:25,812
- Herr...
- I don't care! Shut up!

243
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:27,772
I don't care.

244
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:30,692
We're each of us a part of it.

245
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:33,528
Once any of you decide
to live this way.

246
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,822
And you especially.

247
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:38,950
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

248
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,953
Once you make that choice.

249
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,443
About half are in.

250
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:38,528
Yes?

251
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:24,342
Max, you'll botch this.
We don't have any choice.

252
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:25,844
It started with them.

253
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,013
So a bunch of Poles
from Number 3 get to decide.

254
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,849
They get to stall it until it's right
for them, and it's our people.

255
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,309
Who is our people?

256
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:33,685
On the fucking trains.

257
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,228
- Because they're Hungarian?
- Yes.

258
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:38,982
That's because Hungary's the only
country with any Jews left.

259
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,525
But that's your reason?

260
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,069
If we were burning Polish
Jews you wouldn't care?

261
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:46,364
If we were burning Polish Jews
we wouldn't be waiting.

262
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,450
What's another week
to these guys?

263
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:50,452
Another ten thousand Hungarians?

264
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,746
They don't care about us.

265
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,498
We're all after
the same thing, Max.

266
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,082
It doesn't seem like it.

267
00:26:58,668 --> 00:26:59,628
Here he is.

268
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:05,592
Sorry.
It was hell getting over.

269
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:07,552
How is it over there?

270
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:09,846
They're locking us all in.

271
00:27:10,222 --> 00:27:12,015
- Who said?
- Lopkowitz.

272
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:13,600
They're getting ready
to liquidate another section.

273
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:14,851
Which one?

274
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:18,271
I'd guess one of the Czechs. Better for
them, anyway. They're all starving.

275
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:19,773
Give me some vodka.

276
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:26,655
What's this?

277
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,241
Hungarian wine.
We got it in today.

278
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,700
Any gold?

279
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,661
They haven't come back yet.

280
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:37,791
Look here.

281
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:41,545
Check out the diamonds.

282
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:43,421
Lovely.

283
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,507
- I was gonna get it smelted, but...
- But what?

284
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,676
Smelt it.

285
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:48,718
Fine.

286
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,015
Looks like we got some god food in.
Smoked oysters, meats, a few cakes.

287
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,517
We should do alright tonight.

288
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,519
We hear you got
more machine guns.

289
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:00,730
- Who told you?
- Hoffman found out.

290
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:03,066
- Were you gonna tell us?
- Of course.

291
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:05,151
Doesn't seem like it.
He just said explosives.

292
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:05,944
No.

293
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,238
Why do you think I came?

294
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,448
Because Hoffman told you
to come.

295
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,242
No. I told Hoffman.

296
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,788
They were left inside the fence by
the partisans. And twenty grenades.

297
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,373
Who has them now?

298
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:19,291
We do.

299
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:22,752
So we don't give any more of ours,
you guys are better off now.

300
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,921
When did we ever need
from you?

301
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,215
So what's this business
about waiting?

302
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:29,384
- We have to re-coordinate.
- Why?

303
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:31,261
I don't like the way
you talk with me.

304
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:32,429
You don't like
the way I talk?

305
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:33,346
I don't like
the way he talks.

306
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:35,891
Wait, you don't like the way I talk?
It's difficult to understand?

307
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,188
Why are we re-coordinating?

308
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,439
Again.

309
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:44,733
- We have more guns.
- We had guns.

310
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,736
You think the partisans aren't
wondering why we've done nothing?

311
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:50,155
You think the women aren't wondering
with the powder they've got in?

312
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,032
- The machine guns.
- So?

313
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:54,826
What?

314
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:56,620
Escape.

315
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,333
Wait. Who? Us?

316
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:05,879
You think you think
we'll escape?

317
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:07,130
With guns.

318
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,758
So we kill more of them.
Destroy three of the crematorium.

319
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:10,717
And get out.

320
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,135
Is that what you're after?

321
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:13,720
If I get the chance,
fuck yes.

322
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:16,932
You tell them, if this is
about escape, we're out.

323
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,475
How can you speak
for all of us?

324
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:20,060
You gonna speak for yourself?

325
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,019
Are you serious?

326
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,812
What, you're gonna go back
to your normal life?

327
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,065
Forget that. The point
is it doesn't make any sense.

328
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:26,775
You live to tell.

329
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:29,611
You're not going to live.
You won't make it to the Vistula.

330
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,154
Others have made it.

331
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:33,406
Others from the camp,
not from the kommandos.

332
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,660
They'll give up on someone
from Buna, or the camp...

333
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:39,579
...but not anyone who's been
inside the crematorium.

334
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,374
What we could tell they'll
turn Poland upside down.

335
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,753
If we want to accomplish anything,
it has to be one thing.

336
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:48,046
One end.

337
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:49,881
And that's the machinery.

338
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:51,675
You've got to tell them this.

339
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,094
And there's no time left.
Do they know that?

340
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:56,388
Kommando 8 lasted
three months and a week.

341
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:58,682
Not with this kind of cargo.
Even Moll admits...

342
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:01,601
Moll's not going to tell you.
And with them locking us in,...

343
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,772
Do you hear this?
You don't even speak German.

344
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:06,982
What the fuck does
that matter?

345
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,067
I speak enough.
And I speak Yiddish.

346
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:11,695
- You speak Yiddish?
- From the Poles.

347
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:13,446
You heard from the Poles!

348
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:14,489
Shut up!

349
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:21,830
Mussfeld told me they
are getting ready to move us.

350
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:25,876
No group has lasted more
than four months.

351
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,878
- All he's saying is...
- I know what he's saying.

352
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,504
We could be massacred waiting...

353
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:31,089
...like every other group,
thinking we're different.

354
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:34,634
Which'll be worse even
than ting to escape.

355
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:38,805
We can tell them
we can work this out.

356
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:41,808
But it has
to be the crematorium.

357
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,270
Then they can do whatever they want.
You can run to high heaven.

358
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:47,480
But after we've done
the buildings.

359
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:51,943
I'd like a bottle
of that wine.

360
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,029
Give us the necklace.

361
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:54,946
Oh, c'mon.

362
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:56,823
It's good wine,
you fucking Yid.

363
00:30:57,699 --> 00:31:01,536
You won't get that smelted and it'll be of
no use. We can get something for it.

364
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:04,456
- Two bottles.
- Fuck you.

365
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,792
Hoffman, give him two bottles.

366
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:21,681
Be careful.

367
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:26,686
They're liars.

368
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,438
What are they gonna lie about?

369
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:30,398
He wanted to keep the necklace.

370
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:35,612
He thinks he's going to live.
We're a fucking diversion.

371
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:38,657
These are Jews.

372
00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:40,742
You keep saying that, Simon.

373
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:43,745
You trust Jews anymore?

374
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,836
No one would make it?

375
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:54,089
Suppose even you do.

376
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:59,177
Do you want to look anyone in the face
if any of your family's even alive?

377
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,139
What you've done
For a little more life.

378
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:06,518
For vodka and bed linens.

379
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,009
Anja, listen to me...

380
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:10,303
...you're gonna die anyway.
We're dead.

381
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:11,721
They'll find the powder.

382
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:13,223
Don't say anything.

383
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,308
No matter what they do.

384
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,893
Don't say anything.

385
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:18,436
I love you.

386
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:16,495
This process of disinfecting is of
vital importance to your health.

387
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,371
One louse can kill you.

388
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:21,416
Cleanliness brings freedom.

389
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:22,959
You're all fine.

390
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:26,421
The quicker you get undressed, the
quicker you'll be cleaned, settled...

391
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,507
...and reunited
with your families.

392
00:37:28,882 --> 00:37:30,050
Filthy liar.

393
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,512
Remember the number of the hook
you hang your clothes on.

394
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,763
He's a liar.

395
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:36,723
I can't believe it's
Jews doing this.

396
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:39,851
He's lying everyone.
He's a liar.

397
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,894
Stop it.

398
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:43,605
You should listen
to your wife.

399
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:46,191
Think what you want to think,
but don't cause trouble.

400
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,652
- I'm causing trouble?
- Please.

401
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:52,781
Look me in the eye and tell me
I'm not gonna be killed.

402
00:37:53,698 --> 00:37:57,369
Hang your clothes on the hooks and keep
them separate from your neighbours.

403
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,538
I'm gonna die, but I'll have lived
longer than you ever will.

404
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:00,831
You're dead already.

405
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:04,918
Be quiet. You think you're
gonna change something?

406
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:08,213
- That's right, what does it matter?
- At least I'll die with my dignity.

407
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:09,464
- Morris.
- Stop it!

408
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:12,384
At least I'll die
with my dignity.

409
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:14,386
How'd you get through
with herewith that?

410
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:16,471
What?

411
00:38:16,638 --> 00:38:17,514
The watch, is what.

412
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:19,766
They'd have killed your whole car.

413
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:21,309
What does it matter?

414
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:25,105
See what you've done for yourself
now? Give me the watch.

415
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:27,065
Why?

416
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:28,650
Give it to me.
You're bathing.

417
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,443
Why do you need the watch
in there?

418
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:32,529
Get it from me after
of the Nazis will.

419
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:34,990
- Do as he says, Morris.
- We always do what everyone says.

420
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:37,200
I'm not giving you anything.

421
00:38:38,994 --> 00:38:40,537
You're attracting
more attention.

422
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:43,248
Tell me, tell me I'm gonna live,
you fucking Nazi.

423
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:45,041
Tell me I'm gonna live.

424
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:45,876
Morris, give him the watch.

425
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:46,918
He's a liar, everyone.

426
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,379
These Jews are all Nazi liars.

427
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,381
And now he wants
to steal my watch.

428
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,049
- Give me the watch!
- No.

429
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:54,718
All I want is the fucking watch!

430
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:55,886
No!

431
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:58,763
No! Give him the watch!

432
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:14,339
Alright, let's keep it moving.

433
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:18,343
Remember what hooks you hang
your clothes on.

434
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,805
The hooks are numbered. You'll need
to return once you've showered.

435
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,225
Keep your shoes tied together by
their laces so you don't lose them.

436
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,770
The sooner you shower, the sooner
you'll be fed and reunited.

437
00:40:29,437 --> 00:40:31,147
Move it, move it!

438
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:36,611
Keep moving inside.

439
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:38,363
Move it!

440
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:44,703
Move it! Move it!

441
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:46,496
David.

442
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:48,790
Stay.

443
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,959
David?

444
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,071
Do you want a drink?

445
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:03,156
No, thank you.

446
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:07,911
- You have work.
- Yes.

447
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:33,562
Always so young.

448
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:37,232
Adult siblings move away
from one another.

449
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,819
- How's it going?
- Alright.

450
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:48,410
He'll make twins?
With German women?

451
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:50,787
That's the goal.

452
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:54,457
What's this?

453
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,710
A gall stone.

454
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:58,795
What are you keeping it for?

455
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:01,631
He takes an interest
in such things.

456
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:07,304
- He collects them?
- I suppose.

457
00:43:07,804 --> 00:43:08,722
In jars?

458
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:13,101
That's how I'm giving it to him. What
he does with it after is his business.

459
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,817
So, have you heard anything?

460
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:22,652
Heard anything?

461
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:25,280
- I mentioned last time.
- I told you...

462
00:43:26,698 --> 00:43:27,491
Yes?

463
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:29,075
They don't speak to me.

464
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:35,874
You found your wife and daughter.

465
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:38,752
Who told you?

466
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:40,420
Does it matter?

467
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:42,214
I don't suppose.

468
00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:45,634
You've been several times.
Brought blankets, medicine.

469
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:46,551
Yes.

470
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:49,513
In C-camp, is it?

471
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:51,223
- He gave you a pass.
- Yes.

472
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,143
What did you think
of it over there?

473
00:43:56,478 --> 00:43:57,437
Think?

474
00:43:58,355 --> 00:44:00,023
Did you tell them
what goes on here?

475
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,817
Of course not.

476
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:03,568
Do they have any idea?

477
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:05,403
How couldn't they?
Everyone talks.

478
00:44:06,696 --> 00:44:08,990
- You denied it.
- I did.

479
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,327
It's best.

480
00:44:17,582 --> 00:44:19,751
They're going
to be liquidating C-camp.

481
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:21,294
Who said?

482
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:23,922
Cuts in administration.

483
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:26,091
There's not enough food.

484
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:28,593
In the next two weeks.

485
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,262
We dispose of food.

486
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,847
The order is the order.

487
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,432
The entire section.

488
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:35,934
Two weeks?

489
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:36,810
That's what I said.

490
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:39,020
I'll speak with...

491
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:40,897
What does he have to do
with who stays and who goes?

492
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:44,151
What does he have to do?...

493
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:45,777
Because he gave you a pass?

494
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:48,071
I can assure you it
won't be allowed.

495
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:54,327
It will be easy to save them.

496
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:58,540
If there is an uprising
in this camp there will be a massacre...

497
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:00,709
...that will far outweigh
anything done to us.

498
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:02,919
These men will suffer.

499
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,172
That's a strange remark.

500
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,756
We let them live.

501
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:08,091
For a time.

502
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:12,387
Even if I...
they don't.

503
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,098
Someone will speak.

504
00:45:15,932 --> 00:45:17,392
I want to know you'll help me.

505
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:21,688
If I'm spoken to.

506
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:23,773
Whatever you hear.

507
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:26,776
Yes.

508
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:28,445
Good.

509
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:33,241
As for your wife and daughter...

510
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:36,870
we must go to KZ Administration
and get them transferred.

511
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:38,038
How?

512
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:40,624
Find out which are
the safe convoys out.

513
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:43,960
They're sending some west
to the munitions factory.

514
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:47,547
Have them volunteer.
They will be chosen.

515
00:45:47,923 --> 00:45:48,965
It's safe?

516
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:52,302
I'm telling you I will make it safe.

517
00:45:52,844 --> 00:45:54,638
That's what I'll do for you.

518
00:45:55,138 --> 00:45:57,349
They must keep it a secret,
though.

519
00:45:58,433 --> 00:46:00,477
- If everyone volunteers...
- I know.

520
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:02,979
They save themselves,
that's all.

521
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:05,899
Just like you.

522
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:09,528
You and your gall stone.

523
00:46:10,987 --> 00:46:13,156
Your gall stone of a Jew.

524
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:44,855
How did you get the powder
from the plant?

525
00:46:58,743 --> 00:47:00,954
How did you get the powder
from the plant?

526
00:47:01,538 --> 00:47:03,415
It doesn't matter how they
got the fucking powder.

527
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:06,251
What we need to know
is where it's headed.

528
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:08,044
I'm asking her that.

529
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:10,213
You think I don't have ears?

530
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:16,261
You're asking her where it came
from. It came from the plant.

531
00:47:16,553 --> 00:47:18,054
The plant wants to know.

532
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:19,806
Of course the plant wants
to know.

533
00:47:20,432 --> 00:47:22,517
They should have wondered
that before it happened.

534
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:27,522
You'll kill this one, too before
she tells us who has it now.

535
00:47:37,532 --> 00:47:39,201
Where was the powder headed?

536
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:46,625
Where was the powder headed?

537
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:54,758
This is what you want?

538
00:48:02,432 --> 00:48:03,934
You're going to kill me anyway.

539
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,894
You won't be so lucky.

540
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:11,316
We will do worse to your entire
block, after we're done with you.

541
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:18,824
Why don't you just gas them?

542
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:24,955
Revive her.

543
00:49:39,738 --> 00:49:41,072
I got the girl.

544
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:42,657
You two got a date?

545
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:44,326
I said take the fucking body.

546
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,814
Why are you up here?

547
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:15,690
There's a girl...

548
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:17,692
I said what are you doing
up here?

549
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:20,612
There's a young girl on that cart
who survived the gas.

550
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:23,657
She's still breathing.
She'll be burned alive.

551
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:35,919
We're taking this one.

552
00:50:36,044 --> 00:50:37,087
What do you mean, taking?

553
00:50:37,337 --> 00:50:38,380
I mean taking the body.

554
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:39,256
Let me get the hair.

555
00:50:39,548 --> 00:50:41,800
I said we're taking her,
hair and all.

556
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:44,261
If she leaves with hair,
I need to know why.

557
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,428
She's a twin.

558
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:46,137
What's the trouble?

559
00:50:46,346 --> 00:50:48,223
I need this body
for the Doctor.

560
00:50:48,431 --> 00:50:49,474
So let him get the hair.

561
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:52,602
What is it with you people?
We're taking now, with the hair.

562
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:54,104
If she's a twin,
where's the other one?

563
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:56,565
The other one was caught
before she got on the lift.

564
00:50:57,107 --> 00:51:00,235
And why was she killed?
I thought they were taken alive.

565
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:02,404
Are you saying I'm lying?

566
00:51:03,071 --> 00:51:04,990
I've kept this unit alive
nine months.

567
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:05,991
What do I care?

568
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:07,617
So you're alive.
We're all alive.

569
00:51:07,826 --> 00:51:09,828
We're all shitting gold.
Make your fucking point.

570
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:11,079
I don't want trouble.

571
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:14,624
If you want trouble, send me down
to the Doctor with her head shaved.

572
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:22,674
Take her. What do I care.

573
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:24,426
Help them.

574
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:26,636
No, we've got her.
I said we fucking have her.

575
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,602
This will foul everything.

576
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:34,853
It's blood on our hands.

577
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:36,730
It's a goddam distraction.
And what do we do with her?

578
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:37,981
We figure that out.

579
00:51:38,064 --> 00:51:38,940
We'll have to hide her.

580
00:51:39,107 --> 00:51:41,109
And not just from them,
but from some of us, too.

581
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:43,069
We do not have time
to be dealing with this.

582
00:51:47,157 --> 00:51:48,283
She was inside.

583
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:50,911
It'll be and she'll never make it.
What are you thinking?

584
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,579
I'm not going to kill her,
alright?

585
00:51:52,787 --> 00:51:56,541
Just think if they found her
in the barracks, which they will...

586
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,210
...because you'll never keep her
without it'll be worse.

587
00:51:58,418 --> 00:51:59,544
How can that be worse?

588
00:51:59,753 --> 00:52:00,378
Worse for her.

589
00:52:00,504 --> 00:52:01,922
Forgetting
what they'll do to us.

590
00:52:02,172 --> 00:52:05,425
She's not even conscious. She goes
the way she would have gone.

591
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:07,135
Meet us at the store room.

592
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:08,720
I can stop you, Max.

593
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,180
Stop me, then. Do it!

594
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:12,182
You know we're not killing her.

595
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:21,691
Where's Schlermer?

596
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:22,526
Down the corridor.

597
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:23,235
Where's she?

598
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,195
He won't bring her in until
he talks with the Doctor.

599
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:26,780
Why? Get him.

600
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:28,031
Who's gonna watch?

601
00:52:28,114 --> 00:52:29,908
What's to watch?
There's no one in the hall.

602
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:31,159
He won't let anyone near her.

603
00:52:31,243 --> 00:52:32,077
You'd better get her in here.

604
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:32,953
Go.

605
00:52:36,248 --> 00:52:38,792
I know what you think.
It's not the same.

606
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:40,961
He's scared.

607
00:52:41,169 --> 00:52:42,420
We'll put her on this table.

608
00:52:42,629 --> 00:52:43,880
If anyone were to find out...

609
00:52:44,089 --> 00:52:44,840
I know.

610
00:52:45,048 --> 00:52:46,258
We're not murderers.

611
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:47,300
I know that.

612
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:51,471
We're sorry.

613
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,682
I hadn't been here long enough.

614
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,018
- I'm talking about...
- I know what you're talking about.

615
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:59,229
- Of course.
- It doesn't mean I'd act differently.

616
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:01,898
I've aborted suicides before
and would again.

617
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:05,485
- I understand.
- Anywhere.

618
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:06,403
I didn't.

619
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:07,445
I was summoned.

620
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:08,405
Not by me.

621
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:12,659
After midnight like this, to watch
what amounted to a murder.

622
00:53:14,286 --> 00:53:16,830
Something I hardly need
to be woken for in this place.

623
00:53:17,455 --> 00:53:18,165
I'm sorry.

624
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:20,375
- It's not how we...
- Then don't call for me.

625
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:22,878
I'm sorry.

626
00:53:23,295 --> 00:53:25,922
- And you exclude me.
- Exclude you?

627
00:53:26,214 --> 00:53:27,883
I don't know why you do that.

628
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:32,137
He told you?

629
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:33,305
Yes.

630
00:53:33,597 --> 00:53:34,973
That there's no point.

631
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:36,641
I can't know
until you bring her in.

632
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,227
If there's no hope,
if she's dead already...

633
00:53:39,436 --> 00:53:41,021
I'm at risk here, too.

634
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:43,231
I don't give a shit about you.

635
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:46,735
Bring her in.

636
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:52,908
Hoffman.

637
00:53:55,994 --> 00:53:58,538
Get some blankets,
some tea, some warm broth.

638
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:00,916
Here.

639
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:02,584
Well put it over her.

640
00:54:03,752 --> 00:54:04,794
Not there.

641
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,831
How many of those
will you give her?

642
00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:43,458
She's had twenty minutes of gas.

643
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:25,625
Put it there.

644
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:27,460
It's alright.

645
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:38,972
Some tea.

646
00:55:53,236 --> 00:55:54,988
Stop that! Let me do it.

647
00:55:59,784 --> 00:56:00,744
Spoon.

648
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:05,665
This is just some tea.

649
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:07,542
Tea.

650
00:56:16,718 --> 00:56:18,261
Good. Good.

651
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:23,892
- What was this convoy?
- Hungarian.

652
00:56:24,935 --> 00:56:26,478
- Who found her?
- He did.

653
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:27,312
Where?

654
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:29,314
On the bottom.

655
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:31,274
The young are always
on the bottom.

656
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:33,735
How was she lying?

657
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:35,153
Lying?

658
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:38,198
It's a simple question.
On her side, what?

659
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:40,283
On her belly.

660
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,081
Can you hear me?

661
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:48,917
Hello?

662
00:56:51,628 --> 00:56:52,963
You must speak with me.

663
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,007
Hello.

664
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:00,887
What's your name?

665
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:04,474
Hello.

666
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,309
Hello.

667
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:11,773
This is gonna take time.

668
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:14,484
It'll take time.

669
00:57:16,987 --> 00:57:19,781
So simple...

670
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,952
...and whom does it harm?

671
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:29,457
It harms only you.

672
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:33,920
If you refuse to tell us
what we're going to know anyway...

673
00:57:34,462 --> 00:57:37,215
which is where was
the powder going?

674
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,972
Where was the powder going?

675
00:57:47,517 --> 00:57:51,062
Is this what you want happening
to the people who have the powder...

676
00:57:51,897 --> 00:57:54,524
...or to the rest of your block
until we find them?

677
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:02,532
Where was the powder going?

678
00:58:03,158 --> 00:58:04,284
Don't tell them.

679
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:06,703
Don't tell them. Don't tell them.

680
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:10,665
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

681
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,002
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

682
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:17,047
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

683
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:28,391
You're not supposed
to be in the zones.

684
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,643
I'm aware of that.

685
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:33,396
There were two girls caught with
explosives in the Polish section.

686
00:58:34,648 --> 00:58:36,983
You think we're suddenly chummy
with the rest of the camp?

687
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:41,613
You have another piece
for the way back?

688
00:58:41,947 --> 00:58:43,198
I'll get it there.

689
00:58:45,492 --> 00:58:47,369
You're not supposed
to be in the zones.

690
00:58:47,577 --> 00:58:48,620
You said that.

691
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:53,834
Give me the other piece.

692
00:58:58,088 --> 00:58:59,965
And have two for the way back.

693
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,509
Or you won't be slapped,
you'll be shot.

694
00:59:07,055 --> 00:59:09,057
No one's gonna harm you here.

695
00:59:09,474 --> 00:59:10,642
We're Jews.

696
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,727
Are you Hungarian?

697
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,271
Yes, she's Hungarian.

698
00:59:14,479 --> 00:59:16,231
The point is simple questions.

699
00:59:16,565 --> 00:59:18,024
Give us some more
of that soup.

700
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:27,868
We're going to be found here.

701
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:29,286
He's right.

702
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,580
We're not moving her.

703
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:35,125
It's been over 2 hours since we started
the lifts. Someone will come right past.

704
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,836
And do we cart her down the hall
without getting through the unit?

705
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:39,504
The unit doesn't know?

706
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:40,755
What would that do?

707
00:59:41,381 --> 00:59:43,049
At least get her
off the corridor.

708
00:59:44,426 --> 00:59:45,844
Fine. The changing room.

709
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:47,012
The changing room?

710
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:49,347
I said.
Go see if it's clear.

711
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:55,687
We're gonna move you. Into another
room, you'll be more comfortable.

712
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,150
She's alive, you know.

713
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:12,162
Where can you keep her?

714
01:00:12,704 --> 01:00:13,580
We can't.

715
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,290
This is a problem.

716
01:00:15,582 --> 01:00:16,500
Yeah, it's problem.

717
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,252
Because we've revived her.
You understand that.

718
01:00:19,544 --> 01:00:21,129
This wasn't my idea.

719
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:22,380
But she's been revived.

720
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:24,257
We have a responsibility.

721
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:25,300
Otherwise...

722
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:25,967
Otherwise?

723
01:00:26,218 --> 01:00:27,761
Why did we revive her?

724
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,096
- If you tell Mussfeld.
- No.

725
01:00:30,388 --> 01:00:32,265
- If you speak with him.
- Me?

726
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:34,059
The two of you.

727
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,228
What? Are friends?

728
01:00:37,062 --> 01:00:38,939
None of us is going
to talk with Mussfeld.

729
01:00:40,816 --> 01:00:42,692
He will not allow this girl
to live.

730
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:44,986
He doesn't save people.

731
01:00:45,529 --> 01:00:46,655
Your family?

732
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,451
Who told you?

733
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:52,702
We heard.

734
01:00:53,328 --> 01:00:54,996
You got the run of C-camp...

735
01:00:55,622 --> 01:00:57,624
...and found your wife and kid.

736
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,376
You wouldn't do the same?

737
01:00:59,584 --> 01:01:01,670
- And got them out.
- You wouldn't do the same?

738
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:04,381
- I wouldn't have the chance.
- That's not what I asked you.

739
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,094
I didn't have the chance.

740
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,893
If we tell Mussfeld,
she's finished.

741
01:01:17,394 --> 01:01:18,436
You hide her.

742
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:19,688
One of the doctors.

743
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:20,647
Impossible.

744
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,440
They walk in at all hours.
It has to be...

745
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:24,192
No. I said no.

746
01:01:24,317 --> 01:01:25,360
For a few days.

747
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:26,695
What few days?

748
01:01:26,903 --> 01:01:28,488
We're almost sixteen weeks.

749
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:31,158
Plus with men who've been
who've hardly seen a...

750
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,243
...and she's what, fifteen?

751
01:01:33,368 --> 01:01:34,828
Put her in your bed.

752
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:37,247
She's not staying with us,
alright? I want her out.

753
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:39,082
Forgetting for a minute
she's a girl...

754
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:42,127
what do you gain by putting her
with us when we're about to be...

755
01:01:42,669 --> 01:01:43,879
Until what?

756
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,463
A suitable time.

757
01:01:45,672 --> 01:01:47,215
There isn't going
to be a suitable time.

758
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:48,800
A day or two.

759
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:51,094
We don't have a day or two.

760
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:52,345
Nonsense.

761
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:57,726
What?

762
01:02:00,604 --> 01:02:02,355
There's going to be an uprising.

763
01:02:04,316 --> 01:02:05,192
When?

764
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:09,029
Alright, who?

765
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:10,780
Numbers 1 and 3.

766
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,073
How?

767
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:14,242
Out of Number 3.

768
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:15,202
An escape?

769
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,662
We're going to destroy
the crematorium.

770
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,873
You'll all be killed.

771
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,418
The things that come out
of your mouth.

772
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:25,629
We're to be killed
within the week.

773
01:02:25,712 --> 01:02:26,963
How do you know?

774
01:02:27,297 --> 01:02:29,674
Like I said, we're almost
four months.

775
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:32,802
We're dead.
Our time's up.

776
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:36,973
Were you going to ask
for our help?

777
01:02:37,808 --> 01:02:39,142
Ask for your help?

778
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:39,976
The doctors.

779
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:42,813
Were you going to ask
for our help?

780
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,606
Even tell us?

781
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:50,195
I never asked to be doing
what I do.

782
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:52,280
You volunteered.

783
01:02:52,572 --> 01:02:55,116
They wanted doctors
for a hospital.

784
01:02:55,325 --> 01:02:58,703
You knew the sort of work you'd be
doing, and you continue to do it.

785
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:00,330
I don't kill.

786
01:03:00,539 --> 01:03:01,706
And we do?

787
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:03,792
I didn't say that.

788
01:03:05,335 --> 01:03:06,920
You give killing purpose.

789
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:09,923
We're all just trying
to make it to the next day.

790
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,217
That's all any
of us is doing.

791
01:03:12,717 --> 01:03:14,594
You have no idea, do you?

792
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:16,513
I don't know
what you're talking about.

793
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,933
I do not wish to be alive
when all of this is over.

794
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:21,685
I don't believe that.

795
01:03:22,853 --> 01:03:24,229
I know you don't.

796
01:03:24,813 --> 01:03:26,523
I can help you.

797
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:28,275
You want to
help?

798
01:03:29,234 --> 01:03:31,194
Get rid of this fucking girl.

799
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:01,516
Where have you been?

800
01:04:01,766 --> 01:04:02,476
What do we got?

801
01:04:02,684 --> 01:04:04,269
Plenty, but very little gold.

802
01:04:04,436 --> 01:04:05,479
You're gonna have to divvy up.

803
01:04:05,687 --> 01:04:06,730
They've got three of the women.

804
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,689
Where?

805
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:10,317
Block eleven. Someone says we're
hiding a girl still alive?

806
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,860
Keep everyone away
from this area.

807
01:04:12,068 --> 01:04:13,445
- Is it true?
- We'll be up.

808
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:16,865
We heard. We got problems
of our own.

809
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:18,742
- What's he doing?
- I told him.

810
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:19,659
You told him?

811
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:21,453
I just told him. Come on.

812
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:37,928
- Why are you here?
- What's this about?

813
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:39,596
She survived the gas.

814
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:42,098
What're you gonna do with her?

815
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:44,684
What're you gonna do with her?

816
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:46,144
Why is he here?

817
01:04:46,269 --> 01:04:48,897
They caught three of the women
for the Unio, found powder.

818
01:04:49,105 --> 01:04:49,940
Here?

819
01:04:50,315 --> 01:04:51,733
In the camp.

820
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:52,859
How do you know?

821
01:04:53,068 --> 01:04:55,529
They didn't come with the powder
and we found out. As far as we know...

822
01:04:57,322 --> 01:05:00,367
They've been stealing and they aren't
going to find out where it was going?

823
01:05:00,534 --> 01:05:01,576
I didn't say that.

824
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:04,204
- They are being tortured right now?
- Of course they are.

825
01:05:04,412 --> 01:05:08,792
How long did you expect this
to go on, before they were caught?

826
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,377
- We couldn't have...
- We couldn't have what?

827
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:15,090
We couldn't mustered together at any
time once we decided it was time...

828
01:05:15,257 --> 01:05:16,925
- No, we couldn't...
- Oh, God dam, no we couldn't have.

829
01:05:17,175 --> 01:05:18,301
That's a lie.

830
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,010
It was...

831
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:22,222
- It was who? The Poles?
- No, it was the whole group.

832
01:05:22,347 --> 01:05:26,309
So we waited for this to be killed
without the chance.

833
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:27,978
There are two women
being tortured right now.

834
01:05:28,186 --> 01:05:29,104
Why are they being tortured?

835
01:05:29,354 --> 01:05:31,106
Why are we still burning day
after day?

836
01:05:31,314 --> 01:05:34,568
Because we've waited. Because
suddenly this became about escape.

837
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,194
And let's get it straight,
Hesh.

838
01:05:37,154 --> 01:05:40,490
You were gonna deal us out.
We were just a fucking diversion.

839
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:42,242
How many times does this
have to be gone over?

840
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:46,621
Every gun you guys have got you've
kept and we find out about it later.

841
01:05:46,872 --> 01:05:48,415
Not shit from you guys.

842
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:50,876
Only plans and delays.
Your plans.

843
01:05:51,126 --> 01:05:52,169
We changed our plans.

844
01:05:52,377 --> 01:05:55,380
Changed your plans, but only
after we decided we'd be out.

845
01:05:55,714 --> 01:05:57,591
Had to make a deal,
re-coordinate.

846
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:01,553
But were you gonna stay wait
until two crematoria were done...

847
01:06:01,761 --> 01:06:03,221
...or let us do that and run run...

848
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,599
...like you always wanted to,
while we stayed and fought?

849
01:06:05,807 --> 01:06:06,558
I don't know.

850
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:09,769
But when we're through
with the machinery, I can't run?

851
01:06:09,978 --> 01:06:13,440
I have to stay here and be shot
because that's what you want to do?

852
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:15,275
Because you can't live
with it, I can't?

853
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:16,485
Fuck you, Max.

854
01:06:16,568 --> 01:06:19,404
It's my fucking life.
I hope I live till I'm ninety.

855
01:06:21,156 --> 01:06:22,407
Now we're ready to go today.

856
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:23,450
- What?
- Today?

857
01:06:23,658 --> 01:06:24,826
Between the shifts.

858
01:06:24,993 --> 01:06:26,995
Why else am I here?
To argue with this idiot?

859
01:06:27,204 --> 01:06:29,456
- Who starts the fire?
- Us.

860
01:06:29,998 --> 01:06:32,584
You see how easy it is once
the decision is made.

861
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:34,085
We have to tell the unit.

862
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:37,714
An hour. Everyone knows
what to do. It's a matter of when.

863
01:06:38,256 --> 01:06:39,382
What about the girl?

864
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:40,884
What about her?

865
01:06:41,092 --> 01:06:42,135
What do we do with her?

866
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:43,345
What do we do with her?

867
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:46,181
- It's got to be now, Max.
- We get her in the fence.

868
01:06:46,807 --> 01:06:47,516
Out?

869
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:49,726
- The fence into the camp.
- You'll never.

870
01:06:49,935 --> 01:06:51,812
- In a group we could.
- A group is worse.

871
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:53,271
- It doesn't have to be.
- We're locked in.

872
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,314
Don't do this.

873
01:06:54,523 --> 01:06:55,565
An excuse could be found.

874
01:06:55,774 --> 01:06:56,483
The Doctor's right.

875
01:06:56,691 --> 01:06:59,236
We shave her head, dress her
she looks like a boy.

876
01:06:59,444 --> 01:07:00,570
What happens on the other side
of the fence?

877
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:01,696
She gets taken in.

878
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:02,948
- Which camp?
- Does it matter?

879
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:05,075
Yes, it matters.
What do they do with her?

880
01:07:05,283 --> 01:07:06,618
How do they account
for the extra?...

881
01:07:06,827 --> 01:07:10,288
This is Germans we're talking about.
They stand corpses up in the snow...

882
01:07:10,372 --> 01:07:12,582
They're going to suspect
someone of breaking in?

883
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:13,708
Breaking in from here.

884
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,043
She's not even numbered.

885
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:18,713
Don't fuck this up for one life!
You'll be shot and so will she.

886
01:07:19,005 --> 01:07:20,590
Then there's alert
and today's impossible.

887
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:21,758
He's right, Max.

888
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:24,469
It'll drag us down.
No single person is worth that.

889
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:27,514
Look at her.

890
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:30,392
Does she even have a mind left?
Can she speak?

891
01:07:31,017 --> 01:07:31,977
We don't know.

892
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:34,146
Can you speak?

893
01:07:38,733 --> 01:07:39,568
The gas got to her.

894
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:41,319
Why are you even considering?

895
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:42,737
- We don't kill people.
- We don't?

896
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,866
We put them in the rooms,
walk them in and strip...

897
01:07:46,032 --> 01:07:47,409
...them look them in the face
and say it's safe.

898
01:07:47,576 --> 01:07:48,535
What the hell is that?

899
01:07:48,743 --> 01:07:49,286
- It's not...
- It's not what?

900
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:50,704
It's not pulling the trigger.

901
01:07:50,954 --> 01:07:52,414
You leave the room.

902
01:07:52,581 --> 01:07:56,168
Bring them in and leave say it's safe,
you'll see them when it's over.

903
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:59,588
Who put her inside? Now you
think she made it through.

904
01:07:59,796 --> 01:08:01,214
God knows how you're a hero.

905
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:02,257
Not a hero.

906
01:08:02,507 --> 01:08:04,259
Not a hero, not a killer.
What are you, Max?

907
01:08:04,885 --> 01:08:07,429
Better we do it than them.
I'll make it easy for you.

908
01:08:07,637 --> 01:08:09,055
We can solve this another way.

909
01:08:09,306 --> 01:08:10,098
I'll fucking kill you!

910
01:08:10,265 --> 01:08:11,141
You won't do shit.

911
01:08:11,308 --> 01:08:13,477
We're not going to kill her,
alright?

912
01:08:13,852 --> 01:08:16,688
I'm not saying we shouldn't have,
but we're not gonna do it now.

913
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,883
On the bench here.

914
01:08:45,926 --> 01:08:46,801
What about me?

915
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,011
What about you?

916
01:08:48,053 --> 01:08:49,638
If he sees me we're fucked
if he sees me.

917
01:08:49,846 --> 01:08:52,265
There's hundreds of He's not
gonna know you. Just keep still.

918
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:53,809
He wanders around half drunk.

919
01:08:54,643 --> 01:08:55,894
It's a fucking check.

920
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:05,070
Why is this door shut?

921
01:09:05,695 --> 01:09:07,697
We were organizing
the morning muster.

922
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:09,115
Organizing?

923
01:09:09,282 --> 01:09:10,617
With Lowenthal... Gone.

924
01:09:10,826 --> 01:09:12,035
We settled that.

925
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,579
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer,
but now with one short...

926
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:16,540
Who's going to replace him?

927
01:09:17,165 --> 01:09:17,999
He is.

928
01:09:20,377 --> 01:09:21,962
He's not capable.

929
01:09:23,755 --> 01:09:24,881
You!

930
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,216
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

931
01:09:26,424 --> 01:09:28,677
And who replaces him
is your business.

932
01:09:28,802 --> 01:09:30,095
That's just the thing.

933
01:09:30,762 --> 01:09:33,223
- What happens with...
- The duties in the room stay the same.

934
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:34,266
Yes, sir.

935
01:09:38,645 --> 01:09:40,230
It's miserable outside.

936
01:09:45,318 --> 01:09:47,529
I've grown to hate Poland.

937
01:09:56,037 --> 01:09:57,539
How are you, Doctor?

938
01:09:57,831 --> 01:09:58,665
I'm well.

939
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,253
Do you want to come over
for a drink?

940
01:10:03,795 --> 01:10:06,882
I have some Hungarian wine
some brandy.

941
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:08,967
Later.

942
01:10:09,384 --> 01:10:11,553
- If you've got a chill...
- I said no.

943
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:15,474
There's a convoy arriving...

944
01:10:16,183 --> 01:10:19,186
...and your group haven't finished
with the cargo from this morning.

945
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:22,147
- We just have to...
- You have to clear the elevators.

946
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:23,356
Yes, sir.

947
01:10:24,107 --> 01:10:25,901
And it's filthy down there.

948
01:11:11,446 --> 01:11:12,364
Yes?

949
01:11:14,366 --> 01:11:15,116
What?

950
01:11:15,826 --> 01:11:17,285
Why are you here?

951
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:19,079
Here?

952
01:11:20,497 --> 01:11:23,834
This isn't your unit.
This isn't your building.

953
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:25,919
To help.

954
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:27,879
How did you get over?

955
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,297
I was moved.

956
01:11:29,798 --> 01:11:31,550
- By whom?
- Almaier.

957
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:34,469
That's not true, is it?

958
01:11:35,345 --> 01:11:36,680
Of course it's true.

959
01:11:53,864 --> 01:11:56,491
That's how it'll go
for all of us.

960
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,245
First you, then us.

961
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,749
The last thing to do
is smile.

962
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,504
Your bombers only speed it all up.

963
01:12:11,006 --> 01:12:15,260
We'll dispose of as many of you
as we can before they do it to us.

964
01:12:17,554 --> 01:12:19,222
Why was he here?

965
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:20,265
He was moved.

966
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:21,766
He was not moved!

967
01:12:21,892 --> 01:12:23,602
You were to stay
with your groups.

968
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:28,106
Why were the women
from the Unio hoarding powder?

969
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:33,695
Why were the women
from the Unio hoarding powder?

970
01:12:37,365 --> 01:12:38,533
We let you live.

971
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,410
You're not gonna let us live.

972
01:12:40,785 --> 01:12:43,830
If something is attempted,
that's certain.

973
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:46,833
If you think we have powder,
tear apart the crematorium.

974
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:51,213
Move away from the bench.

975
01:13:00,597 --> 01:13:01,973
Where did she come from?

976
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,228
Doctor?

977
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:08,730
Everybody out.

978
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:10,649
You give orders now?

979
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:12,818
It won't help anyone
if there's a row.

980
01:13:13,318 --> 01:13:15,320
How will the work get finished?

981
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:18,782
Everyone out.
I'll take care of this.

982
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,325
What do you mean,
take care of this?

983
01:13:20,534 --> 01:13:21,576
I want what you want.

984
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:22,953
Don't speak Hungarian!

985
01:13:25,038 --> 01:13:26,581
What are you saying?

986
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:28,542
Leave quietly. Leave.

987
01:13:30,752 --> 01:13:31,670
Let's go.

988
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:33,880
Save her. You've got
to fucking save her.

989
01:13:34,172 --> 01:13:37,926
Shut him up. Take this with you.
And burn it with the others.

990
01:13:49,187 --> 01:13:53,275
I've seen them strike the ones
that are slow getting in.

991
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,528
Hey steal, lie to each other.

992
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:01,116
I never fully despised
the Jews...

993
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:05,787
...until I experienced how easily they
could be persuaded to do the work.

994
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:08,290
To do it so well.

995
01:14:08,832 --> 01:14:10,667
And to their own people.

996
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:13,587
They'll be dead
by week's end eve soul...

997
01:14:14,129 --> 01:14:17,382
...and we'll replace them
with others' no different.

998
01:14:18,717 --> 01:14:20,969
Do you know how easy that'll be?

999
01:14:29,769 --> 01:14:31,062
Who are you?

1000
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:34,483
She doesn't speak German.
I don't even think she speaks.

1001
01:14:35,525 --> 01:14:38,445
- You don't understand me?
- She's from a convoy.

1002
01:14:39,362 --> 01:14:42,073
I didn't imagine she's
from Osweicum.

1003
01:14:42,908 --> 01:14:44,993
- This morning's convoy?
- Of course.

1004
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:47,621
So you're Hungarian.

1005
01:14:55,504 --> 01:14:57,839
They took her out
from the undressing room?

1006
01:14:58,757 --> 01:14:59,674
Why her?

1007
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:02,010
She's related to someone?

1008
01:15:02,302 --> 01:15:03,345
She survived.

1009
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:05,305
Survived what?

1010
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:07,015
The gas.

1011
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:11,978
All I can think is that,
with the wet floor...

1012
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:13,438
It kills everyone.

1013
01:15:14,606 --> 01:15:19,611
If there was a pocket of wet air...
Should we speak in private?

1014
01:15:21,696 --> 01:15:24,616
If she doesn't speak German,
what's the problem?

1015
01:15:25,075 --> 01:15:28,078
I find it difficult to stand here
and discuss while...

1016
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:29,830
What's to discuss?

1017
01:15:37,754 --> 01:15:40,131
I have the information
you requested.

1018
01:15:40,882 --> 01:15:42,133
The information?

1019
01:15:42,342 --> 01:15:44,010
At the time you saved my wife
and child.

1020
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:45,345
Tell me here.

1021
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:48,390
I don't want to tell you here.

1022
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:54,855
You.

1023
01:15:56,189 --> 01:15:57,732
Stay here with her.

1024
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:04,239
If you take her out from here,
both of you will be killed.

1025
01:16:06,324 --> 01:16:07,826
Stay here.

1026
01:16:48,783 --> 01:16:50,869
I used to think so much
of myself.

1027
01:16:53,038 --> 01:16:54,831
What I've made of my life.

1028
01:16:59,586 --> 01:17:02,714
We can't know what
we're capable of, any of us.

1029
01:17:04,799 --> 01:17:09,304
How can you know what you'd do to
stay alive until you're really asked?

1030
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,016
I know this now.

1031
01:17:14,518 --> 01:17:16,061
For most of us...

1032
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:20,565
...the answer is anything.

1033
01:17:24,194 --> 01:17:26,738
It's so easy to forget
who we were before.

1034
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:32,118
Who we'll never be again.

1035
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:35,580
There was this old man.

1036
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:38,625
He pushed the carts.

1037
01:17:39,543 --> 01:17:41,545
And on our first day...

1038
01:17:42,128 --> 01:17:45,257
when we had to burn
our own convoy...

1039
01:17:45,924 --> 01:17:48,718
...his wife was brought up
on the elevator.

1040
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:51,221
Then his daughter.

1041
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:54,349
And then both his grandchildren.

1042
01:17:57,686 --> 01:17:58,895
I knew him.

1043
01:17:59,563 --> 01:18:00,897
We were neighbours.

1044
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:05,068
And in twenty minutes...

1045
01:18:05,485 --> 01:18:10,615
...his whole family and all its future
was gone from this earth.

1046
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:17,706
Two weeks later he took pills
and was revived.

1047
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,294
We smothered him
with his own pillow.

1048
01:18:22,919 --> 01:18:25,088
And now I know why.

1049
01:18:25,338 --> 01:18:29,509
You can kill yourself.
That's the only choice.

1050
01:18:34,264 --> 01:18:36,057
I want them to save you.

1051
01:18:37,392 --> 01:18:40,020
I want them to save you more
than I want anything.

1052
01:18:42,022 --> 01:18:43,982
I pray to God we save you.

1053
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:47,235
You can hear me, can't you?

1054
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:54,618
I thought so.

1055
01:18:59,831 --> 01:19:01,791
Yes. I thought so.

1056
01:19:04,044 --> 01:19:06,087
I don't understand, Doctor.

1057
01:19:06,421 --> 01:19:08,673
I don't know
how I can make it clearer.

1058
01:19:09,716 --> 01:19:13,220
Dr. Mengele says you're
the best surgeon he's seen ever.

1059
01:19:13,804 --> 01:19:15,472
I Jew, even, and he admits it.

1060
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,224
Which is astonishing.

1061
01:19:17,557 --> 01:19:19,851
He says you do the work
of five men.

1062
01:19:20,268 --> 01:19:22,354
That without you his research
would be impossible.

1063
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:23,814
Where is this leading?

1064
01:19:24,022 --> 01:19:26,316
Your expertise
has quintupled the torture.

1065
01:19:26,483 --> 01:19:27,234
I haven't...

1066
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:29,861
Has quintupled the torture
of children in this camp...

1067
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,321
...and that is fact!

1068
01:19:31,488 --> 01:19:35,534
So that you can live here as you do,
which is better than any other Jew.

1069
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:38,119
And better than all
but a handful of Germans.

1070
01:19:38,286 --> 01:19:39,538
Including me.

1071
01:19:40,288 --> 01:19:42,457
I haven't seen you once protest...

1072
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:45,377
...and as the workload has increased.

1073
01:19:45,585 --> 01:19:47,379
And you've saved your family.

1074
01:19:47,587 --> 01:19:49,172
We do what we do.

1075
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:52,175
You make up for that
with the life of this one girl?

1076
01:19:52,384 --> 01:19:53,635
I don't pretend.

1077
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:54,761
Good.

1078
01:19:55,303 --> 01:19:56,263
Don't.

1079
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:58,640
And who is to die in her place?

1080
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:01,017
No one lives here
without someone else dying.

1081
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:01,977
I don't believe that.

1082
01:20:02,185 --> 01:20:03,019
It's a fact of the camp.

1083
01:20:03,228 --> 01:20:04,396
It's numbers.

1084
01:20:04,604 --> 01:20:06,231
There's only so much food,
so much room.

1085
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:07,691
This is one child.

1086
01:20:08,024 --> 01:20:09,484
Which you could say about anyone.

1087
01:20:09,693 --> 01:20:11,236
Your wife and daughter.

1088
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:13,947
You save one, you take the life
of another.

1089
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:17,200
Put her in a bed, give her food
someone else doesn't get...

1090
01:20:17,826 --> 01:20:19,327
...dies or is removed.

1091
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,747
To save her
is a meaningless lie.

1092
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:25,125
It's your lie,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

1093
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,460
We want the girl to live.

1094
01:20:30,881 --> 01:20:33,592
If you tell me this information,
I will spare the girl.

1095
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:37,429
There's going to be an uprising.

1096
01:20:37,512 --> 01:20:38,555
When?

1097
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:41,183
I don't know. They don't want me
to be a part of it.

1098
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:43,351
And they have powder.
The women got them powder?

1099
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,188
- I said I don't know.
- Why did they tell you?

1100
01:20:46,313 --> 01:20:48,190
Because of the girl.
Because they wouldn't hide her.

1101
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:50,567
- Who told you?
- The one you killed.

1102
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:51,985
How did you speak with him?

1103
01:20:52,235 --> 01:20:54,321
He was here, wasn't he?
That's why you shot him.

1104
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:56,156
No one else here speaks with me.

1105
01:20:56,531 --> 01:21:00,118
- But they have powder?
- I don't know.

1106
01:21:00,494 --> 01:21:02,454
- Weapons?
- I don't...

1107
01:21:02,746 --> 01:21:05,040
But powder from the women.
That's where the powder went.

1108
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:06,625
I've heard nothing else.

1109
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:10,795
- This information is useless to me.
- It's all I was told.

1110
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:13,089
It's not worth the life
of the girl.

1111
01:21:14,674 --> 01:21:15,884
You agreed.

1112
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:20,806
Wrong, Doctor. I agreed to save your
wife and daughter, which I have done.

1113
01:21:23,099 --> 01:21:24,434
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer...

1114
01:21:24,559 --> 01:21:26,436
There's nothing more to discuss.

1115
01:21:28,939 --> 01:21:31,858
What about your headaches
and your drinking?

1116
01:21:36,154 --> 01:21:37,197
Excuse me?

1117
01:21:38,532 --> 01:21:40,200
I'll tell him you're unfit.

1118
01:21:45,205 --> 01:21:47,207
And they won't move you
somewhere else.

1119
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:50,085
I'll want to see her.

1120
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:53,463
Not a hair on her head,
and on the other side.

1121
01:21:55,048 --> 01:21:57,134
Through the fence,
if you'd like...

1122
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,678
...but numbered, shaved and alive.

1123
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,808
And to live isn't to kill,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

1124
01:22:06,977 --> 01:22:08,770
Because we are not doing
the killing.

1125
01:22:10,021 --> 01:22:12,107
No. Please, no!

1126
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:17,946
Because she knew.
Because all of you know.

1127
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:22,200
And these two know.

1128
01:22:24,703 --> 01:22:28,373
I could say I don't want to be doing
this but that wouldn't be true.

1129
01:22:31,293 --> 01:22:33,670
It's less bodies for us
to worry about.

1130
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:35,672
Keep track of.

1131
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:36,923
Feed.

1132
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:41,219
So, do us a favour
and remain silent.

1133
01:22:43,597 --> 01:22:46,099
But you don't seem
to be enjoying it...

1134
01:22:47,058 --> 01:22:49,644
...murdering your friends
to protect...

1135
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,313
who?

1136
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:54,566
Polish partisans who hate you?

1137
01:22:54,858 --> 01:22:56,318
Sold Jews...

1138
01:22:56,943 --> 01:22:59,112
...and stole from Jews early
in the war.

1139
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:09,539
One by one...

1140
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:11,875
We can do this until we're done
with your whole group...

1141
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:14,628
...and then we'll move
to the next block.

1142
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:17,672
Or one of you any of you...

1143
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,512
...tell us where the powder is,
where it was headed.

1144
01:23:24,054 --> 01:23:26,223
They don't know.
None of them know.

1145
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:28,850
Tell them, please.
Tell them.

1146
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:30,936
They don't know.
Don't you think they would say?

1147
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:33,146
You know, and you're silent.

1148
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:34,272
Stop the killing.

1149
01:23:35,398 --> 01:23:38,026
You know, because you had
to have been approached.

1150
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:42,197
And you are getting it
for somewhere.

1151
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:45,075
Stop the killing.

1152
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,330
Please. Please.

1153
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:52,082
No! No!

1154
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,793
Don't shoot her!

1155
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:19,526
Get a proper count.

1156
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:43,300
It's all sentimental.

1157
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,471
Do you understand sentimental?

1158
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:52,142
Because they look you
in the eye twice.

1159
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:55,061
Once before and once after.

1160
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:58,356
Suddenly they believe
in heroics.

1161
01:25:02,068 --> 01:25:03,403
You wait here.

1162
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:09,993
Hold her in here
until I get back.

1163
01:25:10,202 --> 01:25:11,536
Don't leave her.

1164
01:25:19,377 --> 01:25:20,295
They're saving her.

1165
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:22,088
No, Max, the Doctor
will make certain.

1166
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:23,799
You saw, or they told you?

1167
01:25:23,924 --> 01:25:25,133
The Doctor told me.

1168
01:25:25,217 --> 01:25:26,176
We did this.

1169
01:25:26,384 --> 01:25:27,427
Listen to me, listen.

1170
01:25:27,594 --> 01:25:30,722
What's going to happen to her will happen,
no matter what you do or see.

1171
01:25:30,847 --> 01:25:32,599
You're right, we did it.
We saved her.

1172
01:25:32,974 --> 01:25:36,770
The best thing you can do is to finish
the day quietly and wait for later.

1173
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:38,146
That's it.

1174
01:25:38,563 --> 01:25:39,898
That's it for you.

1175
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:41,691
The goddam end.

1176
01:25:42,734 --> 01:25:45,570
Hoffman, you have to get over to the
Third, tell them about Abramowics.

1177
01:25:45,862 --> 01:25:47,113
How am I to get through?

1178
01:25:47,322 --> 01:25:48,240
We'll load you up.

1179
01:25:48,365 --> 01:25:49,199
Here.

1180
01:25:50,242 --> 01:25:52,536
Exactly what happened.

1181
01:25:52,953 --> 01:25:53,787
I don't speak Yiddish.

1182
01:25:53,995 --> 01:25:55,789
Well, you can fucking convey
somebody getting shot.

1183
01:25:56,164 --> 01:25:59,292
And don't try to come back.
We're not waiting for you.

1184
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:01,503
- I talked to her.
- Yes?

1185
01:26:01,711 --> 01:26:03,171
I talked, she understood.

1186
01:26:03,463 --> 01:26:04,589
What are you saying?

1187
01:26:05,465 --> 01:26:07,884
- We were alone while...
- Did she talk?

1188
01:26:08,385 --> 01:26:09,427
I said I talked.

1189
01:26:09,678 --> 01:26:10,720
What did you say?

1190
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:12,973
- Everything.
- Everything?

1191
01:26:14,141 --> 01:26:16,935
You told her?

1192
01:26:17,269 --> 01:26:18,687
You would have, too.

1193
01:26:18,937 --> 01:26:20,063
What do you know
what I would do.

1194
01:26:20,272 --> 01:26:21,231
You would have.

1195
01:26:21,314 --> 01:26:22,566
What does that do for her?

1196
01:26:22,774 --> 01:26:23,608
Maybe it did something for me.

1197
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:26,111
Fuck what it did for you!

1198
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:27,654
What do you need?

1199
01:26:27,863 --> 01:26:29,030
She'll know who we were.

1200
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:30,782
And why does she need
to know that?

1201
01:26:31,449 --> 01:26:32,284
I don't know.

1202
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:34,035
That's right. You don't know.

1203
01:26:34,244 --> 01:26:35,078
Do you?

1204
01:26:35,287 --> 01:26:38,165
- Get going.
- Fuck off! I'm going.

1205
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:41,835
Do you?

1206
01:26:44,963 --> 01:26:46,131
Fire! There's fire!

1207
01:26:46,298 --> 01:26:47,716
He said between the shifts.

1208
01:26:56,892 --> 01:26:59,686
Cohen, Lowy, we won't have time
to organize the groups.

1209
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:03,982
Get the guns and down into the
corridors and barricade the doors.

1210
01:27:04,608 --> 01:27:05,525
Let's go!

1211
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:07,736
Let's go, let's go!

1212
01:27:23,668 --> 01:27:25,003
Go see what's happening.

1213
01:27:45,982 --> 01:27:47,442
Get the fuel drums.

1214
01:28:25,605 --> 01:28:27,274
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer?

1215
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:30,694
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer
or any SS men with a young girl.

1216
01:28:30,819 --> 01:28:31,444
No!

1217
01:28:31,653 --> 01:28:34,197
Please, have you seen
a young girl? She was alive.

1218
01:29:04,811 --> 01:29:06,354
We've only got two drums up there.

1219
01:29:06,897 --> 01:29:08,148
We're nearly out of explosives.

1220
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:09,941
They're only the machine guns.

1221
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:12,736
I don't need to know.
Go tell Schlermer.

1222
01:29:28,043 --> 01:29:30,128
We're dead up here.
Move down, move down!

1223
01:30:48,874 --> 01:30:51,168
Kaminski needs bodies
in the furnace room.

1224
01:30:51,376 --> 01:30:52,627
We're setting the explosives.

1225
01:30:52,711 --> 01:30:54,796
Have you seen Mussfeld
with a girl?

1226
01:30:55,046 --> 01:30:56,882
We need you in the furnace room.

1227
01:30:58,842 --> 01:30:59,885
Come on!

1228
01:31:00,635 --> 01:31:02,220
Get out! Get out!

1229
01:31:23,909 --> 01:31:25,785
Get out! Get out!

1230
01:31:28,705 --> 01:31:29,873
Get out!

1231
01:31:32,584 --> 01:31:34,544
Surrender if you want to live.

1232
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:37,339
It's over.
We're gonna blow the room!

1233
01:31:45,096 --> 01:31:46,640
Do it!

1234
01:32:35,438 --> 01:32:37,023
Why don't they kill us.

1235
01:32:38,984 --> 01:32:40,235
Did you ever see her?

1236
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:42,737
No. Did you?

1237
01:32:44,406 --> 01:32:45,782
Why am I asking?

1238
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:48,368
Why aren't they killing us?

1239
01:33:48,136 --> 01:33:50,722
The Russians will be here
before the year's out.

1240
01:33:52,057 --> 01:33:56,019
If it weren't that, we would
never have pulled this off.

1241
01:33:58,021 --> 01:33:59,147
You hid.

1242
01:34:02,692 --> 01:34:03,944
Will I be killed?

1243
01:34:05,278 --> 01:34:06,780
Do you want to be killed?

1244
01:34:09,282 --> 01:34:10,826
You would have fought.

1245
01:34:12,828 --> 01:34:14,079
Wouldn't you have?

1246
01:34:20,544 --> 01:34:22,295
I've spoken with Dr. Mengele...

1247
01:34:23,338 --> 01:34:27,008
...and assured him that you had
nothing to do with any of this.

1248
01:34:28,802 --> 01:34:30,971
That you knew and did nothing.

1249
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:36,935
You will continue
with your work.

1250
01:34:44,526 --> 01:34:45,777
That's right, Doctor.

1251
01:34:47,904 --> 01:34:50,365
We will both continue
with our work.

1252
01:34:51,616 --> 01:34:53,410
Because that's
what the living do.

1253
01:34:55,871 --> 01:34:57,956
We will have saved each other,
then.

1254
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:01,626
We needn't save anyone else.

1255
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:19,769
In Budapest, mostly.

1256
01:35:20,562 --> 01:35:21,980
My wife was from the city.

1257
01:35:23,315 --> 01:35:25,192
But we stayed north.

1258
01:35:26,735 --> 01:35:28,195
I still don't know why.

1259
01:35:28,695 --> 01:35:29,988
It's beautiful there.

1260
01:35:30,197 --> 01:35:31,156
Yes, it is.

1261
01:35:32,491 --> 01:35:34,868
But we were finally gonna move
near her family.

1262
01:35:35,827 --> 01:35:38,038
- Where did they live?
- Near the markets.

1263
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:41,374
We would be neighbours.

1264
01:35:49,591 --> 01:35:50,842
Will they kill her?

1265
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:53,553
They're gonna show her this
then let her live.

1266
01:35:54,596 --> 01:35:56,598
But why wouldn't
they have done it already.

1267
01:35:58,016 --> 01:35:59,601
You're asking for reasons.

1268
01:36:00,101 --> 01:36:01,353
I guess I was.

1269
01:36:15,534 --> 01:36:17,035
We did something.

1270
01:36:19,538 --> 01:36:20,330
Yes.

1271
01:36:21,373 --> 01:36:22,541
We did.

1272
01:36:26,086 --> 01:36:26,920
Yes. Bye.

1273
01:36:32,634 --> 01:36:33,677
Neighbours.

1274
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:27,749
After there vo It,
half the ovens remain...

1275
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:31,211
...and we are carried
to them together.

1276
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:39,261
I catch fire quickly.

1277
01:38:45,058 --> 01:38:49,479
The first part of me rises
in dense smoke...

1278
01:38:50,522 --> 01:38:53,650
...that mingles
with the smoke of others.

1279
01:38:57,445 --> 01:38:59,447
Then, there are the bones...

1280
01:39:00,282 --> 01:39:02,367
which settle in ash.

1281
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:07,581
And these are swept up
to be carried to the river.

1282
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,251
And last...

1283
01:39:13,336 --> 01:39:17,090
...bits of our dust
simply float there...

1284
01:39:17,507 --> 01:39:21,470
...in air, around the working
of the new group.

1285
01:39:23,555 --> 01:39:26,475
These bits of dust are grey.

1286
01:39:27,726 --> 01:39:31,271
We settle on their shoes
and on their faces...

1287
01:39:32,105 --> 01:39:33,982
...and in their lungs.

1288
01:39:35,442 --> 01:39:38,028
And they become so used to us...

1289
01:39:38,778 --> 01:39:44,534
...that's on they don't cough
and they don't brush us away.

1290
01:39:46,703 --> 01:39:49,831
At this point, they're just moving...

1291
01:39:50,415 --> 01:39:52,751
...breathing and moving.

1292
01:39:53,543 --> 01:39:57,005
Like any one else, still alive
in that place.

1293
01:39:57,214 --> 01:40:03,470
And this is how
the work...

1294
01:40:06,014 --> 01:40:07,557
...continues.

1295
01:40:08,305 --> 01:41:08,530

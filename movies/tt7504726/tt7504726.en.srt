Not much luck up there

Seems more folks coming back

206

pockets empty
than full of gold.

207

Two. We needed two.

You got time for one

You're late.

612

It's just that
it's my son's birthday.

And I need to send
this remembrance to my wife.

You should have come
when we were taking.

Oh.

You are lucky.

Perrault! One for you.
Looks official.

What's the news

Good work.

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay.

643
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,916
You did nothing wrong.

644

Okay?

I'm sorry, Buck.

647
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,064
They don't need me
and my sled anymore.

648
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:43,600
By summer,
the telegraph will reach here.

A new way
to send the mail.

It's your team now.

00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:51,126
Are they broken?

675
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:53,562
HAL: No. They're just lazy.

676
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:54,697
Buck?

677
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:56,166
HAL: Mush!

678
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,634
Charles,
persuade the beast.

679
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:01,071
MERCEDES: Not the club.

680
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:03,673
Charles!

681
00:47:03,675 --> 00:47:05,040
Put that down or I'll...

682
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,943
I won't go a step!

683
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:08,645
- Charles!
- (Buck whimpers)

684
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:14,985
Remember me? (chuckles)

685
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,057
Yeah, I know.

686
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,462
Your runners are frozen.

687
00:47:27,464 --> 00:47:29,264
You'll help your dogs
a mighty lot

688
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,968
if you take the gee pole
and break 'em out.

689
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,570
HAL: Gee pole?

690
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:39,009
MERCEDES: What is he doing?

691
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:44,379
- Sir! Watch the Victrola.
- (Mercedes gasps)

692
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,114
(crowd laughs)

693
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:48,718
Where are you
headed, mister?

694
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,452
It's none of your concern.

695
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:53,088
You didn't buy that map
in Skagway, did you?

696
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,058
- No.
- That old fairy tale.

697
00:47:55,592 --> 00:47:56,993
Lost cabin.

698
00:47:56,995 --> 00:47:58,393
- (sled rattles)
- (Mercedes gasps)

699
00:47:58,395 --> 00:48:00,128
River of gold?

700
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,030
You're setting off
too far into the spring.

701
00:48:02,032 --> 00:48:03,598
Half that trail
is on the river.

702
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,801
Well, that leaves
half the trail fit for travel.

703
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:08,004
Oh, it means the ice
is gonna break up

704
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:10,639
with your companions
and the dogs on it.

705
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,975
Why don't you lay over
till the spring thaw?

706
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:14,242
Save your dogs

707
00:48:14,244 --> 00:48:15,711
and your companions
the suffering.

708
00:48:15,713 --> 00:48:17,713
And let some old prospector
beat us to the gold?

709
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,080
I'm not a prospector.

710
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:20,382
No, thank you.

711
00:48:20,384 --> 00:48:22,652
I paid a fortune
for this team.

712
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:24,252
They'll pull my sled.

713
00:48:24,254 --> 00:48:27,558
They're good dogs, sir.
They'll pull your sled.

714
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:31,128
They'll pull your sled
till they die.

715
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:36,032
(slams on sled)

716
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,234
Thank you.

717
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:40,070
Let's go.

718
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:46,374
CHARLES: (taps on sled)
All right, let's go.

719
00:48:46,376 --> 00:48:47,679
And...

720
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:49,177
Mush!

721
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,682
(dogs barking)

722
00:48:55,653 --> 00:48:57,354
(crowd muttering)

723
00:49:07,164 --> 00:49:09,031
CHARLES: You lazy mutts!

724
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:11,199
MERCEDES: I'm not so sure
about those dogs.

725
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,969
Maybe you should've bought
a different team.

726
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:14,269
CHARLES: Maybe
we should feed them.

727
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:16,571
We should've stayed
on the trail.

728
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:17,641
Mush!

729
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:19,409
(grunting)

730
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:21,777
(all gasping)

731
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:22,678
MERCEDES: Make it stop!

732
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,115
- (Hal grunting)
- (Mercedes screaming)

733
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:28,718
(groans)

734
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,121
(Hal yelling frustratedly)

735
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:33,723
(panting)

736
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:36,393
CHARLES: Maybe they need
a little encouragement.

737
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:39,527
(whip striking)

738
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:41,331
- (dogs whimpering)
- HAL: Mush!

739
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:44,265
- (whip striking)
- Mush!

740
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,002
MALE NARRATOR:
<i>For the first time,</i>

741

<i>Buck knew
more than his masters.</i>

(barks)

743
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:51,174
- HAL: Mush!
- (whip cracks)

744
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:54,043
MALE NARRATOR: <i>But the whip</i>

745
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:56,313
<i>offered him no choice.</i>

746
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:03,286

(dogs whimpering)

751
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:40,221
HAL: Well, now,

752
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:41,893
we're going across.

753
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,993
Move!

754
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:45,493
(Hal grunting)

755
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:47,163
- (Buck whining)
- (both barking)

756
00:50:47,165 --> 00:50:50,298
I say you go.

757
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,736
Hal, he can't.

758
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:53,537
Move.

759
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,171

Don't you dare.

762
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:00,945
- Hey!
- (Mercedes gasps)

763
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:02,780
(dog barks)

764
00:51:04,214 --> 00:51:07,083
That river ice is gonna
break up any minute!

765
00:51:07,085 --> 00:51:08,416
You fool!

766
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:10,653
That dog is trying
to help you keep your life!

767
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:11,889
MERCEDES: Hal!

768

(Mercedes gasps)

769
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:16,458
Why are you so keen
to stop us?

770
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,863
You know where
the gold is, don't you?

771
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:24,299
(gunshot)

772
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:27,604
You keep your filthy hands
off of my dogs.

773
00:51:27,939 --> 00:51:29,270
Hal.

774

(dogs barking)

776
00:51:34,411 --> 00:51:35,978
Hal, he said
we shouldn't cross.

777
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,848
CHARLES: Hal, are you sure?
Maybe we just leave the dogs?

778
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,883
HAL: I know
what I'm doing.

779

(Dub whimpers)

784
00:52:01,304 --> 00:52:03,205
Don't do this.

785
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,407
Not to them.

786
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:14,652

(snoring)

789
00:53:08,505 --> 00:53:10,875
What am I gonna
do with you?

They're not here.

794
00:54:15,273 --> 00:54:17,440
They're gone.

795
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:23,513
You've been sleeping
for two days

796
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:25,548
in my bed.

797
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:38,129
I'll be back.

798

(blows)

800
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:51,608
Stay. Go.

801
00:54:55,313 --> 00:54:57,081
Do what you want.

802
00:55:02,186 --> 00:55:03,654

- (music playing)
- (laughter and chatter)

805
00:55:25,943 --> 00:55:27,244
Whiskey.

808
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:56,007
I want the bottle.

They're all gone!

812
00:56:05,615 --> 00:56:07,051
My dogs ran off.

813
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:09,752
My fortune lost.

814
00:56:09,754 --> 00:56:11,889
You called it a fairy tale.

815
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:13,822
(grunts)

816
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:16,158
You didn't want me
finding the gold.

817
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,625

Easy, Buck, easy.

820
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:31,273
Buck.

821
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:33,242
- Easy.
- HAL: Well, you all saw.

822
00:56:33,244 --> 00:56:35,177
This man and I
had business

823
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:36,879
and the dog went
for my throat.

824
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:38,149
- Probably rabid.
- (growls, barks)

825
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:40,883
(crowd gasps)

826
00:56:40,885 --> 00:56:42,550
You leave
that dog alone!

827
00:56:42,552 --> 00:56:44,119
- Buck, settle!
- (barking)

828
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:46,355
You see?

829
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:48,257
I say it gets put down
here and now.

830
00:56:48,259 --> 00:56:50,392
- MAN: No. Come on, mister.
- You don't touch him!

831
00:56:50,394 --> 00:56:52,730
MAN 2: No one puts
any creature down.

832
00:56:54,564 --> 00:56:56,631
Until we hear
all the facts.

833
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:58,067
The man sucker punched me.

834
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,967
(people exclaiming)

835
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:00,938

836
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:03,074
Buck, easy.

837
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,211
What might you have
on that belt, friend?

838
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:12,283
(growls)

839

00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,159
MAN 3: No guns
on the premises!

842
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,227
(grunts)

843
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:26,897
(indistinct chatter)

844
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:35,172
You okay,
John Thornton?

845
00:57:36,173 --> 00:57:37,675
Yeah.

846
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:40,077
I'm fine.

847
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,658
(sniffing)

848
00:57:58,662 --> 00:57:59,864
JOHN: What?

849
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,067
What are you
looking at, huh?

850
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:19,649
You got something to say?

851
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:21,752
(sets glass down)

852
00:58:26,957 --> 00:58:28,025
(grumbling)

853
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:32,329
Buck!

854
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:36,365
That's not very nice.

855
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:37,701
What did you do that for?

856
00:58:38,068 --> 00:58:39,601
Hey, Buck!

857
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:40,971
Buck, what...?

858
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:42,738
Buck?

859
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,275
Bring that back.

860
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:49,313
Now what are you
gonna do, huh?

861
00:58:58,556 --> 00:59:00,657
Buck? What are you doing?

862
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:02,257
Bring that back.

863
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:04,092
Buck, don't do this.

864
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:05,396
That's mine.

865
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,696
I need that.

866
00:59:07,698 --> 00:59:09,364
Don't do this to me.

867
00:59:09,366 --> 00:59:11,133
What'd you do?
Where is it?

868
00:59:11,135 --> 00:59:13,235
Just, would you...

869
00:59:13,237 --> 00:59:15,237
(grunting) Get off.

870
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:16,840
Get off.

871
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:20,244
Buck.

872
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,088
Darn, you're big.

873
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,260
(sighs)

874
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,966
This was his birthday.

875
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:52,743
My son.

876
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:59,850
After he died,
his mom and I...

877
01:00:01,552 --> 01:00:04,019
...we just grew apart.

878
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,790
She didn't wanna
be around me...

879
01:00:08,693 --> 01:00:11,428
I didn't wanna
be around anybody.

880
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,869
So, I came up here.

881
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:25,574
Then I met you.

882
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:27,011
(owl hooting)

883
01:00:35,386 --> 01:00:36,653
Hell.

884
01:00:36,655 --> 01:00:38,522
- It's around here somewhere.
- (object thuds)

885
01:00:40,624 --> 01:00:42,493
Good, you're awake.

886
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:45,095
- I put it...
- (yawning)

887
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:48,198
Here it is.

888
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,268
Something I want
to show ya.

889
01:00:53,837 --> 01:00:55,039
Come here.

890
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:58,206
This is a map
of the Yukon.

891
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:03,514
My son was always reading
adventure stories,

892
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,481
and he was crazy
about the news

893
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:07,816
coming out of the Yukon.

894
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:09,484
It wasn't the gold.
He didn't care about that.

895
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:10,952
It was the mountains.

896
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:12,888
He spent all day
looking at maps

897
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,423
and at pictures
of the mountains.

898
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:17,859
Dreaming about
what was on the other side.

899
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:19,997
Places no one had been.

900
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:22,566
Wild places.

901
01:01:24,535 --> 01:01:26,669
"Let's go," I said.

902
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:28,603
He said, "Yeah, Pop."

903
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:30,072
We'd start there,

904
01:01:30,074 --> 01:01:33,275
but then
he grabbed a pencil

905
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:36,912
and he drew a line
off the map

906
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:39,782
and he said,
"But let's go there.

907
01:01:39,784 --> 01:01:43,020
"Off the map.
Where no one's been."

908
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:48,890
It's... It's a trip
he would've loved.

909
01:01:48,892 --> 01:01:50,894
A real adventure.

910
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:57,201
We could go.

911
01:01:59,536 --> 01:02:00,904
You and me.

912
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:04,641
See what's out there.

913
01:02:05,576 --> 01:02:07,042
What do you think?

914
01:02:07,044 --> 01:02:10,514
It's a canoe, Buck.
We're gonna ride in it.

915
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:12,916
(exclaiming)

916
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:19,521
Settle. Sit. Sit.
Sit, Buck.

917
01:02:19,523 --> 01:02:21,992
(chuckles)
Good. Good boy.

918
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:49,119
Ha. What are you doing?

919
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:52,022
Begging?

920
01:02:57,762 --> 01:02:59,396
You're not my pet.

921
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:04,034
(thunder rumbling)

922
01:03:10,107 --> 01:03:11,606
Are you comin'?

923
01:03:11,608 --> 01:03:12,809
(Buck whimpers)

924
01:03:12,811 --> 01:03:14,445
Get in here.

925
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:18,315
(birds squawking)

926
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:23,620
(barking)

927
01:03:27,191 --> 01:03:28,525
JOHN: <i>♪ Row your boat ♪</i>

928
01:03:29,293 --> 01:03:32,461
<i>♪ Gently down the stream ♪</i>

929
01:03:32,463 --> 01:03:34,897
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily ♪</i>

930
01:03:34,899 --> 01:03:36,031
<i>♪ Life is but a dream ♪</i>

931
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:39,436
Come on, Buck.
Give us a song.

932
01:03:40,304 --> 01:03:41,538
(baying)

933
01:03:42,005 --> 01:03:43,605
Maybe not.

934
01:03:43,607 --> 01:03:45,609
(playing harmonica)

935
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:49,313
(plays random note)

936
01:03:53,651 --> 01:03:55,285
(resumes playing)

937
01:03:57,488 --> 01:03:58,690
(moose grunting)

938
01:04:03,994 --> 01:04:05,462
(water rumbling)

939
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,603
(screaming)

940
01:04:14,605 --> 01:04:16,071
(Buck grunts)

941
01:04:16,073 --> 01:04:17,606
JOHN: Whoa!

942
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,176
(Buck barking)

943
01:04:25,783 --> 01:04:27,850
Whoa! (grunts)

944
01:04:27,852 --> 01:04:29,219
(barking)

945
01:04:31,088 --> 01:04:33,388
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
(panting)

946
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,525
(barking)

947
01:04:41,064 --> 01:04:42,399
(John screams)

948
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,742
Oh, you like that, huh?

949
01:05:03,688 --> 01:05:05,690
I guess
we walk from here.

950
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:09,827
(bird screeching)

951
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:20,604
(breathing heavily)

952
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,809
(objects clattering)

953
01:06:00,044 --> 01:06:02,579
JOHN: Your ancestors
used to roam here.

954
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:04,514
And mine.

955
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,382
Back when we were wild.

956
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:09,486
(bird squawking in distance)

957
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:17,662
We come and go,
don't we?

958
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,866
This is always here.

959
01:06:33,543 --> 01:06:34,777
(barking)

960
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:35,878
What?

961
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,947
I don't know. Which way?
You tell me.

962
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:39,851
Go on. You lead.

963
01:06:42,185 --> 01:06:44,621
- (barking)
- (John chuckling)

964
01:06:47,892 --> 01:06:49,661
(sniffing)

965
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:53,530
- (Buck barking)
- Buck?

966
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,668
(Buck barks)

967
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:10,380
Ah. Look what you found.

968
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:13,483
(Buck barking)

969
01:07:14,217 --> 01:07:15,419
(John chuckles)

970
01:07:19,556 --> 01:07:20,792
(door bangs)

971
01:07:24,162 --> 01:07:25,529
Boy...

972
01:07:28,265 --> 01:07:30,966
- Look at this, Buck.
- (barks)

973
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:33,971
I don't think
we're off all maps.

974
01:07:36,606 --> 01:07:37,942
(barking)

975
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:45,917
A prospector, I guess.

976
01:07:46,684 --> 01:07:47,919
Trash.

977
01:07:48,452 --> 01:07:50,786
- Trash.
- (grunting)

978
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:52,222
Trash.

979
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:55,993
(John exclaims)

980
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,834
Treasure.

981
01:08:04,902 --> 01:08:06,236
(Buck grunts)

982
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:14,409
This is mine. All right?

983
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:16,013
Just leave it alone.
It's mine.

984
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:18,415
(grumbles)

985
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:22,586
(John grunting)

986
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:27,290
(barking)

987
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:36,533
(crickets chirping)

988
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:40,738
Good day.

989
01:08:45,777 --> 01:08:47,812
(howling in distance)

990
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:02,693
It's your ancestors.

991
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:06,030
Wolves.

992
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:09,499
(wolves continue howling)

993
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,943
(water splashing)

994
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:23,781
(barks)

995
01:09:24,215 --> 01:09:25,750
(panting)

996
01:09:27,018 --> 01:09:28,083
(chuckling)

997
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,419
(barks)

998
01:09:58,883 --> 01:10:00,483
(panting)

999
01:10:07,658 --> 01:10:10,460
(chuckles)
That's good, Buck,

1000
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:13,630
but more like this, huh?

1001
01:10:22,006 --> 01:10:23,975
Damn fairy tale's true.

1002
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:33,885
That's more like it, Buck.

1003
01:10:35,286 --> 01:10:36,854
Attaboy!

1004
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:39,891
(chuckling)

1005
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:46,429
(sniffing)

1006
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:51,501
What?
What you looking at?

1007
01:10:56,374 --> 01:10:57,742
Go take a look.

1008
01:10:58,976 --> 01:11:00,044
Go on.

1009
01:11:00,543 --> 01:11:01,946
Go on. (chuckles)

1010
01:11:03,714 --> 01:11:06,583
Just be back before dark!

1011
01:11:22,867 --> 01:11:23,935

That's beautiful, Buck.

1044
01:15:47,164 --> 01:15:48,732
Beautiful.

1045
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,569
<i>He's still the same dog
with me,</i>

1046

Not this time.

1057
01:17:43,213 --> 01:17:44,982
Long after dark.

1058
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:51,055
You've been staying out
later and later every day.

1059
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:56,091
Yeah, I know,
there's a lot to explore

1060
01:17:56,093 --> 01:17:58,562
but world's
a dangerous place.

1061
01:17:59,496 --> 01:18:01,432
You never know
what's coming.

1062
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:06,303
(sighs) You never know.

1063
01:18:11,842 --> 01:18:15,946

Hell.

1067
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:31,628
Okay, Buck.

1068
01:18:34,998 --> 01:18:36,367

(Buck grunts)

1071
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:51,382
It's been
a beautiful summer.

1072
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:00,457
You know what, Buck?

1073
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:03,560
I've been thinking.

1074
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:07,830
I might buy myself
a railroad.

1075
01:19:07,832 --> 01:19:08,997
Is that my hat?

1076
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:10,632
That's my hat.
Come on.

1077
01:19:10,634 --> 01:19:12,033
(chuckling)
Give me my hat.

1078
01:19:12,035 --> 01:19:13,803
Give me my hat.

1079
01:19:13,805 --> 01:19:16,273
(playfully) Give me my hat.
Give me my hat.

1080
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:18,442
Buck!

1081
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,878
Buck!

1082
01:19:20,177 --> 01:19:21,109
Come on.

1083
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:23,547
(chuckling)
There you go.

1084
01:19:28,452 --> 01:19:29,486
Ooh.

1085
01:19:30,954 --> 01:19:32,523
Timber wolf.

1086
01:19:33,691 --> 01:19:35,259
Beautiful.

1087
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:38,696
This is their domain.

1088
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:41,298
They own these hills.

1089
01:19:48,673 --> 01:19:49,674
You wanna go?

1090
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:51,808
Go.

1091
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,177
Just...

1092
01:19:55,446 --> 01:19:57,147
...be careful.

1093
01:20:30,047 --> 01:20:31,615
(distant barking)

1094
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,168
<i>He had been
both spoiled</i>

1095
01:20:52,236 --> 01:20:54,202
<i>and he'd suffered</i>

1096
01:20:54,204 --> 01:20:56,206
<i>at the hand of man.</i>

1097
01:20:57,876 --> 01:21:00,377
<i>Now, Buck found himself</i>

1098
01:21:01,478 --> 01:21:03,547
<i>with his own kind.</i>

1099
01:21:04,983 --> 01:21:09,086
<i>How far he has traveled
to find his home.</i>

1100
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:15,192
<i>How far I have traveled
from mine.</i>

(John chuckling)

1102
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:36,113
Here, look, Buck.

1103
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,682
Groceries.

1104
01:21:39,651 --> 01:21:41,184
For life.

1105
01:21:42,085 --> 01:21:44,354
No man needs
more than that.

1106
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,493
It's time for me
to go, Buck.

1107
01:21:50,728 --> 01:21:52,195
Go home.

1108
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:55,096
Whatever's left of it.

1109
01:21:55,098 --> 01:21:56,366
Pick up the pieces,

1110
01:21:58,068 --> 01:21:59,369
or at least try.

No.

1114
01:22:08,545 --> 01:22:11,281
I'm not asking you
to come with me, Buck.

1115
01:22:15,019 --> 01:22:17,354
You got something here.

1116
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:20,290
Something important.

1117
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:23,427
Hang onto it.

1118
01:22:26,998 --> 01:22:28,666
I'm leaving
in the morning.

1119
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,803
Come say bye.

1120
01:22:38,241 --> 01:22:40,678
You're a good dog, Buck.

1121
01:22:52,056 --> 01:22:54,524
You're a good dog.

You came
all the way out here.

1133
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:57,579
You knew something,
didn't you?

1134
01:24:57,581 --> 01:24:58,446
Easy.

1135
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:00,450
You wanted it
all for yourself.

1136

Where is it?

1137

Where's the gold?

1138

It's everywhere.

1139

Take it.

1140

Take it all.

1141
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,877
It won't change anything.

1142
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:29,412
It won't
bring back the dead.

- Good.

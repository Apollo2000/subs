2
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,099
My first
visual memories are of this

3
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:39,609
framed poster above my crib.

4
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,379
I would stare at it every
night before I went to bed.

5
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,359
My father was an underground
comic distributor.

6
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,329
He's always been this sort of
Zelig of the counterculture

7
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,289
as I like to call him.

8
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,599
Having painted in
Warhol's studio,

9
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,699
being roomies with Lou
Reed, he knew R. Crumb

10
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,099
and all these great
artists of his generation.

11
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:15,209
I mean, I was brought up on all
kinds of wacky visuals as a kid.

12
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:21,579
So I would stare at this
painting over and over:

13
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:26,049
The Garden of Earthly Delights
by Hieronymus Bosch.

14
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:33,059
It was painted around 1500.

15
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,629
And if you look at these
panels long enough,

16
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,599
they start to tell a story.

17
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,539
In the first panel you have Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

18
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,109
Birds flying off
into the distance,

19
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:51,979
elephants and giraffe and a
lot of religious iconography.

20
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,449
The second panel is where
it starts to become

21
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,249
more interesting.

22
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,389
The deadly sins start to infuse
their way into the painting.

23
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:04,189
There's overpopulation,
there's debauchery and excess.

24
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:11,299
And the last panel, which
is the most nightmarish one,

25
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:17,539
especially from a young child's
perspective, is this twisted,

26
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,239
decayed, burnt landscape.

27
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,509
A paradise that has been
degraded and destroyed.

28
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,689
Man may be
unwittingly changing the world's

29
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,289
climate through the waste
products of its civilization...

30
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,959
The burning of coal, oil and
wood is releasing carbon dioxide

31
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,059
into the atmosphere.

32
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,429
The greenhouse effect has been
detected and it is changing

33
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:49,239
our climate now.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,739
Guess where the
temperature goes?

35
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,409
It goes up.

36
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,479
Climate change is
already in our backyards.

37
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,479
It's official. 2012 was the
hottest year in the...

38
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,365
warmest year around the globe

39
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,579
warmest year on record.

40
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:07,689
It is these activities
that drove mankind

41
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,219
out of the Garden of Eden.

42
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,469
- Hi, how are you?
- Ah, Mr. DiCaprio.

43
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,499
Pleasure, pleasure.

44
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,299
Great to, great
pleasure to see you.

45
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,209
Here.

46
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,009
We can move this.

47
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,979
This can be adjusted.

48
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,055
Oh wow, this
is for height control.

49
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,439
Yeah.

50
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,155
- Like this, like this.
- For shorter leaders

51
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,479
and taller leaders.

52
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,519
What specific message do you
think is the most important?

53
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,119
Climate change is
coming much, much faster.

54
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,959
We have seen such, uh,
extraordinary extreme weather

55
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,659
patterns.

56
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,299
If you consider this
vastness of this universe,

57
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,969
this Planet Earth is
just a small boat.

58
00:03:55,999 --> 00:04:00,469
If this boat is sinking, then
I think we will have to all

59
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,079
sink together.

60
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,479
I know that he has been a
very committed and effective

61
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,419
environmentalist and that is
why I really count on your

62
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,549
leadership and vision.

63
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,989
Please welcome
newly appointed United Nations

64
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,229
Messenger of Peace,
Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio.

65
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,399
Thank you
Mr. Secretary General,

66
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,709
Your Excellencies...

67
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,139
I feel incredibly honored
that they chose me to be

68
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:37,139
the United Nations Messenger
of Peace on climate change.

69
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:40,409
I stand before
you, not as an expert,

70
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,619
I want to do everything I can
to learn more about this issue.

71
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,619
See for myself exactly what's
going on and what can be done.

72
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,259
But it all kinda seems
beyond our control.

73
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:56,429
As an actor,
I pretend for a living.

74
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,529
I play fictitious characters
often solving fictitious

75
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,269
problems.

76
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,139
I believe that mankind has
looked at climate change

77
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:05,669
in that same way.

78
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,169
We keep getting inundated with
catastrophic news about the

79
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,609
environment every single day,
and the problem seems to be

80
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:15,919
getting worse and
worse and worse.

81
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,689
Try to have a conversation with
anyone about climate change,

82
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,289
people just tune out.

83
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,929
If the U.N. really knew
how I feel,

84
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,569
how pessimistic I am about our
future, I mean, to be honest,

85
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,139
they may have picked
the wrong guy.

86
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,885
Hundreds of
thousands took to the streets

87
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:45,049
of New York today demonstrating
for action on climate change.

88
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,579
Secretary General,
Ban Ki-Moon called Leo

89
00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:50,319
a credible voice in the
environmental movement,

90
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,089
which is like calling Jeffrey
Dahmer a credible voice

91
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,649
for stew.

92
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,089
Leonardo DiCaprio
has just naively bought into

93
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,389
the entire global warming hoax.

94
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:02,429
Who better to
educate world leaders on made up

95
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,029
climate change in a crisis that
doesn't exist than an actor

96
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,669
from Hollywood with zero years
of scientific training?

97
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,279
Hi, how are you?

98
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,509
I'm very good.

99
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,919
How are you doing,
it's a pleasure.

100
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,949
You too.

101
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,159
Hey!

102
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,689
Nice to see you, buddy.

103
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,029
Good to see you.

104
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,199
So I just started this new film,
it's set in the Western Frontier

105
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,499
of the United States
in the early 1800s.

106
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,409
It's basically the dawn of
the Industrial Revolution.

107
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,939
It has a lot to do with men who
are pillaging the natural world,

108
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:51,709
wiping species out, and
basically destroying cultures

109
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,049
in the process.

110
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,519
Those are like buffalo skulls.

111
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,949
Alejandro!

112
00:06:56,989 --> 00:07:00,149
Crazy, are these fur-trappers?

113
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,535
Are these people
selling the skulls?

114
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,119
No, these are people
selling the skulls, yeah.

115
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,959
What the is this?

116
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,189
Isn't that embarrassing?

117
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:08,899
Man, that's crazy.

118
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,445
And the fact that
they never even reflected on it,

119
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:13,269
that there's an ending to these
animals, and we cannot just,

120
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,529
it's insane.

121
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,145
If you can put that
in the movie that would be

122
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,339
unbelievable.

123
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:19,415
How about this, I dare you!

124
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,039
Ah, okay.

125
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,279
get to the boat. Come on son.

126
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,449
I didn't grow up
around nature at all,

127
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:36,059
I grew up near
downtown Los Angeles.

128
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:41,159
And my escape every weekend was
the Natural History Museum.

129
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,059
And from a very young age, I
became fascinated with species

130
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,599
that had become extinct.

131
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,199
All these different animals,

132
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,539
from the dodo to the
passenger pigeon,

133
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,169
which was the most
plentiful bird on earth,

134
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,609
to the Tasmanian tiger, also
known as the thilacene

135
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,109
to the great auk, the
quagga, the moa.

136
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,119
I remember the
anger that I felt,

137
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,419
reading all these stories about
how explorers and settlers

138
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:14,329
would just wipe out an entire
species, and in the process,

139
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,959
decimate the ecosystem forever.

140
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,009
The difference now is we're
knowingly doing this;

141
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:35,979
it's just on a
much larger scale.

142
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,629
If we're gonna fight
climate change effectively,

143
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,629
we have to start by
acknowledging that

144
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,099
most of our economy is
based on fossil fuels.

145
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:56,969
Fossil fuels are coal,
oil, and natural gas.

146
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,169
Oil powers most of the
transportation sector,

147
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,549
coal and natural gas power
most of the electricity.

148
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,149
Now, in the first couple decades
of the twenty-first century,

149
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:15,659
in order to sustain our
dependence on fossil fuels,

150
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:19,659
we're going to very risky,
very extreme new sources.

151
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,469
You see this in things like
mountain top removal for coal,

152
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:31,039
fracking for natural gas,

153
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,209
offshore drilling for oil,

154
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,919
and the tar sands, which is
the most devastating form

155
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,989
of producing fossil fuels.

156
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,159
They take away massive forests,
the water in the streams

157
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,429
and rivers is poisoned.

158
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,559
It has severe impacts on the
wildlife, on native communities,

159
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:03,269
and it requires a huge amount of
energy simply to get it to

160
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:04,309
our fuel tanks.

161
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,539
There is no such thing
as clean fossil fuel.

162
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,179
Headsets are
hung up at the back,

163
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,449
but the volume control's right
above the microphone so...

164
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:54,479
The truth is, the more
I've learned about this issue

165
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,249
and everything that
contributes to the problem,

166
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,689
the more I realize
how much I don't know.

167
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,519
How much I don't know
about this issue.

168
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:09,129
The first time I ever heard
the term global warming,

169
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,959
which was what it
was called back then,

170
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,069
I was in my early twenties.

171
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,669
I had the opportunity to sit
down one on one with then

172
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,309
Vice President, Al Gore
in the White House.

173
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,409
And he drew a picture of
our planet on a chalkboard,

174
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,979
and then he drew the atmosphere
around it, and he said,

175
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,549
this is the most important
issue of our time.

176
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,619
I had absolutely no idea
what he was talking about.

177
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,059
He said all our modes of
transportation, boats, trains,

178
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,589
planes, cars, the way
we produce our food,

179
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,359
the way we build our cities,
almost everything we do releases

180
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,569
carbon dioxide, CO2, and that
leads to climate change.

181
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,539
The polar ice caps will melt,
the seas will start to rise,

182
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,479
there will be more dangerous
weather patterns, floods,

183
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,439
droughts, wildfires.

184
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,349
It sounded like some nightmarish
science fiction film.

185
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,679
Except everything
he said is real

186
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,389
and it's happening right now.

187
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,259
Wow.

188
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,129
Wow.

189
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,199
Beautiful.

190
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,009
I just want to know
how far we've gone,

191
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,679
how much damage we've done, and
if there's anything we can do

192
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,739
to stop it.

193
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,119
You all set, mate?!

194
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:44,059
So it's the 4th of July,

195
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,289
and we're here in the
middle of the Arctic.

196
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,059
Right now we are
standing on the ocean,

197
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,399
we are basically
walking on water.

198
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:54,069
This is the northern
tip of Baffin Island,

199
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,239
one of the hundreds of islands
in the High Canadian Arctic.

200
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,039
We are way above
the Arctic Circle,

201
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:02,009
and if you put your
hand in the water,

202
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,609
you would not be able to stand
it for more than 5 minutes,

203
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,919
except you who are a badass.

204
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,095
You hunt and fish here, right?

205
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,889
Yeah.

206
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,635
What do you, what do
you fish and what do you hunt?

207
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:19,289
In my territory I
hunt fish, seal, narwhal,

208
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:20,859
and polar bear.

209
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,029
- Is this polar bear?
- Yup.

210
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,129
Oh, well there you go!

211
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,669
And the ice here, since you've
been around has it been

212
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,629
decreasing?

213
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,869
We used to have
a solid ice, blue.

214
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:33,909
Not light blue like this, blue.

215
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,679
Hard, ice.

216
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:43,379
Now we usually have a, kind
of ice cream type of ice.

217
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,849
It's ice but it's,
when it starts to melt,

218
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,749
it melts pretty fast.

219
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,989
Much faster than before.

220
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,799
2040, you will be able
to sail over the North Pole.

221
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,859
There's going to be no sea
ice left in the Arctic Ocean

222
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,669
in the summer.

223
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,039
We are burning so many fossil
fuels that the ice is melting.

224
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,079
The Arctic is like
the air conditioning for

225
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,179
the Northern Hemisphere.

226
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,279
If it goes away, that's
going to change currents,

227
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,849
that's going to change
weather patterns,

228
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,659
that's going to make floods and
droughts more catastrophic.

229
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,329
It's the most dramatic
transformation of a large

230
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,859
environment ever.

231
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,799
Look at this.

232
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,169
They're right here!

233
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,269
There are about 10,000
to 12,000 narwhals

234
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,609
in this region.

235
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,179
The numbers are stable here,
in other regions are declining.

236
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,319
Wow.

237
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,249
That's awesome.

238
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,789
Yeah, they are
waiting for the ice to open up,

239
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,819
to swim in, so they
can catch the flounder.

240
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:02,899
I can't believe what
they sound like, it's amazing.

241
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,929
They're like purring.

242
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,929
You know, I don't
want to be in a planet

243
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,299
without these animals.

244
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,109
He's the
chairman of Earth Day 2000,

245
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,609
Leonardo DiCaprio.

246
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,819
When I was 25 years old,

247
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,919
I remember being asked to
participate in this huge event

248
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,719
in Washington for Earth Day.

249
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,689
Temperatures are rising,
coral reefs are dying,

250
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:35,129
and not since a meteor hit the
earth 65 million years ago,

251
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,799
have so many species of plant
and animals become extinct

252
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,069
in such a short time.

253
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,929
I even got a chance to
interview the President

254
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,599
of the United States.

255
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,099
Why do you think this issue
is so constantly overlooked?

256
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,709
I think it's
because it takes a long time

257
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:50,209
for the climate to change in
a way that people feel it,

258
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:54,609
and because, uh, it seems
sort of abstract now.

259
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:56,979
At the time, it was
this huge push to get the word

260
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,679
out on global warming.

261
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,865
Now a couple degrees' difference
in today's temperatures

262
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,289
may not seem like an emergency.

263
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:07,759
Back then everyone was focused
on small, individual actions.

264
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,859
We all have to, you know, bring
environmentalism to the American

265
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,259
consciousness.

266
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,669
And it boiled down to simple
solutions like changing

267
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,599
your light bulb.

268
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,769
It seemed like a positive
thing at the time, you know.

269
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,379
Changing your lightbulb.

270
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,879
But it's pretty clear that we're
way beyond that point now;

271
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,349
things have taken a
massive turn for the worst.

272
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,959
We keep finding things that
aren't in the climate models

273
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,919
that are used to
project the future.

274
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:42,859
So that, that tells me that the
projections for the future are,

275
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:45,659
are really conservative.

276
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,069
If climate stays at this
temperature that it's been

277
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,769
in the last decade, Greenland
is, is going away.

278
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,609
Don't walk into the crevasse.

279
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:58,779
Oh my God!

280
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:01,679
Don't get too close to the edge.

281
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,819
Look at how violent that is.

282
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,889
These rapids are going
so incredibly fast.

283
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,119
This meltwater is
making its way to the sea.

284
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,189
If that's not balanced by
snowfall then the ice sheet gets

285
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:14,229
smaller and sea level rises.

286
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,329
This is actually our
proper climate station.

287
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:23,899
This is a climate station?

288
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:27,339
I was imagining a massive igloo
with all kinds of scientists

289
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:28,939
doing experiments.

290
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:34,109
It really does look like
broken down pool equipment.

291
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:35,979
How, what does this connect to?

292
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,849
Well, this is all melted up now,

293
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,349
this was a hose that
went down 30 feet,

294
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,149
and now it's melted out.

295
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,819
Wait a minute, so this,

296
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,829
that's lying here used to
be straight down under ice?

297
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,259
Yeah, so we made.

298
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,629
So that's the amount
of ice that has melted.

299
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:51,959
Yeah.

300
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,219
This is 5 years of melt.

301
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:15,149
So this entire length
is the thickness of ice that has

302
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:19,289
melted throughout all of lower
Greenland in the past 5 years.

303
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:20,859
Right.

304
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,059
That's hundreds of cubic
kilometers of ice that's now

305
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,129
no longer stored on land.

306
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,329
It's gone into
the sea over here.

307
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:41,449
Miami, New Orleans,
Boston and Long Beach,

308
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,119
California may be doomed
to fall victim

309
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,319
to ever-rising sea levels.

310
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,149
South Florida as we
know it could be washed away

311
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,359
by risings seas.

312
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,189
When you look at
places that are the most

313
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:57,199
susceptible to sea level rise,
especially in the United States,

314
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,159
Florida is the key one.

315
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:03,199
And a lot of the, your
campaign was based on um,

316
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:06,169
giving people an understanding
of what's at risk here.

317
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,069
We don't have
the liberty or the time

318
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,379
to debate climate change.

319
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,339
If you don't believe
in it, I always say

320
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:14,379
bring your unconverted to
us and we'll make sure you agree

321
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:15,649
that there is a major problem.

322
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,089
We have this thing called
sunny day flooding.

323
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,719
Picture a beautiful sunny day,

324
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,529
all of a sudden you see water
coming up on the street.

325
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,999
As the sea level rises,
the water's coming up,

326
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,999
backflowing into our
streets through our drains.

327
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,399
If the city is underwater,
there's no future.

328
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,339
How do you combat that?

329
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:42,069
Exactly what's going on as far
as prevention is concerned?

330
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:46,979
We started putting in
pumps, take a look at this.

331
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:48,309
Oh, this is the pump!

332
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,149
Yup!

333
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,259
We're in the process of
building all across the city.

334
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,059
This street right here used
to be fully underwater.

335
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,529
During high tide you
may need a canoe.

336
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,629
And now what we did was we
raised this road and you can see

337
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:07,069
the difference, see how that
area there kind of goes,

338
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,229
slopes down a little bit.

339
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,399
So the main investment
is in these systems right here,

340
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,969
raising the roads and
the electric pumps.

341
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,439
Yeah, this is a
400-million-dollar project.

342
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,249
City wide.

343
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,079
And of course we're paying
for it by our city revenues.

344
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,449
I had to raise tax revenue,
which you can imagine is not

345
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,589
a very popular thing to
do as a politician.

346
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,719
And this construction
is it going to make

347
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,935
- a major difference.
- Major difference.

348
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,159
And buy you a
significant amount of time.

349
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,699
Absolutely I would
think about 40, 50 years.

350
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,599
That's it?

351
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,629
Yes.

352
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,185
Now one of the things I always
say when people ask me this,

353
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:48,609
Mayor what about after 50
years, what's going to happen?

354
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,639
Well what we have to do
is come up with solutions,

355
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,579
and unfortunately we have a
governor and we have a cabinet

356
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,449
that doesn't believe that
this is a major issue.

357
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,719
Officials in Florida
were banned from using the words

358
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,489
climate change.

359
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,189
This policy began in 2011 after
Rick Scott came into office.

360
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:07,005
No one really wants
to talk about climate change,

361
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:11,099
especially our senator
from Florida, Marco Rubio,

362
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,129
who doesn't believe that
we have climate change

363
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:16,399
and is not interested in
assisting our state.

364
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:20,139
I would hope that he would have
gone out and grabbed us federal

365
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,709
funds over the last three years
to help make our cities viable.

366
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,609
I do not believe that
human activity is causing

367
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,609
these dramatic changes to our
climate the way these scientists

368
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,579
are portraying it.

369
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,119
Why do you think there
is such opposition about

370
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:34,649
the science?

371
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,265
I think it's politics,
I think it so has to do with

372
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:39,019
lobbying and industry and I
always say one thing, Leo,

373
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,959
I said uh, the ocean
is not Republican

374
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:46,729
and it's not Democrat,
all it knows how to do is rise.

375
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,699
Satellite data show,
for the last seventeen years,

376
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:52,369
there has been no significant
recorded warming.

377
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:54,269
It's supposed
to be 70 degrees today,

378
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:57,039
it's freezing here!

379
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,849
Speaking of global warming where
is, we need some global warming!

380
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,079
It's freezing.

381
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,719
There's about
as robust a consensus

382
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:08,289
about human-caused climate
change as there is

383
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,819
for any matter in science.

384
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,859
Be it the theory of gravity.

385
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:16,799
97 percent of climate scientists
agree, the globe is warming,

386
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,769
our climate is changing, it's
due to fossil fuel burning

387
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,369
and other human activities.

388
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:25,139
Unfortunately we are fighting
this massive disinformation

389
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:27,039
campaign to confuse the public.

390
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:29,679
You look at the
satellite data we actually

391
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,379
have had no significant warming
since 1998 actually no warming.

392
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:35,079
We have been cooling
in recent years.

393
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,649
If you actually believe
that global warming

394
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:40,119
is the biggest problem we face,

395
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,759
you're the dumbest son
of a bitch on the planet.

396
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,335
So yeah, maybe you
could just talk a little bit

397
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,729
about your background, the
studies that you've done.

398
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,759
I was the classic
science and math geek

399
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,299
in high school.

400
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,129
Studied physics in graduate
school and a decade and half ago

401
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,139
my co-authors and I started
to look into climate change

402
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,399
in the more distant past.

403
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:01,839
We published a curve where
there's this long-term cooling

404
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:05,679
trend and then all of
a sudden this abrupt warming

405
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,249
that has no precedent

406
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,679
as far back as you can go and
it got named the hockey stick

407
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,149
because it looks like the
blade of a hockey stick.

408
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:16,219
And once we had published
that graph I had set myself up

409
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,659
for a completely different life.

410
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,459
And why is that?

411
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:21,259
What did they do
specifically to?

412
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,929
I was vilified
on the editorial pages

413
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,229
of the Wall Street
Journal, on Fox News.

414
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,199
That I was a fraud.

415
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,675
Other German
Scientists have called it

416
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,199
statistical rubbish.

417
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,969
He's been called a
statistical charlatan.

418
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,039
I was being
attacked by congressmen.

419
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,385
They threw
spaghetti up on the wall

420
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,609
and wherever it stuck is
what they put in the chart.

421
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,979
I had death threats
that were actionable enough that

422
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,289
the FBI at one point had to come
to my office to investigate

423
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,019
an envelope that had been sent
to me that had a white powder.

424
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,889
I've had threats made
against my family.

425
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,205
These folks know they don't have
to win the legitimate scientific

426
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:57,259
debate.

427
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,229
They just need to
divide the public,

428
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:03,869
and all of that hatred and fear
is in fact organized and funded

429
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,369
by a few players.

430
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:11,179
Fossil fuel interests, folks
like the Koch brothers finance

431
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:16,049
a very large echo chamber of
climate change denialism.

432
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,679
The reality is a
lot of climatologists believe

433
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,249
that the science is not settled.

434
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,119
Global warming is
illusory were actually going

435
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,395
through a period
of global cooling.

436
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,059
It's easier to
believe in a benevolent god

437
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:29,229
the baby Jesus than it is in
some kind of theory about

438
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,799
global warming.

439
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,369
Websites and news
outlets and think tanks.

440
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,869
They find people with fairly
impressive credentials

441
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:38,739
who are willing to sell
those credentials

442
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,209
to fossil fuel interests.

443
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,139
Dr. Fred Singer,
President of the science

444
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,139
and environmental
policy project.

445
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,609
The weather balloons
around the world show no warming

446
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:50,379
of the atmosphere in
the last 25 years.

447
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,719
You have all of
these organizations with lofty

448
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:55,289
sounding names like Americans
for Prosperity

449
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,659
or The Heartland Institute.

450
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,959
These are front groups that are
funded by corporate interests.

451
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,959
Americans for Prosperity
is really a front group

452
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,729
for the Koch brothers.

453
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,675
That's an organization
founded by David and Charles

454
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,975
Koch and good
morning to you Tim.

455
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,275
- Good to be here, Bill.
- Welcome here,

456
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,745
what are you going
to get for your money?

457
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,239
We hope to see policies change.

458
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,309
Koch Industries is one
of the largest privately held

459
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:18,579
fossil fuel interests
in the world.

460
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,679
And they are doing everything
they can to protect that wealth.

461
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,719
Would you give up
all that industrialization,

462
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,219
would you give up all the
productivity that it's brought

463
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:28,919
us, all the lives that it has
saved over the last 100 years,

464
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,189
so that the temperature
wouldn't rise half a percent

465
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:32,259
or a milli percent?

466
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:34,259
They've lobbied Congress.

467
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,899
We keep hearing 2014 has
been the warmest year on record,

468
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,869
oh here Mr. President
catch this. Mhmm.

469
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,739
James Inhofe is
probably the most prominent

470
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,939
congressional climate
change denier.

471
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:49,609
Global warming is the
greatest hoax ever perpetrated

472
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,209
on the American people.

473
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:53,709
He's the chair of the
Senate Environment Committee.

474
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:56,849
There are some people
who are so arrogant to think

475
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,719
that they are so powerful that
they can change a climate.

476
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,049
Man can't change climate.

477
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,719
It might not be
surprising to learn that

478
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,819
James Inhofe is one of
the largest recipients

479
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:08,259
of fossil fuel money
in the U.S. Senate.

480
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,129
Fossil Fuel interests
have bought our House

481
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:17,339
of Representatives and Senate
Environment Committee.

482
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,039
We can't get a climate bill
passed through our Congress

483
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:22,869
because it's controlled
by fossil fuel funded

484
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,309
climate change deniers who
are blocking any bills

485
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:28,809
that would attempt
to deal with this problem.

486
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,949
How they're able to
discredit scientists who have

487
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:35,689
devoted their life to this issue
is kind of mind boggling to me.

488
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,689
It sometimes makes
me want to take a drink right.

489
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:39,189
I'm sure.
If I was a scientist

490
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:41,889
I would be absolutely pissed
every single day of my life.

491
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,329
These people are, you know,

492
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:48,829
engaged in an effort to
lead us astray in the name

493
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:53,609
of short term, you know, fossil
fuel profits so that we end up

494
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,769
leaving behind a
degraded planet.

495
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:56,985
What could be more
immoral than that?

496
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,319
Even now, man may be
unwittingly changing the world's

497
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,659
climate through the waste
products of this civilization.

498
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,959
Due to our release through
factories and automobiles

499
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:16,929
every year of more than 6
billion tons of carbon dioxide.

500
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,869
Our atmosphere seems
to be getting warmer.

501
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,899
This is bad?

502
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:25,039
Well it's been calculated a few
degrees rise in the earth's

503
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:28,839
temperature would melt
the polar ice caps.

504
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:31,709
Fact is, we've known
about this problem for decades

505
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:34,709
and decades, for
over half a century.

506
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:37,849
Every day I send
you a thousand times more power

507
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:39,919
than you use in a year.

508
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:44,589
Anybody working on getting power
direct from old glow hard here?

509
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:48,129
Oh yes but not nearly enough,
roll 6b! The solar battery.

510
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,229
Imagine the world right now,

511
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:53,099
if we had taken the science of
climate change seriously

512
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,999
back then.

513
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,139
But our engineers
will have to build efficient

514
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:02,809
generators that spread out
over acres, even square miles.

515
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,579
To compete with the cheap coal
and oil still available to us.

516
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,949
Since then, our
population has increased

517
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:14,219
by almost 5 billion
people and counting.

518
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:18,189
And China has recently surpassed
the United States as the world's

519
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:20,089
number one polluter.

520
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,299
The problem has become even
more difficult to solve.

521
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,215
Oh now we're on the
opposite side of the street

522
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,639
again. Ok.

523
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:38,079
Now we're in a bike lane.

524
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,199
Air-pocalypse,
schools have been shut down,

525
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:35,369
the toxicity has reached
that worst level.

526
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,859
It's absolutely brilliant,

527
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,759
you don't allow these companies
to operate in the dark.

528
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,699
Chinese media
talks about climate change

529
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:19,769
on a regular basis.

530
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:43,159
Is there a giant push
towards solar and wind here,

531
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,859
is that the next step?

532
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:47,045
China's got some of the
biggest wind and solar companies

533
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:49,269
in the world now.

534
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:52,769
Even though China has some
of the largest challenges,

535
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:57,679
like huge population, China's
gonna prioritize wind and solar

536
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,249
rather than coal.

537
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,649
If China can do it, then I think
the rest of the world can.

538
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:13,659
China is still heavily
relying on fossil fuels,

539
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,929
but they seem to be
transitioning to renewables

540
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:19,859
much faster than
anyone anticipated.

541
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:23,339
The question is, can less
developed countries with rapidly

542
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:26,769
growing populations make
the same transition?

543
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,149
India is the
world's third largest emitter

544
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,159
yet the country is struggling
with massive power shortages

545
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:47,789
and rolling blackouts.

546
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,399
India has consistently said
that its biggest priority

547
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,369
is development and bringing
people out of poverty.

548
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:01,769
We care about climate change.

549
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,139
But the fact is we are a country
where energy access is as much

550
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,949
a challenge as climate change.

551
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:12,919
We need to make sure that every
Indian has access to energy.

552
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,219
From what I understood
there are 300 million people

553
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:18,219
without power, without
light here in India.

554
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,189
Yes, yes.

555
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:21,875
That's equivalent to
the entire population here

556
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:22,989
of the United States.

557
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,169
Today in villages,
Indian villages you will find

558
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:38,909
people take cow dung and
they make what is known,

559
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,749
called cow dung cakes
or uples in Hindi,

560
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,649
and they burn those.

561
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,079
And that's their only
source of cooking energy.

562
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,989
So they will make
food now over this.

563
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:20,419
Coal is cheap whether
you and I like it or not,

564
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:22,149
coal is cheap.

565
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,359
You have to think about this
from this point of view.

566
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,589
If you created the
problem in the past,

567
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:29,259
we will create it in the future.

568
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:33,299
We have 700 million households
who cook using biomass today,

569
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:36,029
700 million households.

570
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:39,969
If those households move to coal
you have that much more use

571
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:44,179
of fossil fuels, then the
entire world is fried.

572
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:47,179
If anyone gives you this very
cute stuff and tells you,

573
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,409
Oh the world's poor
should move to solar, and,

574
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:52,019
Why do they have to make the
mistakes that we have made?

575
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,389
I hear this all the time
from American engineers.

576
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,089
And I'm like, wow!

577
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,719
You know, I mean, if it was that
easy I would have really liked

578
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:03,089
the U.S. to move towards solar,
but you haven't.

579
00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:05,929
Let's put our money
where our mouth is.

580
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,399
We have to
practice what we preach.

581
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:09,169
Absolutely.

582
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,169
I am sorry to say this,
I know you're an American,

583
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,909
and please don't
take this amiss,

584
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:18,579
but your consumption is going to
really put a hole in the planet.

585
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,149
And I think that's the
conversation we need to have.

586
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:25,319
I'll show you charts
from this perspective,

587
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,249
electricity consumed by one
American at home is equivalent

588
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,559
to 1.5 citizens of France,
2.2 citizens of Japan,

589
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:38,999
and 10 citizens of China,
34 of India, 61 of Nigeria.

590
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:40,469
Why?

591
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,229
Because you're building
bigger, you're building more

592
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,469
and using much more than before.

593
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:48,369
The fact is that we need to
put the issue of lifestyle

594
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:52,439
and consumption at the center
of climate negotiations.

595
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:55,049
Look I, there is no
way I don't agree with you,

596
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,209
how can you argue that?

597
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:59,279
You're absolutely
correct and I think yes,

598
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,489
it's a very difficult argument
to present to Americans

599
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,659
that we need to change our
lifestyle and I would also

600
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,029
argue that it's probably
not going to happen.

601
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,359
So we are dependent, if we want
to solve the climate crisis,

602
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:15,129
on the fact that hopefully
renewables like solar and wind

603
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:17,639
will become cheaper and cheaper
and cheaper the more money

604
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:21,269
we funnel into them, the more we
invest into them and ultimately

605
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,269
it will solve that problem.

606
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:27,109
But I, you're shaking
your head obviously.

607
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:29,649
I'm shaking my head
Indian style which means no.

608
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,179
Right.

609
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,919
Who will invest, Leo?

610
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,019
Let's be real about this,

611
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:37,019
who will invest and how
will you invest in it?

612
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,959
We are doing more
investment in solar today,

613
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:43,459
China is doing much more
investment in solar today

614
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:45,159
than the U.S. is.

615
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,299
What is the U.S. doing
which the rest of the world

616
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:48,469
can learn from?

617
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,499
You're a fossil-addicted
country,

618
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,339
but if you are seriously
disengaging it's something

619
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,039
for us to learn from.

620
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,339
And it will be leadership
that we can all hold up

621
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:00,609
to our government and say
listen if the U.S. can do it

622
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:03,509
and the U.S. is doing it,
in spite of all their pressures,

623
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:04,549
we can do it as well.

624
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,459
The sad part of it is,
it's just not happening.

625
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:18,559
And people like me, we are
rich enough to withstand

626
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,239
the first hit of climate change
but it's the poor of India,

627
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:29,139
it's the poor of Africa,
it's the poor of Bangladesh,

628
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:33,609
who are impacted today by what
I believe is the first signs

629
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:34,649
of climate change.

630
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,689
So February and March,
which is when the crops

631
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:52,399
are standing, they got
half the year's rainfall

632
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,029
in just five hours.

633
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,369
Half the year's
rainfall in five hours?

634
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,169
So these crops
are all destroyed?

635
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:00,969
Yeah destroyed.

636
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:04,539
Your back is breaking doing this
and then you get one unseasonal

637
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,349
rainfall, it's absolutely
like the last straw

638
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:11,149
on the camel's back.

639
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:14,489
And we need countries to believe
that climate change is real

640
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,889
and urgent.

641
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:18,389
It's not a figment
of their imagination.

642
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:31,569
The U.S. has been the
biggest emitter of greenhouse

643
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,069
gases in history, and there's no
doubt that we've all benefited

644
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:39,139
from fossil fuels.

645
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,049
I know I have.

646
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:49,149
My footprint is probably a lot
bigger than most people's,

647
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:52,019
and there are times
when I question,

648
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,489
what is the right thing to do?

649
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:58,259
What actions should
we be taking?

650
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:01,499
There are over a billion people
out there without electricity,

651
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:03,599
and they want lights,
they want heat,

652
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,599
they want the lifestyle that
we've had in the United States

653
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,539
for the last hundred years.

654
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:11,979
If we're gonna
solve this problem,

655
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:16,679
we all have a responsibility
to set an example,

656
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,049
and more than that, help the
developing world transition

657
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,549
before it's too late.

658
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:43,369
We are seeing events that
we did not see in the past.

659
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:47,479
It's not about when the entire
islands are underwater.

660
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:52,419
It's well before then is
going to be the crisis.

661
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,579
And it's already happening.

662
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:04,499
What we are facing at the
moment is severe flooding.

663
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,369
It's gone into the fresh water
ponds and that's how people

664
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,669
get their drinking water.

665
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:12,915
Have you spoken
with people in the scientific

666
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:16,809
community that have given you
some sort of a time frame?

667
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,479
Given the scenarios and
the projections put forward

668
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:23,609
by the science, our
islands will be underwater,

669
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:27,919
and so the question is,
what do we do about it?

670
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:30,889
At the moment, internally, we
are relocating our communities

671
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,865
from certain parts of the
island to where the water

672
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:35,529
has not come up.

673
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,759
But our long-term strategy
is something that I've been

674
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:40,669
discussing internationally,
because we,

675
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:45,639
we have to come to accept the
reality that we may not be able

676
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,909
to accommodate
all of our people.

677
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:52,579
We have adopted a policy
of migration with dignity.

678
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:55,309
We bought a piece
of land in Fiji,

679
00:41:55,349 --> 00:42:00,419
so that if our people choose to
migrate today, they can do it.

680
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:01,649
Hmm.

681
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:03,349
They must do it
as a matter of choice.

682
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,519
I've got grandchildren.

683
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,419
I've got 12 grandchildren.

684
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:09,789
I'd like to be able to,
to go away knowing that

685
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,559
they will continue
to have a home.

686
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:22,709
Islands in the Pacific,

687
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,509
we're a paradise in peril.

688
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:30,379
Throughout Palau we have
sea level rise coming

689
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:33,549
into the farmlands,
coming into the homes.

690
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:35,449
This is unbelievable.

691
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:38,789
When was this an intact
island with homes on it?

692
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:39,959
How long ago?

693
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,729
12 years ago, when you came,

694
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,875
there were people living here.

695
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:47,699
So, within the 12-year
period this is the result.

696
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:50,969
It's just a small
picture of one place.

697
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:54,569
The small island nations
who contribute the least

698
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,339
to the causes of climate change,

699
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:00,749
are actually going to feel
the worst uh, impacts.

700
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:04,579
The worst scenarios
because of global warming.

701
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,559
What we've done to
the rest of the world is just,

702
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,829
it's criminal.

703
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,569
It's not just sea level rise.

704
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:30,409
We've taken these coastal
ecosystems that used to be

705
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:34,479
dominated by incredibly
abundant fish,

706
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:39,019
and we've knocked the whole
system down reversing

707
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,049
half a billion
years of evolution.

708
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:49,959
One billion people depend on
fisheries from coral reefs

709
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:53,029
for virtually all of
their protein.

710
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:54,599
One billion people.

711
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:21,729
Here we are, we're on what was
a pretty healthy coral reef.

712
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,599
What's missing?

713
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,399
You see almost nothing
swimming around.

714
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:29,929
Is this a dying coral reef?

715
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,439
I think this reef has had it.

716
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,979
We're pushing the system really
hard and that is a serious enemy

717
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,009
to the health of corals
and their ability to grow.

718
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,709
Mhm.

719
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:47,549
It's causing loss
of people's livelihoods.

720
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:50,859
It's causing starvation.

721
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,789
This is happening all over.

722
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:54,559
Oh yeah, absolutely.

723
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:58,099
I think reefs as we know them
are gonna virtually disappear.

724
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:04,669
The oceans are like this big
buffer because they absorb

725
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:07,269
carbon dioxide.

726
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:10,709
They take up about a third
of the CO2 that we dump

727
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:13,479
into the atmosphere.

728
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:19,519
So because of that, they are a
stabilizing force in climate.

729
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:24,289
The problem is the ocean can't
do its job fast enough

730
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,789
with this absurd rate of
carbon dioxide emissions.

731
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:32,999
You know, life isn't gonna
disappear in the ocean.

732
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,499
There will always be
life in the ocean,

733
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:37,669
but it's not gonna be
necessarily the kind of life

734
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:39,299
we want.

735
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:42,339
We could go back to 3 billion
years ago and have just

736
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:43,609
a whole lot of slime.

737
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:52,319
We're taking away the
ecosystems that normally help us

738
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,429
to restabilize the climate.

739
00:45:55,549 --> 00:46:01,259
Like oceans, rainforests absorb
carbon from our atmosphere.

740
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:04,559
Decades and decades of the
forests breathing in the carbon,

741
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:08,699
storing it in the trunks and the
leaves and the organic matter.

742
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:13,339
Those carbon emissions are
being held safe for us.

743
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,709
Until we clear them,
and light them on fire.

744
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:23,809
It acts like a carbon bomb
and releases massive carbon

745
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:26,949
emissions back into
the atmosphere.

746
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:33,689
Wow, this haze
is intense isn't it?

747
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,399
You can't see anything here!

748
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,669
This is scary.

749
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,369
This isn't natural?
This is all fire?

750
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:54,439
This is not natural at all.

751
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:55,839
I've never
seen anything like this.

752
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,489
There are three big
tropical rainforest areas

753
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,219
left in the world.

754
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:10,159
The Amazon in South America,
the Congo Basin in Africa,

755
00:47:10,189 --> 00:47:12,159
and the South East Asian
rainforest which spans

756
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,599
Indonesia.

757
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:19,199
In Indonesia, we're seeing
fires being intentionally set

758
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,939
in order to create palm
oil plantations,

759
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:27,009
which grow the cheapest
vegetable oil in the world.

760
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,479
It's in cooking oils,
in processed foods,

761
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:32,279
in your cosmetics,
in your detergents.

762
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:37,149
This really cheap commodity is
making companies tremendous

763
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:38,189
profits.

764
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:51,169
Just as far as you can see.

765
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:52,999
Rows of palm oil.

766
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:58,309
They have destroyed so much of
this forest, it's unbelievable.

767
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:21,959
What a beauty!

768
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,625
I can't even
comprehend what these forests

769
00:49:09,649 --> 00:49:11,849
must have looked like.

770
00:49:11,879 --> 00:49:15,319
Forests where rhino and elephant
and orangutan would be populated

771
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:16,989
into the thousands.

772
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:30,199
These guys are
a byproduct of the forest lost

773
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:32,399
because of the
palm oil industry.

774
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:34,499
You know, they're effectively
refugees from forests

775
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,939
that no longer exist.

776
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:38,939
Wow, that's a good grip.

777
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:39,579
Yeah!

778
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,239
Strong.

779
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:43,509
Hey, I'm gonna get you some
fruit, don't be scared.

780
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:45,879
The carrot or the fruit?

781
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:48,649
Definitely the fruit, that's
what you guys are after, huh?

782
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:50,119
There you go.

783
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:51,689
Do you like carrots?
Or, not so much?

784
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,459
Oh my God.

785
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:56,489
These are amazing.

786
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:01,199
Aw.

787
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:08,345
I always
remind people when they go,

788
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:11,339
Aw, the poor thing, you know,
these are the lucky survivors.

789
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:13,339
What happens to
all the other orangutan?

790
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:14,699
You know,
all the others are dead.

791
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,149
And the reason people are
chopping down the forest

792
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:21,225
to plant palm oil plantations
is because people keep buying

793
00:50:21,249 --> 00:50:23,549
the stuff.

794
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:26,959
People have to realize that what
they do in their supermarket,

795
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,119
the decisions they make
in their daily lives,

796
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,729
are affecting places like
the Leuser ecosystem.

797
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:37,269
If palm oil is in
almost everything we buy,

798
00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:39,999
how are consumers
supposed to avoid this?

799
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:45,409
If these products have
such a devastating impact,

800
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:48,009
why aren't governments setting
restrictions to prevent

801
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:51,149
these big corporations
from destroying the planet

802
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:53,049
just so they can save money?

803
00:50:57,189 --> 00:51:01,159
If you want something
that you can do without

804
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:03,429
appealing to any
higher authorities,

805
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:08,459
such as government or whatever,
I can't think of an easier, um,

806
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,669
out, than changing your diet.

807
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,229
You can start tonight.

808
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:16,539
So you're a scientist
who studies the effects

809
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:20,109
of agriculture on climate, but
you grew up raising cattle

810
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,679
and taking them to
slaughter, right?

811
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:24,549
I'm a scientist, that's
the most important thing.

812
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:29,449
So, of all the reasons for
tropical deforestation,

813
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:33,119
the foremost is beef.

814
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,989
And beef is one of the most
inefficient uses of resources

815
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:40,029
on the planet.

816
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:45,929
In the U.S., 47 percent of land
is used for food production,

817
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:50,709
and of that, the lion's share is
just to grow feed for cattle.

818
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:55,309
The things that we actually eat,
like fruit, vegetable, nuts,

819
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:57,609
it's a percent.

820
00:51:57,649 --> 00:52:00,379
Most importantly,
cows produce methane,

821
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:04,349
and methane is a
powerful greenhouse gas.

822
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:08,419
The way cows produce methane is
they eat as much as they can,

823
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,389
and when they are chewing, a
whole bunch of methane is burped

824
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,169
through the mouth uh,
into the atmosphere.

825
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,299
The atmosphere has
much more CO2 in it.

826
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:23,909
But Methane is far
more impactful.

827
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:27,609
Every molecule of methane is
equivalent to 23 molecules

828
00:52:27,649 --> 00:52:28,909
of CO2.

829
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:31,949
And of the methane
in the atmosphere,

830
00:52:31,979 --> 00:52:34,649
nearly all of it is
due to livestock.

831
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:37,649
In comparison to
emissions from other sources,

832
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:40,919
what kind of percentage
are we talking about come from

833
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:42,159
the consumption of beef?

834
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:46,129
About 10, 12
percent of the total U.S.

835
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,699
emissions is due to beef.

836
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:51,399
It's staggering.

837
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:55,399
But it's very easy to
envision a dietary shift,

838
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:58,639
even as minor as
switching, let's say,

839
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,539
from beef to an alternative.

840
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:02,439
Let's say even chicken.

841
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:06,319
The chicken will require
20 percent of the land,

842
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,989
and 10 percent of the
greenhouse gas emissions.

843
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:13,189
And if you compare, rice,
or potato, or wheat,

844
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:18,129
beef requires 50
times as much land.

845
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,059
So even cutting the
amount of beef that you eat

846
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:22,559
in half, or by a quarter, could
make a significant difference.

847
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,169
It, very significant.

848
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,239
Do you, do you at
all think that that's even

849
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,099
a possibility considering
that beef is so a part

850
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,409
of our culture?

851
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:34,309
Maybe not everybody's
ready to eat tofu, you know,

852
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:35,379
24/7.

853
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:36,979
I get that.

854
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:40,049
But even if you just have to
have some flesh between

855
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,649
your teeth, if you
switch to chicken,

856
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:47,259
you will have eliminated 80
percent of you what you emit,

857
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:49,529
depending on where
you are coming from.

858
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,429
Let's face it, it's fairly
easy to switch your diet

859
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:54,399
from one choice to another.

860
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,349
While working on the Revenant,

861
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:17,319
which is about man's
struggle with the elements,

862
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:22,259
we shot on location in
the Canadian snow belt.

863
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:26,129
The irony was we were hit
in with record temperatures

864
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,169
that completely melted our set.

865
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,569
In order to finish
making the movie,

866
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:42,079
we had to relocate halfway
around the world just to find

867
00:54:42,109 --> 00:54:43,679
snow.

868
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:56,229
The fact that we have to come,

869
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,189
200 people in the
middle of the summer,

870
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,299
to the winter in
Southern Ushuaia,

871
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:05,129
9000 miles from where we're
supposed to be shooting

872
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:09,969
this three months ago, chasing
ice, is because it's melting.

873
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:14,279
It was a very, very warm winter.

874
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:17,109
We came down to the
southern tip of our continent

875
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:20,419
besides the South Pole, to
film this, cause this is where

876
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:23,289
this, this, the last
snow is left.

877
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,489
I think that, my
point of view I was saying

878
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,019
to my, to my son, I said,
you know, it's funny that,

879
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,489
it's very sad but
probably for you kids,

880
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:35,099
to see snow will be a
super eccentric adventure.

881
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:38,369
A few people will be able
to see snow in the future.

882
00:55:54,449 --> 00:56:00,159
I feel like I'm in
some weird, surreal movie.

883
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:04,059
I honestly look around, and I
think, when I have children,

884
00:56:04,089 --> 00:56:06,959
everything that we
now take for granted,

885
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:11,229
our planet and all of its
biodiversity and beauty.

886
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:14,169
Everything in the future
is gonna be different.

887
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,149
Every single light that you see
has to be completely different.

888
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:31,189
It has to come from a
different power source.

889
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:33,789
We need to build all
those things differently,

890
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:37,059
all the cars that are on the
road need to be different.

891
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:41,199
And this is one city, and
if you zoom out onto a large map

892
00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:44,629
of planet earth at night,
you see electrification

893
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:46,199
all over the world.

894
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:51,609
And we're fighting powerful
fossil fuel interests

895
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:54,339
that basically want to keep
doing business as usual.

896
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,049
How can we possibly
turn this all around?

897
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:02,965
The fossil fuel industry
is the biggest industry

898
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,689
in the world.

899
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,859
They have more money and more
influence than any other sector,

900
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:11,859
so I mean, the more that there
can be sort of popular uprising

901
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:14,029
against that, the better.

902
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,729
But I think the scientific
fact of the matter is,

903
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:21,169
we are unavoidably headed
towards some level of, of harm.

904
00:57:21,209 --> 00:57:23,169
So, the sooner we
can take action,

905
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:25,769
the less harm will result.

906
00:57:30,249 --> 00:57:32,179
Wow. Holy crap.

907
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:34,079
That's a good robot.

908
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,549
Whoa!

909
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:39,049
What is your grand
vision for all of this?

910
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,929
The point of the
Gigafactory is to get the cost

911
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:43,189
of batteries down to the
point where it's affordable.

912
00:57:43,229 --> 00:57:45,029
Right.

913
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:47,829
Batteries are critical to
the sustainable energy future.

914
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:49,599
The sun doesn't shine
all the time, so,

915
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:52,169
you've got to store
it in a battery.

916
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,669
How is this gonna
help developing nations that

917
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:57,939
have massive populations
that need to have power?

918
00:57:57,979 --> 00:58:00,639
So, the advantage of
solar and batteries is that

919
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:03,249
you can avoid building
electricity plants at all.

920
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,279
So you could be in a remote
village and have solar panels

921
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,849
that charge a battery pack, that
then supplies power to the,

922
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:12,919
to the whole village,
without ever having to run

923
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:15,919
thousands of miles of high
voltage cable over the place.

924
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,589
It's like, what happened with

925
00:58:17,629 --> 00:58:20,559
landline phones versus
cellular phones,

926
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,005
in a lot of developed
countries they just didn't do

927
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:24,329
the landline phones, they just
went straight to cellular.

928
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,675
And we actually did the
calculations today, like,

929
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:30,739
what would it take to transition
the whole world to, uh,

930
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:32,109
sustainable energy.

931
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:34,709
What kind of throughput
would you actually need?

932
00:58:34,749 --> 00:58:37,779
Um, and you'd need
100 gigafactories. So.

933
00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:38,819
100 of these?

934
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,119
100 of these, yes.

935
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,979
That would
make the United States.

936
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,249
No, the whole world.

937
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:44,049
The whole world?

938
00:58:44,089 --> 00:58:45,119
The whole world.

939
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,859
All energy.

940
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:48,859
- That's it?!
- Yeah.

941
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:49,789
That sounds, that doesn't sound.

942
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:50,659
It's manageable.

943
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:51,929
That sounds manageable.

944
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:52,959
Yeah.

945
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,099
The Gigafactory,
when it's complete,

946
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:01,099
will have the largest footprint
of any building in the world.

947
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:03,145
Counting multiple levels, it
could be as much as 15 million

948
00:59:03,169 --> 00:59:05,969
square feet.

949
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:10,049
So, Tesla can't build
100 gigafactories.

950
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,995
The thing that's really gonna
make a difference is if

951
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:14,779
companies that are much bigger
than Tesla do the same thing.

952
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:18,719
If the big industrial companies
in China, and U.S., and Europe,

953
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:21,589
the big car companies,
if they also do this,

954
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:24,589
then collectively we can
accelerate the transition

955
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:26,089
to sustainable energy.

956
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,959
And if government sets the rules
to favor sustainable energy,

957
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,999
we can get there really quickly.

958
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:33,239
But it's really fundamental.

959
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,899
Unless there's a
price put on carbon.

960
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,545
We're never gonna be
able to make the transition

961
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:39,109
that we need to in time.
Correct?

962
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:40,839
Yeah.

963
00:59:40,879 --> 00:59:44,049
And the only way to do that is
basically with a carbon tax.

964
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,019
Okay, now walk
me through a carbon tax,

965
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:49,019
which is what you're saying,
is the silver bullet

966
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:50,719
for climate change.

967
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:53,089
Well the carbon tax
would be basically a tax on

968
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,159
any kind of activity that put
carbon into the atmosphere.

969
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,159
So when you tax something,
you raise the price,

970
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:02,199
people are gonna tend
to consume less of it.

971
01:00:02,229 --> 01:00:04,629
In fact that's sort of lesson
number one of economics.

972
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,639
So you're teaching
economics at Harvard,

973
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,239
and you literally wrote the
book on contemporary economics,

974
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:10,939
right?

975
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:12,085
Well if I'm teaching
the course for many years,

976
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,385
I might as well write the
textbook to go with it.

977
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,879
So just to be clear,
you've worked with a lot of

978
01:00:15,909 --> 01:00:19,919
Republican heavyweights,
John McCain, Mitt Romney,

979
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,679
and you worked for George Bush
when he became president.

980
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,719
I was chairman of the
council of economic advisors.

981
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:28,189
So how come we don't
have a carbon tax already?

982
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:29,335
Politicians don't
always do what professors

983
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,629
want them to do.

984
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:35,199
So the basic idea is
that we wanna tax bad activities

985
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:38,999
that have negative side effects
on other people in society.

986
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,015
So we'd raise the price of
cigarettes by putting a tax

987
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,309
on cigarettes, people are
gonna consume fewer cigarettes.

988
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:47,079
Climate change involves a
variety of negative side effects

989
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:48,309
and costs.

990
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:57,689
A carbon tax forces people to
take account of those costs.

991
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:01,359
I think trying to appeal to
people's social responsibility

992
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,959
is really very, very hard,
because people have complicated

993
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:05,735
lives and they have lots
of things to worry about,

994
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:07,575
they don't want to have to
think about climate change

995
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,399
every time they do every
decision. They can't.

996
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:13,245
And every time you turn on your
car, are you supposed to think,

997
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,039
Uh oh, what am I
doing to the climate?

998
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:20,179
What the carbon tax does is it
nudges them in the direction

999
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,909
of doing the right thing.

1000
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:22,955
So lemme get this straight.

1001
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,749
You're a Republican,
who wants more taxes?

1002
01:01:26,779 --> 01:01:28,225
Well, one of the
important things to keep in mind

1003
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:30,149
is that if you
have a carbon tax,

1004
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,989
you can turn around and cut
other taxes in response.

1005
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:35,759
For example, payroll taxes.

1006
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:38,329
This is a tax shift rather
than a tax increase.

1007
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:41,199
So is it possible to
ever pass a carbon tax now,

1008
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:44,029
given the current
political situation?

1009
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:45,915
I mean, half the people in
office still don't believe

1010
01:01:45,939 --> 01:01:47,839
in climate change.

1011
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:49,599
Yes we can!

1012
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,809
During the campaign,
President Obama didn't wanna say

1013
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,879
the word carbon tax, because
it would poll terribly.

1014
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:59,379
If we wanna change the
president's view of carbon

1015
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:03,219
taxes, we need to change the
public's view of carbon taxes.

1016
01:02:03,249 --> 01:02:04,719
Think of gay marriage.

1017
01:02:04,759 --> 01:02:06,989
Remember Barack Obama ran
against gay marriage.

1018
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:10,059
I, uh, am not a
supporter of gay marriage.

1019
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:11,629
When did he switch?

1020
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:12,835
When the polls
started switching.

1021
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:14,759
I think same-sex
couples should be able

1022
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,599
to get married.

1023
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:17,875
Politicians, whether we
call them our elected leaders,

1024
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:19,269
are really our
elected followers.

1025
01:02:19,299 --> 01:02:22,039
They do what the
people want them to do.

1026
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:23,615
We need to preach to
the American people.

1027
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,915
Once the American
people are convinced,

1028
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:27,179
the politicians will fall
in line very quickly.

1029
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,849
President Obama
and representatives from nearly

1030
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:35,319
200 other countries are trying
to reach an agreement to keep

1031
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:38,049
global warming in check.

1032
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:40,689
In December, the world
will come together at the U.N.

1033
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:44,329
Climate Conference in Paris,
and we will see whether or not

1034
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:47,159
we can muster the collective
political will to reach

1035
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,599
an ambitious, comprehensive
agreement.

1036
01:02:50,629 --> 01:02:51,669
This is a critical year.

1037
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,699
Leo. How you doing, man?

1038
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:57,615
Thank you for your
time, I really appreciate it.

1039
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:00,309
Last time we had a hug
everybody had a, did you see,

1040
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:02,155
it was all over the thing?
It was pretty dangerous.

1041
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,379
Oh, really?
Oh, yes I remember that.

1042
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,879
I forgot about that!

1043
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:08,879
Good to see you, Secretary.

1044
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:12,619
So, after decades of
failed negotiations,

1045
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:16,319
what makes this negotiation
different from all the rest?

1046
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:20,099
I remember the footage of
George Bush Sr. saying

1047
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,959
we've just learned about this
thing called global warming.

1048
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,969
We come to Rio
proud of what we've accomplished

1049
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:29,639
and committed to extending the
record on American leadership

1050
01:03:29,669 --> 01:03:30,939
on the environment.

1051
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:34,079
I mean, we had climate
summit after climate summit,

1052
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:36,809
and we've seen so little action.

1053
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:38,125
Well, let me tell
you why this is different,

1054
01:03:38,149 --> 01:03:39,809
and it really is different.

1055
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:43,719
Last year President Obama was
able to stand up in Beijing

1056
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:45,989
with the Chinese President Shi

1057
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:50,629
and announce intended reductions
in emissions for Paris.

1058
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:53,359
Well guess what, when
the two largest economies

1059
01:03:53,399 --> 01:03:58,269
in the world and the two largest
emitters in the world stand up

1060
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,799
and make a statement like that,

1061
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,899
that's created a momentum
that never existed before.

1062
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,739
A lot of things
are coming together.

1063
01:04:04,779 --> 01:04:08,009
Tragically, the full measure
of the negative impact

1064
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:10,709
of climate change is
coming together too.

1065
01:04:10,749 --> 01:04:13,719
What's happening now is that
you have mass populations

1066
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,919
that are moving as a
result of climate.

1067
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,659
Or you have
huge fights over water,

1068
01:04:22,689 --> 01:04:24,129
which could erupt into wars.

1069
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,899
And any extremist
philosophy could appeal

1070
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:37,609
to people if they have nowhere
to live, no way to live,

1071
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,609
and that's when
people are vulnerable.

1072
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,849
If anybody thinks
I'm kidding about that,

1073
01:04:44,879 --> 01:04:47,219
it's happening today.

1074
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:50,589
And the greatest fear about all
of this is leaving this planet

1075
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:54,119
in better shape than we were
given it and that's not

1076
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:55,019
what we're doing today.

1077
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,139
Today I spend
most of my time on understanding

1078
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:11,669
how can we secure a prosperous
future for humanity

1079
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:13,715
in a situation where we're
starting to hit the ceiling

1080
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:17,179
of what the planet
can cope with.

1081
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,155
And I have the privilege of
chairing something called

1082
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:22,079
the Earth League, which is a
network of leading earth system

1083
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:25,819
scientists, try and gather
really all the knowledge we have

1084
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:29,859
on understanding our
future on, on earth.

1085
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:32,329
We are on average moving
towards a four degrees warming

1086
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:34,029
this century.

1087
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:38,569
And we haven't been in a
four-degree warmer world, um,

1088
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,999
for the past four million years.

1089
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:45,239
So it's not as if it's a
place we know very well.

1090
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:50,109
So give me one, sort
of picture of what the world

1091
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:54,079
may look like if we do
not take action.

1092
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,249
To begin with, for
the past twelve thousand years,

1093
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:59,949
temperatures are almost
miraculously stable.

1094
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:03,019
In fact, average temperatures
vary within only plus minus

1095
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,529
one degrees Celsius during
this entire period.

1096
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:07,799
This perfect planet
with this perfect atmosphere.

1097
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:09,099
Yeah. Exactly.

1098
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:12,169
And so, let us then move
upwards in temperature.

1099
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:13,869
Where are we right now?

1100
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:16,969
Well, today we're
approaching one degree Celsius.

1101
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:20,639
Already it just, 0.85 degrees,
we're seeing faster

1102
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:21,939
than predicted impacts.

1103
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,709
This storm is so big, so vast,

1104
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:27,879
60 million Americans
will feel its power.

1105
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:29,979
We're in a historic drought.

1106
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:32,619
The world's coral
reefs begin to collapse

1107
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,689
even before two degrees.

1108
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:37,329
And we're predicted
to hit 1.5, to 2 degrees. So.

1109
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,389
Already now. So.

1110
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:39,505
That's already
probably gonna happen.

1111
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,959
That's already
probably gonna happen.

1112
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:45,029
At 3, 4 degrees, we will have
heat waves which makes

1113
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:48,669
many regions in the world
not livable any longer.

1114
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:52,609
Agriculture will be collapsing
around the equator.

1115
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:54,909
That would take us beyond
being able to responsibly

1116
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:57,809
feed humanity.

1117
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:01,779
What makes scientists so nervous
is that we can reach a point

1118
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:05,189
where earth takes over and
starts reinforcing warming.

1119
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:07,259
This is what we
call tipping points,

1120
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,589
and the most obvious
one is Greenland.

1121
01:07:10,629 --> 01:07:14,729
Greenland, for the first time,
is melting on its entire surface

1122
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:16,929
to a point where, instead
of being a white surface,

1123
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,699
becomes a dark surface, and
suddenly instead of becoming

1124
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:21,769
a cooler, becomes a self-heater.

1125
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:24,169
Because, because of
the fact the ice can no longer

1126
01:07:24,209 --> 01:07:25,539
reflect back.

1127
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:26,539
Just the color change.

1128
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,309
Just the
color change of the ice.

1129
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:32,279
Suddenly, all these
feedbacks start kicking in.

1130
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:36,179
Methane stuck under frozen
permafrost thaws to a point

1131
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,589
where it starts
getting released.

1132
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:42,089
And that in turn
warms the planet even more,

1133
01:07:42,129 --> 01:07:43,759
which releases more methane.

1134
01:07:43,789 --> 01:07:45,129
Correct.

1135
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,305
That's if we don't
take immediate action.

1136
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,029
Yes.
That's business as usual.

1137
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:50,829
But the Paris Climate Summit
that we are soon approaching

1138
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:54,099
in December, if world leaders
come together properly,

1139
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:56,299
the window is open,
but barely open,

1140
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:59,139
to transition back
into a stable planet.

1141
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:01,209
Last time we had
our climate summit,

1142
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:03,979
you couldn't say that we could
go to scale on high tech,

1143
01:08:04,009 --> 01:08:05,149
clean energy solutions.

1144
01:08:05,179 --> 01:08:07,649
But now in Paris, we can say so.

1145
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,819
We actually have the proof.

1146
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:11,789
You know you wake up in
Germany Saturday morning,

1147
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:14,159
you're likely to get 30
percent of your electricity

1148
01:08:14,189 --> 01:08:18,589
from solar and wind, and not
from a few energy utilities,

1149
01:08:18,629 --> 01:08:22,859
but from over 2 million
citizens delivering to a grid.

1150
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,239
Denmark today produces over
100 percent, some days,

1151
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,599
of its electricity
needs from wind.

1152
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:30,269
100 percent.

1153
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:32,309
It's totally renewable.

1154
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:35,209
And remember that, once you've
invested in wind and solar,

1155
01:08:35,249 --> 01:08:38,109
you actually have
free energy forever.

1156
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:41,679
¶ ¶

1157
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:43,819
In countries like
my own, in Sweden,

1158
01:08:43,849 --> 01:08:46,649
there was an enormous
uprising among people.

1159
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,789
You know, from youth groups to
citizen side organizations,

1160
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:52,589
to the point that the prime
minister announced three weeks

1161
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,759
back that Sweden will now
become the world's first

1162
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,059
fossil fuel-free nation.

1163
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:57,669
- Congratulations.
- I was shocked

1164
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:02,639
at the way that it propelled
itself from below.

1165
01:09:02,669 --> 01:09:07,039
I think we have tipped the world
toward a sustainable future.

1166
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:09,809
The fear is are we
doing it too slowly?

1167
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:35,699
Ladies and gentleman,

1168
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:42,809
you are here today to write
the script for a new future.

1169
01:09:42,849 --> 01:09:47,279
The fate of our planet
is in your hands.

1170
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:54,489
I am a small island girl
with big dreams from the Island

1171
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:56,789
of Majuro in the
Marshall Islands.

1172
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:58,659
Back when I was six or seven,

1173
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,499
my grandpa told me about how
the ice in the North Pole

1174
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:03,759
and the South Pole
will melt away,

1175
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:08,869
and as they melt, the water will
rise and soon flood our islands.

1176
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:12,009
This agreement is for
those of us whose identity,

1177
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:15,939
whose culture, whose ancestors,
whose whole being is bound

1178
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,979
to their lands.

1179
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:20,879
This agreement will
help the world prepare

1180
01:10:20,919 --> 01:10:24,719
for the impacts of climate
change that are already here,

1181
01:10:24,749 --> 01:10:29,789
and also, for those we know are
now headed our way inevitably.

1182
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:39,469
Nearly a quarter of a
century of global climate talks

1183
01:10:39,499 --> 01:10:44,339
have come to this
pivotal moment in Paris.

1184
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:47,839
195 countries saying they'll do
everything in their power

1185
01:10:47,879 --> 01:10:49,739
to change.

1186
01:11:02,089 --> 01:11:04,659
There's no doubt that
this agreement is a massive step

1187
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:06,589
forward.

1188
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,459
But does it go far enough?

1189
01:11:08,499 --> 01:11:10,669
The Paris Agreement
calls for keeping climate

1190
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:13,769
warming to well below
two degrees Celsius,

1191
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:16,239
while striving for 1.5.

1192
01:11:16,269 --> 01:11:18,309
There's no
mention of a carbon tax,

1193
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:20,679
there's no mention
of any penalties.

1194
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,439
There are no
enforcement provisions.

1195
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:24,925
We just have to take
it on faith that all these

1196
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:29,019
countries are gonna follow
through with what they say.

1197
01:11:29,049 --> 01:11:30,049
How likely is that?

1198
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:36,489
This is an
unattainable deal that Congress

1199
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:38,659
has already voted to reject.

1200
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:41,759
The fact that we're
going to have a 26-28 percent

1201
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:45,299
reduction in CO2 emissions,
that isn't gonna happen.

1202
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:47,269
I chair the committee
that has jurisdiction

1203
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:50,039
over the Environmental
Protection Agency.

1204
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:56,839
Hey man.

1205
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,609
Good to see ya.

1206
01:11:58,649 --> 01:11:59,249
- Thank you so much.
- You doing alright?

1207
01:11:59,279 --> 01:11:59,979
Absolutely.

1208
01:12:00,019 --> 01:12:01,249
Alright. C'mon.

1209
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,749
The Paris Agreement ended up
being a historic agreement,

1210
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:08,289
not because it gets us to where
we need to be eventually,

1211
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:13,429
but for the first time, locking
in all countries into verifiable

1212
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:15,699
steps and targets that
they're gonna take.

1213
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:18,699
It creates the architecture
that allows us to finally start

1214
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:20,415
dealing with this
problem in a serious way.

1215
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:21,715
So you were
happy with what came of it?

1216
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:24,339
I, I, I was happy
that we put the architecture

1217
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:26,009
in place.

1218
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:28,639
The, the targets that have been
set in Paris are nowhere near

1219
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:32,649
enough for what the scientists
tell us we have to do eventually

1220
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:34,449
to solve this problem.

1221
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,819
But if we can use the next
20 years to apply existing

1222
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:41,019
technologies to reduce
carbon emissions,

1223
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:45,389
and then start slowly turning up
the dials as new technologies

1224
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:47,929
come on line, so that we have
more and more ambitious targets

1225
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:52,769
each year, then, we're not gonna
completely reverse the warming

1226
01:12:52,799 --> 01:12:55,899
that now is inevitable, but we
can stop it before it becomes

1227
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,609
catastrophic.

1228
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,539
And it's no secret
that you've been under great

1229
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:02,939
opposition to try to implement
some of your climate change

1230
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:04,609
initiatives. And.

1231
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:06,809
We've got some
folks on the other side. Yeah.

1232
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,419
So someone that comes
into office that does not

1233
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:12,289
believe in the science
of climate change,

1234
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,319
do they have the capacity
and the power to dismantle

1235
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:16,865
everything that you've
already worked for?

1236
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:20,289
Even if somebody
came in, campaigning on denying

1237
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:25,799
climate science, reality has
a way of, you know,

1238
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:28,739
hitting you in the nose if
you're not paying attention.

1239
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:33,539
And I think that the public is
starting to realize the science,

1240
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:36,679
in part because
it's indisputable.

1241
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:39,479
Admire your optimism.

1242
01:13:39,519 --> 01:13:40,349
- Yeah.
- But

1243
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,019
you start to look at
the science,

1244
01:13:42,049 --> 01:13:43,919
look at what's going on
in the Antarctic and,

1245
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:46,849
and scientists saying that
there are sections of ice that

1246
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:50,519
guarantee four to six
meters of ocean level rise,

1247
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,789
which will be catastrophic
for the future.

1248
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,859
You are the leader
of the Free World.

1249
01:13:56,899 --> 01:14:00,399
You have access to information
that most people do not.

1250
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:04,739
What makes you terrified
for the future?

1251
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:08,379
Uh, a huge portion
of the world's population

1252
01:14:08,409 --> 01:14:10,539
- lives near oceans.
- Mhm.

1253
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:17,279
If they start
moving, then you start seeing,

1254
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,789
um, scarce resources.

1255
01:14:19,819 --> 01:14:22,689
The subject of competition
between populations.

1256
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:25,259
This is the reason why
the Pentagon has said,

1257
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:26,889
this is a national
security issue.

1258
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,829
This isn't just an
environmental issue.

1259
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:31,329
This is a national
security issue.

1260
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:36,999
You know, in addition to just
the sadness that I would feel if

1261
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:41,409
my kids can never see a glacier,
the way I saw when I went up

1262
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,549
to Alaska, uh, you know,
that's the romantic side of it.

1263
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:47,419
That's the side that takes
a walk with my daughters

1264
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,979
and I wanna be able to, them
to see, or my grandkids,

1265
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,665
I want them to see the
same things as I saw

1266
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:52,819
as I was growing up.

1267
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:56,619
Even if you were
unsentimental about that,

1268
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,729
in very hard-headed terms,
you've gotta worry about

1269
01:14:59,759 --> 01:15:01,599
the national security
implications of this,

1270
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:05,769
and the capacity for the
existing world order

1271
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:08,699
as we understand it to
survive the kinds of strains

1272
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:10,939
that the scientists are
predicting without action.

1273
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:14,939
This is why we have
to take action now.

1274
01:15:14,979 --> 01:15:18,309
If we keep pushing keep prodding
and most importantly keep

1275
01:15:18,349 --> 01:15:21,949
educating the public
there's no reason why, uh,

1276
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:24,819
we can't solve this
problem in time.

1277
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:25,995
Thank you for
your time, Mr. President.

1278
01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:26,949
You bet.

1279
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,235
Thanks for the good
work you're doing.

1280
01:15:28,259 --> 01:15:29,699
- Thank you so much.
- Alright. Good?

1281
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:42,299
I have realized that as
a science community we have not

1282
01:15:42,339 --> 01:15:47,539
done the best job, frankly,
of communicating this threat

1283
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:51,149
to the public.

1284
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,179
But when you go up there and
see it with your own eye,

1285
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:59,189
how thin the world's
atmosphere is,

1286
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:03,319
tiny little onion
skin around the earth.

1287
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,229
That's all the oxygen that
we breathe, that's the CO2,

1288
01:16:06,259 --> 01:16:08,999
everything we burn goes into it.

1289
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:12,329
It's an astonishingly
fragile film.

1290
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:18,439
You know, I knew intellectually
how the earth's system works,

1291
01:16:18,469 --> 01:16:20,315
'cause that's what I've
been doing for 20 years.

1292
01:16:20,339 --> 01:16:22,439
To see how the
atmosphere and the ocean,

1293
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,009
all the elements in the
system work together.

1294
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:26,355
So I understood it
intellectually.

1295
01:16:26,379 --> 01:16:28,219
Mhm.

1296
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:30,919
But it's like being
an ant trying to understand

1297
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:33,489
what an elephant looks like by
crawling all over the elephant.

1298
01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:38,365
But when you're
up there in orbit,

1299
01:16:38,389 --> 01:16:42,529
and you can see 1200 miles
in any direction, I mean,

1300
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:43,569
let me tell you.

1301
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,429
It's kind of a revelation.

1302
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:49,569
Seeing all the cities at night,
millions of people all working

1303
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:52,069
away, doing something.

1304
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:53,355
Come around the day
side of the world,

1305
01:16:53,379 --> 01:16:55,009
seeing the natural systems.

1306
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:58,509
The hurricanes, huge,
great big wheels, you know,

1307
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:00,949
over the oceans.

1308
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:04,019
Saw the Amazon River
go between my feet.

1309
01:17:04,049 --> 01:17:06,335
For like five minutes, you know,
I have a whole green carpet

1310
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:07,389
either side.

1311
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:10,219
Just beautiful, all
the way out to the sea.

1312
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,165
And you know there was the sun
coming up over the Amazon,

1313
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:15,459
the whole forest waking up, and
doing what it does every day,

1314
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:17,869
you know. Breathing
in and breathing out.

1315
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:21,469
So I, I, you know, at the end
of all that I became immensely

1316
01:17:21,499 --> 01:17:24,469
fond, more fond of
the planet. You know?

1317
01:17:24,509 --> 01:17:25,985
Which I never thought about
when I actually just live

1318
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:27,069
on the surface.

1319
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,539
I'm also kind of fond of
the people on there, too.

1320
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:32,609
It's like being taken away from
your family and coming back.

1321
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:38,019
And um, you know,
I wish it all well.

1322
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:41,359
I, uh, just before Christmas
I got told I got pancreatic

1323
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:43,219
cancer.

1324
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:47,259
Stage 4, so it's also elsewhere
in me, not just in one place.

1325
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:49,599
So um, you know, the, the odds
are I won't be around

1326
01:17:49,629 --> 01:17:51,399
for very long.

1327
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:54,999
You know, it's a very
small chance of survival.

1328
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,969
So, uh, that's really
motivated me to think about

1329
01:17:59,009 --> 01:18:02,379
what's important to do, and what
can I contribute in the time

1330
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:05,009
I have left.

1331
01:18:05,049 --> 01:18:10,079
So this is a model
simulation of the earth, now,

1332
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,489
we have about 20 satellites
that are dedicated to looking

1333
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:15,159
at the earth, every day.

1334
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:17,629
One looks at clouds, one looks
at the sea surface temperature,

1335
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,329
Oko looks at carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

1336
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:23,629
All this information comes in,
and this is the tool we use

1337
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:25,499
to do climate simulation.

1338
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:28,469
Here's an example of one thing
we could see: this is

1339
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:31,869
ocean surface temperature,
as measured from space.

1340
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:34,409
This is the whole world's
surface temperature.

1341
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:38,109
You can see the
poles melting, there.

1342
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:39,079
Wow.

1343
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:40,009
- Yeah.
- It's amazing.

1344
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,095
This is the way to do it man.

1345
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:43,319
This is the way to really
see what's going on.

1346
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:44,525
Here's the Gulf
Stream, look at this.

1347
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:47,289
It's like a motion of the ocean.

1348
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:49,259
This is like
a great piece of art.

1349
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,159
It is, isn't it?

1350
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:52,529
Biggest impact would be here.

1351
01:18:52,559 --> 01:18:54,289
- In the Gulf Stream.
- Yeah.

1352
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,299
This current here, see it?

1353
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:58,669
The dumping of ice
off melting Greenland,

1354
01:18:58,699 --> 01:19:02,239
would stop this conveyor belt,
and the Gulf Stream would slow

1355
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:05,969
down, stopping the transport
of heat from here, to there.

1356
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:08,479
And then Europe
would get cold toes.

1357
01:19:08,509 --> 01:19:11,479
Because there's a lot of heat
transport from the Tropics,

1358
01:19:11,509 --> 01:19:14,249
across the North Atlantic,
that keeps Europe warm. I mean.

1359
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:15,549
So Europe would get colder?

1360
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:17,119
Yeah.

1361
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:18,265
Cause that's the
big misconception about

1362
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:20,219
climate change, is that
everything gets warmer.

1363
01:19:20,259 --> 01:19:22,119
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1364
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,489
And here's the most
advanced precipitation satellite

1365
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:26,259
in the world.

1366
01:19:26,299 --> 01:19:28,575
This is very important, cause we
think the biggest impact from

1367
01:19:28,599 --> 01:19:32,069
climate change is the moving of
the precipitation belts.

1368
01:19:32,099 --> 01:19:34,469
From the equator
they'll go further out,

1369
01:19:34,499 --> 01:19:37,969
so we're already seeing
signs of a system drought.

1370
01:19:38,009 --> 01:19:39,185
So that causes more
drought in places

1371
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,609
- that are already too hot.
- Yes.

1372
01:19:41,639 --> 01:19:44,109
And there's a lot of papers
written in the State Department

1373
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:46,479
and elsewhere, how that
sustained drought has helped

1374
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:50,519
fuel the conflict of the Syrian
civil war, Darfur, Sudan,

1375
01:19:50,549 --> 01:19:53,489
all these places that are
short of water, short of food.

1376
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:56,519
Is this throughout the
entire planet or is it just this

1377
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:58,035
- particular region right here?
- Nope.

1378
01:19:58,059 --> 01:19:59,889
We expect the whole world.

1379
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:04,359
We expect bits of India we
expect in the U.S., Oklahoma.

1380
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,969
You know the dust bowl region,
we expect that to get

1381
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:10,239
much, much drier over the
next few decades.

1382
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:13,969
Oh my God, and
what about my home state

1383
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,309
of California here?

1384
01:20:15,339 --> 01:20:17,979
Um, not looking
great, I'm afraid.

1385
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:22,149
Now predicted persistent drought
in the dust bowl, and here,

1386
01:20:22,179 --> 01:20:24,349
for fifty years from now.

1387
01:20:24,389 --> 01:20:27,619
But we're just seeing the
worst drought in 900 years

1388
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:29,019
here right now.

1389
01:20:29,059 --> 01:20:30,135
So it's coming a bit
earlier than we thought.

1390
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,329
We're talking about this
happening over a period

1391
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:33,959
of a few decades.

1392
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:36,099
It's just
consistent not great news.

1393
01:20:36,129 --> 01:20:37,559
No.

1394
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,469
But a lot of people now kinda
confused about the issue.

1395
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:42,339
You know, the facts
are crystal clear.

1396
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:45,309
The ice is melting,
the earth is warming,

1397
01:20:45,339 --> 01:20:46,709
the sea level is rising.

1398
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:48,409
Those are facts.

1399
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:51,149
Rather than feeling, oh my
God it's hopeless, say, okay,

1400
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,409
this is the problem.

1401
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:53,679
Let's be realistic.

1402
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,949
Let's find a way out of it.

1403
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,619
And there are ways out of it.

1404
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:01,459
You know, if we stopped
burning fossil fuel right now,

1405
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,435
the planet would still keep
warming for a little while

1406
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:05,689
before cooling off again.

1407
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:09,399
So you're saying
that if we do the right thing,

1408
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:11,499
we're gonna heat
up, or we're gonna.

1409
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:14,539
It'll turn off,
then it'll start cooling again.

1410
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,269
Would that Arctic ice
sheet start to then increase

1411
01:21:17,309 --> 01:21:18,439
again?

1412
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:20,969
Once the cooling started, yeah.

1413
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:24,079
So there really is
a possibility to repair

1414
01:21:24,109 --> 01:21:25,909
- this trajectory that we're on?
- Absolutely.

1415
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:28,919
- Interesting.
- Yeah. So there's hope.

1416
01:21:28,949 --> 01:21:31,519
You seem to have an
incredibly positive attitude,

1417
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:33,919
just about everything though.
It's amazing.

1418
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:37,089
Yeah, I, I do, I'm
actually basically an optimistic

1419
01:21:37,129 --> 01:21:38,189
kind of person.

1420
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:40,029
I have faith in people.

1421
01:21:40,059 --> 01:21:42,029
I, I really do have
faith in people.

1422
01:21:42,059 --> 01:21:45,499
And I think that once people
come out of the fog of confusion

1423
01:21:45,529 --> 01:21:47,699
or an issue, or initial
uncertainty on an issue,

1424
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:52,409
and realistically appreciate
it at some level, the threat,

1425
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:56,609
and they're informed of what the
best action is to deal with it,

1426
01:21:56,649 --> 01:21:58,449
they got on and did it.

1427
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:01,219
And what seemed like almost
impossible to deal with,

1428
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,619
you know, became possible.

1429
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:17,159
I still think a lot
about that picture that used

1430
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,269
to hang over above my crib.

1431
01:22:20,299 --> 01:22:23,439
The story of The Garden of
Earthly Delights actually begins

1432
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:25,569
on the outside of the painting,

1433
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:29,279
where. Bosch painted a view
of our Earth on the third day

1434
01:22:29,309 --> 01:22:31,379
of creation.

1435
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:34,109
It's almost as if he wanted to
show the fragility of our

1436
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:38,589
planet by depicting the earth
and its atmosphere enclosed

1437
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:39,689
in glass.

1438
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,609
Pope Francis
has officially released

1439
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,109
his encyclical on the
environment.

1440
01:23:01,139 --> 01:23:04,179
The document is both a call
for immediate action to stop

1441
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:07,149
global warming, and a
cry for justice for the poor.

1442
01:23:10,249 --> 01:23:15,219
Our common home has
fallen into serious disrepair.

1443
01:23:15,259 --> 01:23:19,629
Hope would have us recognize
that there is always a way out.

1444
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:23,259
That we can always
redirect our steps,

1445
01:23:23,299 --> 01:23:29,039
that we can always do something
to solve our problems.

1446
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:33,139
Still, we can see signs that
things are now reaching

1447
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,039
a breaking point.

1448
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:43,049
This is a direct message from
the pope, it's a huge deal.

1449
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:49,919
One of the most important
spiritual leader's

1450
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:51,689
on the planet.

1451
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,029
DiCaprio.

1452
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:56,159
He has now called upon
the world community to accept

1453
01:23:56,199 --> 01:24:00,269
the modern science
of climate change.

1454
01:24:00,299 --> 01:24:02,939
A pope has never done anything
like this in history.

1455
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:21,049
Being able to spend
time and sit with the pope

1456
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:24,019
was a pretty
profound experience.

1457
01:24:25,289 --> 01:24:30,999
This is a book,
Hieronymus Bosch's.

1458
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,999
Uh, it was hanging above
my crib, as a young boy.

1459
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:41,209
Thank you.

1460
01:24:44,649 --> 01:24:48,049
There was definitely an
urgency in his voice.

1461
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:53,589
He said that as far as the Paris
conference is concerned, he,

1462
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:55,589
he felt was a step in
the right direction,

1463
01:24:55,619 --> 01:24:58,229
but certainly not enough.

1464
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:01,129
He feels we all need to keep
speaking out about this issue

1465
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:05,669
as loud as we can, and that we
must immediately take action.

1466
01:25:07,839 --> 01:25:11,839
But more than anything, he said
to pray for the human race.

1467
01:25:22,849 --> 01:25:25,719
After everything I've seen,
it's become pretty obvious

1468
01:25:25,749 --> 01:25:27,619
that we're no longer
living in that first,

1469
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:30,759
unspoiled depiction of Eden.

1470
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:33,559
We're in that second panel.

1471
01:25:33,599 --> 01:25:37,299
What Bosch called, Human
Kind Before the Flood.

1472
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:52,249
And what haunts me the
most is that last panel.

1473
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:55,679
The one with the charred,
blackened skies.

1474
01:25:55,719 --> 01:26:01,049
A planet that we collectively
have left to ruin.

1475
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:06,189
The question is, can we
change our course in time?

1476
01:26:10,969 --> 01:26:14,599
Now if this was a movie we could
write the ending of this script,

1477
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:19,239
and we could figure a
way out of this mess.

1478
01:26:19,269 --> 01:26:22,739
But real life doesn't
work like that,

1479
01:26:22,779 --> 01:26:27,279
and we can't pretend that we
know how this is gonna end.

1480
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:32,819
The only thing that we can do
is control what we do next,

1481
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:40,859
how we live our lives, what we
consume, how we get involved,

1482
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:45,929
and how we use our vote to
tell our leaders that we know

1483
01:26:45,969 --> 01:26:50,139
the truth about climate change.

1484
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:54,809
The last speaker for
this signing ceremony is

1485
01:26:54,839 --> 01:26:57,109
the Academy Award Best Actor,

1486
01:26:57,149 --> 01:27:02,019
and the United Nations Messenger
of Peace, Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio.

1487
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:10,219
Thank you Mr.
Secretary General for

1488
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:13,759
the honor to address this body,
and thanks to the distinguished

1489
01:27:13,799 --> 01:27:16,729
climate leaders assembled
here today who are ready

1490
01:27:16,769 --> 01:27:19,199
to take action.

1491
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:22,999
As a U.N. Messenger of Peace I
have traveled all over the world

1492
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:27,109
for the last two years, I have
seen cities like Beijing choked

1493
01:27:27,139 --> 01:27:31,239
by industrial pollution, ancient
boreal forests in Canada

1494
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,149
that have been clear cut, and
rainforests in Indonesia

1495
01:27:34,179 --> 01:27:35,979
that have been incinerated.

1496
01:27:36,019 --> 01:27:38,289
In India I met farmers whose
crops have been literally

1497
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,119
washed away.

1498
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,295
In America I've witnessed sea
level rise flooding the streets

1499
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:43,989
of Miami.

1500
01:27:44,029 --> 01:27:47,029
In Greenland and in the Arctic
I was astonished to see

1501
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:50,129
that ancient glaciers are
rapidly disappearing,

1502
01:27:50,169 --> 01:27:52,899
well ahead of
scientific predictions.

1503
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:56,899
All that I have seen and learned
on my journey has absolutely

1504
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,669
terrified me.

1505
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:01,085
Now think about the shame that
each of us will carry when our

1506
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:04,209
children and grandchildren look
back and realize that we had

1507
01:28:04,249 --> 01:28:07,679
the means of stopping this
devastation but simply lacked

1508
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:10,249
the political will to do so.

1509
01:28:10,289 --> 01:28:13,819
Yes, we have achieved
the Paris Agreement.

1510
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:15,989
More countries have come
together here to sign

1511
01:28:16,019 --> 01:28:19,589
this agreement today than for
any other cause in the history

1512
01:28:19,629 --> 01:28:23,299
of humankind, and that
is reason for hope.

1513
01:28:23,329 --> 01:28:26,099
But unfortunately the evidence
shows us that it will not

1514
01:28:26,129 --> 01:28:27,599
be enough.

1515
01:28:27,639 --> 01:28:30,739
A massive change is
required right now.

1516
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:33,909
One that leads to a new
collective consciousness.

1517
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:37,009
A new collective evolution
of the human race,

1518
01:28:37,049 --> 01:28:41,249
inspired and enabled by a sense
of urgency from all of you.

1519
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,049
We can congratulate
each other today,

1520
01:28:44,089 --> 01:28:46,319
but it will mean absolutely
nothing if you return

1521
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:50,089
to your countries and fail
to push beyond the promises

1522
01:28:50,129 --> 01:28:52,259
of this historic agreement.

1523
01:28:52,289 --> 01:28:55,299
After 21 years of
debates and conferences,

1524
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:59,299
it is time to declare no
more talk, no more excuses,

1525
01:28:59,329 --> 01:29:02,939
no more ten-year studies, no
more allowing the fossil fuel

1526
01:29:02,969 --> 01:29:06,709
companies to manipulate and
dictate the science and policies

1527
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:08,679
that affect our future.

1528
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:11,079
The world is now watching.

1529
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:14,249
You'll either be lauded
by future generations,

1530
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:16,019
or vilified by them.

1531
01:29:16,049 --> 01:29:20,049
You are the last
best hope of Earth.

1532
01:29:20,089 --> 01:29:22,159
We ask you to protect it,

1533
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:26,959
or we, and all living things
we cherish, are history.

1534
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:39,669
¶ We wait ¶

1535
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:47,709
¶ We pray for the rain ¶

1536
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:51,889
¶ For the rain ¶

1537
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:55,919
¶ For a rain ¶

1538
01:29:55,959 --> 01:29:58,659

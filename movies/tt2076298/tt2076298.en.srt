<i>San Francisco International
Karate Tournament 1964.</i>

3
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,168
Let's welcome Mr. Bruce Lee

4
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:36,331
from Jan Fan Jung Fu Studio.

5
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:18,258
<i>Hong Kong, one month ago.</i>

6
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,151
Mr. Ip,

7
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,477
your tumor is malignant.
You have head and neck cancer.

8
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:34,862
Even though it is still at early stage,
the cancer cells are spreading too fast

9
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,574
to be controlled by standard medication.

10
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:40,647
Nowadays, hospitals offer chemotherapy.

11
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,654
It can control cancer cells.

12
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,707
You should think about it.

13
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:49,094
First thing first, quit smoking.

14
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:51,743
Don't smoke anymore.

15
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:37,134
Turn your stance more.
Rotate your torso. Go.

16
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,014
Exactly.

17
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,839
Fifty times.

18
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:52,144
No. C'mon, man, that's not right.

19
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,825
- What are you doing?
- Chill. Chill. Relax.

20
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,989
I'm just trying to share my thoughts.

21
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,176
Anybody knows what he's saying?

22
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:01,386
No.

23
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:06,143
- No more shows for you.
- Relax. We're Kung Fu Brothers.

24
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:09,419
- Just listen to me. Calm down, man. Easy.
- I don't understand what you're saying.

25
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,850
- Just listen to me!
- Are you nuts?

26
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,391
Want me to beat you up instead?

27
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:17,034
- Get lost! I am asking you to leave.
- Don't push me! I said don't push me!

28
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:18,809
Here to challenge us?

29
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:20,203
Okay.

30
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:40,839
Sifu.

31
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:43,530
Grandmaster. Yes!

32
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,743
I'm so happy to see you!

33
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,748
I'm a student of Bruce Lee.
My name is Billy.

34
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,995
I have something for you.

35
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,488
Sifu wants you to come
to the Karate Tournament in the US

36
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:00,229
which takes place next month.

37
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,796
Here, this is a plane ticket
for you he prepared.

38
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,949
And this book, he wrote it.
He wants you to have it.

39
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:09,864
Bruce.

40
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,320
- He is good?
- He's doing fine.

41
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:15,241
He has a Kung Fu school in Seattle.

42
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:17,898
And I'm from his newly opened one
in San Francisco.

43
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,217
Billy,

44
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:26,093
tell Bruce

45
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,866
maybe I have no time.

46
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,763
Thank you.

47
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:36,101
Thank you.

48
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:58,365
Give this to Sifu.

49
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,520
Give me back my comic book!

50
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:13,428
Please go stop him!

51
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,075
Mr. Ip,

52
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,974
we have to expel Ip Jin.

53
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,837
We can't keep Jin in our school anymore.

54
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,258
Headmaster,

55
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,559
please give Jin one more chance.

56
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:35,943
I promise, he will behave.

57
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:39,793
Please give him another chance.
Let him stay.

58
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,213
It's not his first time
getting into a fight.

59
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,194
Last time was already his last chance.

60
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,916
Since he is so sportive,

61
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,191
studying abroad may be
a better option for him.

62
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,472
It's not serious. Just some minor cuts.

63
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:01,459
Be careful next time though.

64
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:03,261
Thank you, doctor.

65
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,605
The nurse will patch you up.

66
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:09,933
- Where is your family?
- Doctor.

67
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:11,843
Master Ip!

68
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,905
It's been a while.

69
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,743
I am Ming, the son of Auntie Liu.

70
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:19,358
Your Kung Fu Studio
used to be on our rooftop.

71
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:23,787
<i>Mum sent me to study in America,
as I was an enfant terrible.</i>

72
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,584
I just got back.
Now working in this hospital.

73
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:30,041
It's really something
to be on your own abroad.

74
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:31,420
Not really.

75
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,763
Master Ip, Jin is fine. Don't worry.

76
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,983
- See you later.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,197
Answer the door, Jin.

78
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:29,677
- Master Ip.
- Bob! Please come in.

79
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,381
What's the matter?

80
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:35,095
America is so far away.
What's the rush?

81
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:39,768
I am going to San Francisco
to find a school for Jin.

82
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:40,540
Good idea.

83
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,987
Uncle Ba also sent his son there recently.

84
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:45,577
Getting an overseas qualification
helps making a better living.

85
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,267
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

86
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,897
- Have some tea.
- Oh, don't bother.

87
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,330
Jin.

88
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:58,061
- Greet your uncle.
- He did, he nodded.

89
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,291
- Have some tea.
- Thank you.

90
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:02,270
Bob.

91
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:07,327
Can you please come check on Jin
while I'm away?

92
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,251
Not a problem.

93
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,974
When I'm in America. I will phone home
at exactly 10 p.m. HK time everyday.

94
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:14,911
Okay.

95
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,482
You don't need to call.
I won't take it.

96
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:20,268
Don't worry.

97
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,432
I will be here on time to make him answer.

98
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,101
Right, don't be too soft on your son.
You're spoiling him.

99
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,991
Nah, I have to.

100
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:31,716
I want to send him abroad,
so that he'd have a chance to experience

101
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,090
- to be independent.
- Right.

102
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:36,260
I won't go.

103
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,700
If you want to go,
go by yourself.

104
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,700
If you've got something to say,
just come out and say it.

105
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:48,477
There's no way I'm going to America.
You can't make me.

106
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:51,922
I have told you so many times
I really don't like studying.

107
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:53,554
I'm not cut out for it anyway.

108
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,337
What can you do if you don't study?

109
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:58,145
I can teach martial arts. I like Kung Fu.

110
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,260
Who will let you teach martial arts?

111
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,494
Why can't I? Aren't you
doing it yourself?

112
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:07,046
Why don't you tell your students it's
useless to learn martial arts? - Enough.

113
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,474
If nobody learned martial arts,
you'd be starving already.

114
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:12,661
You don't practice what you preach.
You always blame me for everything.

115
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,836
Someone took my comic book,
it's my fault.

116
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,298
He failed, it's also my fault.

117
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,562
I want to teach martial arts
like you do, again, it's my fault.

118
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,729
- Enough already.
- You are always right. I am always wrong.

119
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:24,450
You are never supportive of me.
If mum was still alive, she would have--

120
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:28,821
Don't! Get out! Get out, now!

121
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,541
He's still a kid, be patient.

122
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,351
Don't be so upset.

123
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:47,849
Bob,

124
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,649
so, I'll leave it to you, thank you.
Come. Please sit down.

125
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,595
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
we are approaching San Francisco Airport</i>

126
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,056
<i>where the local time is 11:15 a.m.</i>

127
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:39,622
Man!

128
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,483
- Man. It's been many years.
- Yes.

129
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,911
You must be exhausted
from your long flight. - I'm all right.

130
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,899
My car is outside. Let's go.
Let me carry this.

131
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:49,607
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

132
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,476
It's been years since we last met.

133
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,478
That's about right.

134
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:04,973
Hey, Gun.

135
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:07,050
Why did you move to America?

136
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,303
It wasn't my plan.

137
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,634
My newspaper sent me
to work on the NA edition.

138
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,626
There are more Chinese residents here now.
Many folks send their kids here to school.

139
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:16,990
It's the right time for Jin to come.

140
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:19,290
Regarding the recommendation letter
for school admission.

141
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,603
Has the Chinese Benevolent Association
prepared it? - I contacted them.

142
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:25,188
Chairman Wan said he would like
to meet you in person first.

143
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,211
Once we arrive to Chinatown,
we'll head to the CBA.

144
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,623
Has Chairman Wan been here for long?

145
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,023
His family has been here for generations.

146
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,223
His grandfather came to the States
during the Gold Rush.

147
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,843
He really cares for the compatriots.

148
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:18,223
Let's go.

149
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:25,452
Uncle Gwai.

150
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,175
- Hello, Uncle Gwai.
- Hello, Mr. Leung.

151
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:29,930
Let me to introduce, this is Master Ip.

152
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,626
- Hello, Uncle Gwai.
- Pleasure to meet you.

153
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:32,825
Has Chairman Wan arrived?

154
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:34,469
- Master Ip.
- He's here.

155
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,753
- Master Law.
- It's been ages. It's really me.

156
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:39,490
When did you come here?

157
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:41,892
I've moved here with family
for a few years already.

158
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:45,099
So, are you visiting to prepare
for moving home too?

159
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,251
Master Law, Man is not going
to move here. Shall we sit and talk?

160
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,344
Great. After you.

161
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:56,102
Masters, please allow me introduce,
this is Master Ip Man.

162
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,998
Hello, fellow masters.

163
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:08,126
- Sit down first.
- Take a seat.

164
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,232
Let me introduce everyone.

165
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,140
They are all Kung Fu masters
from Chinatown.

166
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:19,580
Master Lau of Choy Li Fut.

167
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,774
Master Chen of Eagle Claw.

168
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,536
Master Han of White Crane.

169
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,849
Master Chiu of Seven-Star Mantis.

170
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,797
Master Chiang of Xing Yi.

171
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,374
Master Lui of Eight Trigrams Palm.

172
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,719
Master Tam of Tam's Kickfight.

173
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,267
As for me, let's spare the introduction.

174
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:39,640
We are old friends.

175
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,642
Last, but not least, Chairman
of the Chinese Benevolent Association

176
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,937
Master Wan of Tai Chi.

177
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:54,689
Chairman Wan, thank you
so much for your help--

178
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,640
Master Ip, don't thank me just yet.

179
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:00,728
I've heard so much about you.

180
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:04,220
You are here at just the right time.

181
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:07,046
I'd like to ask Master Ip a favor.

182
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,171
How can I help?

183
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:15,137
Here in San Francisco's Chinatown
there's a long established rule,

184
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:19,141
Kung Fu studios should only accept
Chinese students.

185
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:23,623
Your apprentice, Bruce Lee,
not only does he break the rule,

186
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,435
he even published a book

187
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:31,067
to explain Chinese martial arts
in English.

188
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:44,714
Since Master Ip is here, why don't you
give us a hand to resolve this issue first.

189
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:51,544
Does he think he can be the spokesperson
of Chinese martial arts?

190
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:56,394
Your apprentice is too arrogant.

191
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:58,750
Not only that.

192
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,329
He is going to attend
the Karate tournament.

193
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:03,834
He is provoking us.

194
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:07,112
- He is clearly provoking us.
- Exactly.

195
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,406
I have read this book.

196
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,261
It's well-written.

197
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,610
What's wrong with teaching non-Chinese?

198
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:24,866
Master Ip.

199
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,947
Have you heard of the story
of Mr. Dong Guo?

200
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,239
A wolf was sieged by a hunter.

201
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,250
Mr. Dong Guo saw this.
He saved the wolf

202
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:38,692
and put the wolf into his bag.

203
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,878
When the hunter was gone,
the first thing the wolf did

204
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:47,245
was to eat Mr. Dong Guo alive.

205
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:50,800
Animals are animals.
They won't be grateful.

206
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:56,500
I will use one of your Cantonese slangs:

207
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,471
"You offer them rice, they toss it out."

208
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:04,979
That's a bit dramatic.

209
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,327
Master Ip.

210
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,610
Stranger in the strange land.

211
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:17,366
You don't live here.
You won't understand.

212
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:19,333
How about that?

213
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,322
Take a sip of this tea,

214
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,927
and you are one of us.

215
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:28,131
The letter. I'll write it.

216
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,755
Fellow masters,

217
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:49,388
Chairman Wan,

218
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,525
you misunderstood Bruce.

219
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:56,581
In fact, Bruce just wants Chinese
martial arts to have a wider following.

220
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,361
I think it's a wonderful thing.

221
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,490
Marching to a different beat
to make a name for himself.

222
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:07,686
Like student, like master.

223
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,804
To be an exemplar of martial arts,

224
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:12,809
have you two got what it takes?

225
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:41,896
It's going to break.

226
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,388
Man, let's forget it, shall we?

227
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:56,527
Sorry to bother.

228
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:59,168
Excuse me.

229
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,653
Excuse me, everyone.
Chairman Wan, excuse me.

230
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,177
- Thank you.
- Man,

231
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:27,265
I am sorry about what happened.
I didn't expect this.

232
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,929
It's not your fault.

233
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,521
Gun,

234
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:33,927
to meet the school principal,
is the recommendation letter essential?

235
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:35,715
Yes.

236
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,922
After all we are immigrants.

237
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,278
Schools here,

238
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,572
they only acknowledge reputable people.

239
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,356
Recommendation is a must.

240
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,562
Don't worry, I have some American friends.

241
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,828
They should be willing
to help with the letter.

242
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,685
- Okay.
- I won't keep you, take a rest.

243
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,446
Let me walk you out.

244
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,601
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Man.

245
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,018
Thank you for your help.

246
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,760
<i>Operator, where would you like to call?</i>

247
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:19,142
Hong Kong.

248
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,119
<i>Okay, one moment.</i>

249
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,215
Master Ip! It's me, Bob.

250
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,254
I can hear you, Bob. Loud and clear.

251
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,387
Really?

252
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:38,366
How are things over there?
I heard the air is fresher there.

253
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,720
Right. Is Jin there?

254
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,847
Can you put him on the phone?

255
00:20:43,018 --> 00:20:44,968
Jin! Come take the call.

256
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:53,188
Hurry up. Long distance call costs a lot.

257
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,097
He won't answer.

258
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,247
That's how they are.
Defiance is the trademark of youth.

259
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,435
Listen, it's important.

260
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,545
My wife heard that there are some meds

261
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,940
that are only sold in America
but not in Hong Kong.

262
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,867
- Can you help me get some just in case?
- No problem.

263
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:17,222
Please write them down. It's in English.
I will spell it out slowly.

264
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,186
The first one is...

265
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,035
Dad.

266
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:33,054
Why are you late again?

267
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:35,979
I am exhausted today.
Just finished all the assignments.

268
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:37,721
Took a nap before I came.

269
00:21:39,157 --> 00:21:41,056
You are not exhausted
when you are cheerleading.

270
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,308
Only when you are practicing martial arts.

271
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,537
You don't get tired of what you like.

272
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:49,130
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

273
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,472
Come.

274
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,407
"Brush knees and twist steps."

275
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,673
"Part the horse's mane."

276
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:08,714
Sink the shoulders.

277
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,028
Drop the elbows.

278
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:11,486
Round form.

279
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,081
See how terrible your moves are.

280
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:17,853
Look at yourself.

281
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,800
How can you join the Mid-Autumn Carnival?

282
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,365
How can you go on stage?

283
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,898
God, this is so tedious.

284
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,311
How many times have I told you?

285
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,309
Here at home speak Chinese.

286
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,169
Hi, Mr. Wright. How are you?

287
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,490
I thought I was gonna be speaking
with your boss.

288
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:47,320
Actually, it's not my boss who sent me.

289
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,038
I have something
perhaps you can help me with.

290
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,233
Okay. What can I do for you?

291
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:55,225
This is my friend Ip Man.

292
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:56,816
How do you do?

293
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:00,235
He is looking for a school
for his son to attend in America.

294
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:05,083
So, maybe you can help him
by writing a recommendation letter?

295
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,852
Can I have a minute with you please?

296
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,681
Mr. Leung,

297
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:16,541
nowadays many people
fancy coming over here

298
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:18,220
to try to find a better life.

299
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:20,944
Your luck is your ability,

300
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:24,395
and you achieved because your choose
to work with a great boss.

301
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,923
But your friend here...

302
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:27,767
He's a Chinese Kung Fu Master.

303
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,870
Look.

304
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:31,543
I don't really know you that well.

305
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:33,686
I certainly don't know him.

306
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:36,869
How do I know that he isn't
some kind of fugitive?

307
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:38,821
Just like all of the other
illegal aliens

308
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:41,516
that get deported
every day from Chinatown.

309
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,277
I think you're being biased.

310
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:46,185
Not all Chinese are criminals, Mr. Wright.

311
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:48,279
Listen, Sonny,

312
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:51,677
the only reason that you're standing here
on my property

313
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,927
wasting my valuable time
is because of your boss.

314
00:23:56,133 --> 00:24:00,289
I'm only doing this for the sake
of my friend, not you. You understand?

315
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:08,108
Man, I am sorry.

316
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:09,822
Don't worry.

317
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,447
We'll find a way.

318
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,363
Great stuff, man. Really good.

319
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,701
I loved that swing kick. That's crazy.

320
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,617
This match is fixed.
Just a Gook dance.

321
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,423
Phonies.

322
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:54,721
Enjoy.

323
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,076
Congratulations, Bruce.

324
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,603
Your performance tonight was fantastic.

325
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:00,828
Thank you, Sifu.

326
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:03,145
Thanks for inviting me to America.

327
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:04,904
You are welcome.

328
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:07,976
Actually, I am here in America

329
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:10,611
to find a school for Jin.

330
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:12,621
You know,

331
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,245
recommendation letter is required
for school application.

332
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:17,241
So,

333
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:21,160
do you mean those folks from the CBA
refused to write you a letter?

334
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:24,443
I have a student. He is a lawyer.

335
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:26,049
He should be able to help.

336
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,646
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

337
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,555
Sifu.

338
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:31,825
Over here.

339
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:33,216
They're my students.

340
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,323
- Grandmaster Sifu.
- Hartman, come and sit.

341
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,407
- Hello.
- It's amazing.

342
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:39,968
Sifu.

343
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,554
This is Hartman. He's one of a kind.

344
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,918
A Marine Staff Sergeant,

345
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:46,992
very into Chinese martial arts.

346
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:50,837
And he wishes to introduce
Chinese martial arts to the Marines.

347
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:54,455
In America, most people don't know
about Chinese martial arts.

348
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,402
I have practiced Wing Chun for a while.

349
00:26:56,537 --> 00:27:00,227
Its centerline theory for both attack
and defense is useful for combat.

350
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:03,343
I'd recommend it to my officer.
What do you think, grandmaster?

351
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:04,894
Great idea.

352
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,473
Kung Fu man,

353
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:12,078
I saw you at the tournament tonight.
I think your staff is bullshit.

354
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:13,944
I don't buy it.

355
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:17,764
- What's up, man?
- You wanna try it?

356
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,616
Hartman, let's take it outside.

357
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:24,456
I'll kick your ass, man.
I'll kick your ass, too.

358
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:28,090
I'll take you outside.

359
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,911
Sifu, it happens all the time.
I'll be right back.

360
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:16,543
You!

361
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:38,886
The door won't fight back. But I will.

362
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,545
Sifu, here's the recommendation
prepared by my student,

363
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:08,218
it should be okay.

364
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,051
How do you do?

365
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,462
- Hi, how are you today?
- I am very good.

366
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:23,455
I have an appointment with the Principal.

367
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:27,222
- Mr. Ip Man, right?
- Yes.

368
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,861
Do you have all of the required documents?

369
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:32,639
- Yes.
- Okay, follow me please.

370
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:40,677
Is everybody okay?

371
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:43,646
If anybody needs any help
just let me know.

372
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,436
- Mr. Spencer.
- You sir, fire away.

373
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:49,717
The principal is very busy today.
She's in a meeting.

374
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,397
So, would you mind waiting?

375
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:53,657
- Yes, no problem.
- Okay.

376
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:02,179
One, two, three, four,

377
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,286
five, six, seven, eight...

378
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:41,038
Good job, girls.

379
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:47,345
Okay. The contest is over.
I have made my decision.

380
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:52,491
Yonah, you will be the new cheerleader
for away games starting this mid-semester.

381
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:53,740
Well-done.

382
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:55,883
She doesn't deserve it.

383
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:00,107
She changed the routine all on her own.

384
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:02,088
She cheated.

385
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,481
She should be disqualified.

386
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:07,769
Okay, I don't remember saying
that improvisation wasn't allowed.

387
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,515
Since I haven't finalized the routine,
anyone's input is welcomed.

388
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:16,811
Yonah, her move was amazing.
And so is she.

389
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:21,094
We all have the same goals.
Why don't we try to work together.

390
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,091
Well done. Class dismissed.

391
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:39,579
- Mr. Ip, I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
- No problem.

392
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:42,330
I was stuck in a very important meeting.

393
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:44,292
Come, please.

394
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:49,892
This lawyer who wrote the letter,
is he your lawyer?

395
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:52,970
Actually, he is my student's student.

396
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,402
So, you're a teacher, too?

397
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:57,456
I am a teacher.

398
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,057
I teach Chinese Kung Fu.

399
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:02,051
Chinese martial arts.

400
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,415
Like a gymnast?

401
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:06,301
Yes, something like that.

402
00:35:06,494 --> 00:35:09,076
Well, as you already know,

403
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:12,512
this is an exclusive private school.

404
00:35:13,336 --> 00:35:17,335
I can accept this letter as a referral,

405
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:22,722
but you still need to get a recommendation
from the Chinese Benevolent Association.

406
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:28,108
As they act as guarantors
for late school payment.

407
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:30,800
- However...
- I understand.

408
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:35,473
If you can donate ten thousand dollars
to our school

409
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,595
to be one of our sponsoring
board of directors.

410
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:44,347
We can waive the recommendation letter
and accept your son right away.

411
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:58,735
Speak of the devil.

412
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:01,595
Bitch!

413
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,597
Showtime.

414
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:09,367
You think you looked so great out there?

415
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:12,139
You looked like a little yellow monkey.

416
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:13,933
We're not gonna follow your lead.

417
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:17,870
In America, people like you follow,
they don't lead.

418
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,888
What do you want?
Just leave me alone!

419
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:23,108
If you're not happy,
then go back to Asia.

420
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:26,116
This has been our land for generations.

421
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,829
What do you people want from us?

422
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:31,928
Now I know why they call you
stupid blonde.

423
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,168
America has always had immigrants.

424
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:36,738
The Indians are the only real Americans.

425
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:40,852
Your ancestors stole their land. Paleface.

426
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:44,213
What did you just say to me?

427
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,096
She's the one.

428
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:06,910
Grab her.

429
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:22,300
I dare you to stay at the cheerleading!

430
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,891
You've got a long hair.
You think you can be me?

431
00:37:28,065 --> 00:37:30,166
You can never be me!

432
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:42,569
Come back here!

433
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:48,329
Come back here! Where are you going?

434
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:49,922
Get here, man.

435
00:37:57,826 --> 00:38:01,706
I'm gonna cut all of your hair,
since you've got lice anyway.

436
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,085
Get her!

437
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:26,104
Close the door.

438
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,068
Stay out of this, old man.

439
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,064
You want some, too?

440
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,423
Stop. No.

441
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:58,810
No.

442
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:07,143
No! No more. I'm sorry.

443
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,697
Let's get out of here.

444
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,638
I am Yonah, what's your name, uncle?

445
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:22,774
Call me Uncle Ip.

446
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:29,607
Uncle Ip, can you hold this for me?

447
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:42,779
Uncle Ip, please take a look from behind.

448
00:39:42,957 --> 00:39:45,929
Please help me cut it even
if it's not neat.

449
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,592
- Done.
- Thank you.

450
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:07,483
Uncle Ip, are you okay?
You got slammed by the gate.

451
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:09,525
- I am okay.
- Let me take a look.

452
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,503
I am really fine.

453
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:15,725
I've got herbal tonic at home.
Works like magic.

454
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:18,286
So, what went on at school today?

455
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:20,194
Does it happen often?

456
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:23,118
It's not the first time.
I'm not afraid of them.

457
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:26,507
- Does your family know?
- Yes.

458
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:28,958
My dad always asks me to put up with it.

459
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,477
He is very strict.

460
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,844
Uncle Ip, why were you in our school?

461
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,315
I was there to apply for my son.

462
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:39,058
Then, you must have met my dad.
He is the Chairman of CBA.

463
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,931
I've met your dad.

464
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,010
He must have given you the letter then.

465
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,649
Uncle Ip, when will your son come?

466
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,267
He will have a hard time getting used
to life here. I can help out.

467
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,499
Your father didn't actually help
with the letter.

468
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:55,610
How come? You are not a foreigner.

469
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,319
Your father has an opinion against them?

470
00:40:58,474 --> 00:41:02,838
Yes. Dad always says
that they are very bad to Chinese.

471
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,737
They only discriminate and bully us.

472
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,592
It's always been like that
since he came here with grandpa as a kid.

473
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,569
The way Chinese are treated here
has always been unfair.

474
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:15,479
That's why he founded the CBA,
to protect us Chinese.

475
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,100
Sweetheart?

476
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:24,858
What happened?

477
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:29,580
Oh my God! What happened?

478
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:32,793
This Chinese girl.

479
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,030
I need you to come home right now!

480
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,733
Becky's been attacked.

481
00:41:39,818 --> 00:41:42,092
I wish you weren't away
on this business trip.

482
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,738
We need you here.

483
00:41:45,392 --> 00:41:47,194
Come home now, okay?

484
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:05,258
Dad.

485
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,954
This is my friend, Uncle Ip.

486
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:10,702
You always say Chinese
should help each other out.

487
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,424
So, please write him
a recommendation letter.

488
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:25,137
Come over here.

489
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:33,826
Did you get into a fight again?

490
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,082
- No.
- Yonah.

491
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:40,779
You know dad hates liars.

492
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:43,800
I am asking you one more time.

493
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:45,716
Did you get into a fight?

494
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,501
No.

495
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,135
They were jealous of me!
Just because I was made the cheerleader.

496
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:53,334
They cut my hair
and had people beat me up.

497
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,695
Tolerate it? How?

498
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:57,924
What's the point of practicing martial arts
if you want me to put up with this?

499
00:42:58,073 --> 00:42:59,969
- Shut your mouth!
- Chairman Wan.

500
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:04,221
Your daughter was bullied.
It's not wrong to defend herself.

501
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:11,604
Master Ip, as I've told you before,

502
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:16,780
you have no clue
as you don't live here.

503
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:19,039
Let me tell you.

504
00:43:20,328 --> 00:43:22,182
We live here.

505
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,781
This is our home.

506
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:29,870
Those whities keep trying
to get rid of us.

507
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,531
They even want to get rid of Chinatown.

508
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:34,720
Don't you understand?

509
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:38,467
Have you tried to get out of Chinatown
to communicate with them directly?

510
00:43:38,622 --> 00:43:40,399
To fight for a change?

511
00:43:45,887 --> 00:43:47,701
You are preaching me now?

512
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:52,889
Yonah,

513
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:55,419
you can change.

514
00:44:00,573 --> 00:44:02,391
Ip Man.

515
00:44:05,493 --> 00:44:08,535
If you want your letter
don't use my daughter.

516
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,348
Show me who you are.

517
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,608
Let's have a match.

518
00:45:33,922 --> 00:45:36,396
What happened? Old wound?

519
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,440
Yonah!

520
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,378
- Are you all right?
- Dad, I am fine.

521
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:40,976
Yonah.

522
00:47:42,201 --> 00:47:43,251
Yonah!

523
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:45,663
Dad.

524
00:47:47,102 --> 00:47:48,459
I am here.

525
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,283
I am fine.

526
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,089
Ip Man.

527
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:07,356
Looks like we'll have to wait
till the Mid-Autumn Carnival

528
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,447
to decide who's the winner.

529
00:48:12,288 --> 00:48:15,890
Winning or losing,
does it really matter?

530
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:22,534
Shouldn't we use Chinese martial arts
to change the biases against us?

531
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:31,119
I brought Yonah back
because I wanted to protect her.

532
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:36,724
I'm not here for the letter.

533
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:02,832
You always blame me for everything.

534
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:04,700
You are always right. I am always wrong.

535
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,182
You are never supportive of me.

536
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:08,205
If mum was still alive, she would have--

537
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,756
<i>- US Trunk Line.
- Yes, collect call please.</i>

538
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:39,844
Okay.

539
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:42,874
- Master Ip.
- Bob.

540
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:47,596
- Where's Jin?
- He went out to buy late night snack.

541
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,217
Right, how're you getting on
with your thing? Going well?

542
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:55,706
A bit of hiccups.

543
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:58,715
It might take a few more days
before I can return.

544
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,036
Back in a few days, that's very good.

545
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:04,063
Good luck. Be safe.

546
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,070
Thanks a lot.

547
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,593
- Bye.
- Bye.

548
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:31,406
Left, Right.

549
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:34,117
Left, Right.

550
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,202
Pick up the pace, Devil Dogs!

551
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:55,635
You are warriors!
You are killing machines!

552
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:57,982
Earn it like you got a pair!

553
00:50:58,245 --> 00:50:59,688
Hit that bag, boy!

554
00:50:59,907 --> 00:51:02,079
Wear the E.G.A. with pride!

555
00:51:02,287 --> 00:51:04,768
Get the Banana out of the tailpipe!

556
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:06,670
Move it!

557
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:10,389
You gotta earn it, Devil Dog! Move it!

558
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:15,155
Move!

559
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:24,126
- I surrender, Sensei!
- What did you just say?

560
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:27,853
Did I just hear you say
that you surrender? Did I?

561
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:30,489
You know what our motto is, recruit?

562
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:32,904
Trained to kill, ready to die.

563
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:35,627
Do you understand the meaning
of those words?

564
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:37,252
It's hurting me, Sir.

565
00:51:37,578 --> 00:51:38,919
It's hurting you, is it?

566
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:41,338
Hurting you. You know this is the problem.

567
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:44,060
You know there is a rumor
going around this base.

568
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:46,047
People saying that I'm a racist.

569
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:47,807
I'm not racist.

570
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,450
See I don't hate you
because you are colored,

571
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:53,642
I hate you because you are
a cowardly colored.

572
00:51:55,456 --> 00:51:59,036
- Get off the mat!
- You, Jackson. You're next.

573
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:04,218
Staff Sergeant Hartman,

574
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:10,107
do you mind explaining to me
what exactly this contraption is?

575
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:13,959
It's a Wing Chun dummy.
A Kung Fu training aid.

576
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:17,401
Like a punching bag if you will,
but for Chinese martial arts.

577
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:21,773
Let me ask you something.

578
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:25,721
Did you fall out of your crib this morning
and banged your little head?

579
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:27,746
Where the hell do you think
you are?

580
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:33,242
Does this look like a museum for preserving
your ancient Chinese heritage?

581
00:52:33,982 --> 00:52:38,332
Wing Chun is improvising and adapting
just like Marines.

582
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:42,355
I've been practicing for months now,
and I find it practical for real combat.

583
00:52:42,605 --> 00:52:45,019
I'm certain that practicing it
will be beneficial

584
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,274
- for marines on the battleground.
- Oh, you are certain, are you?

585
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:51,845
So, this Kung Fu bullshit can allow us
to kill our enemies?

586
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:53,489
Is that what you're trying to say?

587
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:57,035
Outstanding, Staff Sergeant!
You're a goddamn genius.

588
00:52:57,203 --> 00:52:59,564
Get this thing off my base now!

589
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,223
You know nothing of Chinese Kung Fu.

590
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,221
Zero!

591
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:14,271
All right, Staff Sergeant Hartman.
I'm gonna allow you to prove those words.

592
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:18,182
If you can defeat Colin
in a fair fight, then, I'll consider

593
00:53:18,356 --> 00:53:21,861
maybe allowing your wooden girlfriend
to stay on the base.

594
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:23,828
Is that understood?

595
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,230
C'mon Colin, smack him up.

596
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:14,129
Outstanding work. Very nice.

597
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:19,417
You see this, men?
Now this is Karate.

598
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:23,193
Your Chinese Kung Fu
is only good for folding laundry.

599
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:27,606
It stays where it belongs
and that is the hell off my base!

600
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:33,184
Now, because of the
Staff Sergeant's stupidity

601
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:36,895
all you Chinese will run
an extra 30 laps today.

602
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:41,775
And the Staff Sergeant himself
will run an extra 30 after that.

603
00:54:42,498 --> 00:54:44,427
Are we clear?

604
00:54:46,156 --> 00:54:47,534
Good.

605
00:54:49,115 --> 00:54:50,558
Carry on.

606
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:58,257
One, two, three, four.

607
00:54:58,864 --> 00:55:00,934
One, two, three, four.

608
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:09,712
Left and right and lei ho.

609
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:34,077
- Uncle Ip, I have great news for you.
- What's up, Yonah?

610
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:57,152
Did you forge the signature?

611
00:55:57,344 --> 00:55:59,852
Don't worry, it looks the same as papa's.

612
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:01,695
I am sure no one would notice.

613
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:05,711
I don't understand what you kids
are thinking nowadays.

614
00:56:05,877 --> 00:56:08,414
You guys act without thinking consequence.

615
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:11,906
What are you doing?
It took me a lot of effort!

616
00:56:19,953 --> 00:56:23,489
Did it cross your mind
that your dad will be very upset.

617
00:56:23,777 --> 00:56:26,194
I don't care, he doesn't care
if I'm happy anyway.

618
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:29,459
Why did you say that?
I think he cares about you.

619
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:30,867
He only cares about himself.

620
00:56:31,036 --> 00:56:34,056
He always pushes me to practice Tai Chi
for performing at the Carnival.

621
00:56:34,251 --> 00:56:36,805
Just because he likes it. But I don't.

622
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:44,523
If you don't like Tai Chi,
just tell him.

623
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,847
I did. He wouldn't listen.

624
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:48,870
In his eyes, everything I do is wrong.

625
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,167
I fought back
when I was bullied - my fault.

626
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:53,557
I like cheerleading
and dancing - my fault.

627
00:56:53,804 --> 00:56:56,228
I am always wrong. He never supports me.

628
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:59,056
I don't believe that's how
other dads are like.

629
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:03,029
At the very least you are not, Uncle Ip.

630
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:22,506
Is cheerleading...

631
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:25,013
your passion?

632
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:31,446
Not really.

633
00:57:31,624 --> 00:57:33,899
I do it because I like it.

634
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:36,131
Uncle Ip, you are so good at fighting.

635
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:38,510
That's because you like martial arts,
right?

636
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:44,027
At the Mid-Autumn Carnival,

637
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,459
why don't you do
your cheerleading dance?

638
00:57:46,677 --> 00:57:50,191
Right, why haven't I thought about that?
That's a great idea.

639
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:52,468
Uncle Ip, you will come, right?

640
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,322
Sure.

641
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,190
Great.

642
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:58,534
Now go to school.

643
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,996
Off you go.

644
00:58:08,304 --> 00:58:09,885
Bye.

645
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:28,214
You finally decided to come back then,
Andrew. Thank you.

646
00:58:28,347 --> 00:58:30,991
I was in Washington, D.C., Gabriela.
I came back as soon as I could.

647
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:32,018
How's Becky?

648
00:58:32,157 --> 00:58:34,397
She was almost disfigured
by a Chinese girl at school.

649
00:58:34,592 --> 00:58:38,030
And I don't understand the grounds
they let a Chinese student in anyway.

650
00:58:38,276 --> 00:58:40,324
What do you intend to do about it?

651
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:43,309
What are the INS going to do
about these Chinese savages?

652
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,529
Get rid of them. Send them home.

653
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:52,737
- Becky, honey, who did this to you?
- Yonah Wan.

654
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:58,581
She's the daughter of the Chairman
of the Chinese Benevolent Association.

655
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,628
- Or so she claims.
- Chinatown.

656
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:06,741
I'll handle this.

657
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,674
Really impressive.

658
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,262
- So, this is Chinese Kung Fu?
- Yes, Sir.

659
00:59:28,442 --> 00:59:30,639
It's really amazing.
I mean really amazing.

660
00:59:30,783 --> 00:59:32,054
Thank you, Sir.

661
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:36,785
This brochure has a brief introduction,
and here's a transcript that I've prepared.

662
00:59:37,795 --> 00:59:40,879
Actually, Sir, there's a Martial Arts Event
taking place in Chinatown

663
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,082
during the Full Moon Festival.
With your permission,

664
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:45,042
I'd like to go film it
and do some more research,

665
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,092
so that we may further investigate
this matter.

666
00:59:47,222 --> 00:59:48,466
- Chinatown?
- Yes, Sir.

667
00:59:48,643 --> 00:59:50,963
Granted. Just don't make this
a waste of my time.

668
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:52,647
- Definitely not, Sir.
- All right.

669
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:55,582
Come in.

670
00:59:58,237 --> 00:59:59,337
Sir.

671
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,666
Please excuse
the Staff Sergeant's intrusion.

672
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:05,669
- What the hell you're doing here?
- My job, as a Marine.

673
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:06,973
So that's all right.

674
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:11,292
So, let's start to explore the idea
of incorporating Chinese Kung Fu

675
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:13,577
into our hand-to-hand combat training.

676
01:00:13,771 --> 01:00:17,893
Now, Staff Sergeant Hartman
is gonna go to Chinatown for research.

677
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:23,637
I'd like you to start learning something
from this handbook. Here, take it.

678
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:30,103
- Gentlemen, that's all.
- Sir.

679
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,018
Fix your base, recruit.

680
01:00:52,803 --> 01:00:55,036
You have no power, Mr. Kreese.

681
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,713
Instructor.

682
01:00:58,117 --> 01:00:59,653
A word.

683
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,479
Bow.

684
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,240
Gunny.

685
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,042
You know there's not a doubt
in my mind

686
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:11,646
that Karate is the best form
of hand-to-hand combat. Bar none.

687
01:01:12,188 --> 01:01:15,747
But do you know what that backstabbing
son of a bitch Hartman's gone and done?

688
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,091
Tell me.

689
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:18,829
He convinced out commanding officer

690
01:01:19,018 --> 01:01:22,617
that his bullshit Kung Fu is more effective
than our Karate training.

691
01:01:24,212 --> 01:01:26,208
I'm gonna need you
to write that wrong, Colin.

692
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,691
You just let me show those people
the meaning of real combat Karate,

693
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:32,619
and I'll shut those Kung Fu
charlatans up for good.

694
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,170
Good man.

695
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:35,675
Gunny.

696
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:38,920
Continue.

697
01:01:40,689 --> 01:01:42,052
Move.

698
01:02:03,421 --> 01:02:04,433
Good.

699
01:02:10,633 --> 01:02:11,876
Good.

700
01:02:24,837 --> 01:02:26,316
Grandmaster.

701
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:47,730
Uncle Ip, you are late. I save you a seat
next to the masters over there.

702
01:02:48,594 --> 01:02:50,702
No worries. I'll stay where I am.

703
01:02:50,843 --> 01:02:52,901
But the view's better there.

704
01:02:53,956 --> 01:02:57,037
How about you go prepare.
Get ready for stage, okay?

705
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:58,925
Go back there.

706
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,281
All right. I'll go then.

707
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,583
Uncle Gwai.

708
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,640
- That's how you're dressed for stage?
- Yeah.

709
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:11,207
Where's your father?
Didn't you come with your father?

710
01:03:11,341 --> 01:03:14,342
No, I came first, didn't see him.
Maybe, he will show up later.

711
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:50,398
Mr. Wan Zong Hua.

712
01:03:52,644 --> 01:03:55,248
We are the United States Department
of Immigration and Customs.

713
01:03:55,315 --> 01:03:57,561
We're here to take you into custody
for questioning

714
01:03:57,705 --> 01:04:01,116
regarding the presence of illegal aliens
residing in Chinatown.

715
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,466
Go.

716
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:12,723
Go.

717
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:24,710
Good.

718
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,148
Good.

719
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:29,939
That's my students.

720
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,969
When did we invite
these whities to perform?

721
01:04:42,118 --> 01:04:43,126
I don't know.

722
01:04:43,874 --> 01:04:45,210
Who is he?

723
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:47,081
Who invited him?

724
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,444
Get down!

725
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,585
Hey, Chinaman.

726
01:05:05,444 --> 01:05:08,594
You wanna try to break these bricks
with your Kung Fu, huh?

727
01:05:11,879 --> 01:05:13,831
Cowards.

728
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,784
Get down!

729
01:05:42,026 --> 01:05:43,957
I'll go look for your father.

730
01:05:44,863 --> 01:05:46,848
My name is Colin Frater.

731
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:50,496
4th Dan Black Belt in Kyokuten Karate.

732
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:55,590
And I'm here to show you, yellow bitches
the taste of real combat.

733
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:59,624
Fight me with your Hokey Pokey Kung Fu.

734
01:06:00,215 --> 01:06:01,409
I dare you.

735
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,846
What're you talking about? Get down!

736
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:06,941
How dare you! I will fight you now!

737
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,266
Uncle Gwai, what happened to Chairman Wan?

738
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:13,619
What do you mean?

739
01:06:14,232 --> 01:06:15,563
I just saw Chairman Wan.

740
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:18,562
He was taken by the Immigration officers.
He was taken into a car.

741
01:06:18,743 --> 01:06:20,234
Let's make it quick!

742
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:24,115
- You understand I will go all out.
- You are begging to be killed.

743
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:26,712
- Come on then.
- I won't hold back either.

744
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:38,741
Master Law.

745
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,446
Bullshit, why is the stage so small?

746
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:45,878
Help me.

747
01:06:46,446 --> 01:06:47,532
Who's next?

748
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:49,389
Freaking whitey. I am in.

749
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:50,781
Keep it up.

750
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:19,200
Master.

751
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:22,755
Master Chiu, you okay?

752
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,771
Lady, I'll show you no mercy.

753
01:07:38,102 --> 01:07:39,640
Don't hold back.

754
01:07:40,388 --> 01:07:42,226
Mind yourself first.

755
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,399
Master Chiang.

756
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:35,794
Enough.

757
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:42,634
Master Ip, bravo!

758
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:44,293
Master Ip!

759
01:08:45,181 --> 01:08:46,528
Uncle Ip, you nailed it!

760
01:10:24,585 --> 01:10:26,150
Yes!

761
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:40,682
Uncle Ip, that's fantastic.
Uncle Ip, you are the best! The best!

762
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:44,166
Too awesome.
The most amazing Uncle Ip.

763
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:48,863
Yonah.

764
01:10:50,902 --> 01:10:52,688
Bad news. Auntie San told me

765
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:55,278
your father was detained
by the Immigration officers.

766
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:58,231
I'll drive you there. Go.

767
01:11:01,935 --> 01:11:06,607
We've reopened the cases
involving the CBA.

768
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:12,641
We suspect that these Chinamen
have identities that are fraudulent,

769
01:11:12,821 --> 01:11:14,206
and that you've helped them

770
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:17,801
by writing falsified letters
of referral from the U.S.A.

771
01:11:17,957 --> 01:11:22,257
making you an accomplice
of these illegal aliens.

772
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,190
This is a setup!

773
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,982
Would you know?

774
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:31,731
I am going to arrest every single person

775
01:11:32,544 --> 01:11:35,018
in the CBA tonight.

776
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,328
You, and the CBA

777
01:11:39,313 --> 01:11:42,013
will be gone for good.

778
01:11:50,096 --> 01:11:52,588
He has a broken rib
but he will be okay.

779
01:11:52,796 --> 01:11:56,846
Chinese Kung Fu my ass.
I'll shut them down in my own way.

780
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,458
The full moon event has concluded.

781
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,009
Those chinamen must be back
at the Chinese Benevolent Association.

782
01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:14,584
Thirty minutes to CBA. Bring them all in.

783
01:12:14,802 --> 01:12:17,918
Call the wives, boys.
We're staying late.

784
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:22,683
We're going to Chinatown,
arresting every Chinamen in the CBA.

785
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:26,278
- This operation makes no sense, Sir.
- Shut up, Do-good Marshal!

786
01:12:26,944 --> 01:12:28,709
You do as you're told.

787
01:12:36,072 --> 01:12:37,081
Man.

788
01:12:38,539 --> 01:12:41,076
Excuse me. Anybody here?
I need some help.

789
01:12:41,226 --> 01:12:42,272
What now?

790
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,866
Let me check it out.

791
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,141
It's way past office hours,
you can't be here.

792
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:49,744
My father, Wan Zhong Hua
has been taken by mistake.

793
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:51,145
I need to see him right now!

794
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:52,481
- Billy.
- I can't let you in.

795
01:12:52,614 --> 01:12:54,201
- Grandmaster.
- Billy.

796
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,703
- Can you help us?
- I wish I could.

797
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:59,918
Her father, Mr. Wan Zhong Hua.
What happened?

798
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,798
I have no idea, Sir.
But please, take my advice,

799
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:05,267
stay away from the
Chinese Benevolent Association tonight.

800
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,425
Tonight don't go there, all right?
We're gonna raid that place tonight.

801
01:13:09,578 --> 01:13:12,302
I gotta go. But remember, don't go there.

802
01:13:27,705 --> 01:13:30,860
Masters, who got those Karate guys here?

803
01:13:31,611 --> 01:13:33,276
Made a scene for nothing.

804
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:37,031
It must be Bruce Lee I reckon.
He dragged us into this.

805
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:41,398
Don't make false assumptions.
His Sifu helped us.

806
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,695
Mater Law, leave the CBA right now.

807
01:13:49,937 --> 01:13:51,731
Immigration officers are coming
to make arrest.

808
01:13:51,907 --> 01:13:52,920
Who are you?

809
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:57,155
Is that you?

810
01:13:57,358 --> 01:13:58,642
What did you say?

811
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,971
What are you doing?

812
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,821
Things went wrong.

813
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:26,109
Is that it? Is this
your Chinese Kung Fu, huh?

814
01:14:26,822 --> 01:14:28,471
What about this guy?

815
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,963
Your Chairman. Where is he?

816
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,504
I don't know.

817
01:14:32,646 --> 01:14:34,642
You tell me or I'm gonna break your arm.

818
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:39,882
INS, immigration.

819
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:41,586
Good boy.

820
01:14:53,526 --> 01:14:54,954
What happened?

821
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:56,642
Master Law.

822
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:02,132
Master Ip, a whitey just showed up
and attacked everyone.

823
01:15:02,385 --> 01:15:03,931
Like he was coming for a revenge.

824
01:15:04,075 --> 01:15:06,822
Man, the immigration officers
will be here in a second.

825
01:15:20,494 --> 01:15:22,207
They're gone.

826
01:15:22,381 --> 01:15:23,731
Check 'em back.

827
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:25,712
All right guys, let's do a sweep.

828
01:15:26,077 --> 01:15:28,728
Look for any clues that might tell us
where they went.

829
01:15:50,953 --> 01:15:52,469
Officer,

830
01:15:52,669 --> 01:15:56,617
I'm looking for a Chinaman by the name
of Wan Zhong Hua. Where is he?

831
01:15:57,378 --> 01:15:59,334
What do you want with him?

832
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:03,875
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Barton Geddes.
2nd Battalion 5th Marines.

833
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:07,733
One of my men was assaulted
in Chinatown tonight.

834
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,519
Wan Zhong Hua is the Chairman

835
01:16:10,676 --> 01:16:14,807
of the Chinese Benevolent Association.
I need him back on my base tonight.

836
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:19,747
This man made me look bad. It's personal.

837
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,251
So, why don't you cooperate,

838
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:25,339
or things are gonna get pretty bad
for you, too. Do you understand?

839
01:16:25,505 --> 01:16:28,965
So, go and get him. No worry
about repercussions.

840
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,333
Follow me.

841
01:16:42,475 --> 01:16:45,291
You're now officially in the custody
of the US Marine's.

842
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,652
Just don't let him stay in the country
when you're done with him, all right?

843
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,817
My Karate coach was defeated
in the fight tonight by Chinese Kung Fu.

844
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:57,774
Since you're the representative
of Chinese Kung Fu,

845
01:16:57,937 --> 01:17:00,267
I'm holding you personally accountable.

846
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:05,322
This Chinamen right here.
I just crushed all of 'em.

847
01:17:05,783 --> 01:17:07,680
You're the only one left.

848
01:17:07,883 --> 01:17:09,405
I need to fight you.

849
01:17:09,485 --> 01:17:10,273
Dad.

850
01:17:10,421 --> 01:17:11,914
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.

851
01:17:12,055 --> 01:17:13,968
You're Becky's father, right?

852
01:17:14,145 --> 01:17:15,838
Listen, it's all my fault.

853
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,891
It's nothing to do with my father.

854
01:17:18,129 --> 01:17:20,698
I'm sorry. I beg you.

855
01:17:21,144 --> 01:17:24,275
Please let my papa go. Please.

856
01:17:25,372 --> 01:17:27,200
Yonah!

857
01:17:28,024 --> 01:17:29,654
Get up!

858
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:32,510
Yonah!

859
01:17:36,842 --> 01:17:38,205
Get up.

860
01:17:40,466 --> 01:17:43,021
Don't kneel to these people.

861
01:17:51,297 --> 01:17:52,999
You are right.

862
01:17:54,054 --> 01:17:55,979
If you can't take it anymore,

863
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:58,241
then, just don't.

864
01:18:12,382 --> 01:18:14,562
I will fight you.

865
01:18:16,812 --> 01:18:18,397
Let's go.

866
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:22,094
Papa, don't.

867
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:33,174
Bruce.

868
01:18:34,045 --> 01:18:35,219
Sifu.

869
01:18:43,355 --> 01:18:46,390
I want all the recruits
in the PT Gautlet straight away.

870
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,761
Aye, Gunny.

871
01:18:47,987 --> 01:18:50,443
Especially Staff Sergeant Hartman.

872
01:18:52,231 --> 01:18:56,201
Reveille! Reveille!
Get your asses on the line!

873
01:18:56,414 --> 01:18:58,454
Move it! Move it!

874
01:18:58,784 --> 01:19:00,610
Out! Out! Out!

875
01:19:00,928 --> 01:19:02,022
Good!

876
01:19:02,466 --> 01:19:05,092
Move your asses, Marines. Move it!

877
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,231
Move that ass, double time! Triple time!

878
01:19:08,504 --> 01:19:11,434
Left hand, left knee,
right hand, right knee!

879
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:14,169
Sit down! Sit down! Move it!

880
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,502
I try to be a fair man.

881
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:20,601
So, since Staff Sergeant Hartman
so desperately wants

882
01:19:20,907 --> 01:19:24,606
his Chinese Kung Fu
to be part of our curriculum.

883
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:27,612
I'm happy to give up my rack time,

884
01:19:28,758 --> 01:19:31,997
and give a Chinese representative
the chance to prove

885
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:37,822
the Kung Fu is actually useful
in a real combat situation.

886
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:42,365
Master Wan, you don't have to
accept his challenge.

887
01:19:42,582 --> 01:19:44,051
I have to.

888
01:19:44,869 --> 01:19:47,964
If I back down I'm no Chinese.

889
01:19:54,235 --> 01:19:57,626
No rules. Fight till you drop.

890
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:02,878
- Make sure you get all these on film.
- Sir! Yes, Sir!

891
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,080
Master Wan, stop!

892
01:23:04,637 --> 01:23:06,446
I just realized

893
01:23:08,205 --> 01:23:11,212
you and your daughter
look the hell of a lot alike

894
01:23:13,215 --> 01:23:15,255
when you beg.

895
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:20,078
Enough!

896
01:23:36,315 --> 01:23:38,281
Master Wan.

897
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:42,358
Don't you think I deserve
a round of applause?

898
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:58,611
Those white people
always pick on us.

899
01:23:59,212 --> 01:24:01,580
Made a scene tonight at the CBA.

900
01:24:01,974 --> 01:24:03,740
They are getting way out of line.

901
01:24:03,935 --> 01:24:05,213
That's right.

902
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:08,326
It's not the first time
the immigration officers came.

903
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:10,572
They harassed us for no reason.

904
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:12,667
Yes.

905
01:24:13,068 --> 01:24:16,052
My grandfather came here as a hard labor.

906
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:18,497
Helped them build the railway.

907
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:22,359
Helped the Americans connect
the East coast with the West.

908
01:24:23,011 --> 01:24:25,094
It's all thanks to Chinese labor.

909
01:24:25,873 --> 01:24:29,806
Yet the American government never
willing to acknowledge our contribution.

910
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:32,933
Keep trying to kick us out
with all sorts of excuses.

911
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:35,169
The white guys are too arrogant.

912
01:24:35,424 --> 01:24:37,404
There's no equality here.

913
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:40,175
Bruce, we were, too.

914
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:44,472
No big deal. I didn't take it to heart.
Don't worry.

915
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:48,489
Master Ip, thank you very much.

916
01:24:48,988 --> 01:24:51,630
Not at all. We are all Chinese.

917
01:24:52,322 --> 01:24:53,959
We should help each other out.

918
01:24:54,142 --> 01:24:57,858
That has always been my belief.
Chinese must help each other out. Right?

919
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,372
Spot on.

920
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:00,993
Master Law is right.

921
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:10,868
Hello.

922
01:25:11,132 --> 01:25:14,379
Master, at the Mid-Autumn Carnival
tonight, the masters in Chinatown

923
01:25:14,529 --> 01:25:16,607
had a conflict with people from the army.

924
01:25:17,128 --> 01:25:21,861
Master Wan, he is severely injured.
Now at the hospital.

925
01:26:41,054 --> 01:26:43,253
Little prick, not answering
the phone again!

926
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:45,634
Bob,

927
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:47,868
where is Jin?

928
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:50,161
He is practicing with the wooden dummy.

929
01:26:55,797 --> 01:26:58,347
Master Ip, long distance calls cost a lot.

930
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,594
Bob,

931
01:27:09,593 --> 01:27:12,064
I have cancer.

932
01:27:17,313 --> 01:27:19,367
Are you serious?

933
01:27:19,828 --> 01:27:22,363
Actually, the reason I hurried to America

934
01:27:24,658 --> 01:27:27,012
is to have a look here.

935
01:27:27,589 --> 01:27:30,952
See if it's right for Jin.
Please let me talk to him.

936
01:27:31,398 --> 01:27:33,027
Hold on.

937
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:36,974
Your dad is asking for you.

938
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,246
Pick up the phone.

939
01:27:39,528 --> 01:27:41,643
I won't take his call. No way.

940
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:50,042
Listen to me.
I will only say it once.

941
01:27:50,688 --> 01:27:53,199
Your dad has cancer.

942
01:27:55,422 --> 01:27:58,149
He went to America
just to find you a school.

943
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:13,815
Dad.

944
01:28:14,364 --> 01:28:15,649
Jin.

945
01:28:21,594 --> 01:28:23,480
It was my fault

946
01:28:24,153 --> 01:28:26,079
that I hit you last time.

947
01:28:28,347 --> 01:28:29,712
I am sorry.

948
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:32,096
I know you like martial arts.

949
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,593
I will teach you when I'm back.

950
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:38,684
Dad,

951
01:28:39,577 --> 01:28:41,585
when will you be home?

952
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:45,408
I still have something
to take care of.

953
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:50,468
Once it's done I will be right back.

954
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:55,129
Goodbye.

955
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,115
Take me to the boot camp.

956
01:29:31,345 --> 01:29:35,373
Uncle Ip, don't go. I don't want
anything bad happen to you.

957
01:29:45,067 --> 01:29:47,047
Uncle Ip is a martial artist.

958
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:49,627
In a face of injustice

959
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:51,970
I must stand up and fight.

960
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,945
That was why we took up martial arts.

961
01:29:55,751 --> 01:29:58,497
This is something I very much want to do.

962
01:29:58,829 --> 01:30:01,281
Just as you want to do cheerleading.

963
01:30:18,008 --> 01:30:21,786
If you're lucky enough to come
to America. Set foot on our soil.

964
01:30:21,992 --> 01:30:25,895
Then, you ought to learn
everything about my culture.

965
01:30:26,445 --> 01:30:29,299
Consider yourselves
incredibly honored to be here.

966
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:31,048
Incredibly honored.

967
01:30:32,782 --> 01:30:37,992
Because America is the greatest
and the most powerful country on Earth.

968
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:40,212
A land of supremacy.

969
01:30:40,404 --> 01:30:44,201
And that is an indisputable fact.

970
01:30:46,305 --> 01:30:49,275
- Is that understood?
- Sir! Yes, Sir!

971
01:30:53,866 --> 01:30:55,248
But last night

972
01:30:55,906 --> 01:30:58,661
I had the unfortunate
but necessary task

973
01:30:59,139 --> 01:31:04,484
of demonstrating how an inferior race
can and should be defeated.

974
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:07,670
I'm sure you all agree
the results were...

975
01:31:08,253 --> 01:31:09,992
quite definitive.

976
01:31:11,628 --> 01:31:13,223
So, don't even think about bringing

977
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,494
you filthy culture to my Marines
corp. Again. Is that understood?

978
01:31:16,725 --> 01:31:18,531
Sir! Yes, Sir!

979
01:31:20,348 --> 01:31:22,351
Racist asshole!

980
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:25,082
Look around you.

981
01:31:26,417 --> 01:31:28,664
We are the culture.

982
01:31:29,397 --> 01:31:32,455
Your supremacy is pure hatred
and bigotry.

983
01:31:33,226 --> 01:31:35,998
This-- This is Master Ip Man.

984
01:31:39,737 --> 01:31:41,914
He defeated Colin last night.

985
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:46,213
And he's here to kick your ass!

986
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:51,329
No rules. You fight till you drop.

987
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:55,718
Is that it, huh?

988
01:33:56,645 --> 01:33:58,190
Is that all you've got?

989
01:34:01,532 --> 01:34:02,982
You see this?

990
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:09,852
You're nothing but another
little yellow chink. Come on!

991
01:34:17,586 --> 01:34:19,294
Let's go!

992
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:22,925
That's it.

993
01:36:07,064 --> 01:36:09,202
Take the Gunnery Sergeant to Sick Bay.

994
01:36:09,852 --> 01:36:11,173
Johnson! Harris!

995
01:36:11,337 --> 01:36:12,770
Move! Move! Move!

996
01:37:09,086 --> 01:37:10,789
Master Ip,

997
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:13,672
this letter is a bit late.

998
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:16,579
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

999
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:21,949
I appreciate it.

1000
01:37:24,155 --> 01:37:25,351
Right.

1001
01:37:25,727 --> 01:37:28,428
When will you and your son come here?

1002
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,111
Actually, grass is not really greener

1003
01:37:37,687 --> 01:37:39,268
on the other side of the fence.

1004
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:49,788
Uncle Ip,

1005
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:52,577
those meds you asked for,
I got them all.

1006
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,196
I even got you candies and chocolate.

1007
01:37:55,448 --> 01:37:58,682
This is my favorite chocolate.
Your son will love it, too.

1008
01:37:59,372 --> 01:38:01,097
- Thank you.
- You're so sweet.

1009
01:38:25,313 --> 01:38:26,811
Dad.

1010
01:38:39,191 --> 01:38:42,121
I have thought it through.
I don't want to go to America.

1011
01:38:43,889 --> 01:38:45,544
I really like martial arts.

1012
01:38:46,459 --> 01:38:47,721
Dad.

1013
01:38:48,311 --> 01:38:49,709
Teach me.

1014
01:38:50,619 --> 01:38:52,026
Okay.

1015
01:38:53,788 --> 01:38:55,906
Self-confidence
is the most important thing.

1016
01:38:56,334 --> 01:38:58,047
Wherever you are.

1017
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:32,949
Jin,

1018
01:39:34,656 --> 01:39:36,197
I will demonstrate once.

1019
01:39:37,506 --> 01:39:38,757
Film it.

1020
01:41:43,192 --> 01:41:44,663
<i>On 2nd December, 1972,</i>

1021
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,602
<i>the Grandmaster, Ip Man, died

1024
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,591
<i>the US Army has regularly invited</i>

1026

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
Hello!

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,971
Over here!

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,042
Whoo!

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,804
Please help me!

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,481
Help!

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,161
Whoo!

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,721
Can you hear me?

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,324
I see you!

10
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Ah, the Lord has answered my prayers.

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,527
Bless you, my son, bless you. Good dog.

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,884
That's me poor mule here.
She's hurt. She's hurt really bad.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,845
How long you been walkin' her like that?

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,243
Ah. Not far.

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,966
Well, if she's in pain,
you oughta put her down.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,121
Nah.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,451
I don't think I could do that.

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,961
She was good to you.

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,087
It's only right.

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,371
No sense in lettin' her suffer.

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,771
No, you misunderstand me.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,840
See, it's not that I lack the conviction
to shoot this animal.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,082
The Lord is Himself would give me
the strength for that.

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,202
No, no, it's more it's a...

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,289
It's a matter of practicality.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,403
See, do you believe in God, my son?

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,809
Ah, well, me and this mule here,
we do the Lord's work...

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,930
Been traveling all across this land
preaching the good word.

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,642
And over that hill there down into
the valley is the town of Denton.

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,809
That's our next stop. You familiar?

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,926
Ah, let me give you a little
insight into our situation.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,400
Denton is a town that is run by sinners.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Just like many of
the others that we visited.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
No church, no religion left to speak of.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,971
Many of its residents have...
They've lost their way.

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,484
So you see, traveler,
if I cannot get this goddamned mule

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,200
over that goddamn hill,
then I cannot heal those poor souls

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
with the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Praise his name.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,483
I've been praying, and I've been praying
all day for the Lord to hear my troubles.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,886
I've asked him...

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,727
And I know that he wants me
to help those people.

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,320
I know that he wants me to save
those that need to be saved.

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,121
Especially the women.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,044
They are ripe with sin.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,566
So I asked the Lord, I said, "Do not
forsake them, and do not forsake me.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,970
"Send me someone to help
get over that hill."

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,525
And sure enough, he answered my prayers.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,531
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna be
needin' that horse of yours.

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,847
So, please, my son,

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,087
kindly climb down, hand over the reins...

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,726
For the Lord.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,250
Did you not hear me, boy?

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,644
Aren't you listening?

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
No, Father.

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,007
I don't believe I was.

56
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,120
Get it off me!

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,966
Get her off of me!

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,760
I stopped listening to men
like you a long time ago.

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- Quiet.

60
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,249
- Don't shoot.
- Be quiet!

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,728
Or you'll be speaking
to your Lord directly.

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,891
- Now, I'm willing to make you a trade.
- Trade?

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,520
Yeah, I ain't no thief.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll trade you your life
for these bullets and whatever water

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,840
you got left there in your canteen.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,969
Considering the circumstances,
that seems more than fair.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,208
Unless, as a man of God,
you don't fear death,

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,160
and you're content in your convictions

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,208
and prepared to meet your maker,
right here and right now.

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,890
In which case, I will oblige you.

71
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,442
Because I'm not a thief,
but I am a killer.

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,882
And I've killed better men than some drunk

73
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,080
wanderin' around pretending
to preach the word of God.

74
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,320
So are you prepared?

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,370
You got confidence in your convictions
or you wanna make a deal?

76
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,921
- Deal.
- What?

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,405
Yes, I want to make a deal.

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,886
All right, good, 'cause I promised my dog
I wasn't gonna kill anybody on this trip,

79
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,800
and I don't wanna break
my promise here today.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,602
Hey, now, the trade
wasn't for the whiskey.

81
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,326
No, it wasn't.

82
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,560
There.

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,007
You!

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,365
You say there's a town
right beyond that ridge?

85
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,445
Well, you give this mule a little rest,
he'll get you there just fine.

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,645
But I don't ever wanna see you again.

87
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,885
I hate charlatans.

88
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,644
I want you to stay right here...

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,884
Till you learn to respect your animal.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,526
God damn you.

91
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
You'll pay for this.

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,491
The devil is waiting for men
like you. He's waiting!

93
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, if the devil's looking for me,
you can tell him I'm headed to Mexico.

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,844
He can meet me there. Come on.

95
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,885
That's all there is.

96
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,924
I know. I'm thirsty, too.

97
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,762
I'd say the border is about 10 days away.

98
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,646
What do you think?

99
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,402
We'd waste a lot of time
going around that valley,

100
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,725
and there's no guarantee
there's water on the other side.

101
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,486
Oh, it's a straight shot
right through that town.

102
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,407
Oh, Jesus.

103
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,885
I don't know about you, but...

104
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,410
A fresh meal and a warm bath
sound pretty good right about now.

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,731
Cathy'd roll her eyes
if she could see us now, huh?

106
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,845
All dirty and starvin'.

107
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,329
You can't live on flies alone, you know.

108
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,764
We gotta keep our heads down, okay?

109
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,440
No trouble.

110
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,090
You gotta be on your best behavior.

111
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,204
Yeah.

112
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,607
I know.

113
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,328
I know. Same goes for me.

114
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,650
Looks like that priest was right.

115
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,726
God must've packed up
and left with the rest of 'em.

116
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,285
Come on.

117
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,566
Shit.

118
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,962
How would someone spend
an hour in this town?

119
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,367
Huh?

120
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,402
If your name was Dollar Bill,
is that where you'd be?

121
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
All right, listen,
you stay here with Lady.

122
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,567
If I'm wrong and he comes back,
you give a bark. You got it?

123
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,086
Okay. I'll take that as a yes.

124
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,120
Now, gentlemen, gentlemen,

125
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,040
please allow me to keep your attention
for just a few moments more.

126
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,804
I came all this way, and I must admit

127
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,326
that I have indeed saved
the best for last.

128
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,560
Although I am disappointed
you did not take

129
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,200
to the lilac powder or the ladies elixir,

130
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,360
I am certain

131
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
these next two items are
just what you're looking for.

132
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
Men of your ilk require something
very special, very special indeed,

133
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,480
and if I can't see to that, well,
then my name isn't William T. Baxter.

134
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Now, I know that sounds
braggadocious of me to say,

135
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,802
but as you can no doubt see,

136
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,569
I'm quite confident in
what I have to offer.

137
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,600
What'll it be?

138
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,603
I'm looking for a man named Dollar Bill.

139
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh, DB's shop's across the street.

140
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,689
Yeah, sign on his door says he's out.

141
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,886
Well, 2:00, he takes a break
to feed his pigs.

142
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,650
Now it's almost 3:00.
You should be able to catch him then.

143
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,765
Can I get you a drink?

144
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,687
Some water.

145
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,882
- Just water?
- Yeah, and, uh...

146
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,127
A bowl?

147
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
You want the water in a bowl?

148
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,080
The bowl is for my dog.

149
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,805
Bowl is for the dog.

150
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,885
These here are the finest
handguns currently available.

151
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,840
The greatest equalizers.

152
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,730
Forty-five calibers designed
by Samuel Colt himself.

153
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,480
Twenty-four karat gold inlaid.
Raised elephant ivory grip.

154
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,840
And when I tell you that
the front sight is accurate enough

155
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,764
to pick a flea off a dog's ass...

156
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,804
I do not exaggerate.

157
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,120
Now, I can let you
have them for only $30 apiece

158
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,645
or 50 for the pair.

159
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,242
Now, gentlemen, please, before you
speak, that isn't just a bargain.

160
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,010
That is a steal.

161
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,080
Quite frankly, there's no better
revolver on the market today,

162
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,162
and I lay my reputation on it.

163
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,206
As you can imagine, being in
the industry that I am in,

164
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,924
my reputation, gentlemen, is everything.

165
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,210
You never mind your...

166
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,687
Reputation.

167
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,360
So you're saying that this,
this is the best gun on the market?

168
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,200
Yes, sir. I say it with pride.

169
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,081
Well, nobody west of Texas will be
able to handle it better than me.

170
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,723
Hell, that is nice. What do ya say, boys?

171
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,880
Oh.

172
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,041
Harris, you even see that?

173
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,642
No, can't say I did.

174
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,009
I almost put one
right between your eyes there.

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,645
What about you, Roy? Did you see anything?

176
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,405
I ain't seen nothin'.

177
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,960
Tubby, I know you didn't see shit
'cause you were too busy thinking

178
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,202
what you were gonna have for lunch, right?

179
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,086
Hey!

180
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,246
Stranger.

181
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,730
You ever seen anybody so neat
with a pistol before?

182
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
Hey!

183
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,801
Pard!

184
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,571
You deaf or something? I'm talking to you.

185
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,760
You think this thing's loaded?
What do you say we find out?

186
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,608
You should be careful
who you point a gun at.

187
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,609
So, do we have a deal here?

188
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,244
Thirty dollars?

189
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,361
Do I look like I have $30?

190
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,840
Oh.

191
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,649
You take a look around this town.

192
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,844
Nobody buying nothing from you.

193
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,167
Do you, uh...

194
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,330
Do you know what they call this place?

195
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,361
Hmm?

196
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,450
They call it "Valley of Violence."

197
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,127
Now, why don't you pack up,
before you find out why.

198
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,966
Move.

199
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,166
Now...

200
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,971
What were you sayin' to me?

201
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,684
You answer me when I talk to you.

202
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,367
What's the matter?

203
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,688
Cat got your tongue all of a sudden?

204
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,042
Well, you look like a bum.

205
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
You smell like a bum, too.

206
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,641
Jesus.

207
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,645
That's one ugly scar you got.

208
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,761
Hey, fellas.

209
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,122
I don't think this bum knows where he is.

210
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,287
And you must not know who I am neither.

211
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,201
Wanna find out? Huh?

212
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,403
You talk too much...

213
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,446
Whoever you are.

214
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
All right!

215
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,760
Anyone who wants to see a fight
better get out here right now.

216
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,680
I'm about to show you what it's like
when you run your mouth at Gilly Martin.

217
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,450
- You gonna get him, Gilly?
- Oh, Tubby, I'm gonna get him so good,

218
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,120
he's gonna be lookin' to you
for tips on places to sit.

219
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,320
Ellen. Ellen!

220
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,006
Sweetheart! Where the hell are you?

221
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,845
Get out here and see this.

222
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,320
You are definitely gonna wanna see
what I am about to do to this man.

223
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,600
What's going on? What's all this hubbub?

224
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,840
What's goin' on?
Baby, some dried up dick licker

225
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,200
came into town this morning
and I'm about to teach him a lesson

226
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,964
on how things work around here.

227
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,640
You gonna fight him?

228
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,404
Oh, I'm gonna beat him bad, baby.

229
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,560
It's time to watch your man go to work.

230
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,688
Oh, I love a good fight!

231
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,960
- Y'all could learn somethin' out here today.
- Yes.

232
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,644
This here...

233
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,530
This is my town.

234
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,364
Anybody who don't know it,
you better take notice.

235
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,327
Now you gonna face me like a man or what?

236
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,280
No offense, mister, I don't know you
and I don't think nothin' cross about you.

237
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,728
But that shot is on the house
if you will get outta here.

238
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,364
Now don't worry, everyone,
you are gonna see a fight.

239
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,520
Get him, baby! Be a man.

240
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,243
I know what the problem is.

241
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,167
Now I know.

242
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,162
You're afraid I'm just gonna
pull my pistol, lean into you.

243
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,529
All right, well, listen.
Nobody here is shooting nobody today.

244
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,520
No guns.

245
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,250
This here, this is a fair fight.

246
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,840
No jumping in neither, all right?

247
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,367
Man to man. Tubby, you hang on
to this. Don't eat it.

248
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,286
There, now you have it.

249
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,161
All right, come on.

250
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,046
Let's get this over with.

251
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,481
Everybody's waitin'.

252
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,650
Son of a bitch.

253
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,000
All right, $5 to the winner.

254
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,527
What do you say to that?
Do you even have $5?

255
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,280
Now wait just a minute.

256
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,001
What...

257
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,207
Is that?

258
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,521
Is that... Is that your dog?

259
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,330
Come here, pooch. Come here.

260
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,888
Oh, dear.

261
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,920
- Hey!
- Here he comes now, Gilly!

262
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
Get away from my dog.

263
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,521
Is that your wife?

264
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,920
Roy, I've seen you
with some long in the tooth ladies,

265
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,320
but this one here takes the cake.

266
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
You started this.

267
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,646
And I'm gonna finish it too.

268
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,124
I don't care where I am...

269
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,689
And I don't care who you think you are.

270
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,211
Men like you don't scare me,
you understand?

271
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,286
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

272
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,809
I don't want any trouble with y'all.

273
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,280
Put it away. Put it away.

274
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,330
Harris, he just laid Gilly out
in front of half the town.

275
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,124
- We can't just...
- Yes, we can.

276
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,840
He's right, it was a fair fight.
It's settled.

277
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,000
What do you think the Marshal is gonna say
when he finds out we didn't do nothing?

278
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,730
I imagine he'll be upset.

279
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,691
We'll deal with it.

280
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,560
Oh!

281
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,450
He just spit on him.
He just spit on Gilly.

282
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,371
Get up, kid.

283
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,250
How's the pigs, Bill?

284
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,166
Oh, my God, Gilly!

285
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,322
He shouldn't have threatened me or my dog.

286
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,726
- A man can only take so much.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,843
- How much for all of this?
- No charge.

288
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,605
I'm not a thief. How much?

289
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,691
I... I insist.

290
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,365
What, you afraid of me?

291
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,766
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,005
That's...

293
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,649
Tell you what, there's a man
out there who owes me $5.

294
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,971
When he wakes up,
you take all this outta that, okay?

295
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,091
Thank you.

296
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,240
What are y'all lookin' at? Go back inside!

297
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,800
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

298
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,166
Oh.

299
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,886
- Oh, he's leaking, he's leaking!
- Wait, why are we outside?

300
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,240
Clean, clean him, he's leaking.
Ugh, come on, come on...

301
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,765
Get up, get up.

302
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,800
Gilly.

303
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,806
Don't break my hat.

304
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,083
- Come on. Get up. There we go.
- Okay.

305
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,646
Sit down.

306
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,528
Don't worry. We're okay.

307
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,966
Coming! I'm coming!

308
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

309
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,040
My sister should be down here,
I don't know where she is.

310
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,407
I'll let her have it. Ellen!

311
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,088
Hi. What can I do for you?

312
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,368
You got any, uh, hot water?

313
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,446
Sure do, you want a bath?

314
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,607
Yeah.

315
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,801
Oh, my goodness, who is this? Huh!

316
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,840
Hi there, cutie.

317
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,446
What's your name?
Aren't you just precious.

318
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,250
She do any tricks?

319
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,200
She bites.

320
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,770
Oh, she's not gonna bite me, look at us.

321
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,450
We look just like each other.

322
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,570
Oh.

323
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,210
Anyways, about that bath.

324
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,611
Uh, you could use one.

325
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,087
Yeah.

326
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,728
Oh, my, what happened to your hand?
You're bleeding.

327
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,611
Let me get you a rag.

328
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Oh, no, it's all right.
Just need some hot water.

329
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,360
Uh, I know, I know you want a bath.

330
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,090
But I can't have you painting my floors.

331
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,486
Ellen!

332
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,805
Ugh, where is she?

333
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,804
She got red hair and a white dress?

334
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,323
Yeah, that's right.
Tall and dimwitted too.

335
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,650
- You know her?
- She's outside.

336
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,650
Figures. I swear she's about as useful
as a fork in a sugar bowl around here.

337
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,404
How'd you do this to your hand anyway?

338
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,640
Well, it was... It was an accident.

339
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,810
Hold that on there.

340
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,323
It's okay. It's okay.

341
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,088
Oh, my goodness! Did you punch Gilly?

342
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,606
Oh, my goodness.
This is the best day of my life.

343
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,365
Let's get you right on up to this bath.
In fact, let's get both of you a bath.

344
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,001
Come on, whatever your name is. Come on.

345
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,009
Okay, here we go.

346
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,771
Got some fresh towels and a comb
and brush if you wanna wash your teeth.

347
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,451
And one for you, Abbie.

348
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,164
I hope you don't mind me
being in here for the moment.

349
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,486
Trust me, I've seen it all.

350
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,882
Not that I'm a whore or nothin'. I'm not.

351
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,200
This is just a hotel.

352
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,720
So if you're looking for someone
to give it a rub, you're out of luck.

353
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,724
There's no women for sale here.
They all left with the silver.

354
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,691
Can I get you anything else?

355
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,686
No.

356
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,320
I can't believe I missed you
punching Gilly.

357
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,240
I would've given anything
to have seen that.

358
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,368
I gotta say, I'm just real
interested in who you are.

359
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,371
We don't get many visitors anymore.
Not since the mine went dry.

360
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,731
I spend more time sweeping
dust than I do prepping rooms.

361
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,571
It's exciting to have someone
new to talk to. You a miner?

362
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,840
No.

363
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,251
You a cowboy?

364
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,366
No.

365
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,769
You a gunfighter?

366
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,087
No.

367
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,160
Is that 'cause you ain't,
or 'cause no one's hired you yet?

368
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,760
'Cause let me tell you, there are
plenty of people in this town that...

369
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,251
I'm not a gunfighter.

370
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,010
Well, what are you then?

371
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,611
I'm passing through.

372
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,366
Well, I know that. Nobody stays.

373
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,730
Not even my husband.

374
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,611
Anyway, let me know when you're done,
I've got some coffee brewing.

375
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,245
You do like coffee?

376
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,251
Ah, well, good.
At least I got something right.

377
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,804
Abbie, next time I'm just gonna talk
to you. You might have more to say.

378
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,969
Where the hell is he?

379
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,122
Mary-Anne, Mary-Anne,
you better not be serving that man.

380
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,160
I am too, you shut your mouth!

381
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,480
I don't want him hearing none of this.

382
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,762
Did you see what he did to Gilly?
Look at my dress!

383
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,763
The whole town practically saw.

384
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,000
Good! Gilly deserves some egg
on his face the way he treats people!

385
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,240
Oh, you watch your mouth.

386
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,641
No! I'll say what I want,
and I'll serve who I want.

387
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,001
Dad said for us to run this hotel,
not just you.

388
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,690
He could be a criminal.
So have some sense.

389
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,330
Oh, Ellen, shut up.

390
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,920
You let me worry about this.

391
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,325
I think he's handsome and I like his dog,
and I wanna know more about them both.

392
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,848
I'm not scared, and you're not
gonna ruin this for me.

393
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,600
You foolish little girl.

394
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,000
One day you'll realize
there's no sense in being difficult.

395
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,924
You make the best of what you can.
Now Gilly takes care of me.

396
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,000
So every time you put him down,
you ought to remember that he's why

397
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,162
I'm always in nice dresses and jewelry

398
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,683
and you're still lookin' like
a little old farm girl.

399
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,928
There's a reason we have it better
than most people in this town.

400
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,526
So wise up.

401
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,960
Maybe then you'll find someone
to take care of you too,

402
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,960
but it's not gonna be that man upstairs.

403
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,769
Because he is a rapscallion

404
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,520
and we don't serve rapscallions.

405
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,170
Well, maybe I like rapscallions!

406
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,326
Now go tend to that nincompoop
fiancé of yours and leave me be.

407
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,360
Show him how he ruined your dress.
See if he buys you a new one then.

408
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,725
Maybe he can fix that black tooth
of yours while he's at it.

409
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,050
Gilly! I'm coming, baby.

410
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,568
What did I tell you
about staying out of trouble?

411
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,047
Yeah, I know.

412
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,689
Probably was all my fault.

413
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,162
You know what Cathy'd say?

414
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,049
She'd say, "You got sand...

415
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,002
"But you could use a little bit
more in your mouth."

416
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,726
Ain't that funny?

417
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,526
Shit.

418
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,002
Fair fight or no fair fight,

419
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,765
whatever law they got in this town
is gonna wanna talk to us soon.

420
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,082
So, we best be moving on.

421
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,445
Thank you.

422
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,723
From your description,
I expected you to be a lot taller.

423
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,131
Have a seat.

424
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,611
The coffee's ready.
I thought you both might like some.

425
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,723
I have some pig-stew boiling
if you're hungry.

426
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,811
Mary-Anne, sweetheart,
find something else to do.

427
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,925
Do you want me to watch Abbie for you?

428
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,167
No.

429
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,645
Are you sure?
I'll be real nice to her, I promise.

430
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,920
- Mary-Anne!
- Yes, sir?

431
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,411
Move your feet.

432
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,811
Yes, sir.

433
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,080
Now you don't wanna sit, that's fine.

434
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,322
But all you're doing is
giving me a sore neck.

435
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,085
See, I got to take the weight
off it once in a while.

436
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,763
I'm not proud of it.

437
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,490
That's a sweet doggie. She do any tricks?

438
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,771
She bites.

439
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,120
All right. Down to business, I guess.

440
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,682
I am Clyde Martin.
I am the Marshal here in Denton.

441
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,965
You got a badge?

442
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,880
Hmm...

443
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,849
Damn pin broke.

444
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,207
Satisfied?

445
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,122
You busted up my deputy pretty good.

446
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,044
I had no idea he was your deputy.

447
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,040
I was just trying to defend myself.

448
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,167
I know you were.

449
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,648
Nobody dare tell me that
'cause it's my son.

450
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,405
And I know how he is.

451
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,240
But defending or not,
he's still my son and he's my deputy too.

452
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,482
So all of this is kinda lousy for me.

453
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,400
Well, I can't have people thinking

454
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,320
this kind of business goes on around here.

455
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,640
First the fight breaks out, then another.

456
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,170
And all the sudden all hell breaks loose
and everybody's got something to say.

457
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,687
This town's fallen on some hard times.

458
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,401
The last thing I need
is a stranger starting trouble.

459
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,603
Yeah, but, I'm not
gonna cause any troubles.

460
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,524
No. We're just, uh, passin' through.

461
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,245
Well, that's what I hear.

462
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,407
Now is that your horse
over there at Bill's outfit?

463
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,725
That's a McClellan saddle.

464
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,200
And would I be right to suspect that
that is a Springfield trapdoor rifle

465
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,770
that you got tied up there too?

466
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,770
I could throw you in jail right now.

467
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,607
You want that? I don't think so.

468
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,125
Only one reason I don't.

469
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,442
And that's the two items on your horse.

470
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,120
'Cause what they tell me is that you're
just not another vagabond or a criminal

471
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,770
that I should be locking away.

472
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,964
It tells me that you're army.

473
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,285
But what it does not tell me is why
the hell are you all the way out here?

474
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,720
Now last I heard, the cavalry was still
busy killing Injuns in Kansas and Oklahoma.

475
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,485
Now we are a long way
from Kansas, soldier.

476
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,485
You mind filling me in?

477
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,724
We're leaving.

478
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,651
Now just a minute.

479
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,764
If you're a deserter, I have a duty
as a US Marshal to turn you in.

480
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,931
I took an oath.

481
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,848
But that would cause extra attention
that I don't want.

482
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,000
You see, I have a way
of doing things around this town

483
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,320
that some think of as non-traditional.

484
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,129
And I don't wanna turn that upside down.

485
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,807
And I have a feeling, neither of us
want the extra attention. Am I right?

486
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,926
Frankly, I feel like
I've given the military enough.

487
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,844
And from the looks of it, so have you.

488
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,920
And I have sympathy
for men who have fought in wars

489
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,525
and even those who have abandoned 'em.

490
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,524
So, you find yourself
another town far away from here.

491
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,280
One with fancy whores and fine whiskey
and a chink with a pot of opium

492
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,806
that's just begging for a man
like you to come into his life.

493
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,970
You do what you need to do.

494
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,051
I expect you earned it.

495
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,200
But don't you ever, if I ever hear
a whispering of you or that dog

496
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,647
being even near these parts again, you'll be
begging for the army to come get ya.

497
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,687
But they won't. They won't ever find you.

498
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,726
Nobody will.
Are we clear on that, soldier?

499
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,890
All right, fellas.

500
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,083
Our visitors have decided to leave.

501
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,682
They are ready to move on.
So please see that they do so.

502
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,608
And Mary-Anne?
I believe I will have some of that stew.

503
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,086
Oh, and my understanding is,
Harris, it was a fair fight.

504
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,521
Yeah.

505
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,927
So don't bring any aggravating
on this no more.

506
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,371
And tell Gilly that too.

507
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,769
His nose is gonna heal up
like a crooked boot,

508
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,489
but he's gonna have to accept that.

509
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,246
Maybe he'll even learn something
from all this, I don't know.

510
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,926
All right, you're dismissed.

511
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,565
Well, all right.

512
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,482
I know you're not coming back, but...

513
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,649
I just wanna say
it was nice meeting you today.

514
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,131
I wanted to give you this.

515
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,365
You can fold it or rip off Ellen's part
if you don't wanna look at her.

516
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,211
I just thought maybe you could...

517
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,641
Remember me sometimes when you
get wherever you're going.

518
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,650
Mary-Anne!

519
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,328
Well, goodbye.
Heck, I don't even know your name.

520
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,685
My name's Paul.

521
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,645
Well, goodbye, Paul.

522
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,925
Good girl.

523
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,002
You know what Cathy used to say one
of the greatest things about Mexico was?

524
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,565
Nobody speaks any English.

525
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,965
Oh, shit.

526
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,280
I'll tell you what though.
One thing I did realize today?

527
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,163
Is that words don't come so easy anymore.

528
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,647
I'm so used to talking to you that I barely
know what to say when somebody talks back.

529
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,840
You speak Spanish?

530
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,646
Oh.

531
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,527
Yeah.

532
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,443
Come here. Come here.

533
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,810
What'd you think of that girl today, huh?

534
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,484
I thought she was pretty funny.

535
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,689
No, she was nothing like Cathy.

536
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,560
When I first met Cathy
I couldn't get three words outta her.

537
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,849
You know, she only spoke if she
had something meaningful to say.

538
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,522
But this one.

539
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,047
Shit.

540
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,326
She'd speak every time
she wasn't taking a breath.

541
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,041
No...

542
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,244
She's young enough to be my daughter.

543
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,960
She was funny though, didn't you think?

544
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,326
I thought she was funny.

545
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,884
Not as funny as you, don't worry.

546
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,091
All right, let's go to bed.

547
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,525
Don't you want your blanket?

548
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,923
Be quiet.

549
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,163
Don't make a sound in case he wakes up.

550
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,771
You sure he's asleep?

551
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,647
God damn it, Tubby. Just do what I say.

552
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,801
Cut him off.

553
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,844
Gilly, I don't know about this.

554
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,971
Harris, go. Now.

555
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,331
Abbie, quiet down.

556
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,251
Come here.

557
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,689
Where'd it go? Where is it?

558
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,805
No, no. Shh.

559
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,440
I can't see where you're hit.

560
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,491
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Where you hit?
I can't find where you're hit.

561
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,170
Bullseye.

562
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,361
All right.

563
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,849
Listen to me. She needs my help.

564
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,320
Okay, just, you can
have whatever you want.

565
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,402
Please let me just
make sure that she's okay.

566
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,090
Now you shut up. You are not in charge.

567
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,929
All right, I'm not in charge. That's fine.

568
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,640
Just... Just please let me
make sure that she's okay.

569
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,120
You back away from her or I will kill her.

570
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,884
- It's...
- Back up.

571
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,047
Okay.

572
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,960
Oh, no, no, no.

573
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,640
The Marshal told you to leave me alone!

574
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,051
The Marshal ain't here.

575
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,280
No! Oh, God damn, you're making a mistake!

576
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,089
I am going to murder you!

577
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,000
I am going to murder all of you,
I swear to God!

578
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,048
God!

579
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,206
There ain't no God here.

580
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,724
And there ain't nobody here but us.

581
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,960
Shh.

582
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,880
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

583
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,964
My dad said...

584
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,762
That this is probably an Injun's dog.

585
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,963
He most likely got her off a pack
of Cheyenne out there in Kansas.

586
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,520
Cheyenne, who raped and killed white folk.

587
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,646
Did you steal this dog?

588
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,771
Please. Please. Don't do this.

589
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,603
Okay, please. Please don't do
this 'cause of what happened today.

590
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,969
I mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

591
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,445
You answer my questions...

592
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,722
And maybe I will consider your request.

593
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,804
Now did you kill her tribe or not?

594
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,126
Come on, now.

595
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,242
There ain't nobody here
that's gonna snitch on you.

596
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,040
Nah. See, we all heard the stories,

597
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,250
we just ain't never had a chance
to talk to somebody in the flesh.

598
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,327
Tell us about it!

599
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,160
You want us to believe that you were

600
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,648
the one man in the cavalry
too good for all of it?

601
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,809
Shit, I hope that you killed every last one
of those wagon burners that you saw.

602
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,925
That's what I would have done.

603
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,330
Those goddamn savages
deserve nothing less.

604
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,961
Please leave us alone. Please.

605
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,851
How many?

606
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,120
I don't know! I don't remember!

607
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,009
I wanna go to Mexico.

608
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,009
You'll never see me again!

609
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,521
I swear, please. Take whatever you want.

610
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,646
Oh, no. No.

611
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,080
You see, we ain't here to rob you.

612
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,970
You're the thief. Not us.

613
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,322
Yeah. What do you say, fellas?

614
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,570
Suppose we let this thief
and this traitor run off to Mexico?

615
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,330
I don't think so.

616
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,325
I don't think so, neither.

617
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,531
You're awfully quiet, Harris.

618
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,001
- Look, Gilly...
- Yes or no, Harris?

619
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,120
Well, that's a shame.

620
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,885
Because I vote no, too. So that's...

621
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,045
Four to one.

622
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,249
Please! She needs me.

623
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,011
I'm begging you. I'm begging you. I'll...

624
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,488
Oh, no, begging ain't
gonna do you no good.

625
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,564
See, it ain't a time for begging.

626
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,126
It's time for praying.

627
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,565
You are a coward.

628
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,800
You left good men behind.

629
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,963
They trusted you and you ran out on them!

630
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,164
What if they needed you?

631
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,403
Just like this dog here...

632
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,241
Needs you.

633
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,920
I think that it's time
that someone let you know

634
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,729
what that feels like.

635
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,809
No!

636
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,569
Help! Help!

637
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,126
Get him up. Get him on his feet.

638
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,969
Get up, you motherfucker.

639
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,680
Nah, nah.

640
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,444
I ain't gonna cut you.

641
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,486
Looks like somebody already did that.

642
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,446
But you will remember me.

643
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,963
You will remember my name.

644
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,602
And the last thing that you will remember

645
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,128
is that you shoulda never
come up against Gilly Martin.

646
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,640
You're a disgrace.

647
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,848
Get this coward out of my sight.

648
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,361
You're dead.

649
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,290
You're dead, too. All of you are dead.

650
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,760
I think you got that wrong.
I think it's you who's dead.

651
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,644
Oh! Whoa! That's a long way down.

652
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,803
Now let him go, Harris.

653
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,731
Harris!

654
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,805
Let him go.

655
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,170
Adiós, stranger.

656
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,486
Let go.

657
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,890
Whoo!

658
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,241
You see him bounce off that rock there?

659
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,800
I didn't see where he landed.

660
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,484
I did. On the bottom.

661
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,682
Well, you better go down there
and make sure he's dead.

662
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,600
You crazy? I'm not climbing down there.

663
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,843
You hear that?
Tubby ain't climbing down there.

664
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,411
Whoo!

665
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,726
Damn!

666
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,840
Hey, you two.

667
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,520
You take his horse and you go
through his bags and you hurry up.

668
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,285
I wanna get back to town
before my dad knows we're gone.

669
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,089
Harris! You gonna stand there
all night or what?

670
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,530
Get outta here!

671
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,850
I'm so sorry.

672
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,402
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

673
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,888
I'm not sure what you'd want me to do.

674
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,363
I could just keep heading down
to Mexico, like we planned.

675
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,125
I know I promised you
that I was done killing.

676
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,402
But I think I'm gonna have
to break that promise.

677
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,643
I'm not done...

678
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,686
Not yet.

679
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,850
And it's not done with me either.

680
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,643
Those men left me with nothing...

681
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,403
I'm gonna leave them with less.

682
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,165
Hey, hold up, boy.

683
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,451
Oh, God.

684
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,891
Don't come any closer.

685
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,362
I thought I took your bullets.

686
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,721
Huh?

687
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,726
I bought more.

688
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,605
What's a priest need so many bullets for?

689
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,691
Sinners.

690
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,684
I'm gonna need your belt.
And I'm taking your mule.

691
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,765
I thought you said you weren't a thief.

692
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,730
Now you're thieving me gun and me mule.

693
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,809
Yeah, times have changed.

694
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,481
Give me that.

695
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,521
What happened to you?

696
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,960
Well, let's just say the Marshal
in Denton wasn't keen to my cause.

697
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,840
Told me I'd need to pay
if I wanted to preach

698
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,400
and said he didn't see the need
for the word of God in his town.

699
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,761
Yeah, well, I bet he didn't.

700
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,810
I tell you, if this country keeps
turning its back on faith,

701
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,240
there'll be nothing worth left saving.

702
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,210
Well, you're right about that,
Father, you are right about that.

703
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,805
This country's all but lost.

704
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,004
You're right about something else, too.

705
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,011
That town back there,
it's full of sinners...

706
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,084
But they don't need saving.

707
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,206
Oh.

708
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,250
Bless you, my son.

709
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,210
This is my father's house.

710
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,246
He's sick.

711
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,521
You got a family?

712
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,366
Not anymore.

713
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,645
They die?

714
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,447
No.

715
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,725
Are you gonna kill those men?

716
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,725
'Cause I could help.

717
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,360
They deserve to die for what they've done to
you and for what they've done to this town.

718
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,727
I could tell you where to find them.
I could do that for you.

719
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,849
The Marshal and Gilly
got everybody scared.

720
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,448
They say if you aren't with
them, you're against them.

721
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,404
And a lotta people here
took that to heart.

722
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,928
There's nobody brave enough
to stand up to them anymore.

723
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,364
You've killed before, haven't you?

724
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,091
What I mean is, you was in wars.

725
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,928
I can tell by the way you don't
wanna look me in the eye.

726
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,124
You don't want me to know
what you're capable of,

727
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,242
but I wanna know,
I wanna know that you'll get them.

728
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,405
After it's done, stay with me
until I bury my father.

729
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,209
Then I'll go with you anywhere, please.

730
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,480
I know how to treat a man.
I know what a husband likes...

731
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,925
Stop it.

732
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,160
Please take me with you,
I need to get outta here.

733
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,160
There are no good men left in this town.

734
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,571
I'm not here to save you.

735
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,604
I'm not here to save anybody.

736
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,043
- Don't say that, you don't have to be alone.
- Yes, I do.

737
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,040
You imagine that you know who I am just
'cause you think everybody outside this town

738
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,320
has it better than you, that other people
somehow aren't suffering the same.

739
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,811
Well, you're wrong about that.

740
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,245
It's a big old world.
Everybody's suffering.

741
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,361
I had a wife named Cathy.

742
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,168
I had a daughter named Abilene

743
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,286
and she was real pretty
and smart, just like you.

744
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,926
- What happened to them?
- I left them.

745
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,010
Now, I'm sorry for the hand
you've been dealt, truly I am.

746
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,720
But I can't stay here
and help you bury your father

747
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,848
and run you off to someplace better.

748
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,803
I'm not the man you see in your head.

749
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,085
I deserted my family the day I enlisted

750
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,567
and I ain't been nothing
but a coward for not going back.

751
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,565
I don't even wanna see their faces,
not after what I've done.

752
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,681
Paul...

753
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,441
You seem like a good girl,
all right, you do, I mean that.

754
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,489
A good man will be proud
to be with a woman like you.

755
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,809
All right, but I'm not
a good man, not anymore.

756
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,845
I'm taking your horse.

757
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,048
You think just because I'm young
I must be naive.

758
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,360
I've spent my whole life helping
people who can't help themselves

759
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,965
and what is there to show for it?

760
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,760
You're not a good man? Well, I am good!

761
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,524
So why should I be punished for that?

762
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,845
You act like everybody's given up on you,
but you've just given up on yourself.

763
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,560
You might be suffering,
but you're not dead, not yet.

764
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,290
You're not even sick
like my father in there.

765
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,530
You could still go back to them,
your family, they'd understand.

766
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,162
I'm sure your wife and daughter
would wanna see you again.

767
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,364
Mary-Anne, how would you feel
about seeing your husband again?

768
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,170
We're not meant to be alone, Paul.

769
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,961
People, we belong together,
just like animals in a herd.

770
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,891
Just like you and Abbie.

771
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,565
Abbie's dead, Mary-Anne.

772
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,891
I wish you well.

773
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,527
Come on.

774
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,730
God damn it, you stink.

775
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,840
Oh. Oh, Jesus. Ellen, sweetheart, will you
make sure that Roy here gets a bath,

776
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,080
I can't even be in the same room with him.

777
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,207
I sure will.

778
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,571
See now, what he's not used
to is the smell of a real man.

779
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,964
I mean, I can make babies with this shit.

780
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,650
- Y'all just don't know.
- Whew!

781
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,291
God, you are sour!

782
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,051
All right, I'm gonna go help Tubby
collect the rest of the taxes.

783
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,880
Maybe later I'll bring you something nice.

784
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,800
Something nice? I'd like that.

785
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,840
I thought you would.
Make sure he don't drown,

786
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,445
he's like a cat to water. I may need him.

787
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,971
I'll see to it.

788
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,240
Ellen!

789
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,969
Ellen, where are you?

790
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,808
Stop shouting,
I'm right here, you're so loud.

791
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,602
What do you want?
I thought you was out with Dad.

792
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,126
I need to talk with you.

793
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,646
He didn't die, did he?

794
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,569
- No, not yet.
- Oh.

795
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,123
- Oh, thank God.
- Not like you'd care.

796
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,971
Mary-Anne, how dare you say
something like that to me.

797
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,800
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that,
but please, it's important.

798
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,240
Roy is in 353 and he needs hot water.

799
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,360
Go warm him up and then we can talk about

800
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,240
whatever nonsense you got
in your mind this time.

801
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,482
I'll be in our room.
Don't let that man get cold.

802
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,484
- Ellen!
- Nope.

803
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,320
Fine, I'll get him the damn water.

804
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,731
And a shave kit.

805
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,249
His chin is looking like
a nasty old billy goat.

806
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,524
And don't you dare tell him I said that.

807
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,889
Yeah, what is it?

808
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,048
Got some more hot water
and a kit for a shave.

809
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,050
Yeah, well, bring it in.

810
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,646
Oh, I feel real good.

811
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,440
How old are you now?

812
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,090
- Sixteen.
- Oh.

813
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,080
You know that husband of yours
never coming back, right?

814
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,003
I mean, you're old enough
to know that by now.

815
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,880
Yes, sir.

816
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,247
You're real pretty, like your sister.

817
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,129
You ought to find a new man.

818
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,722
One with connections...

819
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,291
And a home outside of this hotel.

820
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,410
You know, you don't wanna wait
till your looks grow out.

821
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,641
No shave today.
I think I'll keep the beard.

822
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,128
You back already?

823
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,843
Why don't you just...

824
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,048
Slip that little dress of yours off

825
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,521
and climb right into the tub here with me?

826
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,723
The water's real nice.

827
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,044
I don't want you to be shy.

828
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,407
Mmm.

829
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,640
Oh.

830
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,449
I said no shave today.

831
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,280
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

832
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,681
Put your arms in the tub.
Put your arms in the water.

833
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,489
I told you I'd find you, didn't I?

834
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:28,488
And before you start asking for anything,
there's not gonna be any sympathy today.

835
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,765
Now get your arms back in the water.

836
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,286
Put 'em in the water.

837
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,561
Now listen to me.

838
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,249
I didn't come here today
with any compassion at all.

839
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,323
The four of you killed my dog
and you tried to kill me.

840
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,161
Now, it was a mistake to leave me alive.

841
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,240
I'm not gonna make that mistake.

842
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,085
I've killed more human beings
than I care to remember.

843
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,365
And I will not hesitate

844
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,647
or quit until the four
of you are in the dirt.

845
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,520
Now take a deep breath.
And that's your last.

846
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,724
Mary-Anne, what's goin' on?

847
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,683
Mary-Anne? Mary-Anne?

848
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,921
Mary-Anne, what is it?

849
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,241
Oh, my God.

850
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,450
Oh, my God. Roy.

851
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,801
Roy?

852
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,007
Oh, Lord.

853
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,561
Tubby, catch your breath somewhere else
and get away from the goddamn window.

854
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,931
Yes, sir.

855
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,481
- What happened?
- You went after that man, didn't ya?

856
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,080
I told you not to.
I made it perfectly clear

857
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,160
that you were not to
aggravate the situation.

858
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,680
But ya did, didn't ya? All of ya did.

859
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,444
We couldn't let him
get away with what he did.

860
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,160
- It would have made us look weak.
- Weak?

861
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,320
Stop. Stop. Stop.

862
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,324
- You think that I let him go 'cause I'm weak?
- No.

863
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,401
Look at this.

864
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,600
That's not done by an angry drunk
or a minor that has a sense of entitlement.

865
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,284
This was done by a military man.

866
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,720
A man trained to kill by one of the most
ruthless divisions our country has ever seen.

867
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,600
Something you would know nothin' about.

868
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,840
And you think just 'cause you got a prick
and a pistol you can kill somebody?

869
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,320
Well, get a look at death.

870
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,840
Take a look at it.

871
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,724
If you'd done what I said, Roy wouldn't
be breathing out of his neck right now.

872
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,089
Give me that cane.

873
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,884
Stop. Just stop!

874
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,808
Marshal.

875
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,206
- Stop it!
- Marshal!

876
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,720
We thought he was dead. Honest.
I don't know how he could've survived.

877
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,840
I told you we should have
gone down there, made sure.

878
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,570
Oh, shut up. Both of you.

879
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,160
Y'all should have known better than to let
him get away with something like this.

880
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:03,046
Why the hell am I even paying you?
Now, which one of you girls seen him?

881
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,000
Well, we both did.

882
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,320
- He have a gun?
- I don't know.

883
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,440
It happened so fast. All I saw was blood.

884
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,761
Mary-Anne, did you see if he
had a gun? Mary-Anne?

885
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,850
I don't know.

886
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,290
Now, think hard.
It's important you say the right thing.

887
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,729
People's lives are depending on it.

888
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,605
I don't know, Marshal. Honest.

889
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,520
All right. Harris,
get over to the jailhouse.

890
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,967
Lock up all the guns
and get up on the roof with a rifle.

891
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,680
Now, if we're lucky, he's not armed.

892
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,570
But if he is, it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

893
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,765
Now, Gilly, you make sure
you get them girls someplace safe.

894
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,610
And Tubby, you come with me.

895
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,849
Why do I have to stay with the women?

896
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,686
You almost got us all killed today.

897
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,240
Now, I would appreciate it if you
didn't act on every idiotic thought

898
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,369
that comes into your mind
and just do what I say from now on.

899
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,560
We don't know if this man is deranged.
We don't know what he's done.

900
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,240
Anybody could be next including
the women. So get them safe.

901
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,970
Now! Get!

902
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,404
Move!

903
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,765
Marshal, what about Roy?

904
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,289
We don't have time to dig a hole.
Let's just let him soak.

905
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:14,042
Now, if he's out there and he's got a gun,
most likely one of us is gonna take a bullet.

906
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,771
And since I've already been shot
in this life, I think you ought to go first.

907
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,205
Why do we have to go out there?

908
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,000
Because you don't run from battle
with a man like this.

909
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,684
Hesitation will get you killed.

910
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,640
It's the stick or the whip.

911
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,320
Either way I want a fighting chance.

912
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,200
And I've got a shotgun waiting for me
in that jailhouse and I intend to use it.

913
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,325
So, you go from door to door and make
sure he ain't hiding out with anybody.

914
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,725
Now we gotta move fast.

915
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,520
We ain't gonna wait here to die.

916
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,570
We're gonna take it to him.
Do you understand what I mean?

917
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,605
Yes, sir.

918
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,207
Now, you be careful
'cause you're a big target.

919
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,880
Gilly, why is this happening?

920
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,962
God, that man, he was covered in blood.

921
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,760
Looked like he had on red gloves.

922
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,800
Why would he do that? Poor Roy.

923
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,451
- Poor Roy. He didn't deserve this...
- Ellen. Ellen...

924
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,331
Be quiet.

925
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,200
I need to think right now.

926
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,682
And you are grinding down my ears
with all of your babbling.

927
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,000
My babbling? My babbling?

928
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,242
Gilly, he almost took Roy's head off.

929
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,200
I know, Ellen. I saw.

930
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,080
I looked down his throat.

931
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,488
But you going on and on about it
ain't helping me sort any of this out.

932
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,566
You're gonna kill him, right?

933
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,008
You and the others, I mean,
he can't get away with this.

934
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,400
- He can't.
- Ellen...

935
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,480
- What did I just say?
- Or maybe he's gone.

936
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,211
Maybe he killed Roy and he just moved on.

937
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,604
Yeah. Yeah. We don't know
for sure that he's even still here.

938
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,165
He's not moving on.

939
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,371
They killed his dog.

940
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,444
- What?
- That's why he's back.

941
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,286
That's why Roy's dead.

942
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,440
He's not going anywhere
until he gets even with all of you.

943
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,010
You shouldn't have done what you done.

944
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,690
How did you know about that?

945
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,210
How did you know about his dog?

946
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,842
You talked to him, didn't you?

947
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,880
- Are you helping him?
- Mary-Anne,

948
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,644
is that what you
were trying to tell me earlier?

949
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,520
You knew this man was coming?

950
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,920
You knew this would happen,
and you didn't say nothing?

951
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,729
I did say something. You didn't listen.

952
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,683
Gilly, Gilly. Gilly!

953
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,331
Shut up, Ellen!

954
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,531
I'm talking to your sister.

955
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,687
Now, are you helping him?

956
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:44,363
You answer me. Are you helping him?

957
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,728
No. He didn't want my help.

958
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,885
But I would have, though.

959
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,246
Gilly! Gilly! No.

960
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,480
Ellen, get off of me.

961
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,729
Enough!

962
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,360
Enough.

963
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,000
I should shoot the both of you right now.

964
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,920
But I need all the fucking bullets
that I have in this gun

965
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,560
for that asshole out there.

966
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,964
So you lie there and you ache.
And you lie there and you bleed.

967
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,082
But the both of you, please shut up.

968
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,480
All clear now.

969
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,720
And just move on
down the line like I said.

970
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,167
Do it quick 'cause
I'll be right behind you.

971
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,361
And you're sweatin' a lot. You all right?

972
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,321
You're not gonna pass out on me
or nothin', are you?

973
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,889
No, sir.

974
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,723
I just sweat sometimes
on account of my biology.

975
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,485
Shoot 'em.

976
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,845
Shoot 'em both.

977
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,727
Mister...

978
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,691
I'm real sorry for what we done.

979
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,403
I told Gilly, but he just wouldn't listen.

980
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,288
He ain't reasonable when he's like that.

981
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,844
But you remember, though, right?

982
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,362
You remember I didn't
want to do this to you.

983
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,730
Shoot 'em...

984
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,927
Or I'll shoot you.

985
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,528
On a count of three now.

986
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,286
Yes, sir.

987
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,761
You can do this.

988
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,640
Yes, sir.

989
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,210
Move straight out.

990
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,001
Yes, sir.

991
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,840
All right.

992
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,126
One.

993
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,441
Two.

994
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,921
Yes, sir.

995
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,760
Three.

996
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,920
Go.

997
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,161
Go.

998
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,765
No!

999
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,280
What are you doing?

1000
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,280
That's Tubby, God damn it!

1001
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,440
Don't shoot.

1002
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,646
What the...

1003
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,241
Tubby, you hit?

1004
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,728
Shoot them now.

1005
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,520
They're getting away.

1006
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,045
Shoot them.

1007
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,560
Come on. Get up!

1008
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,688
I can't, I don't want to die.

1009
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,000
Look, I don't want to die neither.

1010
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,567
Ahh!

1011
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,280
- Ow!
- Get up!

1012
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,007
I can't.

1013
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,565
I can't shoot 'em.

1014
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,651
I know there's not
a lot of dignity in this.

1015
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,129
But I have a daughter
I'd like to see again.

1016
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,643
But I don't suppose I ever will.

1017
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,200
Harris?

1018
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,369
Get away from the window.

1019
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,687
He's still on the roof. We can trap him.

1020
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,400
You move in front of the building.
I'll cut him off in the back.

1021
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,608
But we got to move fast.
This is our only chance. We can't blow it.

1022
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,120
Shoot.

1023
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,051
Did I get you?

1024
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,400
No!

1025
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,688
I'm not here for you, Marshal.

1026
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,686
I'm here for the men who killed my dog!

1027
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,406
Shit.

1028
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,969
God damn it, Gilly.

1029
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,122
Well, I didn't know about that.

1030
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,361
But I can't allow this to go on.

1031
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,600
Now, I wouldn't be much of a father
if I let you kill my son.

1032
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:51,844
And I wouldn't be much of a marshal
if I let you kill anyone else.

1033
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,763
Well, if you get in my way,
I'm gonna take you down.

1034
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,920
Yeah.

1035
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,809
I suppose you will.

1036
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,329
Well, the feeling's mutual.

1037
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,049
Tubby, how long does it take you

1038
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,600
to get your fat ass around that building?

1039
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,369
I'm coming to get you.

1040
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,124
I'm coming to get you.

1041
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,201
Shit.

1042
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,720
- That's it. I'm going out there.
- No. No.

1043
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,131
No, you can't leave us here.

1044
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,440
The hell I can't.

1045
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,360
He's not after you, he's after me.

1046
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,761
- She said it, you remember?
- He's crazy.

1047
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,840
And the Marshal told you to protect us.

1048
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,606
And I'm your fiancée,
you don't just up and leave your fiancée.

1049
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,360
Ellen, right now I wouldn't care

1050
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,440
if you were the tip of my dick!

1051
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,720
I am going out there.

1052
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,880
You forget about what my dad said,

1053
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,000
because he doesn't care
about either of you.

1054
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,240
He just doesn't think
that I can handle it on my own.

1055
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,040
But I'm gonna end it, and I am gonna
prove to him what I am capable of!

1056
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,680
Now you get away from the door
before I put another hole in you.

1057
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,125
Move!

1058
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,891
Gilly,

1059
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,805
I'm pregnant.

1060
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,086
Please don't leave me alone here.

1061
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,325
I can't lose you.

1062
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,641
I can't have this baby all by myself.

1063
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:54,050
Uh... I need you?

1064
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,121
Ellen.

1065
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,763
Do you honestly think

1066
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,840
that now is the right time
for this conversation?

1067
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,720
Are you seriously
bringing this up right now?

1068
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,080
Yes.

1069
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,960
There is a man outside who is
systematically trying to kill

1070
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,640
everyone that I know, including my father!

1071
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,680
And you've decided that now is a good time

1072
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,047
to tell me that you are pregnant?

1073
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,760
- Gilly. Gilly.
- Ellen!

1074
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,000
- Come on. Why?
- Ellen!

1075
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,366
Stop talking.

1076
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,365
The worst thing that you could do
right now is to say another word.

1077
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,920
Let him go, Ellen.

1078
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,200
He wants to die, let him.

1079
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,280
You know what?
Maybe I can spare one more bullet.

1080
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,720
No, no, please. Please, Gilly, don't.

1081
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,680
I love you, I love you,
I'm just so scared.

1082
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,200
I'm scared, please.

1083
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,611
Please.

1084
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,926
There is no denying
that the two of you are related.

1085
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,488
You truly are pathetic.

1086
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,770
Both of you.

1087
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,040
What the hell's wrong with you?

1088
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,800
Couldn't you hear me yelling out there, waiting
for your fat ass to get around the building?

1089
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,360
Get away from the window!

1090
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,329
How many times do I got to tell you?

1091
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,480
- Tubby!
- It's Harris's face.

1092
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,720
It's gone.

1093
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,960
What?

1094
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,166
His whole face is gone.

1095
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,640
What are we gonna tell his wife and kid?

1096
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,961
How are we gonna tell them
he got no face no more?

1097
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,200
And Roy?

1098
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,363
He's up there pruning
in a tub of his own blood.

1099
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,121
I can't do this, Marshal.

1100
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,000
I'm sorry.

1101
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,160
- I just can't.
- Okay.

1102
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,526
It's a lot to take.

1103
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,568
I didn't know it would be like this.

1104
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,920
All right, now, Tubby.

1105
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,320
Stop calling me Tubby!

1106
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,400
I don't want to be called that anymore.

1107
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,760
I'm not even that fat!

1108
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,366
You all act like all I do
is sit around eating all day.

1109
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,880
I don't! I work!

1110
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,040
And I eat less than you all.

1111
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,168
This is just the way God made me.

1112
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,680
And I accept that.

1113
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,090
But if I'm gonna die here today,
I am not gonna be called Tubby.

1114
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,800
I mean it!

1115
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:32,520
Now, look, I will call you whatever
you want if we just get through this.

1116
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,760
But please...

1117
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,000
Lawrence!

1118
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,811
My name is Lawrence!

1119
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,160
All right, Lawrence.

1120
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,720
Larry, please, for the love of God,

1121
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,320
get away from the goddamn window!

1122
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,760
Fuck!

1123
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,080
Son of a bitch!

1124
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,960
Marshal!

1125
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,611
This doesn't have to concern you.

1126
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,962
You don't have to die today.

1127
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,840
But you're gonna have
to have a real good long think

1128
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,764
about where you stand from here on out.

1129
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,280
Come on, come on, come on, you cocksucker.

1130
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,124
Just let me see your face.

1131
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,046
All right. I'm beat. Let's talk.

1132
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,201
But if I come out, are you gonna
talk or are you gonna shoot?

1133
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,964
I'm prepared for both.

1134
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,284
Well, that doesn't
make me feel comfortable.

1135
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,920
Well, you got a gun, Marshal?

1136
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,048
You know I do.

1137
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,084
Better leave it behind.

1138
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,725
Well, if I come out unarmed,
how do I know you won't shoot?

1139
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,444
Well, you don't.

1140
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,369
What better option you got?

1141
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,049
Well, I can see your point.

1142
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,210
No gun.

1143
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,804
No gun.

1144
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,483
What the hell is he doing?

1145
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,726
Where's your son?

1146
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,840
I don't know.

1147
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,641
But I just don't want anyone else hurt.

1148
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,043
Now you got to know that this is
a deeply embarrassing moment for me.

1149
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,320
But I've done the right thing by surrendering
and I hope that you do the same.

1150
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,164
I wasn't planning on it.

1151
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,683
Now, look, I know my son
and the others have done you wrong.

1152
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,320
And I know you want my boy dead.

1153
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,320
But that ain't gonna bring your dog back,

1154
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,000
no more than I could regrow my leg.

1155
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:34,563
So let's stop the killing
and let's be reasonable.

1156
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,809
Reasonable?

1157
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,169
That how you run this town?

1158
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,160
Well, now, you don't know
nothing about that.

1159
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,440
This town needs me.

1160
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,284
This town wouldn't be
standing here without me.

1161
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:49,844
These people need a leader.

1162
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,800
Now, they don't always like it,
but they can't survive without it.

1163
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,640
Now, you ought to remember that, soldier.

1164
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,120
Now, come on.

1165
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,441
Leaders are chosen, Marshal.

1166
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,569
You ain't given nobody a choice.

1167
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,731
Your son?

1168
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,170
He killed my dog.

1169
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,881
So now, I ain't got no choice.

1170
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,880
- All right, enough talking, Dad!
- Whoa! Whoa! Now, hey!

1171
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,920
No! I said I got it
and you get out of the way!

1172
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,360
No. Stand back, Gilly!

1173
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,880
Now, both of you all put your guns down.

1174
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,640
Now, that's enough is enough!

1175
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,247
You're just saying that
because he's got you beat.

1176
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:32,206
He thinks he won, but he ain't won shit,
not while I'm still here.

1177
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,880
Gilly! Put your guns down!

1178
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,121
No, he'll shoot me!

1179
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,280
He won't shoot you!

1180
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,930
Now look, we can stop all of this.

1181
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,760
No, he killed Roy,
and then he killed Harris.

1182
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,160
He killed Tubby, and I'm not
gonna let him get away with it.

1183
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,960
He's got to die for what he did!

1184
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,246
He does not have to die.

1185
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,760
Nobody's got to die.

1186
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,451
Now, look, I'm begging you,
don't shoot my son.

1187
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,480
The time for begging is over.

1188
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,528
Now's the time for praying.

1189
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,800
Well, don't worry, Dad,
everything is under control.

1190
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,882
You just step away.

1191
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,880
Just can I... Just let me talk to him.

1192
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,928
Just let me talk to him.

1193
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,162
No. We're done talking.

1194
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,726
Dad.

1195
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,326
Dad.

1196
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,361
You all saw what he did!

1197
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,171
He did this!

1198
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,804
He killed him!

1199
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,521
This is all his fault!

1200
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:58,407
And anyone who helps that man
is as good as dead!

1201
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,040
Now, where the fuck are you?

1202
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,168
Where the fuck are you?

1203
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,331
Lady?

1204
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,566
What are you doing here, huh?

1205
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,965
What are you doing here?

1206
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,920
Shit.

1207
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,801
What do you say we get out of here, huh?

1208
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,365
Give me a second.

1209
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,203
Move!

1210
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,604
Where are you?

1211
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,203
I know you're in here.

1212
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,971
Now,

1213
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,005
you show your face, you coward.

1214
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,560
Why did you kill my dog?

1215
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,847
Why would you do that?

1216
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,287
Why would you hurt my dog?

1217
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,331
No! No!

1218
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,520
Stop, please! Please, not again.

1219
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,285
Please, stop! Please, stop!

1220
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,160
I don't want to die!

1221
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,083
Please, get off of me.

1222
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,881
Come on. Come on.

1223
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,923
I told you I could help you.

1224
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:05,641
Hey, now.

1225
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,804
Gilly? Gilly? Where are you?

1226
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,481
Gilly?

1227
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,760
Through this holy anointing may the Lord

1228
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,851
in his love and his mercy help you
with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

1229
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,642
May the Lord who sets us free...

1230
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:45,440
You ought to stick around
a while this time, Father.

1231
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,602
We could all use a little saving.

1232
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,365
It's okay, I got you.

1233
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,925
Let's just get inside.

1233

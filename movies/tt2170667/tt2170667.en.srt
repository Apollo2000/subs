<i>He owned the most beautiful
car in the world.</i>

16

<i>A 1969 cherry red Buick
Skylark convertible.</i>

00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:18,469
<i>He promised me that one day,
that car would be mine.</i>

18
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:25,211

Thank you sir,

00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:29,280
Thank you so much. Have you
tried the cheese pizza here?

29
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,350
It's delicious.

30
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:09,286
Hello?

31
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,823
Hello?

00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,992
Mickey?

33
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:18,060
Mickey.

34
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,868
Don't lie to me Karen! What the
hell you doing around the house,

35
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,738
all day long while I'm out there
putting my ass on the line!

36
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,005
You're being paranoid!

37
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,510
Paranoid of what?

38
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,925
She's gone, honey.

39
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,830
She took your brother.

40
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:07,978
Rescue 911.

41
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,881
Hi, this is an emergency.

42
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,920
What is
your emergency, sir?

43
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:22,060
Yeah, I heard some screams
coming from 317 Bentley Avenue.

44
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:27,132
Sir, we have that listed as
the location that you're calling from.

45
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:30,402
Yeah, well I know that is
where I'm calling from.

46
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:31,639
Okay.

47
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,677
Look, I'm gonna slit my wrists.

48
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:41,114
So can you be here in, I don't
know, approximately 30 minutes?

49
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:43,116
Sir, I don't know
what's going on.

50
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:45,619
But slitting your
wrists is not the answer.

51
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,688
Well that's-that's,
uh-peachy.

52
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,056
Okay. Sir.

53
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,191
Alright, have a nice day.

54
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,494
Sir, I need you to
stay on the line with...

55
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:17,815
Now look Mickey,

56
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:21,952
Some people feel like they have
no control over their lives,

57
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:24,892
When they actually have
control over everything.

58
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,226
Everybody makes mistakes.

59
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,863
Trust me, I have.

60
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:35,098
But you gotta learn how to pick
yourself up off the ground.

61
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,470
Keep going.

62
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:43,242
I know what you've been through can
have a crippling effect on a man.

63
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:47,578
I want you to know that you can
always come back to the center.

64
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,517
The door is always open.

65
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:57,025
Alright, here you go.

66
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,698
Take care of yourself, Mickey.

67
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,685
<i>What a crock of shit.</i>

68
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,269
Hey! Stop!

69
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:47,072
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

70
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,748
Holly shit!!

71
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,011
Oh my god!
Someone call 911!

72
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:22,001
<i>After all of the times I
had tried to end my life,</i>

73
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:25,374
<i>I had finally realized
that I needed help.</i>

74
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,116
<i>I couldn't do it alone.</i>

75
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,935
<i>I needed to find someone who
would do anything for money.</i>

76
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:04,082
<i>Someone who didn't care
about anything anymore.</i>

77
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,152
<i>And that's when I met...</i>

78
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,554
<i>Drake.</i>

79
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:14,190
Ahhhh!!!

80
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:17,026
Please, I need money for
my medicine. Please!

81
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,494
- Help! Please help me!
- Hang on. Here.

82
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:22,900
I'm fucking dying here! I need
some money for my medicine, man!

83
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,068
Here's twenty bucks.
Here's twenty bucks.

84
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,470
Jesus. Here, let me help you up.

85
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,407
Gett your fucking hands off of me!
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

86
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,975
- Fucking asshole!
- What's wrong with me?

87
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,210
Fuck you! Mother fucker!

88
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,348
You fucking son of
a fucking bitch!

89
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,885
Fucking asshole.

90
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,999
Let me get a beer.

91
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,971
Let's play a little man
pool. Huh? A little money game.

92
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:00,971
Ten bucks.

93
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,274
Ten bucks? What
is this, high school?

94
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:08,446
I'll take the first ten and then
we'll do another ten

95
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,615
and so on and so forth
until you're fucking broke.

96
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,820
Get a partner.

97
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,486
Hey numb legs, you
wanna play some pool?

98
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,557
Let's go. Let's do it.
Come on.

99
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,725
I'd love to.

100
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:25,130
Alright! It's the cripples
versus the big, bad, bikers.

101
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,866
Hey, uh, I need you to, uh,
I need you to shoot me.

102
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,037
Yeah, yeah. You
can break. Here.

103
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,973
Get your money down!

104
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,476
Roller Derby in town.

105
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:39,345
Get that money on the table.
Stop squawking.

106
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:42,181
Come on. Let's play.

107
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:45,484
I almost forgot. I saw
a sweet looking 1200

108
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,655
outside. Gotta be one of yours.
Whose bike?

109
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:49,989
That's my bike.

110
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,657
That's your bike? Man.

111
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,261
Who the fuck colors
their bike that way?

112
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:57,930
You god damn must be some
kind of faggot. You a faggot?

113
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,267
What? Have you lost
your mother fucking mind?

114
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,570
You're a faggot mother fucker!

115
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,070
Nice shot cripple.

116
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:07,174
Who the fuck you calling
cripple mother fucker!

117
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,312

Get off Chino's table.

123
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,032
Get the fuck off Chino's
table! God damn it!

124
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:33,368
You do not get
on his fucking table!

125
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,406
That was fucking great!

126
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:40,942
Yeah. You got a bad cut on your face.
You should get that looked at.

127
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:42,377
Ah, shit happens.

128
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,883
Hey, I'll give you five hundred
dollars if you shoot me.

129
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:55,026
Where's the gun?

130
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:11,641
Where do you want it?

131
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,544
I want you to shoot
me in the head.

132
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:15,980
Shit.

133
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:18,348
You really want me to kill you?

134
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,317
Yeah, man. What did
you think I meant?

135
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:22,618
I thought maybe wound you.

136
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,520
Come on, man.

137
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:25,992
Will you help me out?

138
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,097
Okay.

139
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,066
What's your name?

140
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:37,070
Mickey.

141
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:47,547
Okay, Mick. My name is Drake.

142
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,782
What are you doing?

143
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:54,518
I am going to shoot you in the
face, What do you think I'm doing?

144
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,656
No, No. I don't want my face to get messed
up. Shoot me in the back of the head.

145
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,426
Your face is gonna explode if I
shoot you in the back of the head.

146
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,061
No, it won't.

147
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,033
Look, the bullet enters the back of the
head clean, whent comes out the front

148
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:11,569
your head explodes, and huge chunks
of brain and skull come flying out.

149
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,306
Okay, look.

150
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,079
I just don't want to see it coming. Ok.
So just shoot men the back of the head.

151
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:22,451
Okay.

152
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,288
Here we go.

153
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:33,692
Wait a second.

154
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,231
Where's the money?

155
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:41,101
Just shoot me, then
take the money and go.

156
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,236
No. I need to see the money.

157
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:46,205
You might not even have it!

158
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:49,077
Or you do have it and
then I shoot you and then what?

159
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,412
I am searching through your
brains and skull for the money,

160
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:53,647
and then I find it
and it's soaked in blood!

161
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:55,583
I'm not gonna just give
you the money, and then

162
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:57,551
you wound me in the leg
and just take off!

163
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,820
What the fuck good would it do
if I wounded you in the leg?

164
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,088
My arm, my leg, whatever.

165
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,125
What's stopping me from taking
your God damn money right now?

166
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,730
Okay. Alright.

167
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,700
Look. I have the money.

168
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,103
I'll hold it in my hand.

169
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,637
You shoot me, the money
falls our of my hand, and

170
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,474
then you just pick it up.
And then you just take off.

171
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,776
Okay. I like that. Okay.

172
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:22,444
- Do you want to pray or something?
- No...

173
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:29,350
Ah! It burns!

174
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:31,486
What the fuck just happened?

175
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:32,887
I don't know, just
finish me off.

176
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,632
Stop it. Something's wrong, stop
it. Something's wrong! Stop it!

177
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:49,438
These are fucking
blanks, man. You idiot!

178
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,706
Give me my money!

179
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,876
Screw you, buddy!

180
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,645
Seriously dickhead! There's
blanks in that gun!

181
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:57,116
I know that!

182
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,753
What are we gonna do now, huh?

183
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:07,323
You owe me at least 100 bucks
for the attempted execution.

184
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,926
There's no execution,
there's no money.

185
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:11,462
I went through the same premeditation
as if I had killed you.

186
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:12,763
You didn't even stop and think!

187
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,668
There was a hesitation.

188
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:25,246
I tell you what. I'm sorry
you're not dead, okay?

189
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:39,256
I'll tell you something else,
I'm a make this up to you.

190
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:45,397
I know this great place with
these En Vogue prostitutes.

191
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:50,303
I don't want prostitutes.
They have HIV clusters.

192
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:54,910
30 seconds ago you were gonna have me
shoot you in theack of the fucking head.

193
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:03,851
Where is this place?

194
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,861
So you're telling me, you've
never been with a prostitute?

195
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,630
Yeah, that's a no.

196
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,932
These are En Vogue prostitutes.

197
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,403
Amazing.

198
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,371
Want to hit this?

199
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:25,775
No, thanks. I'm good.

200
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,413
Maybe it's past your bedtime.
You better get home.

201
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:35,386
Alright. Give me some of that.

202
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,895
Thanks for jumping
in back there.

203
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,731
Yeah, you got it.

204
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,668
So how'd you end
up in the chair?

205
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,606
I was putting up
Christmas lights.

206
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,812
Easy, easy, easy.

207
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:07,548
My legs. Dad. My Legs.

208
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,321
It's okay, don't move.

209
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:14,789
You fell off a roof?

210
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,824
Yeah.

211
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,294
Fuck. I'm sorry, man.

212
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:21,563
It's okay. What about you?
What happened to you?

213
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:22,665
Oh my!

214
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh my God, you are
feeling the Drake!

215
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:26,303
God damn it!

216
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,605
Oh shit!

217
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,573
Son of a bitch.

218
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:36,046
Fucking bitch.

219
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:40,916
Fortunately, the guy missed my
nuts and only hit me in the spine.

220
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,885
Did your dick get all fucked up?

221
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,924
No! Fuck no!

222
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:49,760
I just said I didn't
get hit there.

223
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:52,031
I can still fuck
with the best of em!

224
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:06,543
So what do I do? I just
hand them the money, or...

225
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:08,712
- Yeah, you just...
- Hello?

226
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:11,817
Hey! It's your favorite vet.

227
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,984
Come on in, soldier.

228
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:16,824
Showtime, Mick.

229
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,426
So yeah, you just
hand them the money.

230
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh! And they think I was
shot saving some guy.

231
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,734
Should I make something up?

232
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:30,970
Yeah, if you want to.

233
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:34,138
Like I was a police officer
and I was shot, or something?

234
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,377
No, no. That's too common,
it's been done before.

235
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,548
Think of something more
original.

236
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,782
So how do I look?

237
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:47,153
- Good.
- Huh? Yeah?

238
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:49,755
Hello, hero.

239
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:52,925
Hey, hey, hey gorgeous.

240
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:00,501
So, who's the cutie?

241
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:04,506
He's a friend of mine. Yeah,
he's an ex stunt man.

242
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:08,878
Well, nice to meet
you, Hollywood.

243
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,045
It's nice to meet you.

244
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,015
You must be here
for my roommate.

245
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,620
Hold on a second.

246
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:25,795
Oh, man. You are
going to love this.

247
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:33,436
What the fuck am I
supposed to do?

248
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:43,477
I'm still wearing my catheter,
and I think it's full.

249
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,813
Good luck.

250
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,816
She'll be ready in a minute.

251
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,451
You ready, baby?

252
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:50,488
Oh yeah!

253
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:55,791
Go get 'em champ!

254
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:06,234
Hi.

255
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:09,537
Don't turn around.

256
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:14,006
What's your name?

257
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:16,974
My name is Mickey.

258
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:20,312
Well, Mickey, I...

259
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:23,950
Oh my God, what
happened to your face?

260
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:27,589
Here. Get on the bed, we'll
get you cleaned up.

261
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:39,731
You know, I've had
plenty of wounds.

262
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:40,799
Yeah.

263
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:43,569
I was a stunt man.

264
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,139
That's fancy.

265
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:54,985
I am gonna put this on your chin, it's
probably gonna sting a little bit.

266
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:06,626
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

267
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:09,131
No, it felt good.

268
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,136
You're funny.

269
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,774
Let me get you bandaged up.

270
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,878
You should be as good as new.

271
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:25,550
Cuite Pie.

272
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,097
Yeah, well. It's $100 an hour.

273
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:43,568
Okay.

274
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,906
No problemo.

275
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,350
You want some coke?

276
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,221
No, thank you. I'm not thirsty.

277
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,793
Never heard that one before.

278
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:25,279
Okay.

279
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,447
Yeah?

280
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:31,951
Okay, great. Here you go.

281
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:43,162
Just inhale as
deeply as you can.

282
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,802
Very good job.

283
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,704
I gotta win this game, right?

284
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:55,239
So I wind back, I cock back,
like a shotgun and I just

285
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:59,079
explode these pool balls, and
they go all over the place.

286
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:04,184
These guys are
big. They're big.

287
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,253
Are you gonna do that line?
Or...

288
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:13,325
I take a look at them, dead
square in the face and I said-

289
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,997
Fuck you, pal.

290
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:24,170
Once you take Mickey
out of the cage,

291
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:26,409
he's tough to get back in.

292
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:39,053
I'm finished, let's go!

293
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:41,287
Fuck you! You fucking
dick-less prick!

294
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,758
You're being
a fucking bitch!

295
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,295
I'll see you around?

296
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:48,297
Let's go!

297
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:55,238
What's your name?

298
00:28:58,274 --> 00:29:00,776
Janet.

299
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,210
Alright look.

300
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:06,147
Mick, I'm not gonna fuck
with you on this one, okay?

301
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:08,549
Here's the deal.

302
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,051
You stay calm.

303
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,989
You don't look him in the eye.

304
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:21,061
And most importantly, you don't say
anything stupid, and we will be fine.

305
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:23,132
What would I say that's stupid?

306
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:25,867
Alright, what you're saying
right now, is stupid.

307
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,105
This guy will end us, in
two fucking seconds, okay,

308
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:31,941
if you make a Faggedy
Andy comment like that.

309
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:34,510
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

310
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:38,783
Just keep your mouth shut. Alright,
And let me do the talking.

311
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:41,349
Now, give me the money.

312
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,152
What for?

313
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,453
Mick, weren't you
paying attention?

314
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:46,522
Yeah, I was paying attention.

315
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:48,826
Okay, if you were paying
such close attention.

316
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,060
- What do we need the money for?
- You need it for drugs.

317
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:54,932
Ding! Ding! Ding! Mickey's
the big fucking winner!

318
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:58,367
And what has he won, Drake?
Oh! An all expenses paid

319
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:02,138
trip to Heroine Land! The
most happiest place on Earth!

320
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,040
I don't want to do any Heroine.

321
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:06,346
We're doing speed balls.

322
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:09,479
What's a speed ball?

323
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:13,283
Coke and Heroine.
The best there is.

324
00:30:13,285 --> 00:30:16,221
Look, it's not all for us.
200 for the smack,

325
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:18,926
150 for the coke. Keeps
the girls happy.

326
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:22,527
It's gonna keep the girls happy?

327
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,462
You want Janet to
like you, right?

328
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:26,531
Yeah.

329
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,368
Ok. Look. We buy the stuff, we both try it.
And then we party with the girls,

330
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,870
and then later on tonight,
I'll go home and get a bullet

331
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,207
I'll off you myself personally.

332
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,645
For free this time.

333
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:41,146
- Yeah?
- Okay.

334
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:42,851
Let's do this.

335
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:55,927
Alright, give me the money
before he gets here.

336
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,133
Just give me the fucking money.

337
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:07,474
Who's the new guy?

338
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:12,478
Well, I wanted you to meet
colleague of mine. This is Mickey.

339
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,481
Right.

340
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,462
No, not you. I don't know you.

341
00:31:28,698 --> 00:31:32,533
You want a doughnut? We
got sprinkles, chocolate.

342
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:36,938
You must be outta your fucking
mind bringing someone to my house.

343
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,672
Nah man, he's cool.

344
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:42,144
You know I miss when you
used to wear a suit.

345
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,515
What do we got here?

346
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:47,652
350 cash.

347
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:52,353
Interesting.

348
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:54,456
Elvis] That and no bundle right?

349
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,324
Both.

350
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:58,994
We've already been through
this, you can't have both.

351
00:31:58,996 --> 00:31:59,998
Both.

352
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:02,997
Ah!!

353
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,301
You can't have both.

354
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,505
You can have your bundle.

355
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,012
Or you can have that.

356
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:17,348
Let her go.

357
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,367
Come on in.

358
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,314
Hey, I have a gift for
you. Brand new rig.

359
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:51,347
So you live here?

360
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,751
Fuck no, man. I have house
in the hills with a pool,

361
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,653
view of the city.

362
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,992
I just use this as my station.

363
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:08,502
Shit, go ahead. It's little
primer, little primer.

364
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:16,340
Yes, come on lil'
precious, come out.

365
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:17,342
You have a pet rabbit.

366
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:20,310
Aw yeah, this is Maritza,
let's meet Mickey

367
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,714
Rabbits are fucking cool.

368
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,151
Fuck yeah they are.

369
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,055
Ya know, if anyone ever
hurt this little baby,

370
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:32,491
I'd take this knife and
cut out their eyes.

371
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:38,066
Isn't that right my little baby?
Yes I would, I'd fucking kill 'em.

372
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:52,079
Feel that?

373
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:52,948
Huh, sweet.

374
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:59,154
Alright Mick, time to
get your sea legs.

375
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:03,059
<i>How can I explain it?</i>

376
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:12,135
<i>When you're at the bottom,
you can only go up.</i>

377
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,583
<i>I have been looking for a
reason to kill myself.</i>

378
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,492
<i>And as twisted, and as
messed up as it sounds,</i>

379
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:46,470
<i>now I've finally found
a reason to live.</i>

380
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,363
<i>If I could compare
heroin to anything,</i>

381
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:18,571
<i>I would compare it</i>

382
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:27,514
<i>to being able to walk again.</i>

383
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:45,229
Mickey?

384
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,967
Wake up.

385
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,300
Wake up.

386
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:23,369
Wake up.

387
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,373
What!?

388
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:35,582
Now can I get some
sleep, dickhead?

389
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:36,618
Fuck!

390
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,965
Fuck you.

391
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,671
I'll fuck you up.

392
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,484
You get some fucking sleep
dickhead.

393
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:16,354
What the fuck are you doing? I'm gonna
burn you alive! Fucking "A" motherfucker!

394
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:18,955
You limp dick mother fucker. Ah!

395
00:38:18,957 --> 00:38:20,726
Motherfucker! Fucking asshole!

396
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:24,394
- Fuck!
- Fuck you!

397
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:25,729
You fucking piece of shit!

398
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:28,798
You fucking cocksucker!

399
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,771
Alright, alright, alright!
E-fucking-nough man!

400
00:38:36,143 --> 00:38:37,945
The fucks wrong with you?

401
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:46,920
Where's the gear?

402
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,359
It's in the pack.

403
00:39:01,702 --> 00:39:03,771
You're fucking psychotic Mick.

404
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:20,119
I'm tired of this
small time shit.

405
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:22,890
We need to hookup with
Elvis' connection.

406
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:24,792
Do we have anymore gear?

407
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:25,795
Done Dada.

408
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,799
Oh, you're sick man.

409
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,201
Elvis will hook us up.

410
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,571
We give him the cash
and don't fuck it up-

411
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:42,775
Fuck!

412
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:45,415
How the fuck do you
expect me to eat now?!

413
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:52,889
Alright, come on Mick.

414
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,927
Let's get you to the bathroom.

415
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:01,595
It's okay. It's okay.

416
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:04,034
I thought you said
that you were out?

417
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:09,070
I always have a little
for a rainy day.

418
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:10,709
And it's fucking raining.

419
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:15,944
I'm gonna take care
of you lil' Mick.

420
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,651
Hey, you hear me?

421
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,422
Let's go.

422
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:29,927
More.

423
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,131
Alright, it's your funeral man.

424
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,937
That's good. That's fucking
good, right there.

425
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,162
I love you so much, Mickey.

426
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,835
That's why I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

427
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:13,207
I hate to tell you this.

428
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:22,547
But I know you can handle it.

429
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:27,654
You're growing up into a fine
young gentleman and you're ready.

430
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,790
You remember,

431
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:35,127
that piano set you wanted?

432
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:38,697
The one with the little keys
and the tambourine thing and

433
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:42,036
you hit it with your feet and
it went ding! Remember that?

434
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:49,912
It was the last present Santa
brought to a child in the world.

435
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:57,816
He was coming down the chimney

436
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:02,888
with that piano set and that piano set
made a lot of noise, it woke me up.

437
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,691
You remember,

438
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:08,595
the shotgun daddy keeps
under his bed for burglars?

439
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,000
Yeah, you remember.

440
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:15,802
He came down that chimney,

441
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:17,036
and I shot him.

442
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:19,806
In his fat pudgy face,

443
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:22,042
and killed him.

444
00:42:22,044 --> 00:42:24,214
Santa's dead little Mickey.

445
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:30,250
I shot Santa and
buried his carcass,

446
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:33,954
in the backyard
under your rope swing.

447
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:37,091
I feel just terrible about that.

448
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:40,961
But if you hadn't
wanted that piano set,

449
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:43,999
Santa wouldn't be dead...

450
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:45,836
would he?

451
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:52,340
Whoa,
had a good one there.

452
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:54,278
Passed out for a second.

453
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:58,413
Come on, let's get you
to the girls place.

454
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:00,248
I'm gonna go hit up Elvis.

455
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,252
Let's go.

456
00:43:03,821 --> 00:43:08,259
Okay, well, these
need to be cleaned.

457
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:12,361
Oh, you have another pair that
you left here the other week.

458
00:43:12,363 --> 00:43:14,265
I washed them for you.

459
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:18,768
Thank you.

460
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,205
You're welcome.

461
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:27,080
Do you want some
company for bath time?

462
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:34,821
I don't think
that's a good idea.

463
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,954
I have to wash my hair anyway.

464
00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:41,860
It's just, you know, I can't.

465
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:45,865
I'm sorry.

466
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,036
I just think, you
know we should,

467
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:56,406
we should give it
a try sometime.

468
00:43:56,408 --> 00:43:59,078
What? Wash your hair?

469
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:05,482
- Hey!
- Oh!

470
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:07,752
I'm in my clothes.

471
00:44:07,754 --> 00:44:10,456
Yeah, we'll save you some
on the laundry bill.

472
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,889
Whoa!

473
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:13,124
Oh no!

474
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:14,195
Oh no!

475
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,806
He broke my fucking
hand, where's Mick?

476
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:30,242
I've been wheeling around
for hours in circles, man.

477
00:44:30,244 --> 00:44:33,144
Elvis broke my fucking
hand, that motherfucker!

478
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:34,881
He wouldn't even give it to me.

479
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:35,984
You didn't get the shit?

480
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,754
I got the fucking shit.

481
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:42,788
Hey! Hey!

482
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:43,823
Hey!

483
00:44:49,964 --> 00:44:52,432
- Okay, so I burst in...
- Right.

484
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:55,033
And I look him dead in the
eyes and I said, Elvis,

485
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:58,338
I want your fucking connection.

486
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,407
Right now. And bang!

487
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:01,875
Gave me that connection.

488
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:03,009
Guess where the hookup is?

489
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:04,478
Mexico!

490
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,248
We'll get like a little
hacienda in Mexico.

491
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,183
With a farm and lots of cocaine.

492
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,152
We have to get the cash first.

493
00:45:12,154 --> 00:45:13,188
How are we gonna get the cash?

494
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,456
Do you not fucking listen?
See, I say something

495
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,958
and you're fucking
fourteen steps ahead.

496
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,527
There's like thousands, of millions
of hundreds, of ways to make money.

497
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:21,997
Parking lots!

498
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:25,167
There's a lot of money in parking lots.
We take my blank gun and we-

499
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:27,334
Fucking brilliant!

500
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:30,338
Can I finish my fucking plan!?

501
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,240
This one guy I know, I
knew this one guy right,

502
00:45:33,242 --> 00:45:35,876
he was in the hospital
when I was in there,

503
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:38,079
And his arm got stuck
in the thing and it got

504
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:40,314
ripped right the fuck off
man, I'm telling you,

505
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:44,251
it's dangerous, you can make a
lot of money. Lot of money.

506
00:45:44,253 --> 00:45:49,090
That's the stupidest fucking thing
I've ever heard in my life, man.

507
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:53,029
I just want gold. Can I have
like, gold faucets, and-

508
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:56,199
We're gonna have so much stuff,
it's going to be like a bakery.

509
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:58,201
Only instead of flour, yak!

510
00:45:58,203 --> 00:46:02,505
I want piles of cocaine, and
then surrounded by gold.

511
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:05,473
I'm gonna buy Maritza
a gold fucking cage.

512
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:07,342
We're going to Mexico, man.

513
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:09,613
He hasn't given me the
exact fucking address, but

514
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:12,216
we're going to Mexico. I
know it's in Mexico. Fuck!

515
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:13,584
What?

516
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:15,955
Do they have
addresses in Mexico?

517
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,256
So I think I should
hold onto the money.

518
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:21,325
You are not good with money.

519
00:46:21,327 --> 00:46:23,961
I'm great with money, what
are you talking about?

520
00:46:23,963 --> 00:46:25,294
I'm the best one with money.

521
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:26,530
You're fucking good
at spending money.

522
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:30,133
We fuck this up we're dead, I
told you motherfuckers that.

523
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:32,401
Dude, there is a lot of
uselessness with this attitude.

524
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:35,505
Do you know how much coke you
do when you're dead, none!

525
00:46:35,507 --> 00:46:38,141
We go to like one of these
water parks, right.

526
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:40,578
And we have them fucking
load us up at the top.

527
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,513
And it dumps us down the slide
and we get to the bottom

528
00:46:43,515 --> 00:46:46,484
and we're like fuck man your
slide paralyzed me and shit

529
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:50,154
The lifeguard comes and
boom water park money.

530
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:52,656
A fucking lawsuit, are
you fucking stupid?

531
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:55,426
You know how long it takes to
fucking get money from a lawsuit?

532
00:46:55,428 --> 00:46:56,694
At least I'm coming
up with ideas.

533
00:46:56,696 --> 00:46:59,497
You're not coming up with ideas,
you're coming up with bullshit.

534
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:01,599
You take my blank gun
from my backpack, right.

535
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,401
You getting shot is
not a good idea, man.

536
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,671
We just team 'em up man.
Fucking just rack 'em.

537
00:47:05,673 --> 00:47:07,639
Pande-fucking-monium!

538
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:12,177
And then we score Rolexes and
cash and like fucking wallets.

539
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:15,313
That's the way we're gonna
make the money, right there.

540
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:18,483
We are gonna need a fucking dump truck
for all the money we're gonna make.

541
00:48:40,572 --> 00:48:43,639
Get out of the
fucking car bitch!

542
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:49,014
Where do you think
you're fucking going?!

543
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:56,085
What?

544
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:59,022
What the fuck are you doing?

545
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:03,162
Shit! I told you to wait until
opens the fucking cash register!

546
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,499
Take this. Take it!

547
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,600
I got it!

548
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:12,271
Give me some money!

549
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:20,112
Come on Mick, hurry the fuck up!

550
00:50:02,722 --> 00:50:04,525
Alright, that's about it.

551
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:07,760
You got the cash right?

552
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:10,263
Yeah, Maritza's watching
over everything.

553
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:14,703
By sundown tomorrow, we will be back
and it's gold fucking cage time.

554
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:23,442
Hey, cowboy!

555
00:50:23,444 --> 00:50:25,680
I made you lunch.

556
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,652
Come on Janet.
Choppity, chop, chop.

557
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:34,555
Come on tough guy.

558
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:36,423
I'm trying.

559
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:00,848
Mickey get in the tub.

560
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,718
I don't want to get in the tub.

561
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,221
Get in the tub.

562
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,524
But Mommy, he's wearing clothes.

563
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:12,493
He's gonna be fine.

564
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:15,165
We're all gonna
take a bath today.

565
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:19,636
- Mickey.
- Mickey! Wake up.

566
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:28,278
Are we there yet?

567
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,319
No, we're getting gas. You should
probably handle your business.

568
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,554
All yours, Mick.

569
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:48,665
Hey, Maritza!

570
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,600
Maritza, come here.

571
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:52,535
Maritza, come here.

572
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:54,238
Goddammit.

573
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,406
Hey Lisa, help me with Maritza.

574
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,575
Get your own fucking rabbit.

575
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:01,480
Maritza baby. Maritza.

576
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,222
Oh, here let me
help you with that.

577
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:12,260
I can... I can get it.

578
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,196
Dammit.

579
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:21,967
It's not like you're going
to mess this place up.

580
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:23,838
Not very sexy, is it?

581
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:34,280
Why are you so good to me?

582
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:36,948
I'm not that good to you.

583
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,220
You should really
give this shit up.

584
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:46,662
What are you, my mom?

585
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,580
Don't. Don't do that.

586
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:13,456
What's wrong?

587
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,396
Listen to me for a second, okay?

588
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,532
Lisa and I were out,

589
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,901
and we met Drake and

590
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:30,305
he wanted to pay Lisa
to have sex with him.

591
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,742
And he can't have sex.

592
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:36,579
But he kept coming,
and kept paying.

593
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:45,054
I asked Drake, I said you know
you have any paraplegic friends,

594
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:48,056
have them come over.

595
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,527
I would never have
sex for money.

596
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:52,897
I'm not a whore.

597
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,473
So this is about money?

598
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,710
No.

599
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:08,781
No.

600
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,420
Is it because I'm crippled?

601
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:23,829
Look, at first is was about
money, but things changed.

602
00:54:53,692 --> 00:54:55,495
Please forgive me.

603
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:35,067
Thanks loser, ha!

604
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:37,602
Hey. Hey!

605
00:55:37,604 --> 00:55:39,839
Don't you dare! Hey!

606
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:43,576
Get the fuck back here!
You fucking bitches!

607
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:45,778
Hey! Hey!

608
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,182
Fuck you! Get back here!

609
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:53,954
Fuck! Fuck, Mick! Where
the fuck were you?!

610
00:55:53,956 --> 00:55:56,722
Motherfucker!

611
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,891
They got
all our fucking money!

612
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:01,695
God Damn it!
Where were you?

613
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:03,664
What were you doing?

614
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,065
Fuck man!

615
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:08,137
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

616
00:56:13,477 --> 00:56:15,613
Elvis is gonna fucking kill us.

617
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:19,082
Fucked up his connection.

618
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:23,787
Those fucking cunts.

619
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:29,790
I can't take it anymore, Mick.

620
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,762
I mean what's the fucking point.

621
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:45,741
I'm gonna tell you something that
don't tell you in the story books.

622
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:49,447
Everybody knows this rule, but
nobody will talk about it.

623
00:56:51,648 --> 00:56:56,488
Some people are born
to do great things.

624
00:56:58,256 --> 00:57:01,291
Some people are born
to walk on the moon.

625
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,863
Or to become president.

626
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,166
Everyone else,

627
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:14,236
No matter how hard they try,

628
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:18,108
The world will not
let them ever, ever,

629
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:22,279
have their dream.

630
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:27,784
You only have one choice, Mick.
The choice to die.

631
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:31,688
And you had it right the
first time I met you.

632
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:36,062
Just speeding up the
process is all.

633
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:06,224
You get everything you
wanted for Christmas?

634
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:08,696
I miss Mommy.

635
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:14,904
I know.

636
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,082
Hey, buddy.

637
00:58:30,752 --> 00:58:32,820
It's from your mom.

638
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:34,921
It's from Mommy!

639
00:58:34,923 --> 00:58:37,661
It's better to look
at the card first.

640
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,862
Dear Mickey.

641
00:58:41,864 --> 00:58:46,266
Use this brick when you
build your first house.

642
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:48,003
Love Mom.

643
00:58:53,175 --> 00:58:56,079
Why did Mommy give me a
brick for Christmas?

644
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:07,355
You girls are fucking dead.

645
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:09,156
What the fuck?

646
00:59:09,158 --> 00:59:11,095
Lisa! You twat!

647
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,163
My leg!

648
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:21,132
Fuck!

649
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,833
Are you okay?

650
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:24,168
I ran over your leg?

651
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,969
What are you doing
under my car man?

652
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:28,206
We're gonna get you
to a hospital okay?

653
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,907
Fuck your hospital!

654
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:32,510
That's right
motherfucker.

655
01:00:32,512 --> 01:00:35,147
Where's the fucking money?

656
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:37,281
- I've got my wallet in the car.
- Bullshit.

657
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:38,285
Bullshit.

658
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:41,388
Want me to get it?

659
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:47,426
Fucking go get the wallet.
Go get the wallet.

660
01:00:47,428 --> 01:00:48,827
Keys.

661
01:00:48,829 --> 01:00:50,294
Give him the keys.

662
01:00:50,296 --> 01:00:53,031
I'll take the fucking
keys you asshole.

663
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,133
- Move slowly.
- Track him.

664
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:56,302
I'm fucking tracking him.

665
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,404
No you're not, you've got to
get around and follow him.

666
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:00,172
I fucking tracking him,
stop yelling at me!

667
01:01:00,174 --> 01:01:02,174
I can fucking see where
he's coming from, alright?

668
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:03,442
Just go around the
fucking truck!

669
01:01:03,444 --> 01:01:06,813
I can fucking see him. I'm up
ere, you're down there! Alright?

670
01:01:06,815 --> 01:01:08,514
My peripheral I can see him.

671
01:01:08,516 --> 01:01:11,918
You can't see him over
the fucking truck man!

672
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,121
- You can't see.
- You want my wallet?

673
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:17,393
Yes. Toss me the wallet.
Shut up! Toss me the wallet.

674
01:01:18,993 --> 01:01:21,095
What do we got, Mick?

675
01:01:21,097 --> 01:01:24,030
Drake, Drake, we've
got some good money.

676
01:01:24,032 --> 01:01:25,832
Mickey!

677
01:01:25,834 --> 01:01:27,100
Mickey!

678
01:01:27,102 --> 01:01:29,370
You motherfucker!

679
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:30,474
Fuck you!

680
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:57,835
Mickey?

681
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:03,874
Mickey?

682
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:11,950
Mickey? Oh fuck!

683
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:17,052
I'm sorry.

684
01:02:17,054 --> 01:02:20,256
Mick. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry buddy.

685
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:24,029
Oh fuck. I'm sorry.

686
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:35,038
We need a place to sleep, man.

687
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,207
- Those fucking whores, man.
- Where are we gonna sleep?

688
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:40,243
Those fucking cunts man,
I trusted that bitch.

689
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:42,044
The fuck was I thinking?

690
01:02:42,046 --> 01:02:43,547
We need a hit.

691
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:45,047
Fuck!

692
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:47,183
You know what I'm saying?
We need a hit Drake.

693
01:02:47,185 --> 01:02:49,185
That doesn't fucking
matter anymore, Mick.

694
01:02:49,187 --> 01:02:51,020
It just doesn't fucking matter.

695
01:02:51,022 --> 01:02:52,556
I don't want to get sick.

696
01:02:52,558 --> 01:02:58,599
Why don't you shut the fuck up? You get
sick even when we do have the shit!

697
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:04,668
Drake, we need to keep it
together bro. We need to...

698
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,604
Hey! Keep your fucking
hands off me.

699
01:03:07,606 --> 01:03:09,941
Don't fucking touch me!

700
01:03:09,943 --> 01:03:11,575
You're a fucking punk man.

701
01:03:11,577 --> 01:03:13,380
You're a fucking punk.

702
01:03:14,947 --> 01:03:18,115
You're the fucking punk.

703
01:03:18,117 --> 01:03:20,419
What? Fuck you.

704
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,386
Fuck you.

705
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:23,555
Hey, you want a piece
of me, motherfucker?

706
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:25,691
Come on you crippled fuck.

707
01:03:25,693 --> 01:03:27,028
Fuck you say to me?

708
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:58,895
Something I've been needing to
ell you for a long time, Mickey.

709
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,538
They didn't leave son.

710
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:18,214
I don't wanna hear it.

711
01:04:22,218 --> 01:04:25,055
I don't know what you're
trying to tell me. I mean...

712
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:29,126
I need to tell you the truth.

713
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:36,230
Stop it. Stop it!

714
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:38,333
You made them leave!

715
01:04:38,335 --> 01:04:39,570
Stop it!

716
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:18,710
Drake!

717
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:34,995
Drake!

718
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:53,311
Drake!

719
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:25,279
Drake!

720
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,149
Drake!

721
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:32,721
Go the fuck back!

722
01:06:43,764 --> 01:06:45,664
Drake.

723
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,233
Let's go back, come on.

724
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:50,105
Hey. Let the fuck go of me!
Fuck!

725
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:56,646
- Let's go back!
- I said, let the fuck go of me!

726
01:07:06,388 --> 01:07:10,191
We're gonna fucking
die out here.

727
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,662
Don't you get it?

728
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,369
I really miss her.

729
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,371
I love her so much.

730
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,175
We'll find her buddy.

731
01:07:26,177 --> 01:07:28,313
I'm not talking about Lisa.

732
01:07:33,284 --> 01:07:37,552
You know, before,
before I was paralyzed.

733
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:41,757
I used to own this
old model spider.

734
01:07:41,759 --> 01:07:43,394
Thing was a cherry.

735
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:49,299
I used to drive it
down the coast.

736
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:51,366
I remember...

737
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:54,571
that smile. Ah.

738
01:07:54,573 --> 01:07:56,542
That beautiful smile.

739
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,251
I killed her, Mick.

740
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:11,824
I fucking killed her.

741
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:19,265
I was drunk driving
and I hit a car.

742
01:08:24,237 --> 01:08:25,939
I killed my wife.

743
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:31,278
God she was beautiful.

744
01:08:34,815 --> 01:08:36,918
That's why I can't walk.

745
01:08:40,419 --> 01:08:41,889
She died.

746
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:46,360
And I'm paralyzed as punishment.

747
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:51,398
The worst part of it was,

748
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:54,832
She was pregnant.

749
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:56,501
Pregnant.

750
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:59,272
With my daughter.

751
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:01,843
My beautiful daughter,
Maritza.

752
01:09:06,914 --> 01:09:09,484
I killed my wife and baby, Mick.

753
01:09:28,003 --> 01:09:29,005
Drake.

754
01:09:32,775 --> 01:09:35,042
Let's go home.

755
01:09:35,044 --> 01:09:36,776
Let's go home.

756
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:39,879
I'm gonna stay out
here for awhile.

757
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:43,950
I deserve to die for what I did.

758
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:49,057
Look, I ain't had a best friend

759
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,694
until you.

760
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:54,428
You ain't dying on me.

761
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,496
You got that?

762
01:09:56,498 --> 01:09:58,966
I won't let you.

763
01:09:58,968 --> 01:10:01,835
Look how far out we are, Mick.

764
01:10:01,837 --> 01:10:03,640
We can't make it back.

765
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:11,612
Come on. We're going back,
buddy.

766
01:10:11,614 --> 01:10:13,550
I'm taking you back.

767
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:18,823
I'm taking you back.
I'm taking you back.

768
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,455
Give me your hand, Mick.

769
01:11:23,055 --> 01:11:27,057
How come you need to
make it so bad? Huh?

770
01:11:27,059 --> 01:11:31,195
Mr. Suicide. Fuck.

771
01:11:31,197 --> 01:11:33,968
I didn't fall off
of a roof, Drake.

772
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:38,439
My dad pushed me off.

773
01:11:44,511 --> 01:11:46,381
I wanna kill him, Drake.

774
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:50,485
I can't do it alone.

775
01:12:01,996 --> 01:12:05,831
Okay. Then I need you to
do something for me.

776
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,971
I need to get something back.

777
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:13,173
And then I want to
come back here...

778
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:16,042
And you let me die in peace.

779
01:12:16,044 --> 01:12:18,111
Okay?

780
01:12:18,113 --> 01:12:19,746
Okay?

781
01:12:19,748 --> 01:12:21,814
We'll come out here,

782
01:12:21,816 --> 01:12:25,117
and we'll do it together.

783
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:26,689
Promise me.

784
01:12:30,025 --> 01:12:31,595
I swear.

785
01:12:34,097 --> 01:12:35,433
Okay.

786
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:55,650
Are you crazy?

787
01:12:55,652 --> 01:12:56,819
What are you doing?

788
01:13:02,293 --> 01:13:04,627
No, no, no, no!

789
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:17,907
I'll fucking blow it up!

790
01:13:17,909 --> 01:13:19,778
I'm gonna burn the fucker!
Hurry up!

791
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,646
Help!

792
01:13:23,648 --> 01:13:24,649
Someone!

793
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,552
Why are you stealing my car?

794
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:30,186
Because God hates you.

795
01:13:30,188 --> 01:13:32,722
Help me please! Someone!

796
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:33,926
Open the trunk.

797
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:42,665
Please!

798
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:43,834
The fuck are you doing?

799
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,670
I've never driven before.

800
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,170
Please sir.

801
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,240
Get in the fucking car.

802
01:13:49,242 --> 01:13:51,642
You've got to start planning
this shit better, man.

803
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:53,911
Please God, help me!

804
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:55,780
I'm in. Let's get the fuck
out of here!

805
01:13:55,782 --> 01:13:57,848
Get up here and work the pedals!

806
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,317
You go fucking work the pedals!

807
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:00,750
We don't have time
for this shit!

808
01:14:00,752 --> 01:14:02,719
Please don't
take my car.

809
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:04,955
What's going on with
this crazy bitch?

810
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:08,859
You look like you love god.
Please don't take my car!

811
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,261
It's just water!

812
01:14:10,263 --> 01:14:12,299
You dumb bitch!

813
01:14:15,636 --> 01:14:17,605
Where the fuck am I?

814
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:40,960
Doctors said he drank some
paint thinner, window cleaner.

815
01:14:40,962 --> 01:14:42,830
Why would he drink
these things?

816
01:14:45,633 --> 01:14:48,234
I don't know, Bill.

817
01:14:48,236 --> 01:14:53,142
He had some bruises on his left clavic.
Did you two have a fight this morning?

818
01:14:54,742 --> 01:14:58,012
My son almost died, you think I
had something to do with this?

819
01:14:58,014 --> 01:14:59,946
- I would never!
- Take it easy.

820
01:14:59,948 --> 01:15:01,382
Do you know what this is like?

821
01:15:01,384 --> 01:15:04,654
Maybe we should just finish it down
at the station. Is that better?

822
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:08,021
I'm not leaving my boy.

823
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:09,088
Let's go.

824
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:10,723
I don't wanna leave
my boy.

825
01:15:10,725 --> 01:15:11,894
- Al. Let's go.
- Get back!

826
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:15,329
Take him down.

827
01:15:15,331 --> 01:15:17,267
I don't want to leave Mickey!

828
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:24,272
You have the right
to remain silent.

829
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:28,276
Any thing you say, can and will be
used against you, in a court of law.

830
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:32,315
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford...

831
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:48,899
Wake up.

832
01:15:51,769 --> 01:15:53,271
Are we there?

833
01:15:54,838 --> 01:15:56,173
This it?

834
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:03,681
This is it.

835
01:16:17,929 --> 01:16:19,863
Just wait, hold on a second.

836
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:21,297
What are you doing?

837
01:16:21,299 --> 01:16:22,966
Put the fucking brick away.

838
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:24,333
- What do you mean wait?
- Wait.

839
01:16:24,335 --> 01:16:26,135
Wait for what?

840
01:16:26,137 --> 01:16:28,070
Just put it away for a second.

841
01:16:28,072 --> 01:16:30,873
What are we here for?
You said let's do this.

842
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,376
- Wait.
- This is the spot.

843
01:16:32,378 --> 01:16:35,145
- Will you just fucking wait.
- We get in, we don't know...

844
01:16:35,147 --> 01:16:36,382
Wait.

845
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:49,763
Mickey?

846
01:16:53,265 --> 01:16:55,268
I've missed you so much.

847
01:16:59,974 --> 01:17:02,173
This is my friend.

848
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:03,377
Drake.

849
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:07,181
It's good to meet you, Drake.

850
01:17:09,215 --> 01:17:10,883
What?

851
01:17:10,885 --> 01:17:12,253
It's good to meet you.

852
01:17:16,422 --> 01:17:19,894
Why don't you boys come in?
I just put some coffee on.

853
01:17:25,867 --> 01:17:28,468
Are you fucking kidding
me with this guy?

854
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,336
Let's get him now.
Get him, Mick.

855
01:17:31,338 --> 01:17:33,572
Let's go.

856
01:17:33,574 --> 01:17:35,340
Put the brick away.

857
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:37,477
Fucks wrong with you, man?

858
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:38,911
Mickey?

859
01:17:38,913 --> 01:17:40,782
What the fuck is wrong with you?

860
01:17:43,051 --> 01:17:44,320
Fuck.

861
01:17:49,424 --> 01:17:52,926
Mick. Hey Mick.

862
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:54,361
Mick!

863
01:17:54,363 --> 01:17:57,331
We gonna fucking do
this shit or what?

864
01:17:57,333 --> 01:18:00,233
Yeah, I will just give
me a second, okay?

865
01:18:00,235 --> 01:18:02,569
Alright, well my bag is full.

866
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:04,440
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

867
01:18:07,276 --> 01:18:08,812
Where the fuck do I go?

868
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,549
It's down the hall on the right.

869
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:35,840
Remember to sit up
straight, Mickey.

870
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:41,667
You remember that
song I taught you.

871
01:21:47,106 --> 01:21:49,075
Mom taught that to me.

872
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:05,458
Lots of cream, lots of sugar.

873
01:22:14,201 --> 01:22:16,636
I see you still have that
brick I gave you?

874
01:22:20,372 --> 01:22:23,176
Mom gave that to me.

875
01:22:26,179 --> 01:22:28,146
No.

876
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:30,051
It was supposed to
be a gift for her.

877
01:22:31,551 --> 01:22:33,518
A commitment to the

878
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,224
new house we were
gonna build together.

879
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,861
I had the perfect family.

880
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:45,130
Two trouble making boys,

881
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:46,400
a beautiful wife.

882
01:22:48,903 --> 01:22:51,437
All I have left of
that now is you.

883
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:53,642
And she's still taking
that away from me.

884
01:22:55,577 --> 01:22:58,711
Don't blame her for
what you did to me.

885
01:22:58,713 --> 01:23:00,216
I blame myself.

886
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:06,721
I was away at work. When I should
have been taking care of my boys.

887
01:23:09,557 --> 01:23:12,158
But I thought if I could

888
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,394
just build her dream house,

889
01:23:15,396 --> 01:23:17,365
your mother would get well.

890
01:23:19,169 --> 01:23:21,171
You boys were my life.

891
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,177
I didn't take care of her,
I didn't take care of you.

892
01:23:33,782 --> 01:23:35,686
You still can't admit it.

893
01:23:38,687 --> 01:23:41,221
I've done everything, Mickey.

894
01:23:41,223 --> 01:23:42,823
The doctors,

895
01:23:42,825 --> 01:23:45,293
have done everything.

896
01:23:45,295 --> 01:23:47,365
There's nothing I can say or do,

897
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,869
that will help you walk again.

898
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:02,347
You pushed me off
a fucking roof.

899
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,386
No, Mickey.

900
01:24:13,692 --> 01:24:16,459
You used to have,

901
01:24:16,461 --> 01:24:19,632
such a light about you when
you were a little boy.

902
01:24:24,536 --> 01:24:26,337
You could light up a room.

903
01:24:29,506 --> 01:24:33,911
When your mother started
making you sick,

904
01:24:33,913 --> 01:24:36,246
that light went out.

905
01:24:36,248 --> 01:24:38,918
Time to
take your medicine.

906
01:24:40,852 --> 01:24:44,356
My mom, she did
not make me sick.

907
01:24:47,025 --> 01:24:48,959
Yes she did, Mickey.

908
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:52,899
The doctor said he drank so
paint thinner, window cleaner.

909
01:24:54,801 --> 01:24:57,271
I didn't push you off the roof.

910
01:24:58,771 --> 01:25:00,037
That's a lie.

911
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,273
No it's not.

912
01:25:01,275 --> 01:25:03,474
That's a lie!

913
01:25:03,476 --> 01:25:05,809
That's a lie!

914
01:25:05,811 --> 01:25:07,645
You paralyzed me!

915
01:25:07,647 --> 01:25:10,317
Stop it, Mickey! Stop it!

916
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:31,573
You're okay. You're okay.

917
01:25:36,477 --> 01:25:38,543
You're okay. It's okay.

918
01:25:38,545 --> 01:25:40,382
Oh Mickey. Oh Mickey.

919
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:46,255
You okay?

920
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:57,700
Why did she do it?!
What was she thinking?!

921
01:26:45,615 --> 01:26:48,517
She's gone, honey.

922
01:26:48,519 --> 01:26:50,321
She took your brother.

923
01:27:03,668 --> 01:27:04,804
Dad.

924
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:10,943
Dad.

925
01:27:12,843 --> 01:27:14,012
Dad?

926
01:27:19,919 --> 01:27:21,819
Holy shit, Mick.

927
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:23,854
You killed him.

928
01:27:23,856 --> 01:27:25,823
Call a doctor!

929
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:27,861
Can't believe you
fucking killed him.

930
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,602
Rescue 911.

931
01:27:39,604 --> 01:27:40,741
Let's go, Mick.

932
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:28,524
<i>He promised me one day,
that car would be mine.</i>

933
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,952
We're gonna get shit from Elvis?

934
01:28:57,954 --> 01:29:01,288
If we get high, we're never
gonna go out and do it.

935
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:04,691
Let's go to the ocean.

936
01:29:04,693 --> 01:29:06,696
I ain't here for no gear.

937
01:29:10,567 --> 01:29:11,900
Here.

938
01:29:11,902 --> 01:29:13,967
It's the last cigarette.

939
01:29:13,969 --> 01:29:16,671
Take it.

940
01:29:16,673 --> 01:29:19,478
I'll be back before
you're done smoking it.

941
01:29:23,648 --> 01:29:25,050
Save it.

942
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:30,185
We'll share it when we get out.

943
01:29:30,187 --> 01:29:31,920
I'm coming in with you.

944
01:29:47,338 --> 01:29:49,305
Alright, Drake, I'm in!

945
01:30:00,685 --> 01:30:04,219
Let's do this!

946
01:30:44,798 --> 01:30:47,164
Hey, what the fuck?

947
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:49,935
- Don't yell at me!
- Shut the fuck up!

948
01:30:49,937 --> 01:30:52,203
Keep looking!

949
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:08,988
Shit! Where is it?!

950
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:12,958
It's got to be here!

951
01:31:17,032 --> 01:31:20,668
Fuck.

952
01:31:24,674 --> 01:31:28,441
Ah. Fuck!

953
01:31:28,443 --> 01:31:32,111
Mick. Mick.

954
01:31:41,323 --> 01:31:42,927
I got it!

955
01:32:17,494 --> 01:32:18,728
Elvis.

956
01:32:19,864 --> 01:32:21,096
Let's get the hell out of here.

957
01:32:21,098 --> 01:32:22,400
Go!

958
01:32:35,914 --> 01:32:39,015
Go ahead, I'm right
behind you. Go!

959
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:40,350
I'm right behind you.

960
01:32:51,929 --> 01:32:53,365
Drake.

961
01:32:58,871 --> 01:32:59,904
Drake.

962
01:32:59,906 --> 01:33:00,474
Mickey, run!

963
01:33:03,809 --> 01:33:06,179
Drake! Drake!

964
01:33:07,112 --> 01:33:09,513
Mick, just go!

965
01:33:09,515 --> 01:33:10,750
Drake, come on.

966
01:33:12,152 --> 01:33:15,186
I don't want him
getting both of us. Now go!

967
01:33:15,188 --> 01:33:17,088
Go! Run, Mickey!

968
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:18,891
Mick, I'll
take care of it.

969
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:21,058
Come on, I'm not leaving
without you, brotha.

970
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:22,995
I'm not leaving without you,
brotha. Come on.

971
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:26,330
Mick, just go Mick.

972
01:33:26,332 --> 01:33:28,335
Please just fucking go.

973
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,242
Elvis!

974
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,450
I'm in here
you motherfucker!

975
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,021
Drake come on.

976
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:50,892
Ah!

977
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:56,532
Ah!

978
01:34:00,502 --> 01:34:02,135
Mickey, get in the tub.

979
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:03,603
I don't want to get in the tub.

980
01:34:03,605 --> 01:34:04,807
Get in the tub.

981
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:16,617
But Mommy,
he's wearing clothes.

982
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:18,021
He's gonna be fine.

983
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:25,962
We're all gonna
take a bath today.

984
01:34:32,702 --> 01:34:35,807
Now Mickey,
we're gonna wash your hair.

985
01:34:38,107 --> 01:34:41,442
You have to hold
your breath, okay?

986
01:34:41,444 --> 01:34:42,446
Okay.

987
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:04,400
My beautiful boy.

988
01:35:04,402 --> 01:35:05,971
Mom, let him go!

989
01:35:08,605 --> 01:35:09,974
Run Mickey!

990
01:35:12,644 --> 01:35:14,112
Mickey!

991
01:35:50,249 --> 01:35:52,051
Ah!

992
01:35:56,088 --> 01:35:58,993
Ah! This is fucked!
You sick fuck!

993
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:53,679
The doctors
have done everything.

994
01:36:53,681 --> 01:36:57,550
I know what you've been through can
have a crippling affect on a man.

995
01:36:57,552 --> 01:37:01,088
There's nothing I can say or do,

996
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:03,025
That'll help you walk again.

997
01:37:22,413 --> 01:37:24,612
So, how'd you
end up in the chair?

998
01:37:24,614 --> 01:37:26,581
You fell off a roof?

999
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,584
I didn't fall off
a roof, Drake.

1000
01:37:29,586 --> 01:37:31,053
My dad pushed me off.

1001
01:37:31,055 --> 01:37:34,288
I didn't push you off the roof.

1002
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,424
That's a lie!

1003
01:37:35,426 --> 01:37:36,625
No, it's not.

1004
01:37:36,627 --> 01:37:38,559
That's a lie!

1005
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:40,295
You paralyzed me!

1006
01:37:40,297 --> 01:37:42,832
They didn't leave son.

1007
01:37:42,834 --> 01:37:44,570
Bullshit! You made them leave!

1008
01:37:46,704 --> 01:37:48,837
Stop it! Stop it!

1009
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:55,811
She killed your brother.

1010
01:37:55,813 --> 01:37:58,780
And then she killed herself.

1011
01:37:58,782 --> 01:38:00,515
Mickey?

1012
01:38:00,517 --> 01:38:02,150
Mickey? What's wrong, stand up.

1013
01:38:02,152 --> 01:38:03,819
I can't hold you up.

1014
01:38:03,821 --> 01:38:05,555
Mickey, what's wrong?

1015
01:38:05,557 --> 01:38:07,460
It's okay. It's okay.

1016
01:38:14,866 --> 01:38:18,537
It's okay Mickey. It's okay.

1017
01:38:23,142 --> 01:38:24,144
Come on breath.

1018
01:38:32,485 --> 01:38:36,120
Some people feel like they
have no control over their lives.

1019
01:38:36,122 --> 01:38:39,793
When they actually have
control over everything.

1020
01:39:42,925 --> 01:39:44,294
You're okay.

1021
01:39:47,397 --> 01:39:49,864
You're okay.

1022
01:42:48,752 --> 01:42:50,151
Drake.

1023
01:42:50,153 --> 01:42:51,818
Drake. Drake!

1024
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:54,021
No. No. No!

1025
01:42:54,023 --> 01:42:55,026
- Drake!
- No!

1026
01:42:56,660 --> 01:43:00,095
Mick. Mick. Mick.

1027
01:43:03,901 --> 01:43:06,801
Get me out of here Mick. Mick.

1028
01:43:06,803 --> 01:43:11,739
Take me, take me to the ocean.

1029
01:43:11,741 --> 01:43:14,111
Take me to the ocean, Mick.

1030
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,075
Almost there.

1031
01:44:17,077 --> 01:44:18,345
This is it.

1032
01:44:22,216 --> 01:44:24,115
Come on, brother.

1033
01:44:24,117 --> 01:44:27,555
We're almost there.

1034
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,162
This is it.

1035
01:44:36,164 --> 01:44:37,830
The most beautiful,

1036
01:44:37,832 --> 01:44:39,634
thing in the world, isn't it?

1037
01:44:49,043 --> 01:44:51,780
The most beautiful place,
right where you wanted to be.

1038
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,917
<i>Fact.</i>

1039
01:44:56,919 --> 01:44:58,888
<i>Everyone dies.</i>

1040
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:03,789
<i>Everyone that you've ever loved,</i>

1041
01:45:03,791 --> 01:45:05,191
<i>or known,</i>

1042
01:45:05,193 --> 01:45:06,763
<i>will die.</i>

1043
01:45:08,263 --> 01:45:10,197
<i>Your parents,</i>

1044
01:45:10,199 --> 01:45:12,666
<i>your friends,</i>

1045
01:45:12,668 --> 01:45:14,903
<i>even your children.</i>

1046
01:45:20,076 --> 01:45:22,075
<i>I knew that one day,</i>

1047
01:45:22,077 --> 01:45:23,580
<i>I would die.</i>

1048
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,650
<i>I figure,</i>

1049
01:45:29,652 --> 01:45:32,689
<i>why not today?</i>

1050
01:45:44,769 --> 01:45:46,003
There's one. Go, go!

1051
01:45:58,649 --> 01:46:01,586
Get up for real. Okay. Alright.

1052
01:46:07,726 --> 01:46:10,129
And when they find the honey.

1053
01:46:52,237 --> 01:46:54,607
<i>So what's death like?</i>

1054
01:46:57,111 --> 01:46:59,113
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

1055
01:47:02,348 --> 01:47:04,651
<i>I want to live.</i>

1056
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,331
Ah!

1057
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:20,336
Ah!

1058
01:50:12,952 --> 01:50:17,952

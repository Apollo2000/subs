00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,840
I'm sorry.
What'd you say, Dad?

81

102
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,661
- S... scared you?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,731
(clears throat)
It's okay, no worries.

104
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,734
- Sure?
- Yeah.

105

(stammers)
Uh, do you recognize me?

106
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:20,544
No, not really.

107
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,983
I'm driving that.

00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,155
Right.

109
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:34,025
Yeah, I... I just wanted
to apologize for yesterday.

110
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,093
I was texting.

111
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,560
I didn't see you trying to pass.

112
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,365
Well, it was a close call.

113
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,871
Nah, I put my phone down, and...

114
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,307
realized I was in a hurry,
and so I had to repass you.

115
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,542
It was just one
of those days, you know?

116
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,913
It's okay.

117
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,315
What's done is done.

118
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:01,585
But I scared you
a little bit.

119
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,855
I... Look, I gotta go, sorry.

120
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:07,591
- Do you live, uh, nearby?
- Uh, no, no, not really.

121
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,393
Where are you, um...
where are you going?

122
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,899
- I'm headed north.
- I'm always in the area, so...

123
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,568
Do you...
uh, do you have a name?

124
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,306
- Jessica.
- Jessica.

125
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,410
I apologize again,

126
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,279
and...

127
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,015
I'll see you around.

128
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,520
Yeah, yeah, it was...
it was nice meeting you.

129
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,055
Nice to meet you, too.

130
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,557
I hope you have a good trip.
(taps car)

131
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,926

(exhales deeply)

138
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:45,883
Do you mind to open up?

(gear shifter clacks)

140
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,724
Hey, there.

141
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:57,427
Hey, what's... what's going on?

142
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,531
No idea.
The engine just died on me.

143
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,334
It's a piece of shit.
What can I say?

144
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,835
Yeah, that's... that's too bad.

145
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:08,105
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

146
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:14,312
You want me to call you a...
a tow truck?

147
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,813
No, if... if you could just
give me a ride

148
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,883
to the next town,
I can go to a gas station.

149
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,086
But first, I need some help
to get the car out of the road.

150
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:27,058
Look, I'm...
I'm just in a bit of a hurry.

151
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:31,561
Yeah, I mean, me too.
I... it'll just take a minute.

152
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:34,198
I'll push.
You can steer.

153
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,533
Come on.

154
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,440
I can check the GPS.

155
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:46,010
- Excuse me?
- I can search on GPS.

156
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,111
Why?

157
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,246
I'll... I'll find
the next gas station.

158
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,916
- I... I'll just give them a call.
- I know where it is.

159
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,085
It's just up the road
about 15 minutes.

160
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,752
Well, then I'll just go
up there,

161
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,254
and I'll tell them
to come back and get you.

162
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:00,523
Well, I do need help getting
the car out of the road first.

163
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,692
It's a bit hard with this thing.

164
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,662
I'm sorry, I've got to go...

165
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:06,931
It's just gonna take a minute.

166
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,265
I've got to go.
I'm late for a meeting.

167

of the Palais-Royal</i>

171
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:28,551
<i>doubtful to what amusement we
should next partake ourselves</i>

172
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,621
<i>my friend proposed a visit
to Visconti,</i>

173

- <i>but his suggestion was not...</i>
- (sniffles)

174
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:38,195

Hi.

180
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,977
<i>Sweetie, why'd you leave
without telling us?</i>

181
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:28,913
<i>I don't understand.</i>

182
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,082
Well, I woke up early,

183
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,884
and I thought I might
as well get going.

184
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,120
<i>Sweetie, I... I tried you
a few times,</i>

185

<i>Are... are you there yet?</i>

189
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:52,937
No...
I'd say sometime tomorrow.

190
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,144
<i>Are you smoking again?</i>

191
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,013
Nope.

<i>So, um...</i>

195
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:14,291
<i>Jess, have you called
the therapist yet?</i>

196
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,461
Like I said, I've been busy.

197
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:21,165
<i>I just don't understand
why you're leaving right now.</i>

198
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:23,067
<i>After all that's happened,
wouldn't it be better...</i>

199
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,202
Mom, we've been through this.

200
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,304
(Mom sighs)

201
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,874
<i>Why don't you want
to talk about it?</i>

202
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,675
Because I don't need to.
I'm fine.

203
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,414

- <i>Really?</i>

- <i>Well...</i>
- (truck door opens)

207
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,629
<i>...we just think it's
a really bad idea.</i>

208
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,898
<i>You have friends and family</i>

209
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:55,732
<i>who will support you
down here, sweetheart...</i>

<i>I just think
you should've stayed home</i>

213
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,142
<i>until you felt
a little bit better.</i>

214
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:10,114
It's been six months...
it's time to move on.

215
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:13,716
<i>Okay, but promise me

<i>Promise me. Please, Jess,
you need to promise me...</i>

220
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,660
Mom, um, I got to go.

221
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,161
I... I'll talk
to you later, okay?

222
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:25,396

00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:42,772
(Jess breathing shakily)

325
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,911
Jess: You can let me go.

326
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:55,086
I won't tell anybody.
I... I promise.

327
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,689
Jess: (whispering) I promise.

328
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:05,395
Do you think you're
the first one to say that?

329
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,909
Take your clothes off.

330
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:27,952
Go on.

331
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:32,622
You want some help?

332
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:37,761
I just...

333
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:40,998
need to use the bathroom first.

334
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:48,072
Go right ahead.

335
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:58,049

344
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,735
There you go.

345
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,574
(normal voice)
I didn't even have time

346
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,709
to cut all the way through
at the rest stop.

347
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:07,118
Jess: Please just let me go.

348
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,920
Man: (whispering)
Almost gave up.

349
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,991
Jess: Please. (sniffles)

350
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,993
Man: (normal voice)
Let's see what we have here.

351
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,203
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

352
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:29,373
<i>I am finally learning
how to do this trick.</i>

353
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:30,640
<i>This is the only reason</i>

354
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,009
- <i>I married this man...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

355
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:34,011
<i>Because he impressed me
with this trick.</i>

356
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,047
- <i>Yeah, the only reason.</i>
- (laughs) <i>The only reason.</i>

357
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,517
<i>All right, can you take this?</i>
(laughs)

358
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:41,118
Husband: <i>Pick a card.</i>

359

Jess: <i>Um...</i>

360
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:49,026
<i>Don't look, don't look.
Don't look, don't look.</i>

361
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,194

- Jess: <i>Where's my card?</i>

372
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:11,916
<i>My card's supposed to be
in the middle.</i>

373
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,250
<i>Wait, did I mess it?
Wait, no, there's your card.</i>

374
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:14,717
- (Husband laughing)
- Jess: <i>What!</i>

375
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:15,652
You think he's worried
about you?

376
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,254
(laughter on video)

377
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,757
Husband: <i>I fucked it up.</i>
(chuckles)

378
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:25,096

I asked you a question.

(uneasy music playing)

384
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,265
He left you.

385
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:06,971
- Man: Huh?
- He died.

386
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:11,208
How?

387
00:38:13,776 --> 00:38:15,379
How did he die?

388
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,917
He... (sobs)

389
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,319
He killed himself.

(whimpering)

391
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:30,327
Man: In what way?

392
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:38,903
Jess: (stammers) A gun.

393
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:50,147
Man: And you found him?

394

(sobbing)

395
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,355

Aw, it's gonna be okay.

399
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:13,770

Hey.

No, no, I'm not
doing much right now.

426
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,578
Just at the hotel.

427
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:29,846
About to go get some lunch here
in a little bit.

Oh, gosh.

429

It is...
absolutely beautiful here.

It's... it's so gorgeous.

431

Looks out over the water.

432
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,394
Mm-hmm.

433
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,865
You and I should come here
some time.

Yeah.

435
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:55,839
Nah, the deal's just taking
longer than... than I expected.

436
00:45:58,076 --> 00:45:59,676
Um, I don't know.

437
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:03,380
It looks like
it may be Wednesday.

438
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:08,485
It just depends on when they
can make their mind up, yeah.

439
00:46:10,955 --> 00:46:12,222
Mm-hmm.

440
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,961
No, we're just down
to some little detail on it.

441
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:19,864
I think it's gonna be fine.
Yeah.

Yeah.

445
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,343
Yeah, just...
I guess just make sure

446
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,880
she doesn't have any more milk
until we know for sure.

447
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:38,515
Uh-huh.

448
00:46:39,616 --> 00:46:42,285

(chuckles)

450
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:48,325
Hey, little bug.

451
00:46:50,427 --> 00:46:53,430
Aw, I miss you, too,
sweetheart.

452
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:57,768
Yeah, how's the stomach?

453
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:01,805
Yeah, Mom told me,

454
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:05,877
but you are gonna be
just fine real soon.

455
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,980
I promise.
Uh-huh.

456
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,483
I think that I'm gonna see you
in a couple of days,

457
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:16,820
but you're probably gonna be
asleep when I get home.

458
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,423
I love you, too.

459
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,727
All right, bye.
And let me talk to Mom first.

460
00:47:24,062 --> 00:47:25,429
Bye.

(chuckles)
Yeah.

462
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,903
No, I know.

463
00:47:33,236 --> 00:47:37,374
All right, let me, uh, let me
give you a call tomorrow,

464
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:39,676
and I'll let you know
how it's looking.

465
00:47:41,511 --> 00:47:43,513
Okay.
Love you, babe.

466
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:45,983
All right, bye.

Jess: Help me!
Oh, God.

477
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:11,835
Oh, God.

00:52:31,202 --> 00:52:34,138
(flies buzzing)

489
00:52:37,174 --> 00:52:39,143
(grunts)

490
00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:47,650
(grunting)

491
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:03,200
(grunting in pain)

492
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,084
Mm.
(grunting)

493
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,157
(rustling)

494
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:36,300
(shallow breathing)

495
00:53:50,613 --> 00:53:53,184
(groans)

496
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:56,253
(leaves crunching)

497
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:35,825
(eerie tone swells)

498
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:44,268
(shouts)

499
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,371
- Jess: No!
- Hunter: Back off!

500
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:49,340
Hunter:
Get down on your knees.

501
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,044
Jess: Please. I'm sorry.
You have to help me.

502
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:58,015
(sobbing) Please, I need you
to help me right now.

503
00:54:58,648 --> 00:55:01,318
Fuck! What the hell is going on?

504
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:03,621
We have to get out of here.

505
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:06,557
- Let's go...
- You stay right where you are.

506
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:08,926
No, someone is trying
to kill me.

507
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,861
- What?
- He's crazy.

508
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:13,397
He's completely fucking crazy.

509
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:17,834
Please, do you have a phone?
Anything, please?

510
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:23,274
- (sighs)
- Anything?

511
00:55:23,874 --> 00:55:25,075
Hang on.

512
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:29,013
Oh, shit.

513
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:38,355
I got to get out of here.
Please get me out of here.

514
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:42,960
What'd you do to your foot?

515
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,262
I stepped on a root.

516
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:52,303
I have some...
extra boots in the car.

517
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:54,939
Back that way.

518
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:00,743
Don't try anything with that.

519
00:56:02,146 --> 00:56:03,147
I won't.

520
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:05,049
Hunter: Now come on.

521
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:07,284
Jess: Okay.

522
00:56:08,586 --> 00:56:12,389
(dramatic music playing)

523
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,745
(car beeping)

524
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:38,716
(Hunter clears throat)

525
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:41,385
(Hunter grunts)

526
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,387
These are my wife's.

527
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:46,357
They're probably too big,
but better that than too small.

528
00:56:46,523 --> 00:56:47,658
- Right?
- Thank you.

529
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:49,293
(car beeping)

530
00:56:58,035 --> 00:56:59,970
Well, let's get out of here.

531
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:02,172
(car door closes)

532
00:57:07,544 --> 00:57:08,579
(car door opens)

533
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:11,915
(engine revving, door closes)

534
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:15,185
(eerie creaking)

535
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:48,952
You okay?

536
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:52,956
Yeah.

537
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:55,825
I'm fine.

538
00:57:57,695 --> 00:57:59,563
When was the last time
you had anything to eat?

539
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:06,904
I don't remember.

540
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:08,806
There's some sandwiches
in the backpack.

541
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:10,374
You can help yourself.

542
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,316
Goat cheese and honey,
if that's all right.

543
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:23,120
My wife makes
a killer sandwich.

544
00:58:31,895 --> 00:58:33,864
(Jess grunts in satisfaction)

545
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,401
There should be some water
in there.

546
00:58:39,803 --> 00:58:41,338
(Jess clears throat)

547
00:59:02,926 --> 00:59:04,495
You think he's still out there?

548
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:08,499
Jess: Maybe.

549
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:13,670
I think he's long gone.

550
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:15,305
He's probably somewhere

551
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:18,609
(chuckles)
trying to think up an alibi.

552
00:59:21,011 --> 00:59:23,380
Oh, God.
What's this?

553
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:30,554
No, no, no!

554
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,589
- Jessica, Jessica, calm down!
- No, this is him!

555
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:41,198
- (car door closes)
- No, no, no.

556
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:47,137
Jess: You have to help me.

557
00:59:47,404 --> 00:59:49,573
Jessica, you're never
gonna be able to move that.

558
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:51,742
Jess: Come on. Come on.

559
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,511
One, two, three.

560
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:55,979
(both groan)

561
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:58,148
Oh, come on.
This is not gonna go anywhere.

562
00:59:58,282 --> 01:00:00,050
Jess: Push! (grunts)

563
01:00:01,051 --> 01:00:02,586
Ah, fuck.

564
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:05,155
Is there any other way
out of here?

565
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:06,590
How do I know?

566
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:12,262
(car engine revving)

567
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,305
That's him.

568
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:24,308
Hunter: No, no!
You let me handle this.

569
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:25,843
- He will kill me.
- Hunter: I'll handle this.

570
01:00:25,976 --> 01:00:28,479
You get back over there.
Back up against the tree.

571
01:00:32,282 --> 01:00:35,319
No, no.
Thank God, no.

572
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:37,688
Man: No, she's...
she's standing here.

573
01:00:38,021 --> 01:00:40,357
Okay, yeah.
No, she's with somebody.

574
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,392
Okay, thank you so much,

575
01:00:42,526 --> 01:00:45,529
and I'm so sorry that we had
to bother you with this again.

576
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:48,031
Okay, I will.
All right, bye.

577
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:50,969
Jess, for God's sake.

578
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:53,070
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Man: Jess, please.

579
01:00:53,203 --> 01:00:55,439
Hunter: Look, what is...
what is going on here?

580
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:58,141
Sir, you're gonna have
to excuse my sister.

581
01:00:58,275 --> 01:00:59,543
She's not feeling well.

582
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:02,179
I am not your sister,
you fucking psycho!

583
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,449
I found her
about a half hour ago.

584
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:08,252
- She says you kidnapped her.
- Man: Oh, God, no.

585
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:11,421
She had one of her episodes,
and before I knew it,

586
01:01:11,555 --> 01:01:14,391
she was out of the house, and
she had jumped in the river.

587
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:15,860
Don't you believe him.

588
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:17,427
- Look, all right, um...
- Jess, that's enough.

589
01:01:17,561 --> 01:01:19,998
Obviously, we...
we have a situation here.

590
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:22,366
Man: Oh, God.
W... what else did she say?

591
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,635
She said you locked her
in a basement?

592
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:26,069
Jesus.

593
01:01:27,538 --> 01:01:28,605
Jess...

594
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,141
Listen.

595
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,243
We've had a...

596
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:36,713
a tragedy
in our family recently,

597
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,350
and her...
her husband killed himself.

598
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:42,185
Shut up, you sick fuck.

599
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,855
Man: Now she's developed
these triggers,

600
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:47,090
and one second, she's fine, and
then the next, she goes off.

601
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,626
- (thunder rumbles)
- Is she seeing a doctor?

602
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,962
E... every Tuesday.

603
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:53,063
He's lying.
He's fucking lying.

604
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:56,466
Listen, I just got off
the phone with the police

605
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,168
and called off the search.

606
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,203
This is not the first time
that this has happened...

607
01:02:00,337 --> 01:02:01,471
- He's crazy.
- Get back.

608
01:02:01,605 --> 01:02:03,273
Get back.
Over there.

609
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:05,642
Man: I'm sorry, sir.
W... what's your name?

610
01:02:05,776 --> 01:02:06,810
Robert.

611
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,513
I can't begin to thank you
for what you've done.

612
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,315
Jess: Now that he's seen you,

613
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:14,151
he's never gonna let you
out of here alive, never.

614
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:17,154
Jessica, that is
enough for today.

615
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:19,456
Come on.

616
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:21,859
If you could just help me
get her in the car first.

617
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:24,963
- No, no! No!
- (Man shushing)

618
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:27,999
Jess: No! Help me!

619
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:29,232
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

620
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:30,701
- Jess: Help me!
- Man: You're okay.

621
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:33,004
- (Jess grunting)
- Man: Can you give me a hand?

622
01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:34,438
- Ask for his phone!
- Robert: What?

623
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:36,473
- Stop.
- Ask for his fucking phone!

624
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,442
- Man: Let me just...
- Jess: No!

625
01:02:38,642 --> 01:02:41,111
Ask for his phone
and call the police!

626
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:44,181
- (Man shushing)
- Jess: No, no!

627
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:46,017
- Excuse me.
- Man: What?

628
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,318
Can I borrow
your phone, please?

629
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:50,821
- (Jess grunts)
- Man: Fuck! Ouch!

630
01:02:51,521 --> 01:02:52,623
Robert: You stop!

631
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:58,863
- Could you grab her, please?
- Robert: No, she's right.

632
01:02:59,496 --> 01:03:00,697
I need to call the police

633
01:03:00,831 --> 01:03:02,366
and make sure
everything checks out.

634
01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:03,767
It's... it's gonna make me
feel a lot better.

635
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:05,802
Okay, but could you
please just help me

636
01:03:05,937 --> 01:03:06,938
get her in the car first?

637
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:07,972
Phone.

638
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,508
- You want to see my phone?
- Robert: Yes.

639
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,213
Sure, if that's gonna
make you feel better.

640
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,915
Here you go.

641
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:22,386
- Watch out!
- (thunderclap)

642
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:25,188
- (Men grunting)
- Stop!

643
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:37,267
(gunshot)

644
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:41,538
(thunder echoing)

645
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:47,411
(solemn music playing)

646
01:03:59,891 --> 01:04:02,426
(Jess panting)

647
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:34,992
(thunder rumbling)

648
01:04:36,094 --> 01:04:38,930

(Man whistling)

654
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:28,005
(thunderclap)

655
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:29,006
(gunshot)

656
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:32,076
(Jess groaning)

657
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:51,628
(thunderclap)

658
01:06:57,367 --> 01:06:59,636
(Jess grunting)

659
01:07:09,713 --> 01:07:13,817
(thunder rumbles)

660
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:20,457
(Jess gasps)

661
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:36,806
(thunderclap)

662
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:43,480
Man: I know you're close.

663
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:49,486
I know I hit you.

664
01:07:57,794 --> 01:08:00,497
I give you about two hours...

665
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,433
before you bleed to death.

666
01:08:10,473 --> 01:08:13,010
Soon the cramps will set in...

667
01:08:16,613 --> 01:08:18,815
spreading through your body...

668
01:08:21,953 --> 01:08:24,521
and then the rot will start.

669
01:08:30,294 --> 01:08:33,898
Why don't you come out
and fight while you still can?

670
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,769
Yeah, I'll play fair.

671
01:09:00,191 --> 01:09:01,892
It's loaded.

672
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:09,666
You have one minute...

673
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:13,170
to try and grab it...

674
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,606
starting...

675
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,708
now.

676
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,982
Are you too scared?

677
01:09:27,684 --> 01:09:30,187
You know the one thing
I can't stand?

678
01:09:34,025 --> 01:09:35,092
Cowards!

679
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:43,666
Just like that husband
of yours.

680
01:09:45,668 --> 01:09:48,139
Why did he kill himself anyway?

681
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:51,608
Was he too weak?

682
01:09:54,378 --> 01:09:55,379
You know...

683
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:59,316
people who are thinking
about killing themselves...

684
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:05,688
They usually cry out for help.

685
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:11,429
They send these subtle signals

686
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:13,830
to their family and friends.

687
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:19,103
That must just really
tear you apart.

688
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,211
Knowing...

689
01:10:28,711 --> 01:10:30,147
that he...

690
01:10:34,684 --> 01:10:37,188
probably tried to tell you.

691
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:44,794
That guilt must be
something else.

692
01:10:49,533 --> 01:10:54,071
He was supposed to be
the father of your children,

693
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:55,805
and now...

694
01:10:56,874 --> 01:11:00,144
he's rotting
in some grave somewhere.

695
01:11:02,546 --> 01:11:04,081
(slowly exhales)

696
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:08,319
All that sorrow...

697
01:11:10,387 --> 01:11:11,754
all that guilt...

698
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:17,394
would drive me nuts
if I were you.

699
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,267
Completely fucking nuts.

700
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:30,875
He was a coward.

701
01:11:33,878 --> 01:11:36,347
I know fear when I see it.

702
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,183
It's all in the eyes!

703
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:43,087
It's all in the fucking eyes!

704
01:11:44,787 --> 01:11:47,690
(light rustling)

705
01:11:51,428 --> 01:11:53,497
Man:
People think they can hide it,

706
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:54,965
but they can't!

707
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:57,168
Not from me!

708
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:59,836
(thunderclap)

709
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:02,940
Man: Prove to me that I'm wrong!

710
01:12:04,508 --> 01:12:06,877
Show me some fucking guts!

711
01:12:08,212 --> 01:12:10,281
Show me you're just
a little bit better

712
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:12,983
than that shitbag husband
of yours!

713
01:12:17,555 --> 01:12:19,056
Do you hear me?

714
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:28,199
Do you fucking hear me?

715
01:12:32,835 --> 01:12:34,538
I'm gonna get you,

716
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:37,174
you delicious fucking bitch!

717
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:42,112
(thunder rumbling softly)

718
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,882
I'm coming for you.

719
01:12:49,486 --> 01:12:52,223
I am coming for you.

720
01:13:19,717 --> 01:13:22,819

<i>You need to speak up.</i>

Jess: There's a man in glasses.

754
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:39,971
I've been kidnapped.

755

<i>I'm sorry.
Can you repeat that?</i>

756
01:23:43,107 --> 01:23:46,376
Jess: He's going to kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

757
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:49,379
- <i>Who's trying to...</i>

<i>Hello? I can't hear you.</i>

Please let me talk

to talk to you.</i>

<i>Yeah, but who are you?</i>

795
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:36,560
Do you know
where he is right now?

796
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:38,596
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about...</i>

797
01:29:38,728 --> 01:29:40,130
I asked you
a fucking question.

798
01:29:41,031 --> 01:29:43,400
Do you know
where he is right now?

799
01:29:43,534 --> 01:29:45,669
<i>My husband is in California
on a business trip...</i>

- Jess: No, he's not.
- <i>I'm...</i>

801
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,077
He's a kidnapper...
and a murderer.

802
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:55,613
<i>Is this some kind of joke?
If it is...</i>

803
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:57,780
No, it's not a fucking joke!

- <i>Sam, are you there?</i>
- You want to talk to him?

805
01:30:03,087 --> 01:30:06,090
Here, hold on a second.
I'll put him on.

806
01:30:07,558 --> 01:30:08,993
You have a phone call.

807

<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

808

<i>Sam...
what the hell is going on?</i>

809
01:30:17,935 --> 01:30:20,504
<i>Sam?
Talk to me.</i>

810
01:30:20,904 --> 01:30:22,940
My name is Jessica Swanson...

811
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:27,344
and if this is the last time
you hear from me,

812
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:30,180
it's because your husband
killed me,

813
01:30:31,115 --> 01:30:33,284
just like he killed a man
named Robert.

814
01:30:34,451 --> 01:30:36,453
People are probably looking
for him, too.

815
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:38,088
<i>Sam!</i>

816
01:30:38,589 --> 01:30:41,225

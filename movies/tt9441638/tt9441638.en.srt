<i>God.</i>

4
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:16,953
<i>Land.</i>

5
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:20,089
<i>Oil.</i>

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,695
<i>It's often said war is waged
over just these three.</i>

7
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,767
<i>Yet, if war is fought
over land...</i>

8
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:41,243
<i>that land usually has something
to do with God, or oil.</i>

9
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:52,121
<i>I didn't come here
to West Virginia for God.</i>

10
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,722
That thing
was bullshit.

11
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,523
It was just bollocks.

12
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,626
It's a fucking fairy tale.

13
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,529
<i>So here we are...</i>

14
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,301
<i>with suitcases
full of dirty cash.</i>

15
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,003
And what then?

16
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:08,870
<i>Invested in
a petrol operation.</i>

17
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:11,573
...for blokes
like us in a legit world.

18
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:13,775
<i>Big James isn't
a fan of the new deal</i>

19
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,911
<i>and he's kept that no secret
back in London.</i>

20
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,281
The pilot has
informed me that

21
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:20,950
we'll be landing
in just a moment.

22
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:22,284
Hey, you all right?

23
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,854
What's wrong?

24
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:30,825
You all right, Big James?

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,528
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet.

26
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,831
Hey, why didn't Suzie
come along?

27
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,601
You know,
I didn't get the note.

28
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,703
- From who? Harris?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:44,273
Oh.

30
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:46,909
<i>He's bad-mouthed
a deal and Harris knows it.</i>

31
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,646
<i>A smart fella
doesn't cross Harris.</i>

32
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:55,985
<i>'Cause back in London,
Harris is the top man.</i>

33
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,087
<i>Time to finish those drinks.
We'll be on the ground...</i>

34
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,790
<i>Sure, sitting on the
king's throne has its perks.</i>

35
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,325
- <i>...way down to West Virginia.</i>
- Mmm.

36
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,061
<i>But it's lonely
at the top.</i>

37
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,833
<i>But here,
deep in the hills of Appalachia,</i>

38
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,169
<i>Harris has a mate.</i>

39
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,236
<i>An oil man.</i>

40
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:16,272
<i>Preston.</i>

41
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,312
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- I knew these had to be your friends.

42
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,780
Ah, you know I got friends
all over the world.

43
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:26,848
Hmm.

44
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:28,783
Every ten, 20 years,
some actually come visit me.

45
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,652
Oh, sure.

46
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:31,719
Thank you.

47
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,787
Mike.

48
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,992
- It's from all the boys.
- Cigars!

49
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,227
Only the best.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,196
Agent, they're good boys
coming to see me.

51
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,730
- Mmm-hmm.
- They're gonna invest in my operation.

52
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,934
Lot of jobs,
great for the economy.

53
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:47,769
And hey, if I even sniff

54
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:50,672
they know how to pronounce
ISIS, Al-Qaeda and KGB,

55
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:52,041
I'm gonna shoot 'em
in the face myself.

56
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:54,176
Save Uncle Sam
all that time and money.

57
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,078
I know you will.

58
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,283
Now don't you worry.

59
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,686
Excuse me.

60
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,155
How's it going, fellas?

61
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:07,689
I got some friends coming in.

62
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:11,360
I'd like them to experience the peace
and serenity of our beautiful home.

63
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:18,067
You got some fucking balls
on you, old man.

64
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,834
Well, that I do.

65
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,669
That I do.

66
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,974
I also got some brains.

67
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,310
Educated. I read my history.

68
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,315
This here shit
ripped our nation apart,

69
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,352
until finally,
these cocksuckers just quit.

70
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,288
You know?

71
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:43,058
They gave up. They lost.

72
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:46,328
(AIRPLANE APPROACHING)

73
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:49,331
Now, I don't give a shit what
your politics or your ideas are,

74
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,935
but this here shit offends me,

75
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:55,037
'cause I believe in winning
and losing.

76
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,241
And a real man knows
how to do both with dignity.

77
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:03,279
You wanna fly a flag?
Go win something.

78
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:06,215
Riding around with this just
says, "Hey, I'm a fucking loser."

79
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:18,394
Doop!

80
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,465
Ah, me old china!

81
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:24,633
- Look at you!
- Ah!

82
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,435
You're looking great.
You're looking healthy!

83
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,404
Thank you, man.

84
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:29,837
Give me a hug, man.

85
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,773
Well, we're not getting
any younger, are we?

86
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,075
Oh, you know, fine wines,

87
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,944
fine wines. We just
get better with age.

88
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:36,512
Well, you look
pretty good yourself.

89
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,414
- My God.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,518
Preston, I would like to
introduce you to the lovely Jackie.

91
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,054
I didn't think it could get much
prettier here, but it just did.

92
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,788
I'm Junior, by the way.

93
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:51,527
It's pretty hot, babe.
Yeah.

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,462
- Help you down here.
- Oh, thank you.

95
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,231
- Oh, jeez!
- I got you.

96
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:56,764
- Oh!
- Sorry.

97
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:58,200
- Easy. Easy.
- Thank you.

98
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,935
- You gotta watch out there.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,303
- Last step is a doozy.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

100
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:02,837
- Good to see you.
- Fucking hell!

101
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,772
Look at that. What is this?

102
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,944
Mad Max
in the fucking Thunderdome?

103
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:14,450
<i>25 million quid
from the streets of London,</i>

104
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>now in the hills
of Appalachia.</i>

105
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:19,989
<i>Preston needs cash flow.</i>

106
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,523
<i>Harris needs a cleaner.</i>

107
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,460
<i>Win-win, for most.</i>

108
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,229
Babe!

109
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,199
Where are you going?

110
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:34,169
I gotta sort a bit of
business out for Harris.

111
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:36,338
Business? About what?

112
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:39,074
About business,
don't worry about it.

113
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,377
All right, well, bye, babe.

114
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,878
See you later, okay?

115
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,933
An oil deal.

116
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,602
Here.

117
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,404
Doesn't make sense.

118
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:45,140
Cleans up our money.
Makes us legit.

119
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,508
We had a good run,
you and me.

120
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,379
Yeah.

121
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,021
I'm ready.

122
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:02,651
<i>I make a profit.
I mean, I always have.</i>

123
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,523
<i>But these days,
I can't get a fucking loan,</i>

124
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,992
<i>'cause Wall Street
just don't like my techniques.</i>

125
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:17,166
You know,
one of the biggest crimes

126
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,269
as Americans is that

127
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,506
our righteous morality
towards nature

128
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,708
rarely extends beyond
our own backyard.

129
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:32,681
I mean, we love to drive cars,
we love to fly in airplanes.

130
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:35,651
I mean, we don't mind getting
that oil from foreign countries,

131
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:38,520
but God help you if you wanna
drill right here at home.

132
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:42,391
Well, I don't
ascribe to that philosophy.

133
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:46,995
I believe you can drill
and do it right.

134
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:52,067
I learned my trade right here on
this land you all standing on.

135
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:56,305
I don't frac.

136
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,542
I don't use
bullshit chemicals.

137
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:03,712
I treat this land with honor.

138
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:07,549
And leave it like God intended
for it to be.

<i>The paperwork means shit.</i>

00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,739
<i>The contract is in blood,</i>

148

<i>in trust, in friendship.</i>

149
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:37,312
<i>But this contract
is stronger than most.</i>

150
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,282
<i>All because of the bond
between Preston and Harris.</i>

151
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:41,717
Shit!

152
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:43,552
What?

153
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,289
I got a fucking loan.

154
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,693
I got a fucking loan!

155
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,553
I am pretty fastidious
about my cars.

156
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,787
I keep them pretty clean.

157
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,591
Um, and, uh, I was giving a
ride to a friend the other day,

158
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,326
and he's eating a sandwich
in my car,

159
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,827
and he just made a huge mess,

160
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,696
which, I, you know,
I didn't say anything...

161
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,832
Hey, buddy.
How are you doing, miss?

162
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,769
You mind clearing out
so we can sit here?

163
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:36,371
- Are you joking?
- Yes, I do. We're very comfortable here.

164
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,241
Oh!

165
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,409
Don't.

166
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,645
- Oh...
- Stoney.

167
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,847
Come on. I'm sorry
about that. I'm sorry.

168
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,784
- Sorry, guys.
- We'll miss you.

169
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,619
<i>We guys are gonna
take a little break,</i>

170
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,187
<i>so everybody stick around...</i>

171
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,761
Bet you I get with
one of them tonight.

172
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:02,331
They're both taken.

173
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,567
- Taken?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,317
Oh, come on now!

175
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,422
You know what? Fuck me!

176
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,326
I'm an oil man.

177
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:32,694
Yeah.

178
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:34,863
Mmm.

179
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:37,633
You're so much more.

180
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,338
Baby... I love you.

181
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:47,409
Come here.

182
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,448
I got
me dancing shoes on.

183
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,953
Two shots please, darling.
Thank you.

184
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,287
- Oh.
- Got one for you.

185
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,456
- All right.
- And one for me.

186
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,258
And we're doing this
together, all right?

187
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,359
- All right.
- Ready?

188
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:06,828
- Yes.
- One, two, three.

189
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,733
- Mmm.
- Whoo!

190
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,470
Damn! Ah!

191
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,808
It's all right, bud.

192
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,610
You like when I howl
like a wolf, don't you?

193
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,812
Yes. I love it.

194
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,716
All right, gaffer?
Come on, son,

195
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:28,650
where did it all go wrong?

196
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,619
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

197
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,954
Are you coked up, mate?

198
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:33,255
Fuck off!

199
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:34,756
I don't touch the stuff.
Do I, babe?

200
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,792
No. No.

201
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,361
Oi, where's Jackie?

202
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,363
She's fucked off.

203
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,465
She's bored of listening
to all these gangster stories

204
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:44,566
and drinking the Perrier.

205
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:47,235
Yeah, well, you could use
a little Perrier yourself.

206
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,805
Hey, asshole,
what's your problem?

207
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:52,942
Hey, hey, hey!

208
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:59,448
Hey! Boys!

209
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,615
We don't do this here.

210
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,956
Only you could get 86'd
from a bar

211
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,291
called the fucking 86!

212
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:12,929
I mean, wild animals can't get
thrown out of that fucking place!

213
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,430
You are a humiliation to us.

214
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:17,733
You're
a fucking embarrassment!

215
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:20,903
Are you finished,
or shall I pull up a chair?

216
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:23,572
You better
wind your neck in, son,

217
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:24,806
or I'll cut it off.

218
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,342
Fi, get him out of here.

219
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,744
Get him out of here!

220
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,379
Left, right, left, right,
left, right.

221
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,647
Let's get you
to bed, eh?

222
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:40,756
How do women like you get
pulled into a racket like this?

223
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,625
How's that?

224
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:46,528
I mean, you...
You're sophisticated,

225
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,931
you're smart.

226
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,034
You got great style.

227
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:56,038
Your... Your beauty is so
bright, it hurts my eyes.

228
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:00,842
Mmm.

229
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,647
I'm with him because he
pays me to be with him.

230
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,352
- Did not see that coming.
- Mmm.

231
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,321
Aren't we innocent?

232
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,864
I'm gonna
fuck your brains out.

233
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,369
Come on now.

234
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:28,603
- Here we go.
- All right.

235
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,474
Well, he did it.

236
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,912
No, man, this is bad.

237
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,646
- This is not...
- No, it ain't bad.

238
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,815
It's good.
Good for everything.

239
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:40,849
It's all right.

240
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,785
Hey, Junior's Junior.

241
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,554
I'm gonna stop it.
I'm gonna stop it.

242
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:47,123
Mmm-mmm.

243
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:49,926
Calm down, man.
Everything is all right.

244
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:54,696
Oh, man!

245
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,531
Uh, how much longer
are you guys gonna stay?

246
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,635
About, like, an hour,
or so?

247
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,104
I guess another hour.

248
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,536
What are we?

249
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,441
What are you on about?

250
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,679
I've been thinking and...

251
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,682
I had some thoughts about...

252
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,651
It's all right, love,
it's been a big day.

253
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,197
I mean, six years,
what are we doing?

254
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,664
Oh, for fuck's sake,
love, please.

255
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:04,399
But baby I just
think that,

256
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,770
I just think that,
you know, if we...

257
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:10,139
We made some changes,
we'd just...

258
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,440
be happier.

259
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,843
Know what I mean?

260
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,651
Oh, baby, don't do that.

261
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,687
Then you'll just blackout.

262
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,189
Don't want you to blackout.

263
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,670
Oh, hello.

264
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,639
I was wondering
where you were.

265
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:47,809
Everything all right?

266
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,661
Cheers.

267
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,600
What are you doing out here?

268
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,470
Can't sleep.

269
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,574
Where's your man?

270
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,043
He's...

271
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:25,081
He's passed out.

272
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,183
Ouch.

273
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,784
Yeah.

274
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:34,924
You wanna grab a drink?

275
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,930
No. I... No, I can't.

276
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:42,898
Why not?

277
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,135
Well, he's... He's asleep.

278
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:48,803
Well, that's his loss.

279
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,074
The night is young.

280
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:54,576
I'm good.

281
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,916
All right.

282
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,592
You know, it's still kickin'
in there.

283
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,597
One or two drinks,
you'll sleep like a baby.

284
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:19,168
It's your call.

285
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:24,974
All right.

286
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:36,818
One drink.

287
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:42,191
One drink.

288
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,796
Fi?

289
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:54,270
All right!

290
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,772
Fi?

291
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:02,912
What are you doing?

292
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,779
I mean, come on!

293
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,715
We've got an important meeting
in London tomorrow early,

294
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,985
where it's already
Sunday evening.

295
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,154
Now, come on.
Get in the fucking shower

296
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:14,823
and make
yourself presentable. Come on!

297
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:15,891
Wheels up in an hour.

298
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:24,967
What are you doing, son?

299
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,937
Fiona's missing.
I gotta find her.

300
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:32,007
I need you in London.

301
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,708
I'm not leaving
till I find her, boss.

302
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:41,816
Harris! Are we
fucking going or not?

303
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,052
Shut it!

304
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,389
Give me that. Fuck!

305
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:53,129
All right! Let's get
this show on the road here!

306
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,697
Come on! London is calling.

307
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,180
Were you on last night?

308
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:15,284
Yeah, I'm always on.
I own the place.

309
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:19,088
I'm looking for my girlfriend.

310
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:21,423
English girl, Fiona.

311
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:23,993
She's missing.

312
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,098
Look, I'm...

313
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:32,134
sorry about last night.

314
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:36,972
Don't remember much.

315
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:44,846
She was sitting right there
till close...

316
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:48,250
with Preston Lawford's boy.

317
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,288
Did they leave together?

318
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:55,090
I don't talk about
what people do after last call.

319
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,095
Please.

320
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,468
They were laughing and drinking
and having a good time.

321
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:30,459
- The fuck is that?
- It's milk and bourbon.

322
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,128
It's my dad's old technique.

323
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,831
It'll slow you down.
Easy on your stomach.

324
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,435
Trust me.

325
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:47,509
Not bad.

326
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:56,986
Did they leave together?

327
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:00,489
Yes.

328
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,228
The oil boys.

329
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:09,398
They're drilling down south
of Buckley.

330
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,402
How far is that?

331
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,437
It's a few hours,
deep in the hills,

332
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:17,940
past the Big Ugly.

333
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,541
The Big Ugly?

334
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:27,883
These were found
in the ladies room.

335
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:31,086
My phone and wallet.

336
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:36,392
Thanks.

337
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:43,432
<i>Sunday, 2:53 a.m.</i>

338
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,968
<i>Neelyn! Neelyn!
Pick up the phone!</i>

339
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,337
<i>I'm lost!
I don't know where I am.</i>

340
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,205
<i>I don't know where...</i>

341
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,107
<i>Come here!</i>

342
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,010
<i>Hey!</i>

343
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,131
My dad died two years back.

344
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,601
He had a big heart.

345
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:26,075
<i>He lived hard.</i>

346
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,048
His truck's out back.

347
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,318
I'd like it gone.

348
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,661
<i>There's, uh, clothes in there.</i>

349
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,230
<i>I'm sure something will fit.
You should blend in.</i>

350
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:51,400
At least let me
pay you for it.

351
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:54,536
Just take care of yourself.

352
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:02,978
Thank you.

353
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:29,591
There she is.

354
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,561
- How was Owingsville?
- Fantastic.

355
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:34,830
Met with some financiers.

356
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,132
Keeps the job site
up and running. Keeps me here.

357
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,135
Well, I guess
that's good news for some.

358
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:44,039
So you kept out of trouble
as usual?

359
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,174
Yeah, you know me.

360
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,510
Everybody's trying to
get a piece.

361
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:50,212
Yeah.

362
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,714
What time you getting off?

363
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,453
PJ, I'm kinda seeing somebody.

364
00:27:58,487 --> 00:27:59,755
What's your man
got to do with me?

365
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:04,459
Seems like you two
need to talk.

366
00:28:10,632 --> 00:28:11,800
What do we need
to talk about?

367
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:17,406
We've kinda been
hitting it off.

368
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:22,611
You've been hitting it off?

369
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,647
Hitting it off.

370
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:31,520
You've been hitting it off,
or you've been hitting it?

371
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:34,256
We've just been having
a good time, I guess.

372
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:36,725
Well, you sure as shit ain't staking claim
on the only hot piece of ass in town.

373
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,428
It's just not happening.

374
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:40,829
Well...

375
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:43,198
You know what I mean?
You're just not.

376
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:45,567
No, I mean, I guess we've been
down here for a little while,

377
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,502
so maybe it ain't happening
for you.

378
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,107
Ain't happening?

379
00:28:58,413 --> 00:28:59,748
You know,
she's a real nice girl,

380
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,117
and I...
I like her an awful lot.

381
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,454
Okay?

382
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,155
So, why don't you back off?

383
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:11,727
You serious, man?

384
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:15,297
You'll be all right.

385
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:17,833
Why don't you
grab my table for me?

386
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:15,824
Sorry about that.

387
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,860
Just not in my game today,
am I? Sorry.

388
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:20,262
I didn't sleep last night.

389
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:23,699
Hey, what can I get you?

390
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:24,766
Pint of milk.

391
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:27,904
- Milk?
- Yeah.

392
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:30,872
Yeah, milk, okay.

393
00:30:35,744 --> 00:30:38,513
In a pint glass,
with a shot of whiskey.

394
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,951
Okay.

395
00:30:46,956 --> 00:30:47,957
Whiskey.

396
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,361
What do you call that?

397
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:57,332
Milk and bourbon
in a pint glass.

398
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,338
- Okay.
- Junior around?

399
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,441
No, not yet, but he will be.

400
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:08,945
I'll just have a half, please.

401
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:11,580
Thomas, I can't...
I can't serve you, sweetheart.

402
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,315
You're out of money.
I'm sorry. I told you.

403
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:15,617
I understand. Thank you.

404
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:37,806
- Two bottles of beer and two whiskeys.
- Yeah.

405
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,893
You may have
to drink mine as well.

406
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:00,897
Why ain't you drinking?

407
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:03,832
I got things to do.

408
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:05,467
Oh.

409
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:08,503
I ain't got nothing to do.

410
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,575
Drink up, mate.

411
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:25,620
Fellas, two colds ones
just for y'all.

412
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,023
You sure you don't want
nothing to eat?

413
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:29,491
Y'all must be starving!
They ain't feed you out there?

414
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:33,062
- Miss me, darling?
- Oh, Lord, always!

415
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:36,531
Hmm. I detect a slight
hint of sarcasm in your voice.

416
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:38,901
Well, you should have been a
cop, not an oil man, right?

417
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:41,904
Ah! See, the thing is,
oil just pays so much better.

418
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:43,973
Hadn't heard that.

419
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:46,408
- Hi.
- Hey.

420
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,881
Neelyn.

421
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,016
What are you doing here?

422
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:58,353
Just dropped in for a pint.

423
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:00,655
Hmm.

424
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,458
Nasty scratch you got there.

425
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,396
Oh, you know,
had a little bit of a dust up.

426
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,134
Man or a woman?

427
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:13,936
A hillbilly who asked me
too many questions.

428
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:15,938
Well, how about this one?

429
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:19,075
When was the last time
you saw Fiona?

430
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:23,112
Oh, last call at the bar
in Owingsville.

431
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:26,115
She was pretty drunk, so...

432
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:29,151
I walked her back
to your room.

433
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:31,988
- Back to my room?
- Mmm.

434
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,161
Now, to be honest with you,

435
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:42,697
she did want to go back
to mine, but...

436
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,101
I took her to yours,
'cause that's the kind of guy that I am.

437
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,904
What was that name

438
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:49,205
she was calling him
there at the bar?

439
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:51,506
- Whiskey Dick.
- That's it.

440
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,708
Old... Old Whiskey Dick.
Old Whiskey Dick.

441
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:56,178
- Yeah.
- That was it.

442
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:57,612
Old Whiskey Dick.

443
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,130
I knew there was something
I liked about you.

444
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:17,900
Why don't you meet me outside?

445
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,106
Oh, you don't
want to fight him.

446
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,016
All right.

447
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,718
Ooh!

448
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,789
All right, man.
You're good.

449
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:42,024
- You got him, you got him.
- You're good.

450
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,793
You got him. Come on.
Let's finish this. Come on.

451
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:46,661
I'm just
getting started, baby.

452
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:48,030
- Easy peasy...
- I'm just getting started, baby.

453
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:50,865
All right, man.
All right, all right.

454
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,835
He's drunk. Hey, no...
Leave him alone, man.

455
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,171
Always fucking drunk.

456
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:57,039
You all right, man?
You need a minute?

457
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:59,108
Come on, boy!

458
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,743
Want to try it again? Try that again.
Try that again. Right here.

459
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:04,846
Oh!

460
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:11,253
- Ow!
- Junior, leave it.

461
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:12,922
- He's okay.
- You want another one?

462
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:16,158
Man, that's too easy.
He's too easy to fight, man.

463
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:21,163
Man,
fish in a barrel, baby.

464
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:28,938
Oh!

465
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:30,538
You got him. Yeah, you got him.
You got him, bro.

466
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:31,606
Fuck off.

467
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:35,177
Help him up,
so you can knock him down again.

468
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:37,612
Come on.

469
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:38,613
Can't kick a man
while he's down.

470
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:40,715
Come on, folks. Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

471
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:48,690
- Junior, no!
- Fucker!

472
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,895
Ooh!

473
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,231
Oh!

474
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:04,907
Hey, Junior, get up!

475
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:09,178
What'd you do that for?

476
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,214
Fuck!

477
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:14,150
You all right?

478
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:22,590
Hey, Pop.

479
00:36:27,063 --> 00:36:28,130
What?

480
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,698
I didn't do nothin'.

481
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:36,906
So Neelyn just...

482
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:39,308
jumped in a car, drove down
here to pick a fight with you...

483
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:42,178
'cause you didn't do nothin'?

484
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:46,015
I guess.

485
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:50,086
Kind of a crazy
son of a bitch.

486
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,692
Goddamn you.

487
00:37:00,062 --> 00:37:01,130
Goddamn you.

488
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,801
Goddamn you!
Goddamn you!

489
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:25,387
I want the facts.

490
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,058
She was real drunk.

491
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,727
I walked her to her room.

492
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:37,967
I swear.

493
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,736
Did the right thing.

494
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:44,907
Okay.

495
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,674
Now we heard
the bullshit version.

496
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,979
Why don't you to tell me
what really happened.

497
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:55,284
I don't know.

498
00:37:57,752 --> 00:37:58,820
I went to bed.

499
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:01,323
I can't control him.

500
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:03,359
I'm not a spy,
I'm not a babysitter.

501
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:04,994
I'm an oil man.

502
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,662
You're the highest paid
motherfucker on this operation.

503
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:10,399
You're here
to keep an eye on him.

504
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,267
You're here
to keep him in line.

505
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,002
You can't do it
and you're his dad.

506
00:38:22,978 --> 00:38:24,113
Why don't you
have him handle it?

507
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,419
Milt doesn't finesse
a situation.

508
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:32,188
Milt makes
a situation go away.

509
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:34,990
This situation needs finesse.

510
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:37,927
Me and Harris are like family.

511
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:40,930
Neelyn's like family
to Harris.

512
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,867
And then there's my boy,
who fucking lies to my face.

513
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:54,977
Now, Will...

514
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,250
Why don't you tell me
what you think happened?

515
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,386
I don't know for sure.

516
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:08,823
I went to bed after I saw
Junior having sex with

517
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,825
Harris' girlfriend.

518
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,529
Oh, fuck!

519
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,464
It's almost romantic
by Junior's standards.

520
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:17,433
Before we hear details
we can't unhear,

521
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,002
I'll try finesse.

522
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:32,915
You a man of God, Will?

523
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:37,286
Yes, sir.

524
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:39,288
- Mmm.
- You?

525
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,758
I don't know. I try to be.

526
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:49,298
I sure do
a lot of prayin' about...

527
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:53,302
About Junior.

528
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:57,106
My son.

529
00:39:58,607 --> 00:39:59,841
My only blood.

530
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:04,413
But he's a goddamn...

531
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,025
You know...

532
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,596
You can't just abandon
your own son,

533
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:22,131
especially if he ain't got
no mama.

534
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:26,902
And you're a hell of
an oil man, Will.

535
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,138
And you're a great foreman.

536
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:30,572
But I could buy me
a hundred of them.

537
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,477
I need somebody I can trust.

538
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:40,082
Somebody to be a friend
to my son.

539
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:43,052
To be his brains,
to be his protector.

540
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:45,921
I don't think I can do it.

541
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:52,494
And be a man of God.

542
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,969
Yeah, well...

543
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:11,447
If you can't
take care of my boy,

544
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:14,416
I'm gonna have to
find somebody who can.

545
00:41:51,353 --> 00:41:52,388
Hey, beautiful.

546
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:58,260
Hello, handsome.

547
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:02,264
What's the word on the street?

548
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,568
Uh, Junior's fine.

549
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:08,971
- Well...
- Junior's fine.

550
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,172
That's too damn bad, isn't it?

551
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:19,214
What is that?

552
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:21,950
Quit your job.

553
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,454
No.

554
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:27,656
No, I'm not taking your money.

555
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:29,925
Listen to me.

556
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:34,396
I need the job
more than I need the money.

557
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,233
I need some place that I can
go every day and every night.

558
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:41,537
It keeps me straight.

559
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:43,972
Goddamn.

560
00:42:45,674 --> 00:42:47,576
- Baby...
- Well, I'm trying.

561
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:49,711
I know, baby.

562
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,017
And I love that
you offered me this.

563
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,087
But I can't take it.

564
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,490
That's just not who I am.

565
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,696
And I hope you
love me for not taking it,

566
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,731
mmm?

567
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,433
I do. I'm just...

568
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,504
It's just
your pride sometimes.

569
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,408
Come on.

570
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:50,038
Preston's only got three
things that matter to him.

571
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:52,774
Family.

572
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:56,678
Honor.

573
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,182
And oil.

574
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:02,718
In that order.

575
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:08,390
Your girl ran off.

576
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:12,060
Fooled around
behind your back.

577
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:13,795
Dumped you.

578
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,532
Maybe she's gone missing.
I don't know.

579
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:19,535
You're lookin' for answers.

580
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:23,171
And the answers you find

581
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:25,173
just might lead you
right to Junior.

582
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:34,516
I owe my life
to Preston Lawford.

583
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:42,524
I ain't got the time or the
energy to tell that story,

584
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:44,693
and even if I did,
I wouldn't.

585
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,665
I work for him
with absolute loyalty.

586
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,370
If you go after his boy,
I gotta put you down.

587
00:44:58,473 --> 00:44:59,541
Right or wrong,

588
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:02,744
it's just what I got to do.

589
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:46,321
You're looking for Preston.

590
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,625
You must be friends
with that...

591
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:50,859
I'm from London, yeah.

592
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:52,694
Ah.

593
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:55,797
Well, uh, can I
get you anything?

594
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:57,766
Beer? Cocktail?

595
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:00,535
I'll have a Perrier.

596
00:46:01,837 --> 00:46:03,205
We don't got Perrier here.

597
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:06,808
But I can get you something
like it.

598
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:17,386
Here you go.

599
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,396
I just did a year.

600
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:32,801
My hat's off to you, girl.

601
00:46:33,702 --> 00:46:35,871
Hat's off, yeah.

602
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:37,839
- I'm Harris.
- I'm Kara.

603
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:40,910
Kara. Very pleased
to meet you.

604
00:46:40,943 --> 00:46:42,377
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.

605
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,383
You mentioned
the other geezer from London.

606
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:50,485
Neelyn?

607
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:55,457
You guys family?

608
00:46:58,995 --> 00:47:00,796
It's a very complicated
question.

609
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,501
So, where's Preston?

610
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:08,971
This is my nephew
and this is my niece.

611
00:47:09,005 --> 00:47:10,940
- How are you, kids?
- Preston!

612
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:14,409
Doop!

613
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:15,945
That was a quick trip
from London.

614
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:17,746
Well, you said come see
the site,

615
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:18,915
and I took you at your word.

616
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:20,348
You took the scenic route,
didn't you?

617
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,484
I did take the scenic route. How are you, man?

618
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:24,553
I'm good. I can't say
I missed you. You just left.

619
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:26,521
I know.

620
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,623
Ah! Who's your friends?

621
00:47:28,657 --> 00:47:30,559
We got something for you
this morning.

622
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:32,360
- Oh!
- Well, thank you, darlin'.

623
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,329
Thank you, son.
Thank you very much.

624
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:36,364
No, I... I... I... ate.

625
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:39,835
Harris, respect, for them,
the land,

626
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:41,470
and most importantly,
the cooking.

627
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:44,639
Thank you.

628
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:45,707
Did you make this?

629
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:49,344
- Mmm, oh!
- Mmm!

630
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:51,013
- That is so good.
- Here.

631
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:52,781
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm. Oh.

632
00:47:52,814 --> 00:47:56,618
Mmm, I'm gonna keep mine,
all right?

633
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:58,687
- Take it easy now.
- Let's go. Let's head on back.

634
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:01,723
Well, they seem to like you.

635
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:04,994
Yeah? Well, I sat with them.

636
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:08,697
Month after month,
year after year.

637
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,699
- Hmm.
- Just me and Milt.

638
00:48:10,732 --> 00:48:12,501
No lawyers, no bullshit.

639
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:14,503
I promised them two things.

640
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:17,372
A good deal,

641
00:48:17,405 --> 00:48:19,976
and that the water and the
land would be unharmed.

642
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:21,777
- Mmm.
- Turned around and gave me the mineral rights.

643
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,915
And what happens
if there's a fuck up?

644
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,549
Like an oil spill,
or something?

645
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,519
You know better than anybody

646
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:32,320
what a blood contract
looks like.

647
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:35,423
This here motherfuckers
are serious.

648
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,827
They love this land.
They live it.

649
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,996
It's special to 'em.

650
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:42,697
They remind me every day...

651
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:45,935
I got a sacred obligation.

652
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:48,503
Come on.

653
00:48:48,537 --> 00:48:50,338
So...

654
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:51,473
Uh...

655
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:54,776
you don't know where
Neelyn is, do you?

656
00:48:56,946 --> 00:49:00,448
Fiona fucked off
and you're blaming Junior?

657
00:49:01,716 --> 00:49:03,652
Just gathering the facts.

658
00:49:03,685 --> 00:49:06,488
You're on a fact-finding
mission, are you?

659
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:09,624
Is that what you call smashing
a boy's head in with a rock?

660
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:11,459
Come on. We're leaving, son.

661
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:14,429
Me and Junior haven't
finished our discussion.

662
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:16,765
Oh, well,
that's too fucking bad, innit?

663
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:19,501
You're coming back
to London with me.

664
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:21,870
Not gonna happen, boss.

665
00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:26,474
Come on.

666
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,678
Think of the money.

667
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,948
Thousands of dollars
every month

668
00:49:31,981 --> 00:49:34,984
without breaking a sweat
or any bones.

669
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:37,887
A new life.

670
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:41,690
I don't want a new life.

671
00:49:46,428 --> 00:49:48,663
I haven't come here
just to chat.

672
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:51,700
Fiona's dead.

673
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:03,678
All these years, I've done whatever
you've asked, followed your orders.

674
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,783
Good men do bad things.

675
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:10,518
Bad men do good things.

676
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:14,623
Tricky game, trying to label
a bloke with a title.

677
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:17,726
On the spectrum,

678
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,696
on the far end
of where we operate,

679
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,201
the bad men,
they know the difference

680
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:29,005
between dark shades of grey
and pitch black.

681
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:32,407
They see it, smell it,
and they feel it.

682
00:50:33,976 --> 00:50:35,111
And Junior...

683
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:37,947
he's pitch black.

684
00:50:39,614 --> 00:50:42,484
And after all the shit
I've done in my life,

685
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,122
if I can't stop
a beast like him,

686
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:47,890
then what's my purpose?

687
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:56,598
He's Preston's only family.

688
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:58,700
It's his only flesh and blood.

689
00:51:00,202 --> 00:51:02,104
Let me take you home.

690
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:03,973
Fight this battle another day.

691
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:15,617
Hello? Yeah,
we're leaving now.

692
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:17,954
Wheels up in 15.

693
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,555
Good.

694
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:29,098
What the...
You fucking muppet.

695
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:32,101
You are
fucking dead to me!

696
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:35,004
You're dead, dead, dead!

697
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:37,006
What? What?

698
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,708
Get the...

699
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:41,776
What the...

700
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,611
You fucking arsehole.

701
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,128
- Any trouble?
- Hell no.

702
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:18,914
I'm a rifleman myself.

703
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:22,717
You seem like a rifleman.

704
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:24,519
I'm good too.

705
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:26,588
Real good.

706
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:32,627
You see that?

707
00:52:35,898 --> 00:52:36,999
We're both steady, mate.

708
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:42,038
Well, there's all kinds
of steady, ain't there?

709
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:45,975
You're a wise man, Thomas.

710
00:52:46,008 --> 00:52:47,575
Shit.

711
00:52:53,049 --> 00:52:55,550
Okay, sounds good.
See y'all tomorrow.

712
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:04,626
Good day?

713
00:53:05,327 --> 00:53:06,594
Yeah.

714
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:08,797
Just got a little better.

715
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:11,200
Did the early shift.
Now I'm off.

716
00:53:13,302 --> 00:53:14,803
Do you know where
I can find Junior?

717
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:18,974
- Is that for him?
- Nah.

718
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:22,945
This is for wolves and coyotes.

719
00:53:22,978 --> 00:53:25,347
Well, turkey season just started
here in West Virginia, so...

720
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:29,818
Well, I guess
I'm turkey hunting then.

721
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,291
Kind of hard not to like.

722
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:38,726
I mean, I can tell
you're bad, but...

723
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:41,763
not.

724
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:44,366
Well, if you like me so much,

725
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:47,769
maybe you can set me up
with a place to stay.

726
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:49,972
Look...

727
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:58,746
Getting on the bad side
of Preston Lawford

728
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,217
doesn't really make
life easier for a girl.

729
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:05,154
I'll tell you what.

730
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,656
Why don't you tell me why
you care so much,

731
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,926
and if your story moves me,

732
00:54:12,962 --> 00:54:13,996
then I'll help you.

733
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:17,900
I can't do that right now.

734
00:54:46,228 --> 00:54:48,397
You can smoke in there
if you want. I do.

735
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,267
Cheers.

736
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:11,287
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.

737
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,555
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

738
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:15,991
Of course, come on in.
You want a beer or something?

739
00:55:16,025 --> 00:55:19,161
Uh, no, not before
I drive down the mountain.

740
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,695
That's why my pops calls you
the smart one.

741
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:23,032
What's on your mind, man?

742
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:27,269
Uh, I wanted to
talk to you about...

743
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,072
About Kara, down at the lodge?

744
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,042
You know,
I told you we've been...

745
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,178
We've been spending
some time together.

746
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:40,082
I like her. I'm with her.

747
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:44,220
And I told you, on these jobs
in remote areas,

748
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:47,289
one guy cannot be
staking claim

749
00:55:47,323 --> 00:55:49,124
to the only
hot piece of ass around.

750
00:55:50,192 --> 00:55:51,293
Just ain't fair.

751
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:03,405
Right. And, uh...
And I've respected that,

752
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:05,474
you know, when we've gone
from town to town.

753
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,144
But Kara's different.

754
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:16,318
So what are you saying?

755
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,131
We have a bond.

756
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:30,266
It's somethin' special.

757
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:33,035
I love her.

758
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:38,806
Wow.

759
00:56:43,479 --> 00:56:44,513
You love her.

760
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:47,883
So all you're asking...

761
00:56:49,418 --> 00:56:51,453
is for me, or anybody else,
for that matter,

762
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:55,424
to just stay away from her.

763
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:57,393
I'm asking you to respect her.

764
00:56:58,594 --> 00:57:01,130
And to respect us as a couple.
That's it.

765
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:16,145
Okay.

766
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:19,982
Okay, man, okay.

767
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:22,451
- Cool?
- Yeah, you got it.

768
00:57:23,285 --> 00:57:24,286
Done.

769
00:57:30,926 --> 00:57:33,529
- Thanks, buddy.
- Hey, I'm happy for you.

770
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:35,564
- Thank you, PJ.
- You're welcome, man.

771
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:36,632
- All right.
- True love.

772
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:40,369
Hey, true love
calls for a shot.

773
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:43,172
Come on.
A celebration. Come on!

774
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,510
You ain't getting out
that easy.

775
00:57:56,151 --> 00:57:58,153
To you and Kara.

776
00:57:58,187 --> 00:57:59,521
- You guys are in love?
- Uh-huh.

777
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,491
And that shit
is beautiful.

778
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:05,594
- Cheers, man.
- All right, man.

779
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:06,995
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

780
00:58:18,974 --> 00:58:20,042
Come on, Will.

781
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:23,579
After everything I've done
for you,

782
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:25,948
you come in here and tell me
what I can and can't do?

783
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:29,485
Whose name's on the door?

784
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,353
Whose name's on
your fucking paycheck?

785
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:35,991
Come on, Will.

786
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,997
Hey... Please.

787
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:47,569
Fix you up.

788
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,573
No. No.

789
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,527
Unbelievable.

790
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:16,331
You're done working for me.

791
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,267
That's for damn sure.

792
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:24,706
Good luck finding another job
that treats you as well as we did.

793
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:31,480
Hope she was worth it.

794
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,135
<i>Tell me exactly
what happened.</i>

795
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:57,372
<i>I don't know.</i>

796
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,575
<i>I'm gonna find out.</i>

797
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:12,287
<i>Neelyn! Neelyn!
Pick up the phone!</i>

798
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:13,755
<i>I'm lost!
I don't know...</i>

799
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:14,623
- <i>Hey, girl! Where are you going?</i>
- <i>...where I am.</i>

800
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,558
Come here!

801
01:00:16,592 --> 01:00:19,161
<i>Hey, girl.
What are you doing?</i>

802
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:55,464
I'm gonna help you
any way I can.

803
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:27,262
Fiona's dead.

804
01:01:38,807 --> 01:01:39,841
I'll handle it.

805
01:01:40,642 --> 01:01:42,778
Today or next year?

806
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:44,846
I'll handle it tonight.

807
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:49,651
And if it leads me to Junior,

808
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:51,587
I will handle it
with extreme prejudice.

809
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:53,789
But I'll handle it.

810
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,825
- Nobody else.
- Is that right?

811
01:01:57,859 --> 01:01:59,461
Just like
you'll handle Neelyn.

812
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,634
He ain't gonna go lightly.

813
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,205
Yeah, well,
we don't do lightly.

814
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:16,745
He's never betrayed me
like this before.

815
01:02:20,682 --> 01:02:22,150
Yeah, well,
he's on his own now.

816
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:24,720
Milt's gonna get him.

817
01:02:24,753 --> 01:02:26,121
I'll handle Neelyn.

818
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,257
Nobody else but me.

819
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:32,327
You and me,

820
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,263
we're cut from
the same cloth, brother.

821
01:03:39,394 --> 01:03:41,730
How's your night going?

822
01:03:43,331 --> 01:03:45,168
Hey, Junior.

823
01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:51,573
What is so dang funny?

824
01:03:52,674 --> 01:03:53,709
Wow.

825
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:56,244
Huh?

826
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:59,448
You just look beautiful.

827
01:04:00,782 --> 01:04:02,085
I mean,
you always look beautiful.

828
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:04,586
You're just a whole 'nother
shade of beautiful this evening.

829
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,688
Thank you.

830
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:09,524
You always know just what to
say, don't you?

831
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:10,993
You know me.

832
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:12,260
Say what's on my mind.

833
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:14,730
No bullshit.

834
01:04:16,364 --> 01:04:18,567
What's on your mind right now?

835
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,535
Guess I'm just caught up
on how damn pretty you are.

836
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:23,906
So pretty,
I can hardly look at you

837
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,574
without hurting my eyes.

838
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,912
Well, you don't look
so bad yourself.

839
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,285
Let me buy you a drink.

840
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:41,356
Oh, I'm good. I got my cranberry
on the rocks right here.

841
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:42,758
Let's put some vodka in there.

842
01:04:45,494 --> 01:04:46,495
I'm good.

843
01:04:50,832 --> 01:04:51,867
Cheers.

844
01:04:53,702 --> 01:04:54,736
Cheers.

845
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:00,877
And, I don't know,
but, I thought... Oh.

846
01:05:02,744 --> 01:05:04,013
Find yourself
a new babysitter.

847
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:08,050
I'm done.

848
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:22,497
Let's go.

849
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:32,607
- Stoney.
- Yeah.

850
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:41,416
'Bout time
you warmed up to me.

851
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:45,654
Yeah, well, girl's gotta work
her way up the food chain.

852
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:46,755
You could just start
at the top.

853
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:50,759
I wasn't sure
I was ready for you.

854
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:54,362
I'm still not.

855
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,933
- Mmm.
- Slow down.

856
01:05:56,966 --> 01:05:58,600
I don't do slow.

857
01:05:58,633 --> 01:05:59,902
You wanna know what you are?

858
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:02,604
I'm all business, baby.

859
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:05,707
You're a vile piece of shit.

860
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:11,746
You might wanna drop
that boner, son.

861
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:14,984
Get on the floor.

862
01:06:17,786 --> 01:06:20,990
Get the fuck down,
or I'll blow you a-fuckin-way right now.

863
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:31,600
I fucking found her.

864
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:33,835
I know you were there.

865
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:36,605
She slipped.

866
01:06:38,473 --> 01:06:39,507
She fell.

867
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:42,477
Hey! Kara!

868
01:06:44,746 --> 01:06:46,048
- Where is she?
- She's safe.

869
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:49,618
What's going on?

870
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:51,453
Well, come here.
We're just about to find out.

871
01:06:58,593 --> 01:07:00,595
- PJ.
- Hey, buddy.

872
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,532
And what's your fucking story?

873
01:07:06,501 --> 01:07:07,802
Look, we went for a drive,

874
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:09,939
just having some fun.

875
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:14,442
Stoney was there.
Weren't you, Stoney?

876
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:19,714
Your girl was
pretty drunk, Neelyn.

877
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:23,818
Drunk, or drugged?

878
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,656
That's your move, ain't it?

879
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:29,658
- Bullshit!
- Is it?

880
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:32,460
What's up, Stoney?
That's his move, ain't it?

881
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:36,165
Speak up. Drunk or drugged?

882
01:07:36,198 --> 01:07:37,934
Put the wrench down.

883
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:40,102
- Fucking speak up, Stoney.
- Put the wrench down.

884
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:42,537
You fuck!

885
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:45,041
Motherfucker!

886
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:55,885
Speak up!

887
01:07:55,918 --> 01:07:58,020
Now's your time,
you greasy bitch!

888
01:07:58,054 --> 01:07:59,721
Speak up!

889
01:07:59,754 --> 01:08:03,092
Just fucking
say something, man.

890
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,961
No.

891
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:05,895
Fucking say something!

892
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:09,231
He drugged her at the bar.

893
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:11,666
He drugged her at the bar!
She didn't know.

894
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,937
Then we went for a drive,
and then we parked.

895
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:18,074
And she... They were
fucking around.

896
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:20,042
And she seemed into it.

897
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:24,914
But... But... Fuck.

898
01:08:24,947 --> 01:08:27,083
Talk like
a goddamn man, Stoney.

899
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:31,887
All right, okay,
she wasn't into it at all.

900
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:33,222
That's fucking bullshit!

901
01:08:33,255 --> 01:08:35,257
She came back to the bar,
'cause she wanted a real fucking man,

902
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,725
not a bitch.

903
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:39,794
Maybe she just wanted
a drink.

904
01:08:41,696 --> 01:08:44,266
Every woman wants you,
right, PJ?

905
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,534
That's right, buddy.

906
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:48,304
Oh, yeah.

907
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:50,072
Fucked his girl on a keg
behind the bar

908
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:51,941
while you were all playing
fucking gangsters.

909
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:54,143
Well, congratulations, son.

910
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:55,510
You shagged my hooker.

911
01:08:57,113 --> 01:08:58,747
Yeah, free of charge, old man.

912
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,814
Free of charge.

913
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:04,120
Would have fucked your girl if
she wasn't so goddamn clumsy.

914
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:07,856
Neelyn.

915
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:12,028
Enough.

916
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,956
The beating I gave you
is gonna be nothing

917
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,824
compared to what's coming
Kara's way.

918
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:44,326
Guarantee you that,
you piece of shit.

919
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,328
- What'd you fucking say?
- You fucking heard me.

920
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:55,737
He won't be touching
your girl no more, Will.

921
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,741
Get the fuck out of here.

922
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:04,779
No more bars.

923
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:08,783
No more good times.

924
01:10:08,817 --> 01:10:10,718
You're gonna get your shit
out of the lodge,

925
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:11,820
you're gonna put it
in a truck,

926
01:10:12,654 --> 01:10:15,057
work and sleep.

927
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:18,094
That's your life
till we finish this job.

928
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:19,962
You hear me?

929
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:23,631
Milt...

930
01:10:23,665 --> 01:10:26,734
get this piece of shit up to the
mountains as soon as you get his shit.

931
01:10:30,839 --> 01:10:32,041
How you doin', Milt?

932
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:07,877
Baby. Babe.

933
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:36,272
Well, go on.
Get on with it.

934
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,010
Or have you forgotten
how to do it?

935
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:43,778
It was easy having me do it for
you all these years, wasn't it?

936
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:47,749
Long time since you were
in the trenches.

937
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:52,087
All the blood and guts.
Drinking man's game.

938
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:54,756
Ain't no Perrier down here.

939
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:58,093
No preaching and Perrier.

940
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:00,728
It was easy when
you didn't have

941
01:12:00,762 --> 01:12:01,964
to blow your best mate away.

942
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:07,835
What's going on?

943
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,906
He's trying to pluck up
the courage to pull the trigger.

944
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,274
Why?

945
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:14,510
So that he can save
his oil deal.

946
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,412
Isn't Junior the one
we should all be after?

947
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:25,921
He's up at the drill site.
That's where they took him.

948
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:28,123
You got a black soul.

949
01:12:30,025 --> 01:12:33,262
Tonight, so do I.

950
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:35,164
- Wait, babe.
- Come on.

951
01:12:37,299 --> 01:12:38,334
Neelyn.

952
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,970
Uh, Fiona...

953
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:46,841
I'm sorry.

954
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:52,881
Take care, guvnor.

955
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:04,460
Hurry up.

956
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:31,520
I need to do this alone.

957
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,023
Get out of here.

958
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:36,125
What?

959
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:38,260
This is between me and Junior.

960
01:13:38,294 --> 01:13:40,162
No, you're not the only one
who wants...

961
01:14:07,389 --> 01:14:08,457
All right, come on.

962
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:18,866
Over here.

963
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:35,017
Hey, Buddy.

964
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:50,899
Let's go.
Let's take a fucking walk.

965
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:53,369
Come on. Keep moving.

966
01:14:58,474 --> 01:15:00,275
Let's go.

967
01:15:00,309 --> 01:15:02,478
Over here. Right there.
There you go.

968
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:05,414
Right there.

969
01:15:07,015 --> 01:15:08,050
Nice.

970
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:13,055
Thanks for coming
all this way, man.

971
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:16,024
Appreciate it.

972
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:17,559
As you know, I'm grounded,

973
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:19,361
so it's a bit difficult
for me to leave.

974
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:30,506
Just so you know, Neelyn,

975
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:33,609
your girl put up
more of a fight than you did.

976
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:35,611
I'll give her that much.

977
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:46,555
Yeah, there you go.

978
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:48,223
There you go. Come on.
Come on!

979
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:49,591
Come on, motherfucker!

980
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,460
Come on. There you go, boy.
Come on!

981
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:54,196
Come on. Come on! Come on!

982
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:56,131
Show a little bit of fire,
motherfucker!

983
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:57,433
Come on!

984
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,968
Heavy decks.

985
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:01,503
He don't want it no more.

986
01:16:01,537 --> 01:16:02,604
Come on. Just kill him.

987
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:05,441
Enough.

988
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:10,612
Enough!

989
01:16:30,766 --> 01:16:32,301
Just so you know, Neelyn,

990
01:16:34,503 --> 01:16:36,638
if it was me, I probably would
have done the same thing.

991
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:58,160
Stay away from that truck, boys.
It's gonna go up.

992
01:16:58,193 --> 01:16:59,561
- And Neelyn?
- Move him, move him, move him.

993
01:16:59,595 --> 01:17:01,663
Get him up. Get him up.
Go, get some halon in there.

994
01:17:01,697 --> 01:17:02,865
Now. Fast!

995
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:05,667
- All right.
- Check him out. Is he bleeding?

996
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:08,170
Boys, get the fire extinguishers.
Let's get this out.

997
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:10,472
He's all right.

998
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:22,784
Get the hell
out of here!

999
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:35,564
PJ.

1000
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:39,735
Ah!

1001
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:41,637
Look who's here to save
the fucking day.

1002
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,671
Put it down.

1003
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:44,640
Fuck you.

1004
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:47,042
Put it... down.

1005
01:17:57,286 --> 01:17:58,320
What are you gonna do?

1006
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:06,528
Don't do this.

1007
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:08,263
Do it.

1008
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:11,466
Do it!

1009
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:16,104
You don't have the balls,
do you?

1010
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:23,512
You've always been
a fucking coward.

1011
01:18:46,702 --> 01:18:48,704
This is my purpose.

1012
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,381
Junior?

1013
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,217
Hey, go.

1014
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,861
Nobody gets down
off this mountain.

1015
01:19:17,332 --> 01:19:18,367
Nobody.

1016
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:47,262
How you feeling?

1017
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,465
Did you feel it?

1018
01:19:52,467 --> 01:19:53,535
You always feel it.

1019
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:01,476
Did it feel better?

1020
01:20:06,415 --> 01:20:07,917
Killing never makes it
feel better.

1021
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:11,853
It's the booze that
makes it feel better.

1022
01:20:15,624 --> 01:20:16,825
It's over now. It's done.

1023
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:27,602
Six years she wasted
on a prick like me.

1024
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:31,840
Waited.

1025
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:40,382
If you loved each other...

1026
01:20:42,784 --> 01:20:43,785
there's no waste.

1027
01:20:57,033 --> 01:20:58,667
They stopped Harris
coming up the mountain.

1028
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,735
He might make trouble.

1029
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:03,872
Wouldn't expect anything less.

1030
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:08,243
When he gets up here, Milt,

1031
01:21:09,678 --> 01:21:10,947
it's all between him and me.

1032
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,347
I can't have you involved.

1033
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:25,293
We was 30 years old.

1034
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:28,330
PJ was three.

1035
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:33,035
Me and Linda,

1036
01:21:33,069 --> 01:21:36,505
we flew off to London to celebrate
our five-year anniversary,

1037
01:21:36,538 --> 01:21:39,008
left PJ with his grandma.

1038
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:41,476
We was coming back one night
from a magical night.

1039
01:21:43,745 --> 01:21:45,982
She was dancing
on a street corner.

1040
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:53,688
Car came around that bend
so fast,

1041
01:21:53,722 --> 01:21:55,724
she was dead before she hit
the cobblestones.

1042
01:22:01,898 --> 01:22:02,932
Driver was drunk.

1043
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:08,070
But what made it worse,
he was rich.

1044
01:22:08,104 --> 01:22:09,638
Connected London elite.

1045
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:11,773
And arrogant as fuck.

1046
01:22:14,409 --> 01:22:18,613
He was gonna walk on some
bullshit wrongful death charge.

1047
01:22:20,016 --> 01:22:22,684
My lawyer, even though he knew
everybody in town,

1048
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:25,687
he told me that was how
it was gonna go.

1049
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:29,858
Said if I wanted any justice,
it was waiting for me...

1050
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,994
in a warehouse.

1051
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:34,931
Harris.

1052
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:39,835
Two days later,
that drunk fuck

1053
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:42,671
was never heard from
or seen again.

1054
01:22:45,107 --> 01:22:46,374
Me and Harris...

1055
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:50,612
we became blood brothers
for life.

1056
01:22:52,915 --> 01:22:55,383
He just did it as a favor?

1057
01:22:56,484 --> 01:22:59,688
I was a young, rich
oil man, Milt.

1058
01:22:59,721 --> 01:23:01,590
I could have paid him
anything he asked for.

1059
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:02,691
He didn't want a dime.

1060
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,460
Just wanted to be friends.

1061
01:23:06,428 --> 01:23:08,697
Maybe one day I'd teach him
the oil business.

1062
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,104
We got away with it.

1063
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:18,840
But I'm convinced...

1064
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:23,678
that the Lord has been
making me pay with PJ.

1065
01:23:26,615 --> 01:23:30,086
When he gets here, Milt,
it's just about him and me, all right?

1066
01:23:49,838 --> 01:23:51,740
Hey.

1067
01:23:53,009 --> 01:23:56,979
Listen, Preston's men
are coming up this way.

1068
01:23:57,013 --> 01:23:59,982
Deputy's got all the roads
blocked down below.

1069
01:24:00,016 --> 01:24:02,084
I know a trail
to get us outta here.

1070
01:24:02,118 --> 01:24:04,419
Old logging path,
take you out to the highway.

1071
01:24:21,503 --> 01:24:22,671
Hey, Kara.

1072
01:24:29,844 --> 01:24:30,845
Listen.

1073
01:24:33,149 --> 01:24:35,051
I shot-gunned PJ
in cold blood.

1074
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:38,620
Lots of witnesses.

1075
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:42,857
Neelyn finished him off,
but...

1076
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,861
cops are gonna be after me.

1077
01:24:50,967 --> 01:24:52,034
You ready to run with that?

1078
01:25:00,775 --> 01:25:01,776
You sure?

1079
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:55,530
Yeah, because I said...

1080
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,801
- Hey, get off that truck. Get down.
- Thank you very much.

1081
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:12,214
You guys
are lookin' good, right?

1082
01:26:12,248 --> 01:26:14,183
You. Follow me.

1083
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:45,814
How you doin', boys?

1084
01:27:36,932 --> 01:27:37,933
I'm sorry.

1085
01:27:50,346 --> 01:27:51,947
It ain't all one-way traffic.

1086
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:54,816
Fiona.

1087
01:27:54,849 --> 01:27:55,885
Yeah, I know.

1088
01:27:59,787 --> 01:28:01,023
But I needed more time.

1089
01:28:02,258 --> 01:28:03,359
Thought I made that clear.

1090
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:07,862
Some things a man's
gotta do for himself.

1091
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:12,101
If I had handled this,
it'd be over by now.

1092
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:15,204
I know.

1093
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:18,340
Retribution.

1094
01:28:22,444 --> 01:28:23,678
Retribution.

1095
01:28:41,263 --> 01:28:42,298
Let's drink.

1096
01:30:03,312 --> 01:30:05,014
- It's locked.
- Oh, shit.

1097
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:13,055
It's not locked.
Get in the car.

1098
01:30:13,088 --> 01:30:14,822
You hear that?

1099
01:30:14,856 --> 01:30:15,924
Oh, no.

1100
01:30:38,013 --> 01:30:39,048
Follow this.

1101
01:30:39,915 --> 01:30:40,949
Get outta here.

1102
01:30:42,251 --> 01:30:43,886
No.

1103
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:47,056
No, I'm not leaving you. No.

1104
01:30:49,158 --> 01:30:50,192
I need this.

1105
01:30:54,997 --> 01:30:56,065
I can't leave her here.

1106
01:31:00,269 --> 01:31:01,337
Follow it.

1107
01:31:02,571 --> 01:31:03,605
It's your way out.

1108
01:31:19,555 --> 01:31:21,223
We got him.

1109
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:23,158
They're on the move
by the exit road.

1110
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,294
He's my boy, Harris.

1111
01:31:26,995 --> 01:31:28,163
You'd have done
the same thing.

1112
01:31:30,332 --> 01:31:31,500
You would've wanted
the vengeance...

1113
01:31:33,102 --> 01:31:34,636
if only to protect your honor.

1114
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:40,576
Don't do it.

1115
01:31:43,579 --> 01:31:44,613
I have to.

1116
01:31:46,315 --> 01:31:47,549
You know I can't let you.

1117
01:31:49,151 --> 01:31:50,252
Well...

1118
01:31:52,054 --> 01:31:53,322
I guess we're at odds then.

1119
01:32:07,202 --> 01:32:09,104
You know you're no match
for me, brother.

1120
01:32:11,407 --> 01:32:14,076
Maybe, maybe not.

1121
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,317
Your call.

1122
01:32:36,165 --> 01:32:37,166
One more.

1123
01:33:07,162 --> 01:33:09,031
- Here's to...
- Friendship.

1124
01:33:12,301 --> 01:33:13,368
Friendship.

1125
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:18,407
One that lasted...

1126
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:21,577
a whole lot longer than most.

1127
01:34:29,879 --> 01:34:31,480
Come on!
Behind the truck.

1128
01:34:32,481 --> 01:34:34,416
Got him! We got him!

1129
01:34:37,553 --> 01:34:39,121
- Go around!
- Go around. Behind him!

1130
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:40,656
Get on the radio!
Get out of the way!

1131
01:34:41,423 --> 01:34:43,559
Move!

1132
01:34:45,594 --> 01:34:47,229
Shoot, shoot!
Don't let 'em get away!

1133
01:35:24,934 --> 01:35:26,201
<i>God.</i>

1134
01:35:28,236 --> 01:35:29,237
<i>Land.</i>

1135
01:35:30,706 --> 01:35:31,740
<i>Oil.</i>

1136
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:38,313
<i>It's often said war is waged

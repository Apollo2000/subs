00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,944
<i>Excuse me.</i>

3
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:17,812
- Sir?
- Hmm?

4
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:19,881
Sir?

5
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,649
Can I get you a snack?

6
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,051
Huh? Uh, what?

7
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,953
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

8
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:27,889
- I just wanted to see if you'd like a snack.
- Ah.

9
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,858
I'm just kidding.

10
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,159
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

11
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,961
- What's up?
- We have some fantastic caviar.

12
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:35,063
It's osetra, fresh from...

13
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:36,164
You ever had caviar?

14
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,832
No, sir.

15
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,801
It's delicious.
It is, yeah.

16
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:41,370
- But I had some last night.
- Mm.

17
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:43,104
You know what?
I'm actually in the mood

18
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:44,939
for something a little bit
more Mediterranean.

19
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:48,643
Do you have, like,
a grilled vegetable thing

20
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,211
with some figs
or even, like, um,

21
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,680
uh, like, any kind
of small fish?

22
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,215
I'm sorry, sir. We don't...

23
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,217
we don't have a kitchen,
full kitchen here.

24
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,153
Well, fuck.

25
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,822
How about a glass of champagne?

26
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:01,956
- Boom.
- Great.

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,160
Perfect.

28
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,932
- Hey, is that the Heidsieck?
- I'm sorry?

29
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:14,135
A German sub sank a ship
on the way to Tsar Nicholas II.

30
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,037
Couple years back,
they found the wreck

31
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,907
and a case of
the 1907 Heidsieck.

32
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,810
They sent a little robot
down there to bring it back up.

33
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,979
Athena bought three bottles
at 250K per.

34
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:28,183
And no one even knows
what the stuff tastes like.

35
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:30,118
It's just plain ol' champagne.

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,155
Hmm.

37
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,859
- You like working for Athena?
- Yes, she's...

38
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,227
sweet.

39
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,729
She's sweet? Don't let her
hear you say that.

40
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:44,032
Whoa, hey, Jesus!

41
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:46,101
- What are you doing?
- What is happening here?

42
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,005
- What the...
- Oh, fuck!

43
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,674
- Sh... Ah, shit.
- What's going on?

44
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:53,875
What is happening?

45
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,243
One of them's
fucking awake, man.

46
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:57,712
- Oh. Okay.
- Gross.

47
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:58,713
What... Ted!

48
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,249
- Okay, uh, calm down.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,017
Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

50
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,219
Hey, it's all right.

51
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,820
Uh, would you...

52
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:07,155
- get-get some towels?
- Yeah, get towels.

53
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:08,890
- Okay, uh, no, it's okay.
- Oh, Jesus.

54
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:10,892
It's all right.
No, no, no, it's all right.

55
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:12,093
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

56
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,995
- Ted, Ted, come on, man.
- Oh, great. Fantastic.

57
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,231
If you could just lay
those towels

58
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,166
- on the floor right there.
- Fuck.

59
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,302
Uh, now, what's his...
what's his... what's his name?

60
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:21,703
His na...
Uh, Squealer, I think? I...

61
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,271
Randy.

62
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,307
R-Randy?
Oh, that's great.

63
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,041
Now, I just need you...
We're just gonna...

64
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:28,776
We're just gonna
go down to the floor.

65
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,012
Just kneel down. There you go.
There. Good, good.

66
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:34,015
Now, I need you to lie
back down on those towels.

67
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:35,984
There you go. There you go.

68
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:38,287
Uh...
Oh, uh, may I use your pen?

69
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,255
- Pen. Yes.
- Thanks.

70
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,957
Okay, Randy.

71
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,926
I'm gonna put you
back to sleep now.

72
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,060
- What?
- Because you woke up

73
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,864
before you were supposed to.

74
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:52,800
- Whoa!
- Fuck!

75
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,073
Hey, you're bleeding.

76
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,175
Ted, what the fuck, man?

77
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,143
He woke up.
And we can't have you

78
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,845
talking about this,
now, can we, Randy?

79
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:06,247
It hasn't even
started yet, man.

80
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:07,882
- Oh, geez.
- What the fuck?

81
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:09,318
You guys just
gonna stand there?

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,352
- Oh!
- Oh!

83
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,155
Oh, my God.

84
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,790
- Uh, whoa.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

85
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,225
You need to
just-just take it easy.

86
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:19,227
- Oh, hey.
- All right, all right.

87
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,129
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
- Shit. Shit.

88
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,164
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, that's gross.

89
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,300
Grab him!

90
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:25,099
No! Stop!

91
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,067
All right, all right,
all right.

92
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,268
- Hold on, hold on. Hold on.
- Motherfucker.

93
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,538
- It's okay, now. All right, all right.
- Oh, no!

94
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,074
Hey.

95
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,078
- Put him in the back with the rest.
- This isn't right.

96
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,280
I mean, he doesn't even know.

97
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,847
I mean, it hasn't even
started yet.

98
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,017
God.

99
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,355
No sentimentality, comrade.

100
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,126
War is war.

101
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:57,966
Oh, uh, thanks.

102
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:00,201
Oh.

103
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,143
Would you... would you grab me

104
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,981
a little seltzer water
or something?

105
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,765
Fucking redneck.

106
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:36,139
H-Help.

107
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,167
Oh, God.

108
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:07,298
Hey. Hey.

109
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:16,070
Hello!

110
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,293
Hey.

111
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,367
What the hell is this?

112
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,118
What?

113
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,126
Oh, no! No, no, no.

114
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,395
Oh, no. It's a trap.

115
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:48,530
- Huh?
- Trap.

116
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:50,064
Trap.

117
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,103
Oh, my God!

118
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,302
Huh.

119
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,505
What the fuck?

120
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:04,068
What's that?

121
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,384
Hey!

122
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:26,690
Thank you.

123
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,330
Thank you.

124
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,965
Sh... Yeah, yeah, sorry.

125
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,235
All right.

126
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:42,804
This ought to help, huh?

127
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,406
Yeah.

128
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:45,707
All right, there you go.

129
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,409
All right, hey, guys,
I got keys.

130
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,544
I got keys. Here, here, here.

131
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,245
Here. Turn around.

132
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:52,681
Turn around.
Let me help get you unlocked.

133
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:54,816
What is happening?
Wh-Wh-What is all of this?

134
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,985
Yeah, fuck if I know. Here.

135
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:58,553
Oh, I can't use that.

136
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,389
Can you do this?

137
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:01,757
Yeah.

138
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,492
You can squeeze
a trigger, then.

139
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:04,793
Take it.

140
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,695
What is this?
What the fuck is this, man?

141
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:08,262
What do we need guns for?

142
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:09,398
We'll get out of here.

143
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,565
TEC-9, Lou.

144
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:14,270
Hey.

145
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,808
Hey. Let me show you.

146
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,776
Safety.

147
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:23,545
Give it a flick,
you're ready to party, okay?

148
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:25,013
Thanks.

149
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:26,314
You're welcome.

150
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,419
- What was that?
- I think that was a rifle.

151
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:33,388
Everybody get the fuck down!

152
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,656
- Move!
- Go! Go! Go!

153
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,293
That almost hit me.

154
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,833
F...

155
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,835
Oh, f...

156
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:49,807
Jesus Ch-Christ.

157
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,612
Over there.

158
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:07,289
What the fuck?

159
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,826
Come on, let's go.

160
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,362
Move!

161
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:23,538
Help!

162
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:31,379
Help!

163
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:33,484
Help!

164
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:40,388
- I fell.
- It's okay. It's okay.

165
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,557
I fell.

166
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,793
It's my birthday tomorrow.

167
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,928
- What?
- I'm gonna eat a whole pie.

168
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,530
Oh, God.

169
00:14:48,532 --> 00:14:49,865
Come on, reach for me.
Come on.

170
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,666
Come on. "Happy birthday"
on three, okay?

171
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,702
One, two, happy birthday!

172
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,375
Go. Here we go. Good job.

173
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:01,810
- Good job. Ready?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:04,346
All right, let's get the fuck
out of here. Come on.

175
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,862
Holy fuck.

176
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,536
Fucking Jesus Christ. Hey.

177
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:27,969
Shoot me.

178
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,504
No, no, no,
I'm not gonna shoot you.

179
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:30,906
No. No, wait. No, no, no!

180
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,841
Let go, you fucking snowflake!

181
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,813
Don't do it! Don't...

182
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,651
Jesus fucking Christ.

183
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:02,406
Okay.

184
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,609
Fuck.

185
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,885
Whoa, don't shoot, asshole.

186
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:18,488
I'm on your side.

187
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:23,625
They with us, too?

188
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,427
Yeah.

189
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:27,929
- Road means civilization.
- What?

190
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:29,431
Civilization's
our fucking friend.

191
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:30,632
Hey, folks.

192
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,000
What's the plan, khaki man?

193
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:34,636
- Trying to figure it out.
- Sorry.

194
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:35,971
Looks like we're gonna
have to climb this bitch.

195
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,573
You know what this is, right?

196
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,642
- Goddamn Manorgate.
- That shit's real?

197
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:42,644
Seems pretty fucking real
to me.

198
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:44,646
- Yeah, right, come on. Up, up, up.
- I'm going. - Fuck.

199
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,550
Yeah.

200
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,525
What?

201
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,895
- What the fuck was that?
- Hurry.

202
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,463
- Oh, shit, that's fucking arrows, dude.
- Fuck.

203
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,631
Hurry up.

204
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,032
I got you. I got you.

205
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,500
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- No, no, no, keep climbing.

206
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:06,635
I'm gonna help you. Come on.

207
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,036
No! Keep climbing.

208
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:09,471
Keep climbing.
Come on, no, no, no.

209
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:10,906
Up, up. Go up.

210
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:12,843
What is this <i>Avatar</i> shit?

211
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:14,943
We should go.

212
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:16,947
- Fuck it.
- Run!

213
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,279
Why isn't it working?

214
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,846
Wait. Did you pull the pin?

215
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:54,549
Ah, shit.

216
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,720
What was that?

217
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:00,755
That's another one of us
getting blown the fuck up.

218
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:02,090
- Fuck.
- We got to find shelter.

219
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:03,760
Come on!

220
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,613
There's about $200
in the cash register.

221
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:26,750
It's all yours.

222
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:29,987
Give me a hand here.
Come on.

223
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,322
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stop.

224
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:35,023
Where are we?

225
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,658
What?

226
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,792
Look, son,
we don't want no trouble.

227
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:40,028
- Just take the money.
- I don't want your damn money.

228
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,796
Where the fuck are we?

229
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:44,333
Well, Route 31,
right outside of Elaine.

230
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,900
Elaine, where?

231
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:47,168
Which state?

232
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,703
Arkansas.

233
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:50,638
What?

234
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,906
We're in Arkansas?

235
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:54,743
Wha... Man, Jesus.

236
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,613
Fucking Arkansas.

237
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:59,781
- You got a phone?
- Please.

238
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,583
We have children.
We have grandchildren.

239
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:03,018
Oh, you have grandchildren?
Can I see a picture of them?

240
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,853
I'm just kidding. I give a fuck.
Give me the phone.

241
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,589
Son, whatever's
going on here...

242
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,890
What's going on is
we're getting goddamn hunted.

243
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:11,360
But y'all have guns.

244
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:13,695
Yeah, to defend ourselves.

245
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:15,930
- Hello?
- 911. What's your emergency?

246
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's been a killing spree.

247
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,734
- You gotta come here right now.
- Can you repeat that, sir?

248
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,003
There's been a murder spree in
the woods, a fucking massacre.

249
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:23,972
It-it-it's Manorgate!

250
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,073
I'm sorry, sir.

251
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:26,174
I'm having trouble
understanding you.

252
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:27,742
Manorgate.

253
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,744
Just fucking google it!

254
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,079
I can't google it right now.

255
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:32,914
- Listen to me, okay?
- We can't do that.

256
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,982
We woke up with these gags
in our mouth,

257
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,817
and they had these...
these locks on 'em and...

258
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,819
Sir, I need the address
of your emergency.

259
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:40,155
Do you want my address
in Staten Island, New York,

260
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:42,123
where I went to a bar
after work

261
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,059
and I don't remember anything
because they drugged me,

262
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:45,627
they drugged all of us?

263
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:46,828
Where'd they get you from?

264
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,096
Wyoming.

265
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,898
Orlando.

266
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,966
Fuck.

267
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,802
All right, listen to me.

268
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:55,203
They grabbed us from all over,

269
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,105
and they brought us here
to kill us,

270
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:58,773
and they're still
trying to kill us.

271
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,141
And they're coming down
the fucking road,

272
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,976
and they're gonna be here
any fucking second.

273
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:03,978
Okay. What is your
current location, sir?

274
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,246
I-I am at a gas station!

275
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,882
Could you please just
trace the call?

276
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:10,685
Of course. That's a...
that's a great idea.

277
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,187
We'll trace you, sir.

278
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:13,755
Sit tight.

279
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:14,956
- Okay.
- Help's on the way.

280
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,224
Good.

281
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:21,832
Wh-What'd they say, dude?

282
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:23,965
They said they're coming.

283
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,135
Thank Christ.

284
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:28,770
- Hey, let me get one of them.
- Get your own.

285
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:29,938
Son, would you mind
putting your gun away?

286
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,773
You seem a little worked up,

287
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,175
and you don't want it
to go off by accident.

288
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:36,744
It's not gonna go off
on accident. I own seven guns.

289
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,113
- Why?
- What?

290
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,882
Wh-Wh-Why do you own
seven guns?

291
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,684
- "Stand your ground."
- Because it's my constitutional right

292
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:43,985
to protect myself
if I should ever

293
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:45,287
happen to be getting
fucking shot at,

294
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,921
which is exactly
what's happening right now.

295
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:48,089
Is that okay?

296
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:51,926
So, those people
that are shooting at you,

297
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:55,763
they're just exercising
the very same right?

298
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,466
What the fuck
are you talking about?

299
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:00,101
"Will there be sugar
after the Rebellion?"

300
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:01,970
Is she okay?

301
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,305
Oh, sure, she's fine.

302
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:04,841
How are you?

303
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,779
What the fuck?

304
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:13,315
- Hey, you okay?
- What's wrong?

305
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:14,983
Hey, get some water, dude!

306
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:16,050
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't... I don't...

307
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:17,118
What happened to her?

308
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,887
Oh, damn. No, no, no, no, no.

309
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:20,188
- Fuck.
- Come on. Sit up. Come on.

310
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,923
Hey, uh, get some water, dude.

311
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,325
I think she's dianetic.

312
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:24,893
Oh, sh... Oh, my God.

313
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:37,205
Don't make a mess.

314
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,940
What?

315
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,244
I'm not cleaning him up.

316
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:58,228
You're going to hell.

317
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:02,531
I don't believe in hell.

318
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,800
As you so eloquently posted,

319
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,236
I'm a "godless elite."

320
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,972
For the record, asshole,

321
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,910
climate change <i>is</i> real.

322
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:18,114
Hit the vent, honey.

323
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,261
I'll get a mop.

324
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:52,180
Sorry.

325
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:58,052
Oh, sorry again.

326
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:25,882
Oh.

327
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,319
What?

328
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:31,886
Nothing.

329
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,054
Oh, come on, honey.

330
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:34,323
Tell me, what's wrong?

331
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,858
He's wearing a wedding ring.

332
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,327
He's a monster.

333
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,928
Honey, he probably uses
the "N" word.

334
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,932
And not even in private.
He probably uses it on Twitter.

335
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:48,102
Those people suffered
400 years of bondage

336
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:50,339
at the hands of that
piece of shit's ancestors.

337
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,373
"Those people"?

338
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,910
Sorry. Black people.

339
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:56,878
African Americans.

340
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,280
- Honey, it's...
- Privilege, Julius.

341
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,948
It's perfectly fine
to call them "black" again.

342
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,652
According to who?

343
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:04,952
NPR.

344
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,425
Which consists
almost exclusively of...

345
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,160
White people.

346
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,296
We're the fucking worst.

347
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:16,197
- Hello? Come in.
- Oh.

348
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,399
We're coming.

349
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,167
You there?

350
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:20,502
Hey! We're here.

351
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:22,103
We got three of 'em.

352
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:25,940
Mollie, Moses and Mr. Whymper.

353
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,376
Yeah? Great.
Liberty got Boxer.

354
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,178
Stuck him full of arrows
and then blew him to pieces.

355
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,347
- It was brutal. Anyway...
- Oh.

356
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:32,481
Snowball's headed
toward you now.

357
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:34,683
She's maybe five minutes out.

358
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:37,085
You gonna be ready, or do you
need us to slow her down?

359
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:38,454
- We're good.
- No need.

360
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,188
- We're ready.
- Great.

361
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,291
She's unarmed,
so have some fun with it.

362
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:44,192
Roger that.

363
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,260
Over and out.

364
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:47,964
Honey, that's poison!

365
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,034
Y-You rigged the soda?

366
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:56,270
No. There are 43 grams of sugar
in that bottle.

367
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:58,407
Oh, good God, Miranda.
You really scared me.

368
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,345
I am not going to apologize
for caring.

369
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,446
Mm.

370
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:06,415
All right, then.

371
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,317
- Let's get some more.
- Okay.

372
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,951
The climate-change myth

373
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:11,420
suffered another blow
today with...

374
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:16,958
What's going on?

375
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,962
Okay, here she comes.

376
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:40,449
Hey there.

377
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,919
Help you?

378
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,430
Get a pack of lights, please.

379
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,331
Coming right up.

380
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,766
You want to fill 'er up?

381
00:25:57,768 --> 00:26:00,302
I don't have a car.

382
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:01,370
Oh.

383
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:03,271
Y-You walked over.

384
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,206
Oh. Sh...

385
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,510
Oh.

386
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:12,283
Everything okay?

387
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:17,453
- I lost my wallet.
- Oh.

388
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:21,088
It's for, um, emergencies.

389
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,224
You want some
matches with that?

390
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:24,426
Yeah.

391
00:26:24,428 --> 00:26:26,428
All sweaty.

392
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:30,097
What state is this?

393
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,535
Sorry?

394
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:35,036
You don't understand
the question?

395
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:37,104
Oh, no, I did. Just...

396
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:38,607
Most people know
where they are.

397
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:43,314
Well, I ain't most people.

398
00:26:47,818 --> 00:26:51,221
You're in the glorious state
of Arkansas.

399
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,229
Is there anything else that...

400
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,839
No! No, please, no!

401
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:13,207
Cigarettes in Arkansas
only cost six bucks.

402
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,209
You fucked up, bitch!

403
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:27,221
Hmm.

404
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:31,313
Hello?

405
00:29:31,315 --> 00:29:33,348
Julius? Miranda!

406
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,816
Are you there?

407
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:39,621
- Richard, are you on?
- Yeah, uh, uh, yes.

408
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,490
A-Affirmative, I'm here.

409
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:44,258
This is Liberty.
I can't find Orwell.

410
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,560
Which one's Orwell?

411
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:46,695
Orwell is the pig.

412
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:47,996
You named the fucking pig?

413
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,230
Richard, enough.

414
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:50,699
Did anyone see Snowball go in?

415
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:53,368
Uh, no,
we lost visual at the road.

416
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,269
Why don't you go take a look?

417
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,441
Go take a... Yes. 10-4.

418
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,626
I don't see anybody inside.

419
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:19,528
I-I guess I should...

420
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,030
I guess I should check around the back.

421
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:23,632
Shit, I-I lost the...

422
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:25,400
- What happened?
- I don't know.

423
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,602
I-I can't see anything.
The signal went out.

424
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,404
Turn your radio off.

425
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:31,339
What?

426
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:33,475
Turn your fucking
radio off now!

427
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:40,350
At least one of you is smart.

428
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,510
Don't fucking move!

429
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:10,812
You lower your gun.

430
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,380
I'm a friendly.

431
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:13,548
How do I know that?

432
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,251
Why don't you pull
that door handle?

433
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,589
Then you'll blow the fuck up,
and then you'll know.

434
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:22,593
Oh, shit.

435
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:33,902
Thanks.

436
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:35,804
You should not have shot
that drone.

437
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:37,806
But now they can't see us.

438
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,977
Don't need to.
You just told them we're here.

439
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:45,380
Huh. Where you going?

440
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:47,382
Saw some tracks earlier.

441
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:49,351
I'm gonna follow 'em.

442
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:50,754
Whose tracks?

443
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:54,391
Hey, whose tracks?

444
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,934
Why didn't they just kill you
when you came in?

445
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:07,469
Don't care.

446
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:10,405
You want to hear my theory?

447
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:11,773
Not really.

448
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:13,942
Did you read that article?

449
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:16,711
Every year,
these liberal elites...

450
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:20,448
you know, the globalist cucks
who run the deep state...

451
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,151
kidnap a bunch of
normal folks like us

452
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:25,520
and hunt us for fucking sport

453
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:28,790
in, like, this mansion
in Vermont or something.

454
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,859
I forwarded that to 50 friends.

455
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,761
It-It's not like I believed it.

456
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,396
You believe it?

457
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:35,897
That you have 50 friends?

458
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:37,868
No, the rest of it.

459
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,904
Mm...

460
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:44,741
This ain't Vermont.

461
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:46,875
Yeah.

462
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,879
Where you going now?

463
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:53,350
Oh. Um...

464
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm Gary.

465
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:00,755
Shut the fuck up, Gary.

466
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:02,624
Mm.

467
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,472
- How fast are you?
- What?

468
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:18,940
Train will be going slowest
at the curve.

469
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:20,542
We're not getting on
standing still.

470
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:22,777
Wait!

471
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:16,932
Thanks.

472
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,700
Welcome.

473
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:32,649
Who's there?

474
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:36,453
Come the fuck out,
or I'll shoot!

475
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:47,929
Oh, come on.

476
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:49,631
What?

477
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,599
They're not real.

478
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,034
Uh-uh.

479
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:55,937
You know what we have here?
Crisis actors.

480
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:57,906
What are the chances

481
00:34:57,908 --> 00:35:01,009
the one train car with the
open door is full of illegals?

482
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,877
I mean, I mean,
will you look at these fucks?

483
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:04,713
A little obvious,
don't you think?

484
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:09,617
Oh, are you fucks trying
to teach us a lesson?

485
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:10,819
Oh, no!

486
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,621
I feel so sorry for

487
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:14,856
immigrants and refugees.

488
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:18,960
I'm gonna have to rethink my
entire position on immigration.

489
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:20,762
No, Gary, they got a baby.

490
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:23,798
So? There are crisis babies.

491
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:29,571
Oh, you're good, Muhammad,

492
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:32,907
but if you don't cut
the bullshit in three seconds,

493
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:35,944
I am gonna blow
your fucking dick off.

494
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:37,112
One.

495
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:38,913
Two.

496
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:48,923
Shh.

497
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:51,159
Gary. Come here, you fuck...

498
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:08,009
Hey! Hey!

499
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:11,946
- Toss your gun.
- What?

500
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:13,615
Toss it, or we're fucking dead.

501
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:21,792
Hey! Hey!

502
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:44,979
Sir. Sir, excuse me.

503
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:48,417
I don't know exactly where
we are, but I'm an American.

504
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:49,984
American.

505
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,719
- American?
- Yeah. Yeah.

506
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:52,854
Her, too.

507
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,156
Look, let me explain
everything, sir,

508
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,892
'cause I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

509
00:36:57,894 --> 00:37:00,095
These are not real refugees.

510
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:03,064
- These are crisis actors.
- Whoa.

511
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,166
Look, I have a podcast.

512
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:07,869
I've been exposing
these people, okay?

513
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:11,239
They were placed on the train
as a part of Manorgate.

514
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:15,743
This has all been an elaborate
trap to try to ensnare us.

515
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,629
I don't think
they believe you, Gary.

516
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,196
Did you hear him?

517
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:36,764
Did you hear...
Did you hear him?

518
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:43,171
Bullshit.

519
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,740
This is...
That-that's bullshit.

520
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:46,875
You're all fake!

521
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:48,912
You're all fake!

522
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,716
Gary, you have just
got to chill, okay, buddy?

523
00:37:54,718 --> 00:37:57,319
Now, those other refugees,
they weren't part of this.

524
00:37:57,321 --> 00:38:00,054
They're real. I know. I have
been embedded with them, okay?

525
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,923
And those soldiers, well,
they're fucking real, too.

526
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:03,992
That train wasn't
supposed to be stopped.

527
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:06,895
So just calm the fuck down,

528
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:08,930
and we will get through this,
all right?

529
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:09,764
And you know what?

530
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,766
I'll even give you guys
a head start

531
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:13,201
before I come after you.
How's that sound?

532
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:15,069
You good?

533
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:16,804
Come on, buddy.

534
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,342
Gary, Gary, Gary, don't.

535
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:22,243
I am not your buddy!

536
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:33,221
Sayonara, sugar tits.

537
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:34,088
No, no, no, no, no, no.

538
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,859
Fuck. Shit, shit,

539
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:38,960
shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

540
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:40,962
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

541
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,369
Fuck. Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

542
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:48,705
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

543
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:56,037
I'm Dino, and this Bojan.

544
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,439
You have papers?

545
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:59,377
Where are we?

546
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:02,210
Where you think?

547
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:03,911
Well...

548
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:07,982
I was, uh, eating
in Mississippi

549
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:11,320
when I got knocked out

550
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:14,889
for what was at least 18 hours.

551
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:18,259
So, taking that
kind of into account,

552
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:23,465
along with your accent and
a license plate I fucking saw,

553
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,803
I'm guessing I'm probably in...

554
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:29,937
Bosnia.

555
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:32,173
Serbia?

556
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:34,108
Croatia?

557
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:38,112
I'm in Croa... Croatia, then.

558
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:40,014
- How you get here?
- Doesn't matter.

559
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:42,116
You need to call
the American embassy.

560
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:43,352
Show us paper.

561
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,154
I don't have papers.

562
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:48,056
C-Can you call the embassy?

563
00:40:48,058 --> 00:40:51,261
You are hunted?

564
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:55,029
Who said I was hunted?

565
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:58,232
Don. Hmm?

566
00:40:58,234 --> 00:41:00,234
You hunted like Don?

567
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:02,138
Who the fuck is Don?

568
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,409
Bring Don.

569
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,122
Can I have one of those?

570
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:22,393
No.

571
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:29,097
Don.

572
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,867
Howdy.

573
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:35,002
Yeah, hunted like Don.

574
00:41:35,004 --> 00:41:38,172
Yeah. I told you, assholes.

575
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:43,077
Yeah, I was heading north
when the dogs came after me.

576
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,947
Man, I thought
I was fucking dead.

577
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:49,183
You know, that it was
those Manorgate assholes.

578
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:51,185
Man, I was... I was relieved

579
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:54,021
when it was just the fucking
Russians, you know.

580
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:56,126
Uh, little more,
little more, pal.

581
00:41:58,061 --> 00:42:01,028
You know, a-and what was up
with that crate?

582
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,197
I mean, why-why did they
give us weapons

583
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,266
before they started
picking us off?

584
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:07,503
To make it more fair?

585
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,505
And what was up with that pig?

586
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:12,041
I thought they were all vegans.

587
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:18,146
Well, I cannot wait to...
to blow the lid off this shit.

588
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:20,482
'Cause we gonna be
on <i>Hannity</i> you and me,

589
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:24,154
just like them two Jew boys
that fucked Nixon up.

590
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:30,024
You want to share what
you're thinking, sweetie?

591
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:32,193
Hmm? Come on.

592
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:34,329
You don't care why
they're doing this to us?

593
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:35,397
Well, they're trying
to kill me.

594
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,465
I don't give a shit why.

595
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:02,125
Well, if it ain't
Uncle Sam's nephew.

596
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:07,796
We're rescued.

597
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:38,125
So you're telling me
that they built

598
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,528
an entire gas station out here

599
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,464
just to convince you this was
the middle of Arkansas?

600
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:44,533
What kind of sick individual
even comes up with that?

601
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,834
It's horrifying.

602
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:47,336
You fucking said it, junior.

603
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,136
Okay, we're gonna get back
to the embassy.

604
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:50,539
I'm gonna contact
the State Department.

605
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,274
We're gonna get
military support out here.

606
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,408
We're gonna find these animals.

607
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,443
Attaboy.

608
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:57,412
Why would they do
something like that?

609
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,348
Same reason elites
do anything...

610
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,483
'cause they think
they're better than us.

611
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:04,419
Yeah, but... but why you?

612
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,688
I mean, it seems
so personal, right?

613
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,323
What?

614
00:44:08,325 --> 00:44:10,359
No, no, I mean, I'm...
I-I'm just asking,

615
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,226
why pick you of all people?

616
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:15,162
You must have done something to
pop up on their radar somehow.

617
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:18,132
Otherwise, why target you
so specifically?

618
00:44:18,134 --> 00:44:21,102
- We didn't do shit.
- Okay.

619
00:44:21,104 --> 00:44:22,404
So, wh-what, you think this is

620
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:23,572
- our fucking fault?
- N-No.

621
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:25,139
No, no, that's not what I'm...

622
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:26,508
No, I would never
blame the victim.

623
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,676
Yeah.

624
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,647
There'd have to be a reason,
is all.

625
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:32,614
Can you think of anything...

626
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:34,316
anything at all,
no matter how minor...

627
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,452
that might make somebody want
to try something as...

628
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:39,421
Oh! Whoa!

629
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:42,457
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

630
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,458
Oh!

631
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,394
What? No.

632
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:47,196
No! Oh, my God!

633
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,899
Stop the car! Stop the car!

634
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,668
No! No!

635
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,469
Oh, my God!

636
00:44:54,471 --> 00:44:56,203
Oh!

637
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:59,274
Are you out of your mind,
woman?!

638
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:01,310
No, no, no.
Why did you do that?

639
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:03,177
Oh, no. Why did you do that?

640
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:05,280
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Is he dead?

641
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:07,282
You, what is wrong with you?

642
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:09,484
What is wrong with you?
You are not right.

643
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:12,321
Oh, my God.

644
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:14,155
What the...

645
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:16,223
Oh, fuck.

646
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:17,759
Why did you do that? Why...

647
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:20,696
He was trying to save us.
He was...

648
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:23,164
Oh.

649
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,367
Jesus.

650
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:27,769
Nope, that's Gary.

651
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:29,638
How'd you know he was lying?

652
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,276
Because everyone is lying.

653
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,677
Well, maybe...

654
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,447
maybe you should've waited
to kill him until...

655
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:40,949
till he told us
why they're doing this.

656
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:43,219
Pretty sure he wanted us
to tell him.

657
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:47,689
Right, there was 11 of us
when we first woke up.

658
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:49,791
There was four down
out of the gate.

659
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:52,226
A guy got grenaded.

660
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:55,664
Uh, you said there were three
at the gas station.

661
00:45:55,666 --> 00:46:00,502
And I assume this is the guy
you hopped a train with.

662
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:03,438
Mm-hmm.

663
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,541
That just leaves you and me.

664
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:08,144
Yeah.

665
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:11,680
Wh-Wh-What is that?

666
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:14,652
It's where Mr. Bullshit
was taking us.

667
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:20,455
This seems a little obvious,
like...

668
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:23,325
like maybe they wanted us
to find it.

669
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,694
Depends on whether they're
smart pretending to be idiots,

670
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:27,696
or idiots
pretending to be smart.

671
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:30,298
Well, I say
fuck those fuckers, okay?

672
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,634
We got us a car.
Let's just fucking go.

673
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:34,736
Okay? And I'm driving.
Give me the key.

674
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,674
No.

675
00:46:40,577 --> 00:46:42,279
"No"?

676
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:48,385
No.

677
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:55,724
My mama used to
tell me this story

678
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:59,728
about the jackrabbit
and the box turtle.

679
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,332
The jackrabbit is a real dick,

680
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:06,635
'cause he brags all the time.

681
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:10,539
Says nobody's faster than him.

682
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,342
And, well, it's true.

683
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:17,646
'Cause every time he races,
the jackrabbit always wins.

684
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:19,548
The whole fucking forest
has to put up

685
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,416
with his shit...
day in, day out.

686
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:23,752
Fucker always wants to race
just to rub it in some more.

687
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:27,355
So the box turtle figures,
"Why not?

688
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:29,357
I'll give it a try."

689
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,859
And the jackrabbit,
like, laughs.

690
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:32,360
Like, "Okay, this'll be fun.

691
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:34,429
So let-let's fucking go."
So bang!

692
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:35,497
Jackrabbit leaves

693
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:36,832
the box turtle
in his fucking dust.

694
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:39,534
I mean, he is way out in front.

695
00:47:39,536 --> 00:47:41,636
Of course he is,
'cause jackrabbit always wins.

696
00:47:41,638 --> 00:47:45,440
But he wants to put on a show
and he'll make it seem close.

697
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,378
So he stops,
and he takes a nap.

698
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:57,788
He sleeps longer
than he wanted to.

699
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,658
By the time he wakes up, the...

700
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,594
I mean, he knows he's fucked.

701
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:06,795
Jackrabbit...

702
00:48:06,797 --> 00:48:08,563
goes full tilt,
but it's too late.

703
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:11,633
The box turtle crosses
the finish line first,

704
00:48:11,635 --> 00:48:13,635
and the crowd's like...

705
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:16,540
Goes fucking wild.

706
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:22,811
Later that night, box turtle's
having dinner with his family.

707
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:26,515
He's telling his little
box turtles how he did it.

708
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,817
"I mean, never give up. I...

709
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:32,521
"Just keep crawling forwards,
and...

710
00:48:32,523 --> 00:48:35,459
you can overcome
just about anything."

711
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:39,863
Door smashes in.

712
00:48:41,732 --> 00:48:43,500
It's the jackrabbit.

713
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:47,871
And he has a hammer.

714
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:51,673
Smashes up the wife
and kids first

715
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:54,845
so the box turtle
has to watch 'em die.

716
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:57,979
And then it's his turn.

717
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,749
Once the whole family's broken
into little pieces...

718
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:04,688
...he sits down
and eats their dinner.

719
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:08,792
Every last bite.

720
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:20,470
'Cause the jackrabbit
always wins.

721
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,809
Your mama told you that story?

722
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,944
Uh, so... so wait.

723
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:30,946
So, who's the rabbit?

724
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,517
I mean, i-is it us or them?

725
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:42,960
You see a pig
with a shirt on, right?

726
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:46,895
Yep.

727
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:49,664
A little pig.

728
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:02,911
Where the hell is Oliver?

729
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:04,813
He left to get them hours ago.

730
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:06,815
I'm sure he's fine, Ted.

731
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:09,718
Oh, wow. Ava DuVernay
just liked one of my posts.

732
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,220
You're friends with Ava, too?

733
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:13,889
No. Uh, maybe.

734
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:15,657
We met at a Time 100 dinner.

735
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:16,992
Th-This is the photo
that she liked.

736
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,693
It's from when I was in Haiti.

737
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:20,795
Wait a second.
Wait. You were in Haiti?

738
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:22,731
Remind us, what were you
doing there again?

739
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:23,899
You were curing AIDS
in a favela.

740
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,233
- AIDS.
- Isn't that...

741
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:26,635
- Don't joke about AIDS.
- No, no, no.

742
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:27,669
I'm not joking.

743
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:30,538
AIDS is very, very serious,

744
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,942
and thank God Martin is
single-handedly taking it on.

745
00:50:33,944 --> 00:50:38,079
Okay. First of all,
there are no favelas in Haiti.

746
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:39,814
- That's Brazil.
- Well, I just...

747
00:50:39,816 --> 00:50:42,550
I-I heard that you got a girl
pregnant down there.

748
00:50:42,552 --> 00:50:43,985
Oh.

749
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:45,587
I fell in love.

750
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:46,855
Hope she was pro-choice.

751
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:47,789
Don't joke about choice,
man, please.

752
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:49,958
What matters is that Haiti
is in the midst

753
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,559
of a decades-long
humanitarian crisis,

754
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:53,561
and it needs all the help
it can get.

755
00:50:53,563 --> 00:50:54,996
Thank you.

756
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:57,098
- Does it need Martin's semen?
- Okay.

757
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,166
Enough, Richard.

758
00:50:58,168 --> 00:51:00,936
Guys, uh...
we're all on the same team.

759
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:02,037
Did you say "guys"?

760
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,738
I'm sorry. I gendered it.

761
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,040
Where are they?

762
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,708
Just call Oliver on the radio.

763
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,576
I mean, they think he's part
of the embassy, so he's...

764
00:51:08,578 --> 00:51:09,945
Oh, shit.

765
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:14,582
Uh, Sergeant Dale, little help?

766
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:15,951
Please, let's keep
the voices down.

767
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:17,986
- Why? They're in a car.
- You hired me to consult you.

768
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:19,888
I'm consulting you.

769
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,757
What was the name
of that movie you did again?

770
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:24,526
<i>Tears of the Sun.</i>

771
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:26,027
That's... I mean, that's
actually what they called it?

772
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:27,862
<i>Tears of the Sun?</i>

773
00:51:27,864 --> 00:51:29,064
Why is the sun crying?

774
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:31,967
It-it came out?

775
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,101
I mean, like,
in theaters and stuff?

776
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:35,003
- Bruce Willis was in it.
- What?

777
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:36,104
I love Bruce.

778
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:38,573
- He's cool.
- Stop fucking talking.

779
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,075
- Sorry, Athena.
- Well, I'm gonna

780
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:41,743
go take a piss.

781
00:51:41,745 --> 00:51:43,611
Who has the hand sanitizer?

782
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:45,547
Oh, Christ,
Richard, just rough it.

783
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:46,848
Go fuck yourself, Liberty.

784
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,950
Hey, watch out
for the trip wires.

785
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:50,754
I know.

786
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:05,633
Fucking "rough it."

787
00:52:05,635 --> 00:52:08,538
As if you ever roughed a thing
in your fucking life.

788
00:52:16,813 --> 00:52:17,979
Hey.

789
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,948
Is this your pig?

790
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:45,640
Everybody up.

791
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:46,841
- Like we practiced.
- Ow!

792
00:52:46,843 --> 00:52:47,942
- Motherfucker!
- Leave the rifles.

793
00:52:47,944 --> 00:52:50,612
Sidearms now. Come on, come on.

794
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:52,549
Shit.

795
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:05,994
Richard?

796
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:07,195
Shh!

797
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:08,965
Don't shush me.

798
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:13,935
Richard?

799
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:16,104
Easy.

800
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:17,772
They'll hit the trips.

801
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,645
Shit.

802
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:39,763
Oh, fuck!

803
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:44,601
Stop! Stop!

804
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:48,736
Orwell!

805
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:50,105
What the fuck?!

806
00:53:50,107 --> 00:53:51,806
He was an innocent.

807
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:53,675
How the hell did that
get in here?

808
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:55,009
You almost fucking shot me.

809
00:53:55,011 --> 00:53:56,746
Well, I didn't, did I?
Because you're not...

810
00:53:58,048 --> 00:53:59,683
Hey, bitch.

811
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,213
No, Snowball.
No, no, no, no.

812
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:33,214
I-I didn't...

813
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,005
No, no, no, no.

814
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,953
You hick.

815
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:46,056
Goddamn.

816
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:58,367
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, it's me.

817
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:00,336
Thank you for all the help.

818
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:03,238
Fuck you. I dropped the pig.

819
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,941
Come on, give me a gun.

820
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:09,145
Do you think
you could find one?

821
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:18,019
Don, is there anything
you would like to ask her?

822
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:19,087
What?

823
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:22,957
You got mad that I killed
the fucker in the car

824
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:25,026
before you could
ask him anything,

825
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:28,798
and I thought, you know,
now's your chance.

826
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:36,104
Why are you doing this to us?

827
00:56:36,106 --> 00:56:38,875
Because Jesus told me to.

828
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:41,175
Well, there's your answer.

829
00:56:41,177 --> 00:56:42,110
Whoa! Hey, hey.

830
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:44,979
Come on, you can't just...
She's a woman.

831
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:48,317
Hey, miss...

832
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,852
do you think
you should be afforded mercy

833
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:52,155
just 'cause you're a girl?

834
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:55,923
No.

835
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:59,195
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

836
00:57:00,997 --> 00:57:03,131
Don?

837
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:04,400
Don.

838
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:06,169
Did you get her?

839
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:09,340
Don!

840
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,309
Don.

841
00:57:13,311 --> 00:57:15,076
Whoa, whoa.

842
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:16,412
Whoa, hey.

843
00:57:16,414 --> 00:57:18,012
Hey.

844
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:19,249
What's going on?

845
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:21,949
You one of them?

846
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:24,087
What? No.

847
00:57:25,955 --> 00:57:28,024
You drop the gun
and answer her.

848
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:32,260
I'm not dropping my gun.

849
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:35,096
Don, what's going on?

850
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:36,130
Answer her.

851
00:57:36,132 --> 00:57:38,132
Who is this?

852
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:39,967
You don't have to
pretend anymore.

853
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:41,938
She's figured it out.

854
00:57:43,973 --> 00:57:46,074
I don't know who the fuck
that is.

855
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,042
- Shoot her.
- Drop the gun.

856
00:57:48,044 --> 00:57:49,378
Fucking shoot her, Don!

857
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,145
They're playing you.
They're fucking with you.

858
00:57:51,147 --> 00:57:52,348
I'm on your side here.

859
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,250
Just drop the gun.

860
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,690
Don?

861
00:58:01,692 --> 00:58:03,492
Is she hurt?

862
00:58:03,494 --> 00:58:05,363
Don's dead.

863
00:58:07,498 --> 00:58:09,698
'Cause of me.

864
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,267
Then I guess you'd
better come and get me.

865
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:33,121
I heard them call you
a consultant.

866
00:58:33,123 --> 00:58:36,090
You trained these fuckers?

867
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:38,159
Yeah.

868
00:58:38,161 --> 00:58:41,363
How much did they pay you?

869
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:43,199
Nothing.

870
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:47,003
I owed her a favor.

871
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,340
And where is she?

872
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:53,107
Why?

873
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,378
You won.

874
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:57,448
Just go home.

875
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:05,155
Because I am, like...

876
00:59:11,362 --> 00:59:14,262
And, uh...

877
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,467
I work at a car rental company.

878
00:59:18,134 --> 00:59:20,469
And there is nowhere
to put that.

879
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:24,172
So maybe today...

880
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,343
I can, like...

881
00:59:38,556 --> 00:59:40,558
So, where the fuck is she?

882
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,330
Okay, okay.

883
00:59:48,332 --> 00:59:50,365
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Okay, okay.

884
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:52,334
- Sorry.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

885
00:59:52,336 --> 00:59:54,202
Okay.

886
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:56,805
- Three klicks northwest.
- "Three klicks northwest."

887
00:59:56,807 --> 00:59:58,474
There's a gravel road
to the manor.

888
00:59:58,476 --> 01:00:00,107
"Road to the manor."

889
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:02,511
You have no idea
what you're up against.

890
01:00:02,513 --> 01:00:04,546
She's...

891
01:00:04,548 --> 01:00:07,349
She's been training
for eight months.

892
01:00:07,351 --> 01:00:09,451
She's gonna rip you
into pieces.

893
01:00:09,453 --> 01:00:11,152
We'll see.

894
01:00:11,154 --> 01:00:13,589
You... you were in the service?

895
01:00:13,591 --> 01:00:16,125
Uh, yes.

896
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,628
Afghanistan.

897
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,162
Were you?

898
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:22,263
National Guard.

899
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:24,131
Mm-mm.

900
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:27,103
So you were never in the shit.

901
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,138
I'm-I'm in it now.

902
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,544
That's a nice way
of looking at it.

903
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:37,245
Hey.

904
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,283
Thank you for your service.

905
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:54,563
Hello, Paul.

906
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:56,365
Hey. Athena, hi.

907
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:59,233
What are you doing
in my office?

908
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:01,237
Take a seat.

909
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:06,107
Hello, Nicole.

910
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:07,609
Athena.

911
01:01:09,212 --> 01:01:11,313
Have a seat.

912
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:14,181
Hmm. Hmm.

913
01:01:14,183 --> 01:01:16,183
- Hi.
- Hi.

914
01:01:16,185 --> 01:01:17,586
So, you're aware
Martin's account

915
01:01:17,588 --> 01:01:19,388
got hacked last week, right?

916
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,324
I'm the CEO, Paul.
I hear everything.

917
01:01:22,326 --> 01:01:25,394
And Martin's one of
my closest friends.

918
01:01:25,396 --> 01:01:28,463
So you know how embarrassing
it was for him.

919
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:32,199
All the, uh,
extramarital communiqués.

920
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:34,636
I call it sending
his wife's oncologist

921
01:01:34,638 --> 01:01:36,371
pictures of his cock.

922
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:38,407
I mean, there are more than
just the cock pics.

923
01:01:38,409 --> 01:01:40,375
There were texts and e-mails,

924
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:42,477
and he said some
extraordinarily critical things

925
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:43,612
about the president.

926
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,246
Oh, well,

927
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:46,748
last I heard,
free speech still exists.

928
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,685
Don't do that. Don't-don't
First Amendment me, please.

929
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:52,654
It's not a country.
It's a business.

930
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:55,324
A business,
and there are optics.

931
01:01:55,326 --> 01:01:56,692
You fired Martin?

932
01:01:56,694 --> 01:01:59,160
No, he realized he had to
take one for the team.

933
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:01,162
- The team?
- Yeah, the team.

934
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:02,497
We have a team, our team.

935
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,198
What's in the file, Nicole?

936
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,435
Just a sec. Um...

937
01:02:06,437 --> 01:02:08,637
Do you recall
a text thread you had

938
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,205
with Martin, Peter, Richard
and Liberty, amongst others,

939
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:13,275
December 17 at 10:00
in the morning?

940
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:16,647
I don't recall a text thread I
had last fucking Tuesday, Paul.

941
01:02:18,749 --> 01:02:21,117
Go... go ahead, Nicole.

942
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:26,321
Martin: "Did anyone see

943
01:02:26,323 --> 01:02:28,423
what our ratfucker-in-chief
just did?"

944
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:31,693
Liberty:
"Yes. Day equals ruined."

945
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:33,629
Peter: "Infuriating."

946
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:36,263
Athena:
"At least the hunt's coming up.

947
01:02:36,265 --> 01:02:38,333
"Nothing better than
going out to The Manor

948
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,702
and slaughtering
a dozen deplorables."

949
01:02:40,704 --> 01:02:44,473
Miranda: "We promised not to
talk about The Manor on text."

950
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:46,575
Ted:
"Viva El Manor."

951
01:02:46,577 --> 01:02:49,446
Liberty:
"Deleting this thread."

952
01:02:51,582 --> 01:02:54,449
Oh, I get it.

953
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:56,551
Are you aware
there's an active group

954
01:02:56,553 --> 01:02:59,287
of people out there who believe
this is a real thing?

955
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:01,690
Believe wh-what's a real thing?

956
01:03:01,692 --> 01:03:04,695
That you're hunting
human beings for sport.

957
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:12,436
Yeah, not funny.

958
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:16,237
Yeah?

959
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,640
Wh-Wh-Wh...

960
01:03:18,642 --> 01:03:20,241
What?

961
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:22,377
Yeah, conspiracy websites
are all over it.

962
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:23,845
They're going bananas.
They're going berserk.

963
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:26,748
Reddit. I mean, I don't know
the names of them all.

964
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,351
But, anyway, somebody pulled
a property-tax record

965
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:31,720
for the manor that you bought
in Vermont.

966
01:03:31,722 --> 01:03:36,291
"Manor"? No, I don't own
a fucking manor in Vermont.

967
01:03:36,293 --> 01:03:38,293
It's a three-bedroom house.

968
01:03:38,295 --> 01:03:40,595
Jesus, I can't believe
you used that word.

969
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:41,763
"Manor"?

970
01:03:41,765 --> 01:03:42,798
No.

971
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,332
"Deplorables."

972
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:46,601
It's... charged.

973
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:48,637
Oh, well, I initially typed
"fucking rednecks,"

974
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:50,639
but then I decided
that wasn't specific...

975
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:52,441
- Hey, come on.
- What?

976
01:03:52,443 --> 01:03:54,576
What would you prefer
I call them, Paul?

977
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:57,579
- "Gun-clutching homophobes"?
- Hey, hey, stop, please.

978
01:03:57,581 --> 01:04:00,048
- "Academically challenged racists"?
- Hey, hey.

979
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,550
What about
"tooth-deprived bigots"?

980
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:03,518
We have our best team
at reputation management

981
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,854
flooding...
flooding the search engines

982
01:04:05,856 --> 01:04:08,056
in the hopes this thing
doesn't go mainstream.

983
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:09,891
But even if by some miracle
it doesn't...

984
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:11,760
and I really don't
see that happening...

985
01:04:11,762 --> 01:04:13,628
Martin did what he had to.

986
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,897
Richard did what he had to.
He's out at BlueWest.

987
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:19,434
Julius and Miranda had to step
down from their foundation.

988
01:04:19,436 --> 01:04:21,336
Liberty exited her fund.

989
01:04:21,338 --> 01:04:22,904
I'm sorry.

990
01:04:22,906 --> 01:04:25,375
You got to go.

991
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,377
Paul...

992
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:31,913
it was just a joke.

993
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:34,382
One joke.

994
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:36,418
- Wasn't funny.
- It wasn't real.

995
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,555
I mean, I wish
this didn't happen.

996
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:43,293
I really do, but this...

997
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:48,330
...idea is out there,
and these people believe it,

998
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:50,300
and they're not going away.

999
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,706
What people?

1000
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,608
Sorry?

1001
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:06,548
What people believe I'm hunting
human beings at my manor?

1002
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,720
What fucking people?!

1003
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:13,388
Okay, this is gary4USA.

1004
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,723
He's got a podcast

1005
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:16,124
called <i>The Confederate Files.</i>

1006
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:18,493
He's a P score 8.5.

1007
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:20,695
What-what does that "P"
stand for again?

1008
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:22,430
"Piece of shit."
I vote in.

1009
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:23,598
- In.
- Yeah, in.

1010
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,433
In? Another in. Okay.

1011
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:26,401
- Oh.
- Oh, gross.

1012
01:05:26,403 --> 01:05:27,469
BigGameShane.
Trigger warning. I'm sorry.

1013
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:29,704
- Whoa, whoa.
- I think the pic speaks for itself.

1014
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:30,906
- In.
- He's an 8.8.

1015
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:31,940
In.

1016
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:33,842
Guys, we can't
include everybody, okay?

1017
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:36,444
Thousands of people posted
about Manorgate, so...

1018
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:38,446
Oh, Christ. It's a "gate" now?

1019
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:40,582
Well, they ruined water
and pizza. Why not manors?

1020
01:05:40,584 --> 01:05:41,850
Listen, I want to slaughter
all of them

1021
01:05:41,852 --> 01:05:42,918
just like
everybody else here, okay,

1022
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,985
but our
military consultant says

1023
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:45,720
we got to cap it out at 12.

1024
01:05:45,722 --> 01:05:47,889
- Why?
- It's our first time.

1025
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:49,858
- Safety reasons, okay?
- Heavens.

1026
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,593
God forbid somebody gets hurt.

1027
01:05:51,595 --> 01:05:53,662
Is that a kimono?
That's appropriation, Richard.

1028
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:54,996
Hey, where are Liberty and Ted?

1029
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:56,731
- In therapy.
- Jesus. Again?

1030
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:57,799
They lost everything, Richard.

1031
01:05:57,801 --> 01:05:59,868
They-they lost their jobs
and their reputations.

1032
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,736
Yeah, so did I, Miranda.

1033
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,538
But I'm dealing with it
with, you know,

1034
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,473
drugs and alcohol,
like a normal person.

1035
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,609
Excuse me, did anyone else here
get reassigned to Croatia?

1036
01:06:07,611 --> 01:06:09,010
No? No? Because I did.

1037
01:06:09,012 --> 01:06:10,078
That was a blessing
in disguise.

1038
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,913
We're gonna build
that gas station for pennies.

1039
01:06:11,915 --> 01:06:12,914
There's no extradition...

1040
01:06:12,916 --> 01:06:14,551
Next slide.

1041
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:17,919
- Oh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1042
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,888
- No, no.
- Jesus, Oliver, I don't think...

1043
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,623
Listen. Listen, listen,
listen, listen, if we don't

1044
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:22,991
have at least one
person of color in this,

1045
01:06:22,993 --> 01:06:24,759
- it is going to be problematic.
- Um...

1046
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:26,628
I'm playing an Arab refugee.
I'm from Connecticut.

1047
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,762
Isn't that
a little problematic?

1048
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:29,898
- That was your idea.
- It was your idea.

1049
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,633
It was weird when you said it.

1050
01:06:31,635 --> 01:06:34,936
Because we need to lean in
to the stereotype...

1051
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:37,038
- Correct.
- ...to let them just expose their biases.

1052
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,206
Yeah, or we can just shoot 'em
as soon as

1053
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,841
- they grab their guns.
- Then they're not gonna

1054
01:06:39,843 --> 01:06:40,809
know why we're
killing them, okay?

1055
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:42,711
- Next slide.
- We have the opportunity to...

1056
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:46,681
Okay. Justice4Yall.

1057
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:47,916
She's a 6.5.

1058
01:06:47,918 --> 01:06:49,851
This is what she says.

1059
01:06:49,853 --> 01:06:51,786
"Fuck this bitch.

1060
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:54,956
Athena Stone murders
innocent men and..."

1061
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,960
I don't need to hear more.

1062
01:07:02,866 --> 01:07:04,801
That's our Snowball.

1063
01:07:15,779 --> 01:07:18,749
Put your gun in the mailbox.

1064
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:22,951
Why the fuck would I do that?

1065
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:25,522
There's a shaped
C-4 charge underneath the gate.

1066
01:07:27,591 --> 01:07:29,991
I could blow you up right now.

1067
01:07:29,993 --> 01:07:32,429
But where's the fun in that?

1068
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:34,696
No guns.

1069
01:07:34,698 --> 01:07:37,567
Put it in the mailbox. Now.

1070
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:25,974
It's amazing to me.

1071
01:09:25,976 --> 01:09:28,377
People go their entire lives
without realizing

1072
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:30,814
the most simple, obvious truth.

1073
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:36,117
The only way to properly
slice tomatoes

1074
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:38,688
is with a bread knife.

1075
01:09:41,825 --> 01:09:44,125
Did you kill Don?

1076
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:45,760
Uh-huh.

1077
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:48,696
Because I convinced you
he was one of us.

1078
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:50,165
Was he?

1079
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:52,401
Maybe.

1080
01:09:52,403 --> 01:09:54,671
Maybe not.

1081
01:09:56,907 --> 01:09:58,809
Who am I?

1082
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,709
Huh?

1083
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,779
Who am I?

1084
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:08,083
Lady, I don't know who you are.

1085
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:09,951
I just know that you're crazy.

1086
01:10:09,953 --> 01:10:11,653
I am crazy.

1087
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,154
But I know I'm crazy.

1088
01:10:13,156 --> 01:10:16,791
And if you know you're crazy,
then you're not crazy.

1089
01:10:16,793 --> 01:10:20,128
So that just makes me
really, really mad.

1090
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,830
Okay.

1091
01:10:21,832 --> 01:10:24,666
So, who am I?

1092
01:10:24,668 --> 01:10:28,169
Crystal May Creasey.

1093
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:31,873
Born in Mississippi,
Whites Crossing.

1094
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:32,974
Fitting.

1095
01:10:32,976 --> 01:10:34,809
Dropped out of school at 12,

1096
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:37,145
right around the time your
daddy was killed by the police

1097
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:39,047
when they raided
the methamphetamine lab.

1098
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:41,749
Your mother joined him
soon after that... overdose.

1099
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:46,087
Probably the last batch
of Daddy's stuff.

1100
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:48,158
Romantic.

1101
01:10:51,027 --> 01:10:56,097
You know, most people think
that you should use cheddar

1102
01:10:56,099 --> 01:11:00,203
in a grilled cheese,
but I use Gruyère.

1103
01:11:01,938 --> 01:11:05,274
Nothing else has
that kind of melt.

1104
01:11:05,276 --> 01:11:07,742
After your mom died,
you bounced

1105
01:11:07,744 --> 01:11:09,077
from part-time job
to part-time job,

1106
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:10,879
to welfare and back.

1107
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:13,315
More times than I could count,
honestly.

1108
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:17,785
The only consistency was your
inability to stay employed.

1109
01:11:17,787 --> 01:11:19,288
Which is fine.

1110
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,824
I mean, this country belongs
to the uneducated and ignorant

1111
01:11:22,826 --> 01:11:24,926
as much as it belongs to me.

1112
01:11:24,928 --> 01:11:27,929
You fail, we pay.

1113
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:30,798
Eventually,
a cow falls on your head

1114
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,067
or you blow your brains out
in a parking lot

1115
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:35,069
because you finally realize

1116
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:38,206
what a waste
your life truly was.

1117
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:40,241
But not you, Crystal.

1118
01:11:40,243 --> 01:11:42,344
You decided to go
on the Internet

1119
01:11:42,346 --> 01:11:44,681
and run your stupid mouth.

1120
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:49,184
13 months ago, you posted this
on a message board

1121
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:52,321
under the screen name
Justice4Yall.

1122
01:11:52,323 --> 01:11:55,091
I want to make sure I...
I get it exactly right.

1123
01:11:58,094 --> 01:12:00,929
"Fuck this bitch.

1124
01:12:00,931 --> 01:12:04,999
"Athena Stone murders innocent
men and women for sport.

1125
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:08,337
The evidence is all there."

1126
01:12:08,339 --> 01:12:12,840
T-H-E-I-R.

1127
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:15,076
"Her manor, her travel records.

1128
01:12:15,078 --> 01:12:17,979
"Oh, and in case
you were still on the fence,

1129
01:12:17,981 --> 01:12:22,384
she fucking admitted to it
in a text message."

1130
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:26,156
"Admitted" was all caps.

1131
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:28,223
Huh.

1132
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:30,925
"Huh"? That's all you have
to say for yourself?

1133
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:36,030
Everybody you kidnapped
and killed,

1134
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:38,300
that's 'cause they busted you
and your friends

1135
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:40,134
and put it on the Internet?

1136
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:41,570
No one busted us.

1137
01:12:41,572 --> 01:12:43,037
We were joking.

1138
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,006
But you ignorami
took it literally.

1139
01:12:45,008 --> 01:12:49,278
You actually believed we were
hunting human beings for sport.

1140
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,913
- But you are.
- What?

1141
01:12:51,915 --> 01:12:53,315
Hunting human beings for sport.

1142
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:55,016
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

1143
01:12:55,018 --> 01:12:57,118
It wasn't true.

1144
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:01,189
This is your manor, isn't it?

1145
01:13:01,191 --> 01:13:04,025
It's not a fucking manor.

1146
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:06,295
It's a house I rented
in Croatia and had decorated.

1147
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:07,895
Okay, right, but it's yours,

1148
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:10,432
and you're hunting people,
so it's...

1149
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:12,200
I mean, it's true.

1150
01:13:12,202 --> 01:13:13,402
Now.

1151
01:13:13,404 --> 01:13:17,972
Now it's true
because you made it true.

1152
01:13:17,974 --> 01:13:19,941
You people,
you take anything you want,

1153
01:13:19,943 --> 01:13:22,043
and you twist it around
until it fits

1154
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:25,281
into your backwards
fucking worldview.

1155
01:13:25,283 --> 01:13:29,387
You wanted it to be true,
so you decided it was.

1156
01:13:31,389 --> 01:13:34,057
This was your idea.

1157
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:38,394
Well...

1158
01:13:38,396 --> 01:13:40,396
not my idea.

1159
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:42,398
Ooh, I did not want to mess up

1160
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,635
your big grilled-cheese speech,
but...

1161
01:13:46,637 --> 01:13:49,340
oh, you done fucked up, lady.

1162
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:55,143
See, you got the wrong Crystal.

1163
01:13:55,145 --> 01:13:58,349
There's another
Crystal May Creasey back home.

1164
01:13:59,983 --> 01:14:02,252
But she spells "May"
with an "E."

1165
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,088
Hey, I get her mail sometimes.

1166
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,391
And my dad's an asshole,

1167
01:14:09,393 --> 01:14:13,227
but I don't think
he ever did drugs.

1168
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,231
And my mom...

1169
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:21,037
...she's alive, too.

1170
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,407
Can we call her?

1171
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:27,108
- Let's call her right now.
- No.

1172
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:28,109
- Give me the phone.
- No way.

1173
01:14:28,111 --> 01:14:29,177
- I'll call her up.
- Do I look fucking stupid?

1174
01:14:29,179 --> 01:14:31,513
Fine. I'll give you her number,
and you can call.

1175
01:14:31,515 --> 01:14:34,248
- That's not gonna happen.
- Yeah.

1176
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,118
Hoo, you don't really care
about the truth, do you?

1177
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,454
Of course I do.

1178
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:42,125
The only difference
is I'm right.

1179
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:46,062
Hey, maybe.

1180
01:14:47,398 --> 01:14:48,998
Maybe not.

1181
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:53,201
Now, do I have to keep
listening to Beethoven,

1182
01:14:53,203 --> 01:14:55,203
or can we fucking
get on with it?

1183
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:27,371
That was good.

1184
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,065
Hmm.

1185
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:06,109
No!

1186
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,023
Hey, Crystal.

1187
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:26,996
Fuck!

1188
01:16:29,032 --> 01:16:30,632
You need a gun now, bitch?!

1189
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:32,534
That's fucking cheating!

1190
01:17:01,465 --> 01:17:03,233
Fuck you!

1191
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:05,329
- One second.
- Yeah.

1192
01:18:29,152 --> 01:18:30,654
No more glass!

1193
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,409
I got you.

1194
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:30,414
Hmm.

1195
01:19:31,815 --> 01:19:33,550
Hmm.

1196
01:19:56,306 --> 01:19:57,706
Okay.

1197
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:12,487
Hey.

1198
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:14,625
I got you, too.

1199
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:19,596
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1200
01:20:25,636 --> 01:20:27,869
Why did you call me Snowball?

1201
01:20:29,406 --> 01:20:31,473
It's a reference.

1202
01:20:31,475 --> 01:20:34,478
To George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm.</i>

1203
01:20:35,846 --> 01:20:37,846
He's a pig.

1204
01:20:37,848 --> 01:20:42,218
Yeah, but why am I Snowball?

1205
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:46,822
Snowball is an idealist.

1206
01:20:46,824 --> 01:20:50,659
He... he wants to make
the world a better place.

1207
01:20:50,661 --> 01:20:54,830
That's why the other pigs
make up lies about him,

1208
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:56,834
turn him into the enemy.

1209
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:02,506
I think you should be Snowball.

1210
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,376
You read <i>Animal Farm?</i>

1211
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:09,513
Yes, ma'am, I did.

1212
01:21:12,683 --> 01:21:15,317
Can I...

1213
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:17,488
ask you a question?

1214
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:22,459
Are you Justice4Yall?

1215
01:21:24,461 --> 01:21:26,561
Come on.

1216
01:21:26,563 --> 01:21:28,497
We're both dead.

1217
01:21:28,499 --> 01:21:30,499
Just tell me.

1218
01:21:30,501 --> 01:21:33,470
I got the right Crystal,
didn't I?

1219
01:21:35,506 --> 01:21:38,675
No, ma'am, you did not.

1220
01:21:45,616 --> 01:21:47,484
Whoops.

1221
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:37,926
Hey there.

1222
01:23:37,928 --> 01:23:39,694
Oh, shit.

1223
01:23:39,696 --> 01:23:41,796
The, uh...

1224
01:23:41,798 --> 01:23:44,933
assholes you work for
tried to kill me,

1225
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:48,036
so I killed them instead.

1226
01:23:48,038 --> 01:23:49,806
Now I want to go home.

1227
01:23:52,075 --> 01:23:53,942
That gonna be a problem?

1228
01:23:53,944 --> 01:23:55,844
Certainly not, ma'am.

1229
01:23:55,846 --> 01:23:57,512
No.

1230
01:23:57,514 --> 01:23:59,814
May I...
may I pour that for you?

1231
01:23:59,816 --> 01:24:01,650
Yeah.

1232
01:24:11,695 --> 01:24:14,062
How about a snack?
We have fantastic caviar.

1233
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:16,498
- It's osetra...
- Yeah.

1234
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,668
You got it.

1235
01:24:26,109 --> 01:24:27,876
You ever had caviar?

1236
01:24:27,878 --> 01:24:31,646
No, I-I don't... I don't think
I'm really allowed to.

1237
01:24:31,648 --> 01:24:33,850
Well, you are now.
Have a seat.

1238
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:38,655
Dig in.

1239
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:49,066
H-How is it?

1240
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:56,039
It's fucking great.

1241
01:24:56,041 --> 01:25:00,809

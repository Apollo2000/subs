You can't just announce a race

00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,416
Hey!

34
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,618
Oh, hey, guys!

35
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,720
- Oh, hey, Susan!
- Hey, David.

36
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,622
Um, you still good to
pick him up today, right?

37
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,890
Yeah. No problem.

38
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:47,425
I have that late class tonight,
so...

39
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,828
it'll be later than usual.

40
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,995
I'll see you guys later.

41
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:53,832
- Bye!
- Thank you.

42
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,601
Alright.
Don't forget your seatbelt.

43
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,768
Yep.

44
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,370
- Mom...
- Yeah.

45
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:00,538
...I need to ask you
something serious.

46
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:01,841
What?

47
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,742
If you had eight arms,

48
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,746
what would you do
with the extra ones?

49
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,413
Would you hide them
down your top?

50
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,883
Or show them off?

51
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:13,818
- Aaah! No, no, no! Stop!
- You're such a little butt!

52
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,888
Why would you
scare me like that?

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,423
I'm serious!

54
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,492
Seriously.

55
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:20,659
- I'm serious.
- Okay. Okay.

56
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,694
I will take it seriously,
but I need to think about it,

57
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,329
because I'm gonna
take it extra seriously.

58
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,764
Think about it
while your driving...

59
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:26,899
- I will.
- ...because school starts

60
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,502
- in five minutes.
- We'll get there.

61
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,007
Okay. Go.
Have a good day.

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,509
I love you.

63
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,542
Bye, Mom.

64
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,911
Love you.

65
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,482
Hey!

66
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,651
I wouldn't hide
my eight arms down my top.

67
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,754
I would just show them off
and call myself a spider lady.

68
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:51,589
Good answer, Mom.

69
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,398
"A" is for...

70
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,565
Apple!

71
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:03,034
Beautiful.

72
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,570
"B" is for...

73
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:06,738
Ball!

74
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:09,408
Fabulous!

75
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,711
"C" is for cow.

76
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,115
Excuse me!

77
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:24,756
A child with PTSD will often
have a intense focus on death.

78
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,092
And while it is normal

79
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,528
for some kids
to be curious about death,

80
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,096
others with trauma

81
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,766
will often develop
an obsession with it

82
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:37,001
and worry excessively
about their own safety,

83
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,672
or the safety
of their loved ones.

84
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:45,977
Mommy!

85
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,646
- Hi, munchkin.
- Hey.

86
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:49,013
- How'd it go? Good?
- It was great.

87
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,783
We just ate, and he finished
all of his homework.

88
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:52,984
- Amazing. Thank you.
- All of my homework.

89
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,887
- For the rest of the week!
- Good job, buddy.

90
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,822
Thank you, Susan.
We'll see you tomorrow, okay?

91
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:00,158
- See you. Bye, David!
- Bye!

92
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,461
Mom, can I play
video games before bed?

93
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,629
Maybe.

94
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,506
Mom...

95
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:14,639
Yeah, sweetie.

96
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,841
I need my gym clothes tomorrow.

97
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,644
I already have them
waiting for you.

98
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,579
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best.

99
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:22,848
You're welcome.

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,915
- Now go to bed.
- Wait, wait, wait.

101
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,518
Don't shut off the night light.

102
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,053
Just in case there's zombies
hiding in the dark.

103
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:31,856
That's why we're not
supposed to play scary games

104
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,793
before we go to bed.

105
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,927
- Uh...
- Um...

106
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,030
Okay.

107
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:39,764
Goodnight.

108
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,036
David?

109
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,206
I told you
you were gonna get scared.

110
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,911
What do you know.
Come on in.

111
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,580
You can sleep with me tonight.

112
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:31,750
Oh, come on.

113
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,185
Mommy loves when
you sleep in her bed.

114
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,819
Don't feel bad.

115
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,860
David!

116
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,663
David, wake up!

117
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,704
Help!

118
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,907
Help, somebody!

119
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,242
Somebody, help, please!

120
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:32,043
Help!

121
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,546
Help!

122
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,546
Susan...

123
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,716
Susan, help!

124
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,952
Help! Susan! Susan!

125
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,890
Help!

126
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,293
Susan, hurry, hurry!

127
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,794
Susan!

128
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,329
There are people in my house.
Call the police!

129
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,865
There are people
in David's room.

130
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,334
- Laura, who do I call?
- Call the police!

131
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,802
Okay!

132
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:12,084
David.

133
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,851
David! David! David! David!

134
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:15,321
David. David.

135
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,822
David, wake up.

136
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,257
Wake up. Can you hear me?

137
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,192
David, can you hear me?

138
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,125
Mom?

139
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,832
Alright. Alright.

140
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:29,134
So I'll check these,
your neighbor's,

141
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,903
and your son's off
the prints that I found.

142
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,841
Um...

143
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,377
We couldn't find any evidence
of forced entrance

144
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:40,011
on any of the windows or doors.

145
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:42,347
Could you have left
a window or a door open,

146
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,982
do you think?

147
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,750
No.

148
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:47,952
I always lock the doors
and the windows,

149
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:50,622
and then I double check
that I locked them,

150
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,223
and then do that
again and again.

151
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,358
So, no, no.

152
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,793
I'm OCD that way.

153
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,095
Is there a spare key, perhaps?

154
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,198
Does a neighbor or anyone
have a spare?

155
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,966
No.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,735
Did you lose a key?

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,169
Or have one stolen?

158
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,804
Uh...

159
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,706
No, I don't... No.

160
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,810
No. No. Mnm-mnm.

161
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:14,746
Think you could
have been dreaming?

162
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,081
A lucid dream, maybe?

163
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,884
Maybe you went into
your son's room sleepwalking,

164
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,221
stripped him,
went back to your room.

165
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,188
It can happen.

166
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,723
No, I've never sleepwalked
a day in my life.

167
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:26,958
It happened.

168
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,993
Those people were here.
It was real.

169
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,663
Have you been
under stress lately?

170
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,231
Recent break-up,
loss of a loved one?

171
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,234
Why do you think these people
were here? Who were they?

172
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,236
I don't know. You tell me.
<i>You're</i> the police.

173
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,938
Uh, Steve, w... why don't you
head back to the station.

174
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:43,108
I'll... I'll finish up here.

175
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,846
Copy that.

176
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,084
Those people were here, alright?

177
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,120
Those people were here.
It happened.

178
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,822
I did not imagine it.

179
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,158
I believe you.

180
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,994
You do?

181
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:03,229
Yeah.

182
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,735
Now, the doctors...

183
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,237
they couldn't find anything
physically wrong with your son.

184
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,173
So, my guess is that
you interrupted these people

185
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,975
just before they had time to do
whatever they wanted to do.

186
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,312
- Right.
- But don't worry, okay?

187
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,848
We'll fucking get them.

188
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,249
Excuse me.

189
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:32,951
What are you doing?

190
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:35,153
I was sleeping.

191
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,355
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,025
Were there really people
in my room?

193
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,528
You don't remember anything?

194
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,898
No.

195
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,501
Do you remember if you
took your jammies off...

196
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,436
in the middle of the night?

197
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,972
I'm not sure.

198
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:57,341
Sweetie, this is very,
very, very important.

199
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,145
I need you to remember...

200
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:05,116
if you took your jammies off
in the middle of the night.

201
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,552
I think I did.

202
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,488
I was too hot.

203
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,156
Okay.

204
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,092
That's okay.

205
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:20,198
Mom?

206
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,833
Yeah.

207
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:24,302
I was dreaming.

208
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,371
What about?

209
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:30,274
I was drowning.

210
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:33,611
I was drowning
in a river of blood.

211
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:40,252
Alright.
Exactly like that.

212
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,320
You dip it...

213
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,257
I did it.

214
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,325
...and you flick it.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,034
You didn't find a single print?

216
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,370
Other than you, your neighbor,

217
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:02,941
and your son's, no.

218
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:05,410
Are you okay?

219
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,513
Sort of.

220
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,148
Alright.

221
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:13,185
Well, it's gonna take you
a while to get back to normal.

222
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:17,389
People breaking into your home
is just such a... violation.

223
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:21,293
You know, my son...
he said that he could have

224
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,528
taken his pajamas off
in the middle of the night.

225
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:26,331
He said that
he does that sometimes.

226
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,002
But those people...

227
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,371
Those people were there.

228
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,276
If you need anything...

229
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,543
here's my card.

230
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,111
Call me anytime, okay?

231
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,612
Oh, thank you, Detective Tate.

232
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:44,548
Yeah.
Oh, you can call me Paul.

233
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:56,927
Wake up honey.

234
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,221
Mom?

235
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:24,523
Yeah.

236
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,158
I have a headache

237
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,694
- and my stomach feels sick.
- Okay.

238
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:31,228
Well, it's probably 'cause you
haven't eaten anything today.

239
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,165
That's probably why.

240
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:36,367
And if you still feel sick
in the morning,

241
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,536
I will take you to the doctor.

242
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,105
Don't worry.

243
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,407
I got you.

244
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,675
Got to sleep.

245
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,137
Nothing.

246
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,637
Here you go. It's...

247
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,041
I didn't know if you
wanted sugar or...

248
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,341
You know, I really don't think

249
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,044
they're gonna be back here,
Laura.

250
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,079
I mean, whoever they were,

251
00:16:55,113 --> 00:17:01,119
they must know that...
the police are watching.

252
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,489
I saw them, though.

253
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,591
But I'm thinking
that they must have came in

254
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,394
through the back garden.

255
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,328
Right?
It's the only explanation left.

256
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,798
So...

257
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,832
I'll have my guys check
for footprints in the morning.

258
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:17,836
I have a feeling that
they'll come with something.

259
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,371
Right.

260
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,673
Mom?

261
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:23,442
David, are you okay?

262
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:26,410
It really hurts.

263
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,430
Jesus. What is that?

264
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,870
David.

265
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:52,636
David...

266
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,613
I'll just, uh...

267
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,749
I'll wait out here, okay?

268
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:09,287
Can you stay?

269
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,191
I just want someone
to be with me.

270
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,426
Absolutely.

271
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,328
Yeah.

272
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,867
We thought at first,
it was bacterial meningitis,

273
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,536
as the symptoms
are quite similar,

274
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:27,172
but the tests
turned up negative.

275
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,406
Because of the severe
gastrointestinal bleeding,

276
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,575
we checked for trauma, tumors,

277
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:33,411
ulcerative colitis,
and parasites.

278
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:35,180
Negative.

279
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,516
We then tested for all other
viral and bacterial infections

280
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,317
and various diseases,
including tropical diseases,

281
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:43,822
known degenerative diseases,
poisons, and narcotics...

282
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,724
but everything
turned up negative.

283
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,330
Oh.

284
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:56,401
Okay. So...?

285
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,336
So...

286
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:01,405
Laura...

287
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,175
can I be honest with you?

288
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,875
As a parent myself,
if I were in your position,

289
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,179
I know that's what I'd want.

290
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,356
We don't know what this is.

291
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,659
We're still testing,

292
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,960
and, of course,
we'll continue to test,

293
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,628
but I'm afraid time
is against us.

294
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,698
His condition is worsening
by the second,

295
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,402
and we can hardly keep up.

296
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:34,371
I think you should prepare
yourself for the possibility...

297
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:38,176
the distinct likelihood that
David isn't gonna wake up.

298
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:43,414
I'm sorry.

299
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:55,426
Uh...

300
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,362
Those people... Those...
Those... Those people.

301
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:58,762
Those people that
were in his room...

302
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,265
Th-They gave him something then.

303
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,232
Poison.

304
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,567
Well, like I said,
we checked for poisons.

305
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,003
W-Well, then something else.

306
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,938
- Like what?
- I don't know.

307
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:09,740
Something else...
Something that doesn't show up.

308
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,843
I don't know what that is.

309
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:15,012
Paul, does this make any sense?

310
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,780
I...

311
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:18,682
Laura, I assure you,
if someone gave him something,

312
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,618
it would have shown up.

313
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,386
There's nothin'.

314
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,641
Mommy's
right here.

315
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:44,843
I'm so sorry.

316
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,882
I'm so sorry that this is
happening to you, baby.

317
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,550
I'm so sorry
I couldn't do anything

318
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,487
to help make it better.

319
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,865
If you have to go...

320
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:11,302
then it's okay.

321
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,337
I know you do.

322
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,674
I know you hurt.

323
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,380
I know you hurt.

324
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,877
Help, somebody!

325
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,413
Nurse, doctor, somebody!

326
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,447
Get in here!

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,750
Help! Help!

328
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:00,684
Yeah, I-I don't know
what's happening.

329
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:03,488
I think
he's coughing up blood again.

330
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
- I'll get the doctor.
- Hurry! Hurry, please!

331
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:06,857
Hurry, please!
Hurry, please! Hurry!

332
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,661
Baby, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

333
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:13,365
Help, somebody!
Doctor, hurry, please!

334
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:14,765
David. David!

335
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,567
David, it's Dr. Bond.
Open your eyes.

336
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,471
Open your eyes.
Can you hear me?

337
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:20,904
Mommy...

338
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,441
Hi, baby.

339
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:25,643
Mommy...

340
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,750
Hi, sugar.

341
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:35,486
Eat an apple...
It makes me happy.

342
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,654
'Cause apples are the candy

343
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:38,957
of the forest.

344
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,173
You've been
working on it all dinner.

345
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:57,975
I think it's time
to unveil it to us.

346
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,178
Thank you so much.
What do you say?

347
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,945
Thanks.

348
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,649
- She gave you fortune cookies.
- Fortune cookies.

349
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:05,916
Thank you!

350
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,986
Well,
I wonder what the fortune is.

351
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,188
This is
my zombie-killing sword.

352
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:11,823
It has six spikes.

353
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:13,724
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- Eat you fortunate cookie, man.

354
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,492
- Look at your fortune.
- Oh, yeah.

355
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:16,928
Mine says...

356
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,030
you will one day
achieve greatness.

357
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,932
- Huh?
- You hear that?

358
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,967
- Ooh!
- That sounds pretty good.

359
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,504
"Money can't buy everything.

360
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:30,642
You can buy a doctor,
but you can't buy health."

361
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:32,210
- Wow.
- I don't get it.

362
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:33,845
What does yours say?

363
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:36,747
"Do something unusual today."

364
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,218
I got to go to the bathroom.

365
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,985
Do you know where it is?

366
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,189
It's literally
right over there.

367
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:47,759
Okay.

368
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,059
It's amazing.

369
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:52,130
It's like he was
never even sick at all.

370
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:55,567
Yeah, the doctors still
have no idea what it was.

371
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,767
We're just...

372
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,602
We're chalking
it up to a miracle.

373
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:01,038
I'm happy before you.

374
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,840
I think that, um...

375
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,942
I'm gonna put the house
on the market.

376
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,545
I think we're gonna sell
and just get out of here.

377
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:10,013
You know,
start over someplace new.

378
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:15,653
Laura, I feel that whatever
happened was a one off,

379
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:17,588
and that...

380
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,190
I mean, that's your home.

381
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:21,192
Right?

382
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:23,193
You can't get scared
out of your home.

383
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:25,596
Yeah.

384
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,198
Yah!

385
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,701
Aaah!

386
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,001
Can we just go?

387
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,202
Can you take a few bites?

388
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:33,137
No.

389
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,707
David, you haven't
eaten anything today.

390
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,741
We don't want it.

391
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,479
I'm not hungry.

392
00:24:57,228 --> 00:24:59,631
He's completely exhausted.

393
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,532
He's out cold.

394
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,134
Well, he's had a long...

395
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,536
a long day, huh?

396
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:07,838
He's fond of you.

397
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,741
- You think?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,244
Yeah, I can tell.

399
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,180
He doesn't like everyone.

400
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,288
Thank you,
Paul, for everything.

401
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,691
It's been...

402
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:29,626
Thank you.

403
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,697
You're welcome, you know.

404
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,766
Just doing my job,

405
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,935
- I'll get out here.
- Wait. Just...

406
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:42,706
Can you say?

407
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,076
Laura...

408
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,844
you're safe here.

409
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:51,348
I promise you,
you don't have anything...

410
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:54,251
You don't have anything
to worry about, okay?

411
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:55,987
I promise.

412
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,596
- I don't know if...
- Just stay, please.

413
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:06,798
I... I-I like you, Laura.

414
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,599
Just say just tonight.

415
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,269
Are you sure about this?

416
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:15,839
Alright.

417
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:30,687
What happened?

418
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,890
A junkie cut me up
the other night.

419
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:35,093
It's one of the perks
of the job.

420
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,231
David?

421
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:51,075
- No...
- We're still testing.

422
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:52,976
We have a lot
more testing to do.

423
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:54,912
Dr. Bond, I called you
three times over the weekend.

424
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:56,146
I called you three times,

425
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,682
and I said that
he wasn't eating.

426
00:26:57,714 --> 00:26:58,715
He wasn't drinking.

427
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,084
He was doing all of these things

428
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:01,885
that he had done before,
before he got sick.

429
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,921
And you said he's fine.
You said he's totally fine.

430
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:06,223
W-Why would anything else
be wrong with him?

431
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,159
- This is a miracle.
- I need you to stay stay calm.

432
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:10,827
- He's not fine!
- I need you to stay stay calm.

433
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,263
Stay calm?
Oh, my God.

434
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,966
I can get you something
to help you relax.

435
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,300
No.

436
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,733
Paul...

437
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,873
I haven't been completely honest
with you about everything.

438
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:59,743
I was raised in a cult.

439
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,980
I...

440
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:05,415
escaped eight years ago,

441
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,752
and...

442
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,090
I... I wasn't sure

443
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,725
if it was them,

444
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,159
but now I know.

445
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:18,496
They were the people
that were in his room.

446
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:21,031
I know there were people

447
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,967
- that started all of this.
- Laura.

448
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,502
You can come in now.

449
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:29,340
Laura...?

450
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:32,176
Please.
Please stay with us.

451
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,345
Laura.

452
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:37,749
You have no idea what
they're capable of.

453
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,184
Okay.

454
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,987
Yeah.

455
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:29,432
Shhhh.

456
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,601
Say the words.

457
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:27,090
They're waiting for us
downstairs.

458
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:29,527
We have to handle it quietly.

459
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,294
Wait till she falls asleep.

460
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:34,097
The boy is the priority.

461
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,133
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:40,403
- Do you understand?
- Yes, doctor.

463
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:54,652
Okay, baby.

464
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:56,887
Okay. Okay.

465
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,122
I got you, baby.

466
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,522
I got you, baby.

467
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:01,459
Okay. Shh.

468
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:21,612
Shh. Shh.

469
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,962
Shh, baby.
Shh. I know.

470
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:42,934
Everything alright back there?

471
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:50,441
Okay, baby.

472
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:51,541
Alright. Okay.

473
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,210
I'm just gonna run next door,

474
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:55,546
and I'm gonna get money
and clothes a-and my car,

475
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:57,013
and then I'll be right back,
okay?

476
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,416
No. No, Laura.
I can't be a party to that.

477
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,451
You have to take him back.

478
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:02,152
Just let him lie here
for a few minutes, Susan.

479
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,620
- Look at him.
- You saw at the hospital,

480
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,256
They did nothing for him.
They did nothing.

481
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:06,624
Just let him like here
for a few minutes,

482
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,125
and I'll be back in a few.

483
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:11,962
What if I take him back
while you're gone?

484
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,730
You would not do that

485
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,533
because you are a friend.

486
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:21,137
You're our friend, okay?

487
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,740
Okay. Please just take care
of him while I'm gone.

488
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:27,110
I'll be back.

489
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:38,756
Come closer.

490
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:57,008
- <i>Laura, where are you?</i>
- Don't ask me any questions.

491
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,042
Just meet me outside of
David's school in an hour, okay?

492
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,545
<i>Laura, everyone
is looking for you.</i>

493
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,580
Just promise me, Paul!

494
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,649
Promise me.

495
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,550
<i>Okay.
I-I'll see you there.</i>

496
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,122
Don't trust anybody.
Everybody is in on it.

497
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:13,057
Everybody... The doctors,
everybody at the hospital.

I feel better now, Mom.

506
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:34,365
Towel is so warm.

507
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,700
Okay.

508

Mom...

are we staying
with Susan tonight?

510
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,744
No, I just need you
to rest right now,

511
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:49,679
so that's what we're gonna do.

512
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:51,182
Okay?

513
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,250
Okay. I'll try.

514
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:54,451
Cool.

515
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:56,319
I love you, Mom.

516
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:01,759
I love you, too, sweetie.

517
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,666
This is a cool room.

518
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:30,074
Mom, look what's on.

519
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:31,608
Hey, buddy,
that's not for you.

520
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,510
Turn that off.
You know that.

521
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,750
I've see this one,
but it's super funny.

522
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:59,369
Mom...

523
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:02,772
Do you think that
this room has fleas?

524
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:06,409
- No.
- I don't think it does.

525
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,746
Try to get some sleep,
okay, bud?

526
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,484
Okay. A couple more minutes.

527
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,385
And then right to bed, okay?

528
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:17,453
Okay. Fine.

Somebody that I knew

Why?

No, I'm fine.

00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:39,188
Are you in a relationship
with Laura?

560
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:40,958
What?

561
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,259
What are you talking...

562
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,661
Are you fucking her
or are you not?

563
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:46,596
Okay.

564
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,030
- We made out, Steve.
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:51,367
But does that mean
I'm in a relationship? No.

566
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,804
She couldn't have done this.
Okay? I know she couldn't.

567
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,040
She was in a fuckin'
mental institution, right?

568
00:42:57,072 --> 00:42:57,907
For trauma.

569
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,076
So, who did it then?

570
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,876
- This cult.
- Was a pedophile ring

571
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:02,645
And maybe that's what she meant.

572
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,782
There are pedophile cults.
They're fucking cults, Steve.

573
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,117
They're crazy.
They'll do anything.

574
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,319
They could have killed Susan
trying to get to the boy,

575
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:13,255
or trying to silence Laura.

576
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:15,993
Pedophile cults.

577
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,836
Let's just find her
and bring her in.

578
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:29,672
If this is real,
she needs our protection.

579
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:31,307
And what if it's not?

580
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:36,913
Then at the very least,

581
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:38,315
we need to find the boy

582
00:43:38,347 --> 00:43:41,851
and bring him back to
the hospital before he dies.

583
00:44:07,876 --> 00:44:11,815
Hi, Mrs. Naegle.

584
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:15,384
It's... It's me.
It's Anna. Anna Hansen.

585
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,855
I know who you are.

586
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,769
Is that the boy?

587
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:35,105
Is that your father...

588
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:35,771
This is...

589
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,442
He doesn't know anything...

590
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:40,710
Know about what, Mom?

591
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,979
Nothing, sweetheart.

592
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,414
Do you wanna listen
to some music

593
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:47,250
while Mrs. Naegle and I
talk about something, okay?

594
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:50,119
- Okay.
- Okay.

595
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:54,990
Poor child.

596
00:44:55,023 --> 00:45:00,297
How could something so beautiful
and innocent like you...

597
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:02,833
come out of such evil?

598
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,869
She's crazy.

599
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:17,213
Mrs. Naegle...

600
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:19,048
um...

601
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,119
I...

602
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:25,222
really need to talk to Jimmy.

603
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,990
Do you know where he is?

604
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:31,929
When did you get out
of the institution, Anna?

605
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:37,067
A while ago.

606
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,206
We lost Jimmy to drugs.

607
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:46,943
He's been in and out of prison
these past five years.

608
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:50,780
He stole from me
a couple times

609
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:54,416
and drove his father
to an early grave.

610
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,520
You know, for years...

611
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,190
I blamed you

612
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:02,525
for what happened,

613
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,463
for introducing him
to your father.

614
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:10,567
Then, of course,
that's ridiculous.

615
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:13,502
You were just a child,
like Jimmy.

616
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:18,240
It wasn't your fault.

617
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:21,043
Please.

618
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:23,814
I really need
to know where he is.

619
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,250
I'm sorry.

620
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:31,454
He went south.

621
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:33,523
Clarksdale, Mississippi.

622
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,925
An awful place.

623
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,861
Calachmont Square.

624
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,285
Can I help you?

625
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:04,554
Hi, uh, Tracy.

626
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:05,956
I'm looking for a doctor

627
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,391
by the name
of Nathan J. Bradlee.

628
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:13,262
I'm afraid Dr. Bradlee retired
a couple of years ago.

629
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:16,198
- You know where I can find him?
- I'm sorry,

630
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:18,534
I don't think I'm supposed
to give out that information.

631
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:20,871
Oh, it's okay. He's not in
trouble or anything like that.

632
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:22,271
I'm a police officer.

633
00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:25,574
I just need to ask him
a couple of questions.

634
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:38,654
Are there patients here?

635
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:40,657
It's awfully quiet.

636
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,224
People always
expect screaming,

637
00:47:42,257 --> 00:47:44,927
but the patients here
are quiet mostly,

638
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,529
I find that scarier.
Don't you?

639
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:51,101
This place gives me the creeps.
I have nightmares about it.

640
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,469
Why do you work here then?

641
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,238
It's better than McDonalds.

642
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,541
Yeah, well...
that's a good point.

643
00:48:02,344 --> 00:48:04,113
Watch your step.
It's a big one.

644
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:05,547
- Okay.
- There's a dog.

645
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:06,583
There is a dog.

646
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,621
Doesn't the garbage man
ever come here?

647
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:13,389
I don't think so, babe.

648
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:15,157
Don't touch anything, okay?

649
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,959
And especially
when we go inside.

650
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:18,394
Don't touch anything.

651
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:20,563
Okay.

652
00:48:20,596 --> 00:48:22,065
Okay.

653
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:25,034
I don't feel so good.

654
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,938
We're gonna be out of here
in a few minutes, okay?

655
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,423
Jimmy.

656
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,092
Hi.

657
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,626
Anna?

658
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:54,130
Can I speak with you
for a minute?

659
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:58,400
Who's that?

660
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,737
Uh, this is my son, David.

661
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:04,306
He's from a previous marriage.

662
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,209
Can you say hi to Jimmy?

663
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:10,347
This was Mommy's friend
when I was a kid.

664
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,249
You want to say hi?

665
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:16,052
Hi.

666
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:18,621
Do you mind if we come in?

667
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:26,096
Anna was
the most extraordinary case.

668
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,299
She had suffered such
terrible abuse in her life

669
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:35,672
that she had retreated
into a fantasy world.

670
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,677
Was Anna psychotic?

671
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,614
She had an extreme
psychotic episode, yes.

672
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:49,318
The truth is that
her father would pimp her out

673
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:51,653
to other men for money,

674
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:54,324
her and a little local boy

675
00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:57,193
named Jimmy Naegle.

676
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:03,732
Well, Laura... or... Anna

677
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:06,769
thinks that this cult
may still be out there.

678
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:09,172
- She thinks...
- There was never any cult,

679
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:12,375
no conspiracy
or any other fantasies

680
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:15,577
that she's now trying
to perpetuate.

681
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,414
It was all in our head.

682
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:26,222
What happened
to the other child?

683
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,325
I was born dead.

684
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:35,431
I-I-I really wanted to go
and see you at the hospital,

685
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:39,302
Anna, b-but...
but they wouldn't let me in.

686
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:41,336
They tried to tell me
I was crazy, too,

687
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,138
but I wouldn't
let them lock me up.

688
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,809
Those psychiatrics,
they fuck you up in the head.

689
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:49,112
Yeah, they had me
on so many medications

690
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:52,849
that when I was discharged,
I couldn't remember anything.

691
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:56,385
Was it like that for you?

692
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:58,687
No.

693
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:01,224
I-I remember it all.

694
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:06,129
What do you remember?

695
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:11,668
You... You happen
to have a light on you?

696
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:15,371
- I-I don't have mine.
- No, Jimmy, I don't.

697
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:16,472
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:25,714
Please.

699
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:28,585
They... They'd conduct
these ceremonies

700
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:33,623
where they'd kill and torture
animals in front of us.

701
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:38,360
U-Usually in your bedroom.

702
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:40,896
T-Then they'd make you
begin your chanting.

703
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:42,231
Chanting?

704
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:45,734
You were the only one
who could do it.

705
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:47,637
That's why they said
you were special,

706
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,472
th-th-they all tried,

707
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:52,775
but you were the only one.

708
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:54,576
Your father taught you.

709
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,646
Taught me?

710
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,350
What did he teach me?

711
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:04,686
They called your Palestine.

712
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,190
The Huntsman.

713
00:52:08,224 --> 00:52:11,461
Th-The demon.

714
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:14,931
You'd make him rise from Hell.

715
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:20,336
T-Then they'd let
the Huntsman rape you.

716
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:21,771
Jimmy, that can't...

717
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,840
that can't be.

718
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:27,943
You know it's true, Anna.

719
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:30,312
You know I'm telling the truth.

720
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:31,880
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't lie to you.

721
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:34,184
My father is the one
that raped me.

722
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,753
I remember that.

723
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,421
I remember those men.

724
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:41,624
Th-They're false memories.

725
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:44,961
You were sacred, Anna.

726
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:47,730
Th-Th-They would have
never dared touch you.

727
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:50,266
You were meant for the demon...

728
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:51,434
Shh!

729
00:52:53,768 --> 00:52:56,271
- You were abused.
- No, that never happened!

730
00:52:56,304 --> 00:53:00,442
I didn't happen like that.

731
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:02,311
Okay?

732
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:03,346
Okay.

733
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:07,384
I'm sorry.

734
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:12,521
Jimmy, I'm afraid, though.

735
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:14,856
I'm really afraid.

736
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:19,963
Because if I...

737
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:24,400
if I let all these things
back into my brain...

738
00:53:24,432 --> 00:53:26,469
that just means that I'm
slipping back into psychosis,

739
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:29,438
which is exactly what
the doctor said would happened.

740
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,374
Everything I've said is true.

741
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:34,477
Mom...
my skin hurts here.

742
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:38,014
You're as sane as I am, Anna.

743
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:41,351
Everything hurts.

744
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:51,995
<i>Where are you?</i>

745
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:54,563
I'm headed home. I just
passed through Little Rock.

746
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:55,898
Any luck with Jimmy?

747
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:57,733
<i>Yeah.
I talked to his mother</i>

748
00:53:57,766 --> 00:53:59,402
<i>Laura followed him
to Clarksdale.</i>

749
00:53:59,434 --> 00:54:00,969
Fuckin' Mississippi?

750
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:03,338
<i>Yeah. Look, I'll meet
you there in the morning.</i>

751
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:06,576
<i>Wait for me. I'm about
three hours behind you.</i>

752
00:54:06,608 --> 00:54:08,344
<i>We should talk to him together.</i>

753
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:11,847
Alright.

754
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:19,889
I don't like it here.

755
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,891
We're not gonna
be here long, okay?

756
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:24,559
Just till
we figure out what to do.

757
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:27,462
When I say drink this shit,
drink it.

758
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:31,800
Better drink that.
There you go.

759
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:35,337
- I know.
- Get the fuck off me.

760
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:37,373
What's up, mama?

761
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:40,009
Why don't you come over
and hang out with us.

762
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,510
Come on.

763
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:42,679
We'll have some fun with you.

764
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:07,369
There you go, really slow.

765
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:09,705
Really, really, really slow.
Really slow.

766
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,873
I know, sugar.

767
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:12,507
I know.
There you go.

768
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,110
There you go.

769
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,746
Okay. Okay.

770
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,349
Okay. Shh.

771
00:55:20,382 --> 00:55:22,050
It hurts!

772
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,685
It hurts so bad!

773
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,755
- Shh.
- I'm scared, Mom!

774
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,423
I don't want to die.

775
00:55:27,456 --> 00:55:30,360
Hey, none of that.

776
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,427
You're not going to die.

777
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,496
I am right here.

778
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,766
You are gonna be okay.

779
00:55:37,132 --> 00:55:38,100
Okay?

780
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:41,770
Shh.

781
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:46,476
Sing that song that you
used to sing for me.

782
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,545
Okay.

783
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:52,148
So close those eyes.

784
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:30,452
No, shhh!

785
00:56:59,547 --> 00:57:02,117
Wake up, honey.

786
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,188
It's time again.

787
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,192
Say the words.

788
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:25,674
Mom, it hurts!

789
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,610
- It hurts!
- Shh!

790
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:32,748
It hurts so bad!
I'm gonna die!

791
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:37,186
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- I'm gonna die!

792
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:41,624
Mom, come back!

793
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:43,659
Mom!

794
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:45,994
Mom, get me some food!

795
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:49,564
Get me some fuckin' food,
you bitch!

796
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:52,768
Get me some food!

797
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,703
I need it!

798
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:46,054
Okay. Okay.

799
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:48,557
Okay. Okay.

800
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,692
Okay. Okay.

801
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:53,194
Okay. It's okay.

802
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:54,697
Okay. Hey...

803
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,632
Hey. Hey.

804
00:58:56,664 --> 00:58:58,333
Baby...

805
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:00,236
Okay.

806
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:02,337
Okay. Okay.

807
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,273
Shh.

808
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:07,208
Shh, shh.

809
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:09,711
Shh, shh.

810
00:59:09,744 --> 00:59:11,780
Shh, shh.

811
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,163
I need food.

812
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:29,731
I...

813
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:32,201
need...

814
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:33,369
food.

815
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:36,072
I need food.

816
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,307
Please, Mom.

817
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:15,778
By Astaroth, your prince,

818
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:20,783
by your master Lucifer...

819
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:24,252
appear before me now.

820
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:27,989
That's my girl.

821
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,728
I want my fuckin' money!

822
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,063
Yeah, you got it.
I know you fuckin' do.

823
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:36,699
You owe me that fuckin' money!

824
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:37,932
Bitch!

825
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,734
Yeah, see, I knew you got it!

826
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,202
Bitch!

827
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:55,151
The fuck are you looking at?

828
01:00:56,117 --> 01:00:59,688
Huh?!

829
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:50,405
What can I do for you,
little mama?

830
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:54,143
I'd like for you
to come to my room and fuck me.

831
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,065
Not here.

832
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:21,137
I want to do it in the bathroom.

833
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,416
I... I want you to
take yours off first.

834
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:10,085
I wanna...

835
01:03:10,117 --> 01:03:11,853
I wanna look at your body.

836
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:13,581
Take your fuckin' clothes off!

837
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:16,184
Now!

838
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:52,454
Take that fuckin' shirt off!

839
01:05:19,246 --> 01:05:20,382
Aaah! Get off me!

840
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:22,384
Help! Help!

841
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,420
Get off me!

842
01:05:24,452 --> 01:05:26,655
Get this off of me!

843
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:01,724
David: Mommy, wake up.

844
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:17,139
I love you, Mom.

850
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,568
- Mom?
- Yeah?

851
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:49,204
Can we do something fun
tomorrow?

852
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:51,807
We haven't done something fun
in forever.

853
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,076
Uh, maybe, sweetie.

854
01:06:54,108 --> 01:06:56,411
I don't know. We...
We kind of have to leave soon.

855
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,614
Just sit there
and watch your cartoons, okay?

856
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:00,114
Okay.

857

859
01:07:11,726 --> 01:07:16,565
And so you can't
trust anyone these days.

860
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:24,239
Can you... Can you do me a favor
and get down on the floor?

861
01:07:24,271 --> 01:07:26,541
- Why?
- Just for a minute.

862
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:28,376
I just have to do something,
okay?

863
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:09,818
Ohh.

864
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,289
Okay.

865
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:25,793
Jimmy.

866
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:33,302
Jimmy, we're police officers.
We'd like to speak to you.

867
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,216
Jimmy?

868
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:57,326
Jimmy, your mother told
us where we could find you.

869
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,696
We're looking for Anna Hansen.
Has she been here?

870
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:06,868
Jimmy, it's the police.

871
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,659
Shit.

872
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:46,041
Yeah.

873
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:47,775
Got an address?

874
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,679
Copy that.

875
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,916
She used her credit card
to check out of a nearby motel

876
01:10:55,949 --> 01:10:59,654
at 4:00 a.m.,
just around the corner.

877
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,828
We got to call local PD.

878
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:11,033
Alright.

879
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:16,430
- Mom?
- Hmm?

880
01:12:16,463 --> 01:12:19,033
I was dreaming.

881
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:24,006
I was flying and I was
looking down at everyone.

882
01:12:25,172 --> 01:12:29,978
And I could see you
and my school and everything.

883
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:33,449
It was so cool.

884
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:36,384
Sounds cool.

885
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:39,787
Then I raised my hands
like this,

886
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:44,059
and the world cracked in half.

887
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:48,163
There was fire and everything.

888
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:51,399
Buildings were burning.

889
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,104
People were screaming like 9/11.

890
01:12:56,136 --> 01:12:57,840
Were you scared?

891
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:00,676
Uh-huh.

892
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:03,846
But I was okay.

893
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,984
I was like a superhero
or something.

894
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:10,585
Wow.

895
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:15,524
Like that blue guy that was
in the movie we saw.

896
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:17,559
Yeah.

897
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:19,161
Nothing could touch me.

898
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,929
Mm-hmm.

899
01:13:28,802 --> 01:13:30,671
Sweet pea.

900
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:36,177
You know how you've been sick?

901
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:38,779
Uh-huh.

902
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:40,649
- So...
- What about it?

903
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,184
Your illness...

904
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:46,889
it seems that it's getting
closer and closer every time.

905
01:13:49,122 --> 01:13:55,996
Which means that you're gonna
probably get sick again

906
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:57,898
really soon.

907
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:01,869
Okay, it's gonna come on
really quick,

908
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:05,574
and it's gonna be
really painful.

909
01:14:05,606 --> 01:14:06,774
But you're gonna help me, right?

910
01:14:06,807 --> 01:14:09,778
I'm gonna be here by your side

911
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,079
holding your hand.

912
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:16,184
But I'm not gonna
be able to help.

913
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:19,787
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

914
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:23,157
I can't do anything.

915
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:26,595
Mom, stop crying.

916
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:28,896
Please.

917
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,667
- I hate it when you cry.
- Shh.

918
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:44,913
Do you want to
do something fun today?

919
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:48,216
There's a carnival
that's nearby.

920
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:52,987
It's inside,
and they have a carousel.

921
01:14:54,822 --> 01:14:58,527
I want to go.
I want to go.

922
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,096
Can we?

923
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:02,530
Yeah, we can go.

924
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,698
Yes.

925
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:08,068
We can go when it gets dark.
Okay?

926
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:09,570
Okay.

927
01:15:10,037 --> 01:15:11,839
Okay, now go to sleep.

928
01:15:21,849 --> 01:15:23,184
Is it dark yet?

929
01:15:23,216 --> 01:15:25,119
No.

930
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:54,149
Laura was seen last night taking
this pimp to her motel room.

931
01:15:57,018 --> 01:15:59,221
You know it's her
doing this, right?

932
01:16:00,688 --> 01:16:01,823
Nobody's following her around

933
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:03,657
killing everybody
that she meets.

934
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:05,092
It's her.
No fucking satanic cult.

935
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:07,296
No pedophile ring.
It's her.

936
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:12,199
Tell them to go easy on her,
Steve, when they find her.

937
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:14,836
Even if she's the one
doing this,

938
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:17,305
she may not know it herself.

939
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:36,191
- I tripped.
- Way off.

940
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:37,993
I tripped a little.

941
01:16:44,364 --> 01:16:46,166
Aah!

942
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,670
You okay?
What's going on, baby?

943
01:16:48,703 --> 01:16:50,639
Let me see, let me see.

944
01:16:50,671 --> 01:16:51,706
Jesus.

945
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:53,375
Come on, come on.

946
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,944
It's okay.

947
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:58,078
I'm right here, baby.

948
01:16:58,112 --> 01:16:59,814
I'm right here with you.
Come on.

949
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:01,182
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

950
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:04,351
Come on. Come on.

951
01:17:04,385 --> 01:17:07,322
It's okay, baby. You're good.
You're good. Okay, okay.

952
01:17:07,354 --> 01:17:09,657
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay, sugar.

953
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,693
You're okay.

954
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:14,094
No, no, no, don't look at that.
Don't look at that.

955
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:16,831
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts, but look at me.

956
01:17:16,863 --> 01:17:18,232
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

957
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:20,768
It doesn't have to hurt.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

958
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:22,103
Don't look down.
Just look at me.

959
01:17:22,136 --> 01:17:23,338
Look at me.
I'm right here with you.

960
01:17:23,371 --> 01:17:24,838
- Mom.
- No.

961
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:27,809
- Aah! It hurts, Mom!
- I know. I know. I know. I know.

962
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:29,743
- I need help.
- I'm sorry, baby.

963
01:17:29,777 --> 01:17:31,746
Are you really
not gonna help me?

964
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:34,449
- I can't.
- What if I die?

965
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:36,917
I need help.

966
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:40,055
I can't.
I can't.

967
01:17:40,087 --> 01:17:42,724
- But, Mom!
- I need you to trust me.

968
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:44,059
Mom!

969
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:45,793
- Get the boy.
- Get the boy.

970
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,061
Hey, Laura.

971
01:17:51,364 --> 01:17:52,934
Stop!

972
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:57,805
- Mom!
- David, David, are you okay?

973
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:06,981
Mom.

974
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:26,367
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

975
01:18:28,235 --> 01:18:30,104
Move your hand.
I got it, I got it.

976
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:31,271
I got it.

977
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:33,240
Fuck. It won't stop.

978
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,010
Please help me.

979
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,179
It's okay. It's okay.
Lift up your head.

980
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:41,983
Lift up your head.
Lift up your head.

981
01:18:42,015 --> 01:18:43,217
No, no, stay with me.

982
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,286
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

983
01:18:56,296 --> 01:18:58,365
No, no, no, no, no, no.

984
01:18:58,399 --> 01:18:59,334
No.

985
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,422
Look, don't be scared.

986
01:19:21,454 --> 01:19:23,257
We have to go.

987
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:52,287
Laura, hello?

988
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,256
Paul, I don't know what to do

989
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:56,590
or who to turn to.

990
01:19:56,623 --> 01:19:59,059
Okay, Laura...

991
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:00,528
I did not mean to kill him.

992
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,996
I did not mean
to kill your friend

993
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:03,965
or any of those men,
I swear to you.

994
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:06,134
Your friend, he died in my arms.

995
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:08,970
You have to turn yourself in,
Laura.

996
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:10,537
I still might
be able to help you, okay?

997
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:12,372
I-I-I know you're not well.

998
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:15,844
I just panicked and
I fired and I did not mean to.

999
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:19,581
Laura.

1000
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:21,014
Just tell me where you are.

1001
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,382
I have to go back now.

1002
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,619
No. Go... Go back where?

1003
01:20:24,652 --> 01:20:26,054
Back where it all started.

1004
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,555
- No, no, Laura.
- Goodbye, Paul.

1005
01:20:27,587 --> 01:20:29,224
Listen carefully to me, okay?

1006
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:31,558
Everything that you think
has been happening

1007
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:34,094
and is true is not, okay?

1008
01:20:34,127 --> 01:20:36,396
It's all fantasy.
It's all in your head.

1009
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:38,533
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, don't hang up.

1010
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:40,234
Fuck!

1011
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,398
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, baby?

1012
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:27,768
Okay, David,
whatever I say in there,

1013
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:30,637
whatever I do, just know
that I love you, okay?

1014
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:32,007
Mm-hmm.

1015
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:35,743
You are my son.

1016
01:23:35,775 --> 01:23:37,811
You are my only son.

1017
01:23:37,845 --> 01:23:41,416
And I love you and I will always
take care of you.

1018
01:23:41,448 --> 01:23:42,516
Okay?

1019
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:46,487
Okay, baby, come on.
Come on.

1020
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,389
I know. I know. I know. I know.

1021
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:51,158
There we go.
There we go.

1022
01:24:01,402 --> 01:24:06,707
By Astaroth your prince,
by your master Lucifer,

1023
01:24:06,739 --> 01:24:09,510
by all the kings, queens,
and princes of hell,

1024
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,145
I command you, appear before me.

1025
01:24:20,186 --> 01:24:25,259
Great Palystes, I conjure you.
Appear before me now.

1026
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:28,329
You are my servant.
Do my bidding.

1027
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:40,340
I-I want you... to come here.

1028
01:24:43,476 --> 01:24:45,646
I know you can hear me.

1029
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,420
I want you to come here
and I want you to cure my son.

1030
01:24:54,387 --> 01:24:55,856
<i>Our</i> son.

1031
01:24:58,725 --> 01:25:01,261
I know you can hear me.

1032
01:25:08,601 --> 01:25:10,604
Cure him.

1033
01:25:11,271 --> 01:25:12,907
Or I'll kill him.

1034
01:25:14,408 --> 01:25:17,178
- Mom.
- I know. Shh, baby. Shh.

1035
01:25:17,211 --> 01:25:20,448
By Astaroth your prince,
by your master Lucifer,

1036
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,716
by all the kings, queens,
and princes of hell,

1037
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,585
I command you, appear before me.

1038
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:32,159
Great Palystes, I conjure you.
Appear before me now.

1039
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:34,796
You are my servant.
Do my bidding.

1040
01:25:38,364 --> 01:25:40,835
Show yourself!

1041
01:25:40,868 --> 01:25:41,903
Mom, no.

1042
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:44,304
- Shh, baby.
- Please don't.

1043
01:25:44,337 --> 01:25:45,739
I'll kill him.

1044
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:01,422
By Astaroth your prince,
by your master Lucifer,

1045
01:26:01,454 --> 01:26:03,524
by all the kings, queens,
and princes of hell,

1046
01:26:03,556 --> 01:26:05,458
I command you, appear before me.

1047
01:26:09,395 --> 01:26:12,300
Great Palystes, I conjure you.
Appear before me now.

1048
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:14,634
You are my servant.
Do my bidding.

1049
01:26:18,338 --> 01:26:20,408
By Astaroth your prince,
by your master Lucifer,

1050
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,510
by all the kings, queens,
and princes of hell,

1051
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,711
I command you, appear before me.

1052
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:33,854
Great Palystes, I conjure you.
Appear before me now.

1053
01:26:33,886 --> 01:26:36,423
You are my servant.
Do my bidding.

1054
01:26:53,506 --> 01:26:56,376
By Astaroth your prince,
by your master Lucifer,

1055
01:26:56,409 --> 01:26:58,546
by all the kings, queens,
and princes of hell,

1056
01:26:58,578 --> 01:27:00,447
I command you, appear before me.

1057
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,752
Laura.

1058
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:06,721
What are you doing?

1059
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:09,657
Drop the knife, ma'am,
or I'll shoot.

1060
01:27:09,689 --> 01:27:12,025
Hold on.
Stay the fuck back!

1061
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:13,828
I summoned him.
I summoned him.

1062
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:16,296
He was here.
He was gonna cure David.

1063
01:27:16,329 --> 01:27:17,597
Okay.

1064
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:19,900
This is Detective Tate.
Nobody move.

1065
01:27:19,932 --> 01:27:22,569
Hold your fire.
I got this.

1066
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:23,570
Laura.

1067
01:27:23,604 --> 01:27:25,773
You don't understand.

1068
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:27,774
He's not human.

1069
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:31,346
He's killed, Paul,
and he's going to kill again.

1070
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:34,414
Laura.

1071
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:37,351
Put the knife down.

1072
01:27:37,384 --> 01:27:38,786
Stay back!

1073
01:27:42,823 --> 01:27:44,892
Show yourself!

1074
01:27:46,025 --> 01:27:50,831
Come back! Come back!
Please, come back!

1075
01:27:52,599 --> 01:27:53,567
Laura.

1076
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,537
He was here.
Fuck!

1077
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:59,072
Fuck! He was here. He was here.
He was right here.

1078
01:27:59,105 --> 01:28:02,943
You made him go away, Paul.
You made him go away.

1079
01:28:02,975 --> 01:28:06,046
And now I'm going to
have to kill him.

1080
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:07,881
I have her.
I have a clean shot.

1081
01:28:07,914 --> 01:28:09,850
Don't fire.
Nobody fucking move!

1082
01:28:09,882 --> 01:28:12,319
On that night when they came
into his room,

1083
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,354
they fed him human flesh.

1084
01:28:13,386 --> 01:28:14,487
I know that now.

1085
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,789
That wasn't real, Laura.

1086
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:19,394
None of that was real.
You imagined everything.

1087
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:26,000
They awakened something in him,
something that was always there.

1088
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:27,601
It was waiting.

1089
01:28:27,634 --> 01:28:31,538
Laura, I can help you, okay?

1090
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:35,442
I know what happened to you,
your terrible childhood,

1091
01:28:35,475 --> 01:28:36,743
why you are the way you are

1092
01:28:36,777 --> 01:28:38,612
and why you did
the terrible things you did.

1093
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:39,980
Please, Laura, let me help you.

1094
01:28:40,012 --> 01:28:42,917
I can't.
Paul, I can't.

1095
01:28:42,949 --> 01:28:46,354
I can't let him live like this.

1096
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:48,088
You don't understand.

1097
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:50,858
I can't let him live.
I love him too much.

1098
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:53,360
I love him too much.

1099
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:55,596
Mom, stop.

1100
01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:59,599
I can't.
He's his father's son.

1101
01:28:59,632 --> 01:29:01,702
Put the knife down, Laura.

1102
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,139
- I'm sorry, Paul.
- Don't.

1103
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:06,606
I love you, David.

1104
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,390
Mommy.

1105
01:29:23,423 --> 01:29:24,725
Mommy.

1106
01:29:24,757 --> 01:29:26,961
Mommy, please.

1107
01:29:26,993 --> 01:29:29,630
Wake up.

1108
01:29:29,662 --> 01:29:31,098
Please.

1109
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:34,702
Please.

1110
01:29:36,103 --> 01:29:39,105
Please, Mommy.

1111
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:40,742
Wake up.

1112
01:30:19,212 --> 01:30:21,114
David.

1113
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,786
It's me.

1114
01:30:26,987 --> 01:30:28,722
It's Paul.

1115
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:32,692
Hey.

1116
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:39,900
I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

1117
01:30:44,904 --> 01:30:47,007
I'm here to protect you.

1118
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:51,879
And also...

1119
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:58,019
...to make you better again.

1120
01:31:03,756 --> 01:31:06,726
<i>Code blue, room 305.</i>

1121
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:08,956
I want you to know that no one
can ever know anything

1122
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:12,792
about you or who you are.

1123
01:32:12,826 --> 01:32:15,563
Don't you worry.

1124
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:17,630
I took care of everything.

1125
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:31,277
I want you to know...

1126
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:33,880
that you will never be alone.

1127
01:32:37,884 --> 01:32:41,122
You are never gonna
be alone again.

1128
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,829
And I got...

1129
01:32:50,997 --> 01:32:54,100
...a little surprise for you,
David.

1130
01:32:57,637 --> 01:32:59,873
Someone is here to see you.

1131
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:09,182
Hey.

1132
01:33:10,716 --> 01:33:12,319
It's your father.

1133
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:34,175
Daddy.

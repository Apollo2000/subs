that a person can go

Just 10 minutes ago
me and my brother

79
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,616
sold our horses
and our wagon

80
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:43,098
so as we could purchase
tickets on this here boat

81
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,361
and now we ain't got neither.

82
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,929
Well, perhaps
if you go to the man

83
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,278
and you told him
your troubles

84
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,801
and you give him
back the money.

85
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,499
He would give you
back the wagon.

86
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,284
You think he'll do it?

87
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,633
If he is a good man.

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,592
I think he would
do that, yes.

We find ourselves

We need our horses
and our wagon back

Right from this tree,
I head straight north

five or six weeks
till I come to the flat country.

497

and I make a sharp right,
away from the mountains.

501
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:45,192
Once I get to the desert,
God willing.

502
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:48,238
I just continue straight as piss

503
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,936
till I come to the ocean.

504
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:52,242

505
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,854
keeping the ocean
on my right shoulder

506
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,900
and just hot-tail it
right into San Francisco.

507
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:00,250

508
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,644

Well, o-o-of course,
I know it's that way

635
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:44,959
When they banged
on your head

636
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:47,005
they must have
mushed your brains!

637
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,007
If you're so God damned
worried about time

638
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:51,139
how come you don't ride
on Saturday?

639
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,359
I told you,
it's against my religion

640
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,013
to ride on the Sabbath.

641
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,189
Well, I got me
a new religion, too!

642
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:59,887
And one of the things
you ain't allowed to do is die!

643
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:01,846
Them's real mountains
out there.

644
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,978
and that's a real blizzard
building up!

645
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:06,111
I'm tellin' you
we can't make it!

646
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:09,549
- I can make it.
- Goddamn!

647
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:11,507
I ain't gonna let you
talk me into this.

648
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,031
It's just impossible!

knows that!'

'Every goddamn
trapper knows that!'

651
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:23,955
I know, you don't like it
when I talk that way.

652
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,174
But I'm tellin' ya..

653
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,220
You ain't gonna talk me
into it this time!

654
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:33,355
Am I trying to talk you
into anything?

655
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:39,274
Goodnight!

656
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:42,060
- Have a nice trip.
- Goodnight.

657
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:44,323
And thanks for everything

658
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,716
you did for me.

659

Up until the time

660
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,808
I needed you the most!

661
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:55,813
Don't wake me in the mornin'.

662
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:01,427
I'll try to be as quiet
as possible.

663
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,432
So, what do you
think now, Rabbi?

664
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,042
It's cold.

665
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:14,048
You should see it in winter.

1413
01:38:21,983 --> 01:38:24,028
for Mr. Bender

1414
01:38:24,115 --> 01:38:25,725
if and I got
the right house and all.

1415
01:38:25,812 --> 01:38:27,292
You do.
I'm his daughter.

1416
01:38:27,379 --> 01:38:30,252
Yeah, I know.
Oh, you're the daughter?

1417
01:38:30,339 --> 01:38:31,340
You are the Bender daughter?

1418
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:32,907
Oh.

1419
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:35,474
Howdy.

1420
01:38:35,561 --> 01:38:37,607
Would you care to come in?

1421
01:38:37,694 --> 01:38:39,304
Well, I would like to

1422
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:41,306
but, uh, thanks, no

1423
01:38:41,393 --> 01:38:44,135
because I got a friend
waiting at the saloon.

1424
01:38:44,222 --> 01:38:46,877
And, uh, my other friend,
the rabbi

1425
01:38:46,964 --> 01:38:49,097
asked me to bring
this here to you.

1426
01:38:49,184 --> 01:38:50,794
I mean, bring this
to your father.

1427
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:52,230
What is it?

1428
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:53,710
This thing?
I don't know.

1429
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:55,973
I think
it's some kind of Torah.

1430
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,670
A Torah?

1431
01:38:57,757 --> 01:39:00,456
Yeah, I think
that's what he called it.

1432
01:39:00,543 --> 01:39:02,371
So, where is he?

1433
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:04,373
- Who?
- The rabbi.

1434
01:39:06,114 --> 01:39:08,377
Where is the rabbi?
Oh, where is the rabbi?

1435
01:39:08,464 --> 01:39:09,682
The rabbi.

1436
01:39:09,769 --> 01:39:11,815
Well, I don't rightly know,
ma'am.

1437
01:39:11,902 --> 01:39:15,253
Um, the last time I seen him,
I was busting my britches

1438
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,994
in the cat house.

1439
01:39:17,081 --> 01:39:19,475
And, uh, my friend,
the rabbi, asked me

1440
01:39:19,562 --> 01:39:21,738
if and I should
ever come Frisco way

1441
01:39:21,825 --> 01:39:24,393
would I drop by this house
and do him this favor.

1442
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,656
Oh.

1443
01:39:26,743 --> 01:39:29,833
Anyway, it was nice to, uh

1444
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,530
make your acquaintance, ma'am

1445
01:39:31,617 --> 01:39:34,925
and, uh, I'd, uh..

1446
01:39:38,407 --> 01:39:39,974
Is something wrong?

1447
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,326
No, no, no, no.

1448
01:39:44,413 --> 01:39:45,588
It's just I didn't know

1449
01:39:45,675 --> 01:39:47,894
that your eyes
would be so brown.

1450
01:39:49,287 --> 01:39:51,072
How would you know that?

1451
01:39:54,162 --> 01:39:56,338
How would I know that?

1452
01:39:56,425 --> 01:39:59,210
<font color="#ff8000">[LAUGHS]</font>
How would I know that?
That's right!

1453
01:39:59,297 --> 01:40:02,300
How could I know that?
I couldn't know that.

1454
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:06,696
Well, uh, I'd, uh,
better get going.

1455
01:40:06,783 --> 01:40:08,872
I hate to keep
my sidewinder waiting.

1456
01:40:08,959 --> 01:40:10,830
So, I just give you that

1457
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:13,355
to give to, uh,
to your father.

1458
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:15,400
Oh, look, look, wait.
Wait.

1459
01:40:15,487 --> 01:40:16,706
- Papa!
- No, no, no!

1460
01:40:16,793 --> 01:40:18,229
Don't call the papa!

1461
01:40:18,316 --> 01:40:20,405
I'd really better
get my ass out of here.

1462
01:40:20,492 --> 01:40:23,365
So thanks, and adios
for everything.

1463
01:40:23,452 --> 01:40:24,714
Wait, wait!
Please!

1464
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:26,846
'Papa! Wait!'

1465
01:40:27,717 --> 01:40:29,284
Wait!

1466
01:40:30,459 --> 01:40:31,851

1470
01:40:44,821 --> 01:40:46,301
I don't understand you, man.

1471
01:40:46,388 --> 01:40:49,260
If you don't eat, you're gonna
sure lose your strength.

1472
01:40:49,347 --> 01:40:50,392
This is a good piece of meat.

1473
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:51,871
You oughta have something.

1474
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:53,960
You gotta eat something.
Thank you.

Gracias.

Now, look,
you go up and change.

1477
01:41:00,358 --> 01:41:02,447
And then we'll go together,
and we'll tell your people

1478
01:41:02,534 --> 01:41:04,319
that the new rabbi's arrived.

1479
01:41:04,406 --> 01:41:05,668
Alright?

1480
01:41:08,497 --> 01:41:10,977
I've told you
that I can't be a rabbi.

1481
01:41:12,805 --> 01:41:14,155
Don't you tell me that.

1482
01:41:14,242 --> 01:41:15,373
Just don't say that again.

1483
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:16,505
Not after what
I've been through to get

1484
01:41:16,592 --> 01:41:19,595
your goddamned ass
here alive.

1485
01:41:19,682 --> 01:41:21,901
If you hadn't shot that man,
we'd both be dead.

1486
01:41:21,988 --> 01:41:24,078
Do you understand that,
you ignorant asshole?

1487
01:41:26,471 --> 01:41:28,343
You do understand that?

1488
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:29,909
He was gonna kill you
then he was going to kill me.

1489
01:41:29,996 --> 01:41:31,563
Am I right?

1490
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:32,695
When you shot
that son of a bitch

1491
01:41:32,782 --> 01:41:34,914
that was not a sin.

1492
01:41:36,786 --> 01:41:39,136
Then what the hell
are we talking about?

1493
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:42,444
When those men

1494
01:41:42,531 --> 01:41:45,708
were shooting at you

1495
01:41:45,795 --> 01:41:48,014
I ran to save the Torah.

1496
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:50,278
So?
I understand that.

1497
01:41:50,365 --> 01:41:52,584
You're a man of God.
I understand that.

1498
01:41:52,671 --> 01:41:54,195
I wasn't thinking
about God.

1499
01:41:56,066 --> 01:41:58,112
I didn't do it
because of God.

1500
01:41:58,199 --> 01:42:00,636
I don't know one thing
about God.

1501
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,858
I was thinking about a book.

1502
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:08,296
'I cared more for a book'

1503
01:42:08,383 --> 01:42:09,906
'than I did
for my best friend.'

1504
01:42:12,213 --> 01:42:14,867
I don't know
if you can understand that.

1505
01:42:14,954 --> 01:42:16,434
I don't want to insult you

1506
01:42:16,521 --> 01:42:19,002
'but do you understand
what I mean?'

1507
01:42:20,395 --> 01:42:24,486
I chose a piece of paper
instead of you.

1508
01:42:26,357 --> 01:42:28,533
But I forgive you.

1509
01:42:31,754 --> 01:42:34,235
I know that you do.

1510
01:42:34,322 --> 01:42:35,888
But you're a good man.

1511
01:42:35,975 --> 01:42:38,413
I am a good man.
I am.

1512
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,284
But I'm not a rabbi.

1513
01:42:40,371 --> 01:42:41,503
You don't say that.

1514
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,722
Tommy, I'm not a rabbi.

1515
01:42:43,809 --> 01:42:45,768
Don't say that!

1516
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:53,950
You are a rabbi.

1517
01:42:54,037 --> 01:42:55,908
I'm a bank robber.

1518
01:42:55,995 --> 01:42:57,910
I'm a card player
and a whoremonger.

1519
01:42:57,997 --> 01:42:59,173
That's what I am.

1520
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,914
You are a rabbi.

1521
01:43:02,001 --> 01:43:04,178
You can fall in the mud,
you can slip on your ass

1522
01:43:04,265 --> 01:43:06,267
you can travel
in the wrong direction

1523
01:43:06,354 --> 01:43:08,660
but even on your ass,
even in the mud

1524
01:43:08,747 --> 01:43:10,009
even if you go
the wrong direction

1525
01:43:10,096 --> 01:43:13,317
for a little while,
you're still a rabbi!

1526
01:43:13,404 --> 01:43:14,884
That's what you are!

1527
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:16,581

1528
01:43:19,323 --> 01:43:22,500
'If I'm who I am, how come
you ain't what you are?'

1529
01:43:22,587 --> 01:43:24,023
'You're just too goddamn good'

1530
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:25,503
'to have the same rules.'

1531
01:43:26,504 --> 01:43:28,114
'You answer me.'

1532
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,725
'You look me in the eye
and you answer me.'

1533
01:43:31,422 --> 01:43:33,032
'Don't you dare sit there
and not answer me.'

1534
01:43:34,512 --> 01:43:36,471
'You'd better have
an answer for me.'

Well, what will you have?

1570
01:45:57,263 --> 01:45:58,613
<font color="#ffff80">AVRAM:</font>
Straight whiskey.

1571
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,137
'Whiskey for everybody.'

Rabbi, this is Mrs. Bender.

1574
01:46:16,413 --> 01:46:19,503
Welcome.
Welcome, rabbi.

1575
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:22,680
And this is my younger daughter,
Rosalie.

1576
01:46:24,073 --> 01:46:26,031
I know that
in our marriage agreement

1577
01:46:26,118 --> 01:46:27,946
I mentioned
my other daughter

1578
01:46:28,033 --> 01:46:29,208
Sarah Mindl.

1579
01:46:29,295 --> 01:46:30,471
But what difference
does it make?

1580
01:46:30,558 --> 01:46:31,907
Papa.

1581
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:50,926
You know, your father thinks
that you can just switch

1582
01:46:51,013 --> 01:46:53,581
one promised wife
for another promised wife

1583
01:46:53,668 --> 01:46:56,322
but I know that
it isn't that way in America.

1584
01:46:57,759 --> 01:46:59,717
So, please

1585
01:46:59,804 --> 01:47:03,068
don't feel obligated
in that way.

1586
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:10,728
Wouldn't you like to dance
with me?

1587
01:47:12,817 --> 01:47:14,166
I would.

1588
01:47:14,253 --> 01:47:16,778
I would love to dance with you

1589
01:47:16,865 --> 01:47:21,826
but you know, a rabbi
shouldn't do that.

1590
01:47:24,046 --> 01:47:26,657
A rabbi can dance
with his fiancee, can't he?

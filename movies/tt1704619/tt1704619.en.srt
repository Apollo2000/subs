00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:19,196
"Once upon a time,
there was a little princess,

3
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:23,799
"the most beautiful
little princess in all the land.

4
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:30,336
"Her hair was long and blonde,

5
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,848
"and her eyes were as brown
as the dark waters of the river

6
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,851
"which ran by her castle.

7
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,978
"But the little princess
was unhappy,

8
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:39,578
"for she was lonely.

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,922
"Someday she would find
her kind, handsome prince,

10
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,859
"and he would sweep her up
on a big white horse,

11
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,158
"and he would take her away
and marry her,

12
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,927
and they would live
happily ever after."

13
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:55,469
Hi, I'm Joyce McKinney,
and that's from my pending book,

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,094
<i>A Very Special Love Story.</i>

15
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:09,607
- First of all, were you
surprised to be put in prison?

16
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:11,980
- I really didn't feel
I'd done anything wrong.

17
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:16,021
I still don't feel
I did anything wrong.

18
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:19,023
I would never do anything
to hurt Kirk Anderson

19
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,455
or slander him.

20
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,618
In fact, in my book...

21
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:27,688
my book is handled
in a very tender, nice fashion.

22
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,356
It's not a porno story

23
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,662
like these crazy newspapers
have tried to make it.

24
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:33,464
It's a love story, you know?

25
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,562
And, I mean, I would
never do anything to hurt him

26
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:38,197
or to cause him any harm at all.

27
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:41,300
And the way
that they threw me in prison

28
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,209
and tried to act like
I was some sort of criminal

29
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:47,749
and present this image over
was really what got to me.

30
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,215
My life started out in
a small town in North Carolina.

31
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,316
I was one of these girls
who was gonna meet, you know,

32
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:02,055
an all-American guy
and get married

33
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,652
and have a little
<i>Leave It to Beaver</i> house

34
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:04,924
with a white picket fence

35
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:07,023
and just have
a great little life.

36
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,359
Started dating
very late in life.

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,460
Didn't start dating
till I was, like, 17.

38
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,563
Was in an accelerated program
for kids with high IQs.

39
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,164
<i>- How high was your IQ?</i>

40
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,243
- 168.

41
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,342
I hadn't been
out in the world much

42
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:24,108
till I went to Utah.

43
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,116
You know,
I hadn't been around much.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,111
<i>- But there were a lot of men</i>
<i>attracted to you?</i>

45
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,482
- Well, I guess so.
I don't know.

46
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,317
I'm not that vain
that I would say...

47
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:36,052
but I wasn't looking
for just any guy.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,525
I wanted a special guy.

49
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:41,222
I wanted
a special guy.

50
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,695
And he had to have
certain qualities.

51
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,096
There are plenty
of guys out there,

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,667
but I wanted a special guy.

53
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,802
I met this professor,
and he said,

54
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,735
"Well, I've got these
perfect guys for you,

55
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,534
"and they're just your type,
Joyce.

56
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,131
"They don't smoke,
and they don't drink,

57
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,299
"and they're clean-cut,

58
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,808
"and you're just going
to love them.

59
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,573
And why don't you come over
to my house and meet them?"

60
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:03,248
They were Mormons.

61
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,749
They didn't tell me
what Mormonism was all about.

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,820
He didn't say,
"We're a group that believes

63
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,616
"that Jesus was a polygamist

64
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,281
and was married
to Mary Magdalene."

65
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,949
He didn't say,
"We believe that God lives

66
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,084
on a star named Kolob."

67
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,629
He didn't say,
"We believe that black people

68
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,325
were cursed with
the mark of Cain."

69
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,664
They made me think
they were a church.

70
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,261
They made me think
that they were family-oriented.

71
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:34,174
And so I was drawn to them,
as a young 19-year-old teenager,

72
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,869
like a moth to a flame.

73
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,412
I was just so happy
to go to this place

74
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:40,914
where I thought
that I would have my pick

75
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:43,450
of just all-American friends,

76
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:46,145
people, husband material,
I guess.

77
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,622
I had a Corvette, and I had
a big old English sheepdog

78
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:52,818
that loved to ride
in the Corvette.

79
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:57,886
And I had a good friend.
Her name was Marilyn Clark.

80
00:03:57,998 --> 00:03:59,625
There wasn't anything
Marilyn didn't do:

81
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,702
smoke, drink,
have sex with Hells Angels.

82
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:05,862
I mean, this was a wild child.
We were exact opposites.

83
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:07,803
She used to call me
"Holier-Than-Thou McKinney"

84
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,034
because I was so straight.

85
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,632
We would cruise
the pizza parlor,

86
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,177
and we decided to cruise down
by Frosty's ice cream parlor.

87
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,974
And I noticed
this really handsome guy

88
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:20,244
driving alongside me also
in a Corvette, white Corvette.

89
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,683
And he kind of looks around
at me like he's watching me.

90
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,220
And I thought,
"Whoa, he's cute."

91
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:27,222
And I kept on driving,

92
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:28,620
and Marilyn goes,

93
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,659
"Hey, McKinn,
he's following you."

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,318
And I go, "He is?"

95
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:35,795
So I let him chase me.
He was quite aggressive.

96
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:40,398
And he pulled in beside me
and cleared his throat.

97
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:42,299
Then he goes, "Like your car."

98
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:44,463
I go, "Thanks.
I like yours too."

99
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:46,540
He goes,
"I really like yours better."

100
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:47,903
I go, "Want to drive it?"

101
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,616
When I met my Kirk,

102
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,085
it was like in the movies...

103
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,792
When the girl comes down
the stairs, and their eyes meet.

104
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,862
When Juliet looks at Romeo,
and it's... pkew!

105
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,055
That's how it was.

106
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,800
He had the most beautiful
blue eyes

107
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,926
and the sexiest smile,

108
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,233
and he always had
the cleanest skin.

109
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,976
- Kirk Anderson
was a very big, rather flabby,

110
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:44,184
300-pound, 6'3", not athletic
or attractive-looking man

111
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,122
in the accepted sense
of the word

112
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:48,218
who had a very shuffle-y
kind of walk,

113
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:50,763
the last person in the world
that you'd think would be

114
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:57,166
the object of this kind of
strange sexual passion.

115
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,205
He had known Joyce McKinney
in Salt Lake City,

116
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,297
and she had fallen in love
with him.

117
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:05,570
Fallen in love with him...
become obsessed by him,

118
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:07,872
because that's another thing
about Joyce is obsession.

119
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,073
I mean, she just obsesses
about things.

120
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:11,409
I don't know what
the details

121
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:14,882
of their relationship was
in Salt Lake City,

122
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:19,423
but they obviously had some kind
of romance or love affair,

123
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:22,491
because if one's to believe
Joyce at all,

124
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:26,323
he had promised her
a family and children.

125
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,056
- He actually told me
he loved me

126
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:29,460
the first night I met him

127
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,329
and asked me to marry him
the second night,

128
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,800
and then the next thing I know,
we're naming our kids.

129
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:38,030
And we were gonna name 'em all
with Js and Ks:

130
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,073
J for "Joyce"
and Ks for "Kirk,"

131
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:42,267
Joshua, Jacob.

132
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:43,844
You know, we had the names
picked out.

133
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,434
Kyle, Kirk.

134
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,615
And I remember, he took me home
to meet his Mormon mother,

135
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,584
and she was this big,
oh, huge woman,

136
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:56,211
about 350 pounds
in a tent dress,

137
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:57,414
and she took one look at me

138
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,423
with my little
beauty queen figure,

139
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,254
and her eyes went up,
and her eyes went down,

140
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,418
and she goes, "She doesn't look
like a Mormon to me."

141
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:13,964
From the time
I was a little girl,

142
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,231
I was in pageants.

143
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:19,666
It gave me a chance
to develop myself

144
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:23,473
to be the best person
I could be

145
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,515
with my looks, with my talent,
with my personality.

146
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,246
The pageants gave me,
as a small-town girl,

147
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:36,517
the chance to perform.

148
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:45,626
<i>- So Mom thought</i>
<i>you were too sexy for him?</i>

149
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,964
- I guess she thought
I was too pretty or something.

150
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,834
Kirk and I were just ready
for the big wedding,

151
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,064
and everything was happy.

152
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,401
The only problem is,

153
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,532
I was wanting to get married
in the Christian church,

154
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,975
and he was getting pressure
from the other side,

155
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,410
and so one day,
he vanished into thin air.

156
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:04,572
I don't mean he left me.
I don't mean he abandoned me.

157
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:06,377
I don't mean he left me
for another woman.

158
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,816
I mean he evaporated
into thin air.

159
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,080
He wasn't the kind of person
to just run off like that.

160
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:12,746
His things were still
at my place,

161
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:15,450
and, you know,
it was just weird.

162
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,287
I did what any American girl
would do

163
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:20,089
if her fiancè vanished
into thin air:

164
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,094
I looked for him.

165
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,789
I went to L.A.,

166
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,389
and I worked three jobs
trying to save up enough money

167
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,729
to pay a private investigator

168
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,234
to find out
what happened to him.

169
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,896
The private investigator
found him in England.

170
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:32,063
The Mormons had him.

171
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:35,700
- All young men in the Church,

172
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,572
from the time
that we're young boys,

173
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:41,205
we're indoctrinated
to prepare to go on mission.

174
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:45,012
We sing songs like <i>I Hope</i>
<i>They Call Me On A Mission.</i>

175
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:50,420
- ♪ I hope they call me
on a mission ♪

176
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:54,891
- You leave as a boy.
You come back as a man.

177
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,553
For Kirk, when he reaches
the age of 19,

178
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,256
he doesn't get whisked away
from Joyce.

179
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,627
He's just fulfilling

180
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,701
his religious spiritual
responsibilities.

181
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:13,341
- Joyce knew where he'd gone
and set up this plan

182
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:16,674
with her strange,
unexplained friend Keith May

183
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,340
to come over to the U.K.

184
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:22,713
- I had a really good friend
from Torrance, California.

185
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:23,978
He was an architect,

186
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:26,054
and his name
was Keith Joseph May.

187
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:28,452
Everybody called him "K.J."

188
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,319
K.J. was like my big brother,
and he said to me,

189
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,689
"I don't want you going over
there to England by yourself."

190
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:34,659
Said, "You don't know what
they're gonna do to ya."

191
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,355
All I knew
is this powerful group

192
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:41,161
had done something
to the man I loved.

193
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,860
We got two bodyguards
to go with us.

194
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,903
One was a big guy that was...

195
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,495
what do you call...
a body-builder guy.

196
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,005
And the other was a pilot.

197
00:09:51,544 --> 00:09:52,909
- I was interested in something

198
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:56,640
a little bit more exciting
than what I was doing.

199
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:58,306
I saw an ad in the newspaper.

200
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,613
They wanted a pilot to fly
short trips in England,

201
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,186
and it sounded kind
of interesting to me.

202
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:06,779
So I called the phone number,
and a gentleman answered,

203
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,381
and an appointment was made
for the following week.

204
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,016
I was expecting to go
to an office

205
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,389
or something like that,

206
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,520
but it turned out to be
an apartment building.

207
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,765
I was taken in by a gentleman
by the name of Keith.

208
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,963
And after I was there
for a few minutes,

209
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:25,266
why, Joyce came out.

210
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,307
<i>- Tell me about</i>
<i>that first meeting.</i>

211
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,400
- Well, I was
favorably impressed.

212
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,945
She had a totally
see-through blouse on.

213
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:34,309
I can even remember the color.

214
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:37,440
It was a light brown,
totally see-through blouse.

215
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,608
<i>- No bra?</i>

216
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:40,845
- No bra,
see-through blouse.

217
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:49,616
She was very, very easy
to talk to.

218
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,424
At one point, she came over
and sat down next to me.

219
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,761
I was trying to perceive
what type of relationship

220
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,859
existed between Keith and her
at that point.

221
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,767
Perhaps maybe down the line,

222
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:03,305
I might want to ask this girl
out for dinner or something.

223
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:07,008
Joyce had a trunk
that she brought out,

224
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,011
and in it were folders,
pictures, tablets,

225
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:14,446
letters from a private
investigator in England.

226
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,748
She then unraveled a story to me
that was just unreal.

227
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,384
Joyce had hired bodyguards,
she told me, from Gold's Gym.

228
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:27,552
She was gonna put 'em up

229
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:30,994
while they were there
in England,

230
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:35,831
and they were going to liberate
her fiancè from this cult group.

231
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,368
In the back of my mind,

232
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,734
I was trying to figure out how
she could have all this money

233
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,329
to take all these people
to England.

234
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,807
She told me she was a model.

235
00:11:46,912 --> 00:11:49,642
I didn't realize models
made that kind of money.

236
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:55,613
- We actually hired some guys
to go with us from Los Angeles

237
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,653
in case we were attacked
or anything.

238
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:59,188
I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

239
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,383
I didn't know what
I was gonna be walking into.

240
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:05,154
I didn't know if they would
release him willingly or what.

241
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,229
I didn't know if they would
do something to hurt me.

242
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,524
I didn't know.

243
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,190
- Joyce called me
and wanted to know

244
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,498
if I would fly her someplace in
an airplane locally for dinner.

245
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,037
That sounded pretty good.

246
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,606
I thought it might possibly be
an overnight trip or something,

247
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,698
and I was more than up for that.

248
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,972
But when Joyce showed up,
much to my surprise,

249
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,979
Keith was with her.

250
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:30,208
I felt this was a time
that I could try to make

251
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,512
a determination
on how real she was

252
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,382
and her financial ability.

253
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,684
So I did rent the most expensive
airplane that was possible,

254
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,227
single-engine,
a Beechcraft A36 Bonanza.

255
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,055
When you rent an airplane
like that,

256
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,757
you have to give 'em
a credit card,

257
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:51,232
and they lock in the approximate
amount it was gonna be.

258
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:52,735
Joyce didn't have a credit card.

259
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,497
But she did bring out
an envelope

260
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,300
filled with
hundred-dollar bills.

261
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,906
That brought me
a little bit closer to realizing

262
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:07,847
maybe she has the money to do
what she wants to do.

263
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,440
So we flew down to San Diego.

264
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,109
We had dinner,
and we flew back.

265
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,379
<i>- Didn't stay the night.</i>

266
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,920
- No.
No.

267
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:16,650
Keith was with her, and so...

268
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,658
that was three people there.

269
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,886
That's not for me.

270
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,167
<i>- I take it that you</i>
<i>were attracted to Joyce.</i>

271
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,200
- Yes.

272
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:32,362
She was in her late 20s,
had an outstanding figure,

273
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:36,407
had a Southern accent,
long blonde hair.

274
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,979
Any heterosexual male
would be attracted to Joyce.

275
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,444
Prior to our departure from
the United States to England,

276
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,485
they wanted me
to meet the bodyguard.

277
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,680
His name was Gil.

278
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,086
Gil would come to their place.

279
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:54,451
I would come to their place,

280
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,424
then we would go down
to the beach.

281
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:00,655
Then they told me the beach they
were going to was a nude beach.

282
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:03,095
Well, I've never been
to a nude beach,

283
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,258
so that really slowed me down
a little bit.

284
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:08,199
Joyce spread out a blanket

285
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:11,294
and proceeded to take off
all her clothes.

286
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:12,771
Totally.

287
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:17,201
Very quickly,
three to four guys showed up

288
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,335
around the blanket
and started taking pictures.

289
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,346
I don't know
where they came from.

290
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,473
Joyce protested,
tried to stop them.

291
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,016
She claimed
that she was a model,

292
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,177
and she didn't want photographs
taken of her.

293
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,878
After about 15 minutes,

294
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,650
Joyce put on her clothes,
and we left the beach.

295
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:35,853
And so we met at Los Angeles
International Airport.

296
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,451
Keith May was there,
Joyce McKinney,

297
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:40,258
Gil Parker, and myself.

298
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,100
First off, Gil Parker
had a problem

299
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:50,571
when he went through customs.

300
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,539
They asked him
what his occupation was,

301
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,200
and he told 'em
he was a bodyguard.

302
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,607
And they said, "For who?"

303
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,839
And they said,
"For Joyce and Keith."

304
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,177
Well, that put up a red flag,
evidently, in customs,

305
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:01,443
and they pulled him out.

306
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,575
Well, that scared Gil
right there.

307
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:08,179
Then, on the second day, we were
in a motel room together,

308
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,156
and Joyce had a lot of baggage.

309
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,624
I'd never seen anybody travel
with so many bags.

310
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:15,696
And they took out
wireless microphone

311
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:16,990
and listening devices.

312
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,395
Surprised me.

313
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,261
I wasn't sure what they
were going to use it for.

314
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:21,731
It was something you
could probably

315
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,200
just have carried
through customs,

316
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:26,136
but they had it inside
of a portable radio.

317
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,934
Well, when Gil seen this,
that about did it for him.

318
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,531
That was when
he called me outside

319
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,405
and said he wanted to go back
the next day.

320
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,309
The private investigator
had told Joyce

321
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,849
two or three different places
where Kirk was at,

322
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:42,476
and Keith was gonna go
into some of these places

323
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:45,077
where this cult group
was supposed to be,

324
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:46,416
ask questions,

325
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:49,617
and it would be transmitted out
to Joyce in the car...

326
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:51,023
wirelessly.

327
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,499
Keith May and I, we wanted to
go out a little bit on our own,

328
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:04,402
but Joyce was keeping us
so busy, we couldn't,

329
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,473
so one day, she...

330
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:06,665
<i>- Keeping you so busy?</i>

331
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,072
- Yeah, driving places,

332
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,666
checking out places,
walking places.

333
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:13,440
She had this wig,
this wig she called "Matilda."

334
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,139
And she'd wear this strange wig

335
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,945
when we'd go out driving
sometime and sunglasses.

336
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,109
And any time we'd go down near
one of these churches

337
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,846
where they were trying
to find out

338
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:24,184
if Kirk was gonna be
at that church

339
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,951
or if that was one
he frequented,

340
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:28,184
she'd have that wig on.

341
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:32,093
We were across,
in front of a building.

342
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:35,791
Out come two young men
dressed in suits,

343
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,891
a tie, and a white shirt.

344
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:40,163
And she told me,
"There is Kirk."

345
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,932
Well, I was totally surprised.

346
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,098
This was nobody
being held captive.

347
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,300
And that's when Joyce
kind of leveled with me.

348
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,742
She showed me a bottle
of chloroform,

349
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:54,248
and I'd already seen
this phony gun they had.

350
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:56,715
I was going to be no part
of any of this,

351
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,446
and I told her that.

352
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:07,020
- So she arrives
with Keith May, lurks around,

353
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:11,120
waits around outside
the temple of whatever it was,

354
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,358
Latter-Day Saints
of something or other,

355
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,299
waited for this huge,
shuffling figure to come out

356
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,802
with his short Mormon haircut

357
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:23,341
and pointed a gun at him
and said, "Get into the car."

358
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,966
- In the final analysis,

359
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,170
the one way they were able
to make contact with Kirk...

360
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,644
Keith called him and told him

361
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,977
he wanted to convert
to the Mormon religion,

362
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,415
and they thought they had
a new convert.

363
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,247
Now, I'm not sure
this is the exact scenario,

364
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,253
but at that point,
Keith used the gun

365
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,549
to get him out to the car.

366
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:45,192
<i>- So you drive up</i>
<i>in your rental car with K. J.</i>

367
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,524
- I waited, and K.J. went in,

368
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,996
because they're not supposed to
be in the room alone with girls.

369
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,158
So K.J. went in and said,
"Joyce is in the car."

370
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,565
And Kirk turned around,

371
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,534
and he threw the keys
to his companion and said,

372
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,435
"I've got to go out
in the car and get something.

373
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,235
I'll be right back."

374
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:03,537
<i>- So he goes out with K.J.?</i>

375
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:05,544
- Yeah, and didn't come back,

376
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:08,137
and his poor old dumb companion
is sitting there

377
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,773
staring like
he's catching flies,

378
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,011
looking out the window,
waiting for him to come back.

379
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:18,253
He got in the car, and he goes,

380
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:19,790
"How long have you been
in England?"

381
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,154
Like a robot.

382
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,921
He was almost speaking
in a monotone voice,

383
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:25,861
and he'd go, "They said
you didn't love me anymore."

384
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:28,431
It was like he had
a personality alteration,

385
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:32,263
Kirk Number 1
and Kirk Number 2.

386
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,827
Kirk Number 1 was the man
I fell in love with.

387
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,373
Kirk Number 2 was Cult Kirk.

388
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,576
- According to all the reports
at the time,

389
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:52,245
he was driven 250 miles
to a cottage in Devon.

390
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:56,153
She had a suitcase full
of all the equipment required,

391
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:57,417
including, I gather,

392
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:01,620
some Los Angeles
Police Department

393
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:05,630
Smith & Wesson handcuffs.

394
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:10,498
And he was taken in
and chained to...

395
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:12,901
Joyce claims it was ropes,
not chains,

396
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:14,438
but chains sounds better.

397
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,566
Anyway, he was allegedly
chained to a bed,

398
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,200
first by his ankle

399
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,404
so that he could actually
reach the toilet.

400
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:24,175
The chain was long enough
for him to get to the toilet.

401
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:26,113
Subsequently, with the help
of Keith May,

402
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:27,376
was spread-eagled...

403
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,473
spread-eagled...

404
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,213
which is this wonderful
bondage word...

405
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:33,654
was spread-eagled to the bed,

406
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:38,659
and Keith May discreetly left
the room at this point, I think,

407
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,661
closed the door behind him,

408
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,231
and Joyce had sex with him.

409
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,494
And she said to him

410
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:49,627
she was going to go on
having sex with him

411
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,706
until she found
she had missed a period

412
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:56,174
and would then hopefully
be pregnant by him.

413
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,677
<i>- She wanted to be inseminated?</i>

414
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,076
- Yes, I think that's
the polite word for it.

415
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:07,649
- Kirk and I went to
this cottage down in England.

416
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:10,551
Well, I think they called it
the Devon area down there.

417
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,681
Real Franco Zeffirelli.

418
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,225
You know, like <i>Brother Sun,</i>
<i>Sister Moon</i> type shots.

419
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,852
If you saw that film,
that's what it looked like.

420
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:20,863
- Clare!

421
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:23,433
You shouldn't have come,
but I knew you would.

422
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:24,626
I knew.

423
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:25,930
- I have to tell you,

424
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,129
and I don't care
if the whole world knows it.

425
00:20:28,238 --> 00:20:31,935
From now on, I'm not asking
to be loved.

426
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,669
I want to love!

427
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,218
- Okay, if you can get
that vision

428
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,913
set in your head,
Mr. Filmmaker.

429
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:48,751
<i>- How'd you find this place?</i>

430
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:51,485
- Well, I was looking
for someplace peaceful

431
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:53,082
where he could normalize,

432
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:59,462
someplace where he could
come back to Kirk Number 1.

433
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:04,468
I had a big fireplace,
patchwork quilt, silk sheets...

434
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,970
blue to match his eyes,
with his initials on it...

435
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:11,202
cinnamon oil back rub,
'cause he loved my back rubs,

436
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,301
and all his favorite foods
in the fridge.

437
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:19,843
<i>- What were his favorite foods</i>
<i>in the fridge?</i>

438
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,647
- Oh, I had chocolate cake
and Southern-fried chicken.

439
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:24,914
He loved my chicken.

440
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,284
Mashed potatoes.

441
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:30,453
I made everything
that he wanted.

442
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,052
I was like his little,
you know, wifey almost.

443
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:36,759
We were slow-dancing.

444
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:39,425
He got turned on
as we were dancing.

445
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,696
I'll be blunt.
He had an erection, okay?

446
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:44,795
And we sat down on the bed,
and he said,

447
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,203
"Can you give me a back rub?"

448
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:48,605
And I got the cinnamon oil,
which I had warmed,

449
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:49,801
and I was giving him a back rub.

450
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:51,742
And he had these
ugly garments on, and I said,

451
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,437
"How am I supposed
to give you a back rub

452
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,515
with this Mormon thing on?"

453
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:56,980
And I ripped
the ugly things off,

454
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,381
because they smelled, you know,

455
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,009
and they had those
occultic symbols,

456
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,883
and I didn't want
anything ugly there

457
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,319
in our beautiful moment.

458
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,948
You know, it was like
a honeymoon cottage.

459
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,686
And we burned 'em.
We actually burned 'em.

460
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,853
<i>- You ripped off</i>
<i>his magic underwear</i>

461
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,157
<i>and burned it?</i>

462
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,492
- And I threw 'em
in the fireplace

463
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,066
where they belonged!

464
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,566
Where they should put 'em all,
as far as I'm concerned.

465
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,830
- There's folk stories galore,

466
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:26,137
legends of the temple garment
protecting people from harm.

467
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,972
The hooks, the psychic hooks
of the temple

468
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,106
are so... pried in so deep
that even people

469
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:39,415
who don't go to church anymore
still wear them,

470
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:41,079
because in the back
of their mind, like...

471
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,816
"What if I don't wear them,
and then Satan's got me?"

472
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:48,183
- Kirk was impotent.

473
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:53,755
He was sexually impotent
because of this brainwashing.

474
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:56,929
He's not supposed
to have sexual feelings.

475
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,027
He's not supposed
to have emotional feelings.

476
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:03,234
He's not supposed
to fall in love.

477
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:05,310
And we were in love.

478
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,073
He loved me, and I loved him.

479
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,307
I knew there was only one way
to get Kirk out of Mormonism,

480
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:14,111
and that was to make love
with him,

481
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,412
because for a Mormon missionary

482
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,283
to have a love affair
is totally taboo.

483
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:19,412
They can't be in a room
alone with a girl

484
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,788
without their companion
with them to even shake hands.

485
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:25,259
So if it took giving up
my virginity

486
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,829
in a romantic moonlit cottage,
so be it.

487
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,865
I just wanted him
out of that cult.

488
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,264
We started to make love,
and all of a sudden,

489
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,359
he jumps up on the bed
like this, and he goes,

490
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,165
"By the law of the holy prophet
Joseph Smith,

491
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:39,206
"I cannot not touch my bodies
or the bodies of others

492
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:40,672
"in an unnatural,
experimental way!

493
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:41,969
By the law
of the holy prophet..."

494
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,406
Hold a Book of Mormon
firmly in hand.

495
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,444
Sing a Mormon song.
Sing a Mormon song.

496
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:48,242
Because he's turned on,
and he's not supposed to be.

497
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:49,713
And I go, "Ha."

498
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,079
I'd come across
an ocean to find him,

499
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,085
and the Mormons
are in our bedroom?

500
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:58,681
- That moment, when his garments
are coming off,

501
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,849
that could have been
a moment that triggered him,

502
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:01,891
like, "Oh, my gosh."

503
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,722
"Oh, my heck,"
as they say in Utah.

504
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:06,797
"I'm doing something wrong."

505
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,325
- I went back in the kitchen,

506
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:11,094
and I got myself
a real cold glass of water.

507
00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:12,464
<i>- Does he still have</i>
<i>the erection</i>

508
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,628
<i>while he's chanting?</i>

509
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:15,432
- Well, I came back...
to be continued...

510
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,029
I came back in there,
and I'm thinking,

511
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:18,300
"Am I doing something wrong?"

512
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:21,741
He started to cry.
He had ejaculated, I guess.

513
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:24,813
He said, "Please don't tell 'em
about the filthy place,

514
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,380
what happened
at the filthy place."

515
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,346
And I said,
"Honey, what's wrong?"

516
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,611
He goes, "They'll know."

517
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,279
I mean, every guy on the planet
masturbates and has wet dreams.

518
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,651
And I ask him, I said, "Honey,
don't you have those dreams

519
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:37,417
guys have
or whatever they're called?"

520
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:41,017
He goes, "Yeah, but I didn't
tell 'em in the interview."

521
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:42,186
I go, "What interview?

522
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:43,887
They talk to you
about this stuff?"

523
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:45,794
He goes, "Yeah, once a week.

524
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:47,491
"They take us in rooms
by ourselves,

525
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:50,695
and they say, 'M1, M2, M3?
M1, M2, M3?"'

526
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:51,827
I go, "What's that?"

527
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,529
"Masturbation once,
masturbation twice,

528
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:54,628
"masturbation three times.

529
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,707
"So many times, you're out.

530
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,775
"You're Xed.
You're home.

531
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:57,933
"You're off your mission.

532
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:59,408
You can't get married
in the temple."

533
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,274
I go, "Kirk, these people
are controlling your sex drive.

534
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,871
"They're controlling your mind.
They're controlling your food.

535
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:07,213
You can't have coffee,
tea, or Pepsi-Cola."

536
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,977
There was
a Christian marriage manual,

537
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:15,184
which I bought, which
explained sex to young virgins.

538
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:17,953
There was a section in there
on sexual impotence.

539
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,254
Im-po-tence.

540
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:21,489
l-M-P-O-T-E-N-C-E.

541
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:26,158
And it said sometimes if a guy
was very repressed sexually,

542
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:28,099
which poor Kirk was,
Lord knows,

543
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:30,797
that you could
tie the person up,

544
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,897
and they could say,
"Ah, I'll let go."

545
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,169
You know, "I can finally let go
and make love."

546
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:38,939
And so I went, and I read
that section really quick,

547
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:40,343
speed-read it.

548
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:41,880
And I come back and I said,

549
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:43,972
"Honey, we're going to try
some of these exercises."

550
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,141
And so we did.

551
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:50,388
We made love, actually,
for three days.

552
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,016
We sort of, like,
didn't get out of bed.

553
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,651
It was the honeymoon,
was what it was for me.

554
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:01,396
I wanted us
to have a good sex life.

555
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:02,932
I wanted to be a good wife
to Kirk,

556
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:05,867
and I wanted to give him
lots of babies in my tummy.

557
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,995
I didn't look at sex
as a bad thing with him.

558
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,629
I looked at it as
a melting of two souls,

559
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,504
because when he kissed me,

560
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,374
it was like we melted
into one person.

561
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:23,179
It was like I didn't know
where I stopped and he began.

562
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:24,718
We were lying there,
holding hands,

563
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,788
and his little missionary
glasses were kind of askew.

564
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,119
And he goes, "Guess
we're married in God's eyes."

565
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,691
I go, "Yup, we are."

566
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,624
He says, "Guess we better
make it official."

567
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:36,127
He said, "Let's go into London,
and let's get married."

568
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,192
We took the rental car,
and we went into town,

569
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,599
to London,
and we saw Trafalgar Square.

570
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,569
They had, like, pigeons.
We fed the pigeons.

571
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:47,934
And so I said, "Oh, Kirk.

572
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,837
"We've got this cool cafe
we want to take you to.

573
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,375
It's called the Hard Rock Cafe."

574
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,377
And there were cops
running around everywhere.

575
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,174
What do they call 'em,
bobbies or whatever?

576
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,543
British cops.

577
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,481
If Kirk felt kidnapped
at any time, he could have said,

578
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:03,519
"Hey, this little pint-sized
girl here has me kidnapped.

579
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,144
Can you please help me,
'occifer'?"

580
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,223
But he didn't.

581
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:09,314
Kirk says, "Well, I'm gonna go
over across the street

582
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:10,585
and get a newspaper."

583
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:15,687
So he went over, by himself,
got a newspaper,

584
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:17,321
came back to the table,

585
00:27:17,432 --> 00:27:19,866
slammed that newspaper down
on the table.

586
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:21,629
He's white as a ghost.

587
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:24,399
And we said, "What's wrong?"

588
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:30,734
It was so shocking.

589
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:33,370
It sounded like Scotland Yard
was after us or something.

590
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:35,971
And I'm sitting there
with my "kidnap victim"

591
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,141
eating a burger
with a hundred people

592
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,650
in a crowded tourist restaurant.

593
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:41,186
Kirk says,
"Well, maybe if I call 'em

594
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,413
and let them know
I'm alive and okay."

595
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:45,285
He says, "Oh, they're
gonna ask me about sex.

596
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,586
"Oh, they're gonna ask me
about sex.

597
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:51,356
What am I gonna say?
They're gonna ask me about sex."

598
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,929
I says,
"Can't you just tell them?"

599
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,931
"Oh, no, I can't!
Can't tell 'em we had sex!

600
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:58,866
Oh, they'll excommunicate me.
Oh, my mother will be so mad."

601
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,631
We called his mother.
We called my dad.

602
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:03,831
We called from the phone booth
at Trafalgar Square.

603
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,840
Kirk said to my dad,
"Mr. McKinney,

604
00:28:09,945 --> 00:28:11,776
I love your daughter,
and I'm gonna marry her."

605
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,781
And my dad said,
"Welcome to the family, son."

606
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:16,311
When we called his mother,

607
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:18,249
I could hear her screeching
across the Atlantic.

608
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:20,082
"Oh, you've ruined
your eternal progression!

609
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,416
"Don't you know
what you've done?

610
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:22,888
"How could you get involved
with that girl?

611
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,356
You've not had sex with her,
have you?"

612
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:27,557
The mission president was,
"Yadda, yadda, yadda.

613
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,253
Oh, you've been kidnapped,"
and da, da, da.

614
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:31,058
And Kirk could hardly
get a word in edgewise.

615
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:33,395
He'd say, "But I'm really okay,
President Eyre."

616
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,398
"When the news media...

617
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:38,368
Kirk hung up, and he goes,

618
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:40,871
"You know, they've got
Scotland Yard and the FBI.

619
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:42,963
"How about if I just go back in,
and you guys stay here,

620
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:45,338
"so they can't do nothing like
arrest you guys or anything,

621
00:28:45,444 --> 00:28:47,969
and I go back in
and show 'em I'm okay."

622
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,809
And I'll never forget that day.
It was a real Kodak moment.

623
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,281
Victoria Station in those days

624
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:54,874
had a beautiful
old-fashioned train

625
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:56,316
that pulled out
with one of those...

626
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:04,386
And the last thing I remember
of Kirk Number 1 is,

627
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:05,586
he got on the train,

628
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,561
and he mouthed the words,
"I love you."

629
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,064
And I go,
"I love you too, baby."

630
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:16,502
- If Kirk went away
with Joyce willingly...

631
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,801
and had sex with her...

632
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:25,902
the guilt that would come over
him so strongly after the fact

633
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:28,276
could be overwhelming.

634
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:31,907
- K.J. and I turned
and walked away,

635
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:33,212
and he goes, "Don't worry.

636
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,184
"He'll be okay.
He loves you.

637
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:37,187
You got the man you love.
What you worried about?"

638
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,757
I says, "I don't know, K.J.
Some nagging feeling.

639
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,190
I'm worried."

640
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:44,989
So we went back to the cottage,
and we packed everything up.

641
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:46,654
I remember
I had my wedding dress,

642
00:29:46,764 --> 00:29:50,928
a pretty white dress
I was gonna use for our wedding.

643
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:52,399
Put flowers in my hair.

644
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:57,702
Also, our wedding bands
with our names engraved inside.

645
00:29:57,808 --> 00:29:59,469
It said, "Joyce and Kirk.

646
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:04,740
He lift thee, and thee lift me,
and we will ascend together."

647
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,881
Even after we grew old
and died,

648
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:12,442
we would rise into the heavens
together as man and wife.

649
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:26,094
- This bizarre story
began here last Wednesday.

650
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,292
Kirk Anderson,
a young Mormon missionary

651
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:31,234
was talking outside to a man
with a Canadian accent.

652
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:32,895
He then disappeared.

653
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,495
But early today,
he phoned police

654
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:35,766
and told them he was kidnapped.

655
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:37,569
A blanket had been placed
over his head.

656
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:39,166
He'd been driven to a house

657
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,338
where he'd been blindfolded
and his legs shackled.

658
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,741
- When I got back
to my apartment in Long Beach,

659
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:49,251
the landlady called me in

660
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:51,843
and said the Long Beach Homicide
Department had been there,

661
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:54,856
and they wanted me to come down
to the police station.

662
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,392
And that really freaked me out.

663
00:30:57,494 --> 00:30:59,257
Why the Homicide Department,
I don't know.

664
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:01,587
I told them everything.

665
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,927
Then we went down,
had a cup of coffee.

666
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:06,297
Then they asked me to come back
and tell 'em again,

667
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:07,733
the same story.

668
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:09,962
They had tape recorded
the first time I said it,

669
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:11,299
and they wanted to make sure

670
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,135
that when I told it
a second time,

671
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:15,732
it was exactly the same story,
which it was.

672
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:17,605
I told 'em the truth.

673
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,043
They got kind of a big kick
out of it,

674
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,138
considering
they hadn't found him yet,

675
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:23,307
about the whole story.

676
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:24,748
<i>- The Manacled Mormon.</i>

677
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,818
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what it boiled down to.

678
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:31,182
- I was a Mormon missionary
in Exeter, okay?

679
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,382
This is in Devon.

680
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:36,688
And I was at
a church member's house,

681
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,126
and they were a younger couple.

682
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,995
And they sort of sat down
and told us the whole story

683
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,499
of Joyce McKinney
and the Manacled Mormon.

684
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,197
It reminds me
of those cultures

685
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:51,171
that have stories
of the <i>vagina dentata,</i>

686
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:54,505
the women
with the toothed vagina.

687
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:58,172
They become cautionary tales
about sexual impropriety,

688
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:03,013
the dangerous powers of women,

689
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:07,350
women that can seduce
a young missionary

690
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:09,582
who are on God's errand.

691
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:11,717
Young men, once they receive

692
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:13,555
what's called
the Melchizedek priesthood,

693
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,891
they are endowed with power
from on high.

694
00:32:15,997 --> 00:32:18,692
They go through... we go through...
I went through

695
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,700
an elaborate "endowment"
through the Mormon Temples

696
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:25,929
where we received
sacred underwear

697
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:29,735
and sacred knowledge
of keys to heaven.

698
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:31,969
You reenact
the Garden of Eden scenario,

699
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:34,408
and there's an actor
that performs Lucifer.

700
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:37,504
And he says in a menacing tone,

701
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,810
"Those of you
who don't live up

702
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,817
"to the covenants that you make

703
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,546
"on the altar of the temple
this day

704
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:47,123
will be in my power."

705
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:53,084
And one of the covenants that
you make is the law of chastity,

706
00:32:53,195 --> 00:32:55,129
that you will only have
sexual relationships

707
00:32:55,231 --> 00:33:00,668
with he or she to whom you are
legally and lawfully wedded.

708
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:12,175
<i>- "Manacled Mormon Sex Slave"</i>
wrecks that, doesn't it?

709
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,541
- Completely wrecks that.

710
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:18,982
If Kirk Anderson was
a willing Manacled Mormon,

711
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:24,523
he will have violated
his temple covenants,

712
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:28,286
violated the law of chastity.

713
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:31,226
What he risks is excommunication
from the church,

714
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:34,058
and greater than that,

715
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:39,364
unless he repents,
he won't be able to, ultimately,

716
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,428
become a god
and have his own planet.

717
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:46,341
That is Mormon theology.

718
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,138
That's what
they're working towards.

719
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:56,913
- I got this weird phone call.
I had an answering service.

720
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,680
It said,
"It's been really crazy here,

721
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,186
"but I finally got 'em
off my back.

722
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,950
"I still love you.

723
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,422
"Call me.
Urgent.

724
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:07,426
Epsom 25724.
Urgent."

725
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,759
So I called the number,
and some Mormon answered.

726
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,767
"Who is this?
What do ya want?"

727
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,768
Very suspicious voice.

728
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,202
And I said,
"I want to talk to Kirk...

729
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,796
I mean Elder Anderson."

730
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:26,309
So I said, "This is
Sister... Helmsley calling

731
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:30,108
regarding the baptism
for my daughter Millie."

732
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:35,049
Millie was my sheepdog,
and I knew Kirk would know that.

733
00:34:35,152 --> 00:34:36,915
And I said, "Honey,
where do you want to meet?"

734
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,317
He says, "About 2:00."

735
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:40,447
I said, "Don't say where it is
over the phone."

736
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:41,581
He goes, "Okay."

737
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,215
I was worried about
an extension phone.

738
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:45,726
It went further than that.
It was a phone tap.

739
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:53,568
On my way to meet him,
I remember me and K.J.

740
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:55,135
were going along the motorway,

741
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:58,604
and I'm singing, "I'm getting
married in the morning!"

742
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,503
And I'm so happy.
I'm so...

743
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:02,769
I was just like a young bride
on her honeymoon.

744
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:04,845
I was just so full
of so much love for him.

745
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:08,447
These cop cars
ran us off the road.

746
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:10,675
They just literally edged us
off the road.

747
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:13,412
And then when they threw us up
against the police car and said,

748
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,681
"You're under arrest
for false imprisonment

749
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,380
and carrying away
Kirk Anderson,"

750
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:18,615
I couldn't believe it.

751
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:19,918
It was just, like, shock.

752
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:30,598
- The law was required
to take seriously an act

753
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:34,136
involving a woman with a gun,
pointing it at a priest.

754
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:37,035
Forcing him... although
this was a sort of fantasy...

755
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,903
forcing him into a car

756
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:41,569
and spread-eagling him to a bed
and having sex with him.

757
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:44,669
I mean, there are
so many crimes, possible crimes,

758
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,441
involved in all of that,

759
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,040
and yet someone...
everyone suspected

760
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:51,141
there wasn't really
a crime here at all.

761
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:54,153
- Scenario number one
is Kirk's story:

762
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:58,089
fake gun, chloroform, kidnapped,
tied up, forced to have sex.

763
00:35:58,193 --> 00:36:00,854
The second version
is Joyce's story.

764
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,225
They were gonna be married.
They were gonna have children.

765
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,662
He needed to escape
from the Mormon Church.

766
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:07,824
She goes to rescue him.

767
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,663
They rush away

768
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,294
and have this magical,
wonderful night...

769
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:13,497
weekend together.

770
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:14,868
And then they get him.

771
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:16,998
They brainwash him,
and all of a sudden,

772
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,042
he's claiming rape.

773
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:23,410
The third scenario
is something in between.

774
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:27,780
There was a consensual aspect
to his getaway with her.

775
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,877
But then somewhere
along the line,

776
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,956
he had second thoughts.

777
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:38,016
And he wanted it to stop,
and it didn't.

778
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:39,651
<i>- Do you think a woman</i>
<i>can rape a man?</i>

779
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,389
- No, I think
that's like putting

780
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,054
a marshmallow
in a parking meter.

781
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:45,292
I don't... a guy either wants
to have sex, or he doesn't.

782
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,833
He has an erection,
or he doesn't.

783
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:52,895
- She spent about three months
in Holloway Prison,

784
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:56,773
the famous women's prison
in London.

785
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:59,641
- There was
a little sliding door

786
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:02,579
that they would slide open with
just a little slit of light.

787
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:05,276
And they would slide it open
maybe once a day and say,

788
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:06,818
"Are you ready to sign
a confession?"

789
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,887
I kept screaming,
"Please get Kirk!

790
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:10,319
Please get Kirk!"

791
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:13,152
I beat my fists bloody
on this cold, steel prison door

792
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:17,490
screaming,
"Please, somebody get Kirk!"

793
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:22,862
- There was a picture of her
in all the papers

794
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:25,696
looking out of the back
of a police van.

795
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:33,367
She had scrawled
on a piece of paper,

796
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:36,741
which she was holding up
to press,

797
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:40,509
"Kirk was cooperative
all along."

798
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,152
- When I went
to the prison library,

799
00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:48,586
I got a Bible,
and in the back of the Bible,

800
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,249
there was two white pages
of blank paper,

801
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,521
almost like God put it there.

802
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:57,688
I wrote two letters on those
two blank pages out of my Bible:

803
00:37:57,798 --> 00:38:00,732
one to my parents,
and one to the press.

804
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,027
I put them up inside...

805
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,295
I hate to sound gross,

806
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:07,134
but I put one in my vagina
and one in my rectum.

807
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,207
I got out in the prison van,
in the Black Mama,

808
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:10,536
and I pushed 'em out.

809
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:13,167
I grunted them out, and I popped
them out the window.

810
00:38:13,278 --> 00:38:15,212
And this man saw them, and I go,

811
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:16,507
" Pick it up.

812
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:18,343
Pick it up."

813
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:19,939
And he goes like...
"Pick it up.

814
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:21,814
Mail it.
Mail it."

815
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,409
You know, I was trying
to motion to him,

816
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,647
'cause I knew he couldn't
hear me inside the prison van,

817
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:27,347
to mail it at the post office.

818
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:28,947
And he goes...

819
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,186
"Please, please,
please mail it."

820
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:35,024
And so he mailed it,

821
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,428
and of course, the next time
I go back for my bail hearing,

822
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:38,864
the whole planet was there.

823
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:01,116
I asked my lawyer.

824
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,120
I said, "Look, if you
can't talk, would you let me?

825
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:04,484
"'Cause I can sure talk.

826
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,114
Let me tell people
what happened."

827
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:08,021
So I got up there,
and I had 'em laughing.

828
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,491
I had 'em crying.

829
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:12,893
I had 'em throwing spitballs
at the Mormons, you know?

830
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:15,466
Thank God for all those years
of drama school.

831
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,397
Thank you!

832
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:20,959
- Everyone was just mesmerized
by her performance.

833
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:24,234
I mean, there was no sense
of fear or shame or anything.

834
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:27,400
She just took on the court
with great confidence,

835
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,444
and she said,
"I loved him so much,

836
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:32,378
"I would have skied down
Mount Everest nude

837
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:35,541
with a carnation up my nose
for the love of that man."

838
00:39:45,893 --> 00:39:47,190
- There was standing room only.

839
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:49,489
There were little old ladies
with their shopping carts

840
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,291
ogling for places to stand!

841
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:52,422
The banners outside...

842
00:39:52,532 --> 00:39:54,193
"Free Joyce! Free Joyce!"

843
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:58,599
- These judges with their white
wigs sitting there, you know,

844
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:01,264
unable to comprehend
any of this.

845
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:03,307
And there was nothing
in the statute books

846
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,671
which would deal with it.

847
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,210
- They're so prim and proper,
you know.

848
00:40:07,311 --> 00:40:09,506
They wear these little
powdered wigs,

849
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:11,275
which look like
dumb little hats,

850
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:14,977
and they sit up and down
and wiggle on their heads.

851
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:16,609
One of the questions
they ask him was,

852
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,812
"Did you ask for a back rub?"

853
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,013
And he said, "Yes."

854
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:20,521
And they said,
"Was it cinnamon oil

855
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:21,750
that she rubbed on your back?"

856
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,052
And he goes, "Yes,"

857
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,127
like he had remembered,
"Well, that was nice."

858
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:27,422
They ask him, "Were you willing
or unwilling?"

859
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,260
And he did that like really fast
and looked at the head Mormon

860
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:31,390
right on the front row.

861
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,864
He jerked his head
really fast like,

862
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,332
"What am I supposed to say?"

863
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:36,097
And the head Mormon went like,

864
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:38,263
"You say what we told you
to say," like that.

865
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:39,931
And he goes, "I was unwilling!

866
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,598
I was unwilling."

867
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,608
"Were you unwilling
all seven times?"

868
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,439
"Well, I wasn't as unwilling

869
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:48,344
the third time
as I was the first."

870
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,678
I wanted him to be strong
and say, "Yes, I love her,

871
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,341
"and I'm gonna tell
the truth right now,

872
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,714
and let's get rid of this."

873
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,152
But he was so scared.

874
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:59,917
You know, you can tell a lie
long enough till you believe it.

875
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,587
- For 55 minutes, Ms. McKinney
poured out her statement

876
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,994
to an occasionally
confused magistrate.

877
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,329
At one point, he stopped her
and said, "I'm lost."

878
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:13,062
And Ms. McKinney, speaking
in a North Carolina drawl,

879
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,831
put the whole case in this way:

880
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,930
referring to the young Mormon,
Kirk Anderson, she said,

881
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,771
"He put me in prison
to save himself

882
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,402
from excommunication
and family disgrace."

883
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:26,310
This was a phony kidnap
according to Ms. McKinney.

884
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:29,543
Referring to the episode down
in the Devon cottage, she said,

885
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:32,643
"We had three days of fun,
food, and sex."

886
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:39,949
- By this time,
the British Isles was on fire

887
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,789
with the Joyce McKinney story.

888
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:43,624
That was all
that was being talked about

889
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,324
in the pubs and taverns
and restaurants.

890
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:49,334
"Where were you when you read
the Joyce McKinney story?"

891
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:50,732
You know.

892
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:54,033
I mean, it had kinky sex.
It had religion.

893
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,041
It had a beauty queen,
kidnap at gunpoint,

894
00:41:57,143 --> 00:41:59,667
chains, being spread-eagled.

895
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:01,039
It had Mormon missionaries.

896
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:03,080
And there was something
in that story for everyone.

897
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:05,274
It was a perfect tabloid story.

898
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:06,680
- I mean,
I could never understand

899
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:09,013
the public's fascination
with my love life.

900
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,245
I'm not a movie star.

901
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,379
I'm just a person,
a human being,

902
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:15,514
that was caught in
an extraordinary circumstance.

903
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,220
- The <i>Daily Express</i>
and the <i>Mirror</i> were locked

904
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:27,063
in almost deadly combat
over the Joyce McKinney story.

905
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,002
And then it all
kind of went away

906
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:33,505
until she was released on bail.

907
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:38,268
And then there was a kind
of burst of stuff again.

908
00:42:42,615 --> 00:42:45,175
- I was let out on bail
to await the upcoming trial

909
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:47,480
to clear my name.

910
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:49,918
Somebody sent a limousine
to pick me up at the prison,

911
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:51,387
and here I exit the prison,

912
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,458
and I mean,
I've got lice powder in my hair.

913
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,220
I'm supposed to be
this ex-beauty queen,

914
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:57,727
and all the cameras are there,
and, you know, I look like...

915
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:00,353
That was my first taste
of the press.

916
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:02,261
And when I got back
to the bed-and-breakfast,

917
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:05,563
I started to very quietly
get out of the limousine.

918
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,194
I'm thinking, "I wonder
who sent this car, you know,

919
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:09,829
at the prison to pick me up?"

920
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,067
And I was going to go in
and hug my mom and dad and say,

921
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:13,369
"I'm home!"

922
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:16,410
All of a sudden,
the sky lit up with flashbulbs.

923
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:18,412
Suddenly night became day.

924
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:21,972
I was suddenly a celebrity.

925
00:43:22,084 --> 00:43:23,210
I didn't ask to be a celebrity.

926
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:25,286
I didn't want to be a celebrity.

927
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:26,648
But it was like a wave.

928
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,915
It was like a "phenomen-imum."

929
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:33,284
<i>- So what have these last</i>
<i>few months been like for you?</i>

930
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:37,090
- Well, I've been very busy.

931
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,222
It's been amazing,
the way the public

932
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,891
has responded to my case.

933
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:45,664
I got close to 1,000 letters
from the British public.

934
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,830
The rest of the time
that I'm not answering letters

935
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,066
or something of this nature,

936
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:50,232
I'm working on my book.

937
00:43:50,342 --> 00:43:52,207
<i>- What kind of a book is that?</i>

938
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,868
- Well, this is my life story,

939
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:57,176
and it's the story
of how I met Kirk,

940
00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:59,772
and the name of it is
<i>A Very Special Love Story.</i>

941
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,281
I had said something like
I loved Kirk so much,

942
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:11,257
I'd have skied naked
down Mount Everest

943
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,692
with a carnation in my nose.

944
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:14,490
When I went into
the bed-and-breakfast,

945
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:18,327
there were pink carnations
all over the room!

946
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:21,231
There were pink carnations
in the closet, in the sink,

947
00:44:21,336 --> 00:44:22,963
on the floor, on the bed.

948
00:44:23,071 --> 00:44:25,766
Sacks of mail
from all over the world.

949
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:28,603
People wanted me to autograph
their baby's bellies,

950
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:30,939
their elbows,
their cigarette packs!

951
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:32,443
I got marriage proposals.

952
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,673
I got maps with directions
to guys' houses saying,

953
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:37,841
"Please come and kidnap
and rape me anytime, honey!"

954
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:40,181
It kind of got a life
of its own.

955
00:44:56,668 --> 00:44:57,930
I remember, I was at a party.

956
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,503
It was an after-party
for <i>Saturday Night Fever,</i>

957
00:45:00,604 --> 00:45:02,469
and Johnny Travolta was there.

958
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:04,802
And the Bee Gees came over
and asked me to dance,

959
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:06,205
and, you know...

960
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,709
Keith Moon... he was the drummer
for The Who... spied me,

961
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:10,039
and he told
one of the reporters,

962
00:45:10,146 --> 00:45:11,170
"I want to meet the girl."

963
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,474
He was with his girlfriend.

964
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:14,310
I mean, there was nothing
between me and Keith,

965
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:15,610
but he came over,
and he says,

966
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:17,548
"Joycie girl, I'm gonna give you
a big old smooch."

967
00:45:17,652 --> 00:45:18,641
And he just kissed me!

968
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:20,345
And that was
just getting started.

969
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:24,413
- Peter McKay, my editor,
said to me,

970
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:27,983
"Why don't you hire
a Rolls-Royce

971
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:32,690
"and take Joyce to the premiere
of <i>The Stud</i>

972
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,996
and upstage
the show business element?"

973
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:38,070
<i>- Was there a chance that you</i>
<i>could actually do this?</i>

974
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:40,139
<i>Could you upstage Joan Collins</i>
<i>with Joyce McKinney?</i>

975
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,296
- Well, we did.

976
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,169
She stepped out
of this Rolls-Royce,

977
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:44,833
and all the press went mad.

978
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,935
I mean, it was as if...
I don't know...

979
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,513
Marilyn Monroe got out
or the queen.

980
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,013
I mean,
certainly more excitement

981
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,346
than when Joan Collins
got out of her limousine.

982
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,859
She returned home at midnight
like Cinderella.

983
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,918
Presumably, Keith May
had been packing their bags,

984
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,521
because they disappeared
a day later.

985
00:46:10,632 --> 00:46:11,963
<i>- The police had opposed bail,</i>

986
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:14,001
<i>believing that the couple</i>
<i>would leave the country</i>

987
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:15,660
<i>if it were granted.</i>

988
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,034
<i>Since their disappearance</i>
<i>was discovered on Thursday,</i>

989
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:21,074
<i>the police have kept a watch</i>
<i>on all air and seaports,</i>

990
00:46:21,175 --> 00:46:24,803
<i>but they were last seen by</i>
<i>neighbors on Wednesday evening.</i>

991
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:31,080
- I never fled.
Don't use the word "fled."

992
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:33,083
I resent the word "fled."
I left.

993
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:36,677
- They went to the airport
as deaf-mutes, I gather.

994
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:40,016
Quite clever, really.

995
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:49,057
- I went, and I got the birth
certificates of two dead people.

996
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,531
I didn't figure they'd mind.

997
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:52,033
And I got me a travel visa.

998
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:54,366
I put on a granny wig,
and I made me a fat suit.

999
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:56,132
You know what a fat suit is,
like in <i>Norbit.</i>

1000
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,141
I said,
"Keith, we're going home."

1001
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:02,108
So I dye his hair coal black,

1002
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:04,736
and I made him
a little handlebar moustache

1003
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:07,076
and darkened his skin,
like Pedro Gonzalez.

1004
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:10,310
And I found out there was
a troop of deaf actors

1005
00:47:10,419 --> 00:47:12,580
going to the States via Canada.

1006
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:13,847
Well, let me tell ya,

1007
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:16,184
I put some little signs on us,
and it said,

1008
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,487
"I am deaf, but I can lip-read.

1009
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:22,858
Please enunciate your words
slowly and speak clearly."

1010
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:24,122
I remember the stewardess said,

1011
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,458
"Get these dummies
on the plane!"

1012
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:27,260
The other one said,
"Shh, They'll hear you!"

1013
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,301
And she goes, "No, they won't!
They're stone deaf!"

1014
00:47:34,706 --> 00:47:37,140
We got to Canada,
and it's at night,

1015
00:47:37,242 --> 00:47:38,402
and they stop us in immigration.

1016
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,841
I had 13 suitcases
full of news clips.

1017
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,338
In those suitcases are
hundreds of pictures of me,

1018
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,113
magazine covers
and all this stuff.

1019
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:51,187
They're gonna look at me
and say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"

1020
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,723
They go, "13 suitcases?
You immigrating?"

1021
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:57,316
And I go...

1022
00:47:57,427 --> 00:48:01,294
And she goes, "Oh, you're deaf!
Okay!

1023
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:04,389
We cannot get our interpreter
at night!"

1024
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,990
And she's talking louder
and louder.

1025
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:09,365
She gives me a pencil,
and I write down: "I tired.

1026
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,836
May I go now, please?"

1027
00:48:10,939 --> 00:48:13,430
Lady goes, "Eh, go on."

1028
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:18,807
- Ten days later,
I was in my office

1029
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:20,277
in the <i>Daily Express</i> building.

1030
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,372
The telephone rang
one evening about 6:00.

1031
00:48:26,152 --> 00:48:28,712
And I picked it up,
and it was Joyce.

1032
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:32,551
She said that she wanted to sell
her story to the <i>Daily Express</i>

1033
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:36,457
for £40,000.

1034
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:39,826
We arranged there and then
for me to fly out to Atlanta

1035
00:48:39,931 --> 00:48:44,526
and wait in the Atlanta airport
Hilton hotel.

1036
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:45,693
I went to the door,

1037
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:48,636
and there outside
were these two Indians...

1038
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:50,330
like Indians from Calcutta.

1039
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:56,003
They should have been arrested
for bad acting

1040
00:48:56,112 --> 00:48:59,877
far more than abducting
Mormon priests.

1041
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:05,082
She was having, really,
the time of her life.

1042
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:08,622
There was no sense of anxiety.
She was just enjoying it.

1043
00:49:08,723 --> 00:49:11,157
And giving us all
this nonsense,

1044
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:14,660
which was a totally sanitized
version of the truth.

1045
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:16,456
And we were falling for it,
of course,

1046
00:49:16,563 --> 00:49:19,464
getting it all onto these little
tape recorders, and thinking,

1047
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:22,433
"God, hasn't the <i>Express</i>
got a great story here!"

1048
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:26,836
Joyce brought in this suitcase,

1049
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:29,669
took about three of us
to get it in the room.

1050
00:49:29,775 --> 00:49:31,935
I daresay she just put
her finger on the button.

1051
00:49:32,043 --> 00:49:33,203
The thing exploded.

1052
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:37,179
And these disguises
and wigs and...

1053
00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:39,079
not bondage gear,
I hasten to add.

1054
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:41,150
At least, I didn't see any.

1055
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:42,843
I expected the FBI

1056
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:46,013
to come crashing in through
the windows at any minute,

1057
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:47,784
'cause as far as I knew, I mean,

1058
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:51,326
we were aiding
and abetting fugitives.

1059
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:55,193
It wasn't clear, really,

1060
00:49:55,298 --> 00:50:01,327
what Keith May's motive was
except that he adored Joyce.

1061
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:05,372
And Joyce kind of did,
from time to time,

1062
00:50:05,473 --> 00:50:06,632
treat him as if he was

1063
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,437
in some kind
of mistress-slave fantasy.

1064
00:50:10,544 --> 00:50:13,308
Like, "Down, slave,"
she would say to him.

1065
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:16,678
"Down, slave!
Down, slave!"

1066
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:19,274
But she would say it
humorously, joking.

1067
00:50:19,385 --> 00:50:21,785
But it did occur to us
at the time

1068
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:24,481
that this is all the language
of the world of bondage.

1069
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,855
I speak as if I'm an expert,
but I mean...

1070
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,427
- <i>I assume that you are.</i>

1071
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,229
But it's all this kind of
master-mistress power thing,

1072
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:38,962
domination thing that seems
to run through this whole story.

1073
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,263
It seems to be a theme.

1074
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,828
- Keith had probably
an obsession for Joyce

1075
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,500
just like Joyce had
an obsession for Kirk.

1076
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,601
The fact that he was just able
to be around her

1077
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,110
and helping her
where he could

1078
00:50:50,212 --> 00:50:52,840
satisfied his emotions.

1079
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:06,084
- There are tabloids in England
that are filth.

1080
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:09,162
At the top of the list
would be the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>

1081
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:12,993
- The <i>Daily Mirror</i> had...
meantime...

1082
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,589
had their reporters
in Los Angeles

1083
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,262
digging up all this stuff
about her activities as a...

1084
00:51:19,372 --> 00:51:22,364
I don't know...
not a call girl, but as a...

1085
00:51:22,475 --> 00:51:23,634
well, I suppose she was.

1086
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:27,542
I mean, she was being paid
for sexual services.

1087
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:32,446
But this was all long before
her escapades in the U.K.

1088
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:35,882
This was earlier
Joyce McKinney history.

1089
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:37,180
- They had a tip.

1090
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,255
I think it was from
a police officer in London

1091
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:42,222
to one of our London reporters
that was covering the story,

1092
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:45,351
who said that it might be worth
looking up an address

1093
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:47,861
that we know
she had in Los Angeles

1094
00:51:47,964 --> 00:51:52,093
and a boyfriend called
Steve Moskowitz.

1095
00:51:55,804 --> 00:51:58,271
Joyce had been in touch with him
from England saying,

1096
00:51:58,372 --> 00:51:59,839
"Destroy any pictures.

1097
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,432
If any journalists turn up,
do not talk to anybody."

1098
00:52:03,544 --> 00:52:05,671
Steve was very uncooperative
when I first met him.

1099
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:08,213
Once he told me that he was
still madly in love with her,

1100
00:52:08,314 --> 00:52:11,215
I said, "Look, Steve,
if you want to be at her side

1101
00:52:11,317 --> 00:52:12,716
"for the trial
at the Old Bailey,

1102
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:15,218
"we will pay
a first-class air ticket for you

1103
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,948
and put you up in a hotel in
London so you can be with her."

1104
00:52:18,057 --> 00:52:19,149
The next morning,

1105
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:21,624
I'm in the hotel
at Santa Monica.

1106
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:24,126
8:00, Monday morning,
the phone goes.

1107
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,388
Steve.

1108
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:27,293
"I'm downstairs."

1109
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:30,458
He produced six strips
of black-and-white contacts.

1110
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:32,967
There was nothing really
that bad on them.

1111
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,970
She was sitting on a horse.

1112
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:37,097
They were glamour pictures,
as such.

1113
00:52:39,643 --> 00:52:40,768
I said, "Well, look, Steve,

1114
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:42,867
"this doesn't take us
very much further,

1115
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:45,071
"but I will hang on to them.

1116
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:46,944
We need more."

1117
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:49,243
I said, "By the way,
the editor in London

1118
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,817
wants me to take a picture
of you."

1119
00:52:51,486 --> 00:52:54,011
He said, "Can you make it look
as if I've not posed for it?"

1120
00:52:54,122 --> 00:52:56,181
I said, "What do you mean?"

1121
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:58,520
He said, "Well,
I've got Joyce's car here,

1122
00:52:58,625 --> 00:52:59,751
"and I've got Millie.

1123
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,987
"I often take the dog out,
put him in the car,

1124
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,064
take the dog away for a walk."

1125
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:12,336
He didn't want Joyce to know
he was cooperating.

1126
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:15,600
- <i>So he's betraying her.</i>
<i>He knows he's betraying her.</i>

1127
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:19,803
- I don't think he realized
how much he was giving us.

1128
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:22,471
It was only when he said to me,

1129
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:23,774
"She placed these ads

1130
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,371
in the <i>Hollywood Free Press,</i>
in <i>Freep. "</i>

1131
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:27,974
He took us to one
of their offices,

1132
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:30,053
which had back numbers
of some of the ads

1133
00:53:30,154 --> 00:53:32,781
that she'd posted in there,
and it read:

1134
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:36,757
"Gorgeous former Miss USA
contestant desires work.

1135
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,454
"Beauty, brains and talent.
The best gal in the <i>Freep.</i>

1136
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:42,894
"38-24-36.

1137
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:45,489
"Slim, sweet, Southern blonde.

1138
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:47,660
"How would you like her
to leisurely bathe you,

1139
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,964
"lovingly blow dry/style
your hair,

1140
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:52,437
"and then give you
a delicious nude massage

1141
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,134
"on her fur-covered waterbed?

1142
00:53:55,243 --> 00:53:57,233
"Your fantasy is her specialty.

1143
00:53:57,344 --> 00:53:59,676
"S&M.
B&D.

1144
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,270
"Escort service.

1145
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:02,746
"Nude wrestling.
Modeling.

1146
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:04,476
"Erotic phone calls.

1147
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:06,847
"Dirty panties or pictures.

1148
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,410
Mail your fantasy
or specialty to Joey."

1149
00:54:10,523 --> 00:54:11,421
I love this bit.

1150
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:12,889
"P.S., Joey says,

1151
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:16,757
'I love shy boys, dirty old men,
and sugar daddies."'

1152
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,829
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

1153
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,524
I could not believe
that that was Joyce

1154
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,894
advertising those services.

1155
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,126
But that was only the beginning,

1156
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:25,394
because once we had
all of that,

1157
00:54:25,502 --> 00:54:26,799
we then had to start thinking,

1158
00:54:26,904 --> 00:54:28,735
"Who's got pictures
of all this?"

1159
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:31,238
It was only when he named
that photographer.

1160
00:54:33,576 --> 00:54:35,544
He said, "I've never
photographed Joyce McKinney.

1161
00:54:35,645 --> 00:54:37,135
I have no idea who she is."

1162
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:40,772
And I said, "Well,
according to a friend of mine

1163
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:42,281
"and a friend of hers,

1164
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:46,081
she always came on modeling
assignments with her dog."

1165
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:48,883
"Ah."

1166
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:50,513
He dug out some magazines.

1167
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:52,114
Soon as I saw it,
I said, "That's her."

1168
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:59,331
I took that away, and I thought,
"Job well done."

1169
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:02,026
We were getting somewhere.

1170
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:04,399
We went back
to Steve's apartment,

1171
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:08,234
and he brought up a phone bill.

1172
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,275
Every itemized phone call Joyce
had made from the apartment

1173
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:13,469
in the last three, four months.

1174
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:15,876
Right.

1175
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,210
Away we went
with the phone bill.

1176
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,147
Frank Power and I
spent three hours

1177
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,116
hitting every one
of those numbers on there.

1178
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,949
Nobody had heard
of Joyce McKinney.

1179
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,750
No idea who she was.

1180
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:30,452
The dog was the link.
Always the dog.

1181
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:34,586
It was only when Steve told me

1182
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:36,255
that she took
the dog with her

1183
00:55:36,365 --> 00:55:40,425
that the photographer
could put a face to an alias.

1184
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:45,098
- You learn, when you're famous,
who your friends are.

1185
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:47,834
When the payrollees come out,
the checkbook journalists.

1186
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:50,171
People that are real jealous
or maybe didn't like you

1187
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:52,074
or need money, it's, "Yeah?

1188
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:54,477
What do ya wanna know about her?
How much you pay me?"

1189
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:56,572
I had a false friend,
and his name was Steve,

1190
00:55:56,683 --> 00:55:58,673
and he was a creep.

1191
00:55:58,784 --> 00:56:01,218
He had the key
to the outside of my apartment

1192
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,255
so he could go in
and walk my dog.

1193
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:05,846
He broke in a steamer trunk.

1194
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:10,189
I had huge pictures of me in
there from a modeling portfolio.

1195
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:12,957
He sold those to <i>The Sun</i>
and the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>

1196
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:14,587
Both were in contests

1197
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:17,929
to see who could do the worst
Joyce McKinney story.

1198
00:56:18,035 --> 00:56:19,297
When those <i>Daily Mirror</i>
reporters

1199
00:56:19,403 --> 00:56:20,563
showed up on his doorstep,

1200
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:23,935
they turned him
and bragged about it.

1201
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,068
They sent him and
his prostitute crony to Mexico

1202
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:31,737
so that they
wouldn't be prosecuted

1203
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,338
for breaking and entering
my apartment.

1204
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:35,939
- We were worried about Steve,

1205
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:38,315
that somebody
was gonna get to him.

1206
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:43,288
So we kept Steve out of the way
of all our opposition in Mexico

1207
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:46,690
for about ten days until we
finished with the story.

1208
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,852
He didn't realize that it was
to keep him out of the way.

1209
00:56:48,962 --> 00:56:50,429
I mean, he could've made
a lot of money

1210
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,792
by telling his side
of the story.

1211
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:54,628
All he got from us
was a promise

1212
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:58,829
to be at the Old Bailey
when Joyce goes to trial.

1213
00:56:58,938 --> 00:57:02,704
We were coming up with more
material than you could believe,

1214
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:04,673
unpublishable material,

1215
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:07,267
bondage pictures,
her wrestling with Thai girls,

1216
00:57:07,378 --> 00:57:09,778
mud wrestling, nudes.

1217
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:13,873
The service that were offered
were oral sex, massage, bondage.

1218
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:16,612
Laura would have
the full intercourse

1219
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,247
if they paid enough money.

1220
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:23,325
Joyce would do the bondage
and anything else they needed,

1221
00:57:23,426 --> 00:57:25,519
including oral sex,
but that was it.

1222
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:28,494
I said to him,
"Well, what happens

1223
00:57:28,597 --> 00:57:29,825
if this ever got
out of control?"

1224
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:32,058
And he said,
"Oh, we had that fixed."

1225
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,691
I won't try to get his accent.

1226
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:35,394
He said,
"I bugged the dog's collar."

1227
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:37,403
I said, "You did what?"

1228
00:57:37,505 --> 00:57:39,734
He said, "I put a bug
in the collar of the dog."

1229
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,400
I said, "What, the dog went with
her on these sexual encounters?"

1230
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:43,476
"Oh, yeah, always."

1231
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:44,839
He said, "And if it got
out of hand,

1232
00:57:44,945 --> 00:57:46,936
"I'd be sitting outside
with a couple of other guys,

1233
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,343
and we would go in."

1234
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,643
- <i>So is he sitting in</i>
<i>a coffee shop with headphones?</i>

1235
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:51,739
- He was sitting in the car.

1236
00:57:55,688 --> 00:57:58,281
Steve was very much in love
with Joyce.

1237
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,723
We asked him if he'd ever
had sex with her, and he said,

1238
00:58:01,827 --> 00:58:04,955
"Shoot, man, nobody's ever
had sex with Joyce."

1239
00:58:05,063 --> 00:58:07,326
That was the quote from him.

1240
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:08,523
- <i>Nobody?</i>

1241
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:10,725
- "Nobody."
That was the quote.

1242
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,497
When Mike Malloy,
who was the editor

1243
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:15,696
of the <i>Mirror</i> at that time,

1244
00:58:15,805 --> 00:58:17,898
asked me how
we were getting on, I said,

1245
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:19,066
"It's interesting, Mike.

1246
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:20,699
You'll be pleased to see
what we've got."

1247
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,470
"Do you have a picture of her
in a swimsuit?"

1248
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:24,773
I said, "Oh, yes.
We've got that."

1249
00:58:31,419 --> 00:58:33,080
- I mean, worms crawl
out of the woodwork

1250
00:58:33,187 --> 00:58:35,655
when you become famous,
worms, cockroaches!

1251
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:43,893
- Mike called me to say,

1252
00:58:43,997 --> 00:58:45,988
"I better let you know
that tomorrow we're gonna run,

1253
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:49,226
for a week,
with 'The Real McKinney' story."

1254
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:51,360
And that was the front page,
"The Real McKinney."

1255
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:59,933
- Their front page was
going to be Joyce, naked,

1256
00:59:00,045 --> 00:59:01,342
but lying on her stomach.

1257
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:05,905
And ours was going to be
these pictures of her as a nun.

1258
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:08,075
One paper projecting her

1259
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:11,621
as an innocent,
sweet-natured woman,

1260
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,451
a God-fearing, religious woman,

1261
00:59:14,557 --> 00:59:17,492
who was a victim
of cruel circumstances.

1262
00:59:17,593 --> 00:59:19,959
And the other, the <i>Daily Mirror,</i>
projected her

1263
00:59:20,063 --> 00:59:26,001
as a kind of manipulating,
sex-crazed, part-time hooker.

1264
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:29,400
Somewhere in between, maybe,
is the truth.

1265
00:59:29,504 --> 00:59:33,234
- The <i>Express</i> came, and they
actually let me tape-record

1266
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,104
what I said, and they
printed it word-for-word.

1267
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:40,441
And that same week, the <i>Mirror</i>
came out with the story.

1268
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:42,845
They had painted a totally
different picture of me.

1269
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:46,783
If I was well-educated,
they made me stupid.

1270
00:59:46,886 --> 00:59:51,049
If I was a virgin in real life,
they made me a slut.

1271
00:59:51,156 --> 00:59:55,456
- We did the fantasy
that Joyce wanted promoted

1272
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:58,188
to the millions
of English readers.

1273
00:59:58,296 --> 00:59:59,854
- <i>Yeah, you became her tool,</i>
<i>her slave.</i>

1274
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,898
- Oh, totally.
I became her slave, yes.

1275
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,796
We were all her slaves.

1276
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:09,495
The <i>Daily Express</i>
did buy the story,

1277
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,301
and it was only Joyce's story,

1278
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,671
what she wanted to say
about the kidnapping,

1279
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,744
what she did or did not do
with Kirk.

1280
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,473
She wasn't gonna tell a story
about her hooker assignments.

1281
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:19,809
She can't say it never happened

1282
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:23,577
because there it is
in black-and-white.

1283
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:27,280
It was Joyce.

1284
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:28,685
- <i>Well, her claim is, of course,</i>

1285
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,223
<i>that those pictures</i>
<i>were doctored.</i>

1286
01:00:30,325 --> 01:00:31,484
- You don't doctor negatives.

1287
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:34,618
We had the negative,
print, and the magazine.

1288
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:36,821
Get out of that, Joyce.

1289
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,659
- <i>The Sun</i> put my head
on another person's naked body.

1290
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:41,699
And she was flat-chested
as a board.

1291
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,702
I mean, the girl was flat
in her front.

1292
01:00:44,804 --> 01:00:47,102
As you see, I'm not flat
in my front.

1293
01:00:47,206 --> 01:00:49,469
- <i>So it was clear that</i>
<i>this woman's breasts...</i>

1294
01:00:49,574 --> 01:00:50,700
- Were not me.

1295
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:53,972
Those are fried eggs!

1296
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,013
<i>The Sun</i> admitted
it was a fake picture.

1297
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,604
They came out and said,
"This is a composite picture."

1298
01:00:58,716 --> 01:01:00,183
But the <i>Daily Mirror</i> didn't.

1299
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:04,186
The <i>Daily Mirror</i> tried to make
it look like I was a whore.

1300
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:05,777
- On the only occasion
when I did meet her

1301
01:01:05,889 --> 01:01:08,119
a bit later, she said,
in her accent, you know,

1302
01:01:08,224 --> 01:01:09,953
"I don't pose nude."

1303
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:12,118
Of course, sitting
on the editor's desk

1304
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:14,889
was over 1,000 pictures
and magazines

1305
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:18,296
and negatives of her
that we already had.

1306
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,697
She never knew that, of course.

1307
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,927
I never took a picture,
which is really unusual for me.

1308
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:23,333
The only thing
I ever wanted to do

1309
01:01:23,437 --> 01:01:25,029
was photograph Joyce
with no clothes on.

1310
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,299
And I ended up picking up

1311
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:28,534
hundreds of other people
who did it.

1312
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,008
Bit strange.

1313
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:32,476
- <i>Do you still have</i>
<i>the photographs?</i>

1314
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:34,012
- Unfortunately,
only the pictures

1315
01:01:34,114 --> 01:01:36,014
that were published
in the <i>Mirror</i> at the time.

1316
01:01:36,116 --> 01:01:39,881
The file, which was
between 800 and 1,000 pictures,

1317
01:01:39,985 --> 01:01:41,111
were all locked up in a safe.

1318
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,187
But unfortunately,

1319
01:01:42,288 --> 01:01:43,687
the Mirror Group
changed ownership,

1320
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:45,279
and along with
a lot of other things,

1321
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:47,517
all that dossier went missing.

1322
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:53,425
- We were in the hotel room,
and Joyce was constantly calling

1323
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:54,862
her friend
in North London saying,

1324
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:56,091
"Have you seen the papers yet?

1325
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,292
Have you seen the papers yet?"

1326
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:58,663
She'd gotten the newspapers,

1327
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:01,294
the early editions
of the newspapers,

1328
01:02:01,405 --> 01:02:03,635
and had them laid out
in front of her

1329
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,172
and was on the telephone saying,

1330
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:07,469
"And the <i>Mirror</i> says this,
and the <i>Mirror</i> says that.

1331
01:02:07,577 --> 01:02:12,071
"And there's a photograph
of you here with no clothes on.

1332
01:02:12,181 --> 01:02:13,909
"And there's another photograph

1333
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,849
of you here standing on a man
in a bedroom."

1334
01:02:17,953 --> 01:02:20,183
And this is when Joyce
freaked out.

1335
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:28,456
She was so appalled
and enraged and distressed

1336
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,120
about all the stuff

1337
01:02:30,231 --> 01:02:32,664
that the <i>Mirror</i> had been
printing about her,

1338
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:34,995
'cause she had no idea
this was gonna happen at all.

1339
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:38,730
She just went crazy,
went absolutely crazy.

1340
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:42,864
Brian realized that he had
to stop this conversation

1341
01:02:42,975 --> 01:02:45,808
and that she mustn't learn
any more,

1342
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:47,707
'cause we didn't know
what she was going to do.

1343
01:02:47,812 --> 01:02:50,303
So he didn't even bother
to disconnect the telephone

1344
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:51,779
in a civilized way.

1345
01:02:51,882 --> 01:02:54,680
He just grabbed the wires
and pulled them out of the wall.

1346
01:02:57,821 --> 01:02:59,880
He didn't unplug them;
he just pull...

1347
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,083
and bits of plaster came out,
I remember, with it.

1348
01:03:02,192 --> 01:03:05,285
<i>- This is a very unusual kind</i>
<i>of behavior, no?</i>

1349
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:07,089
<i>Wouldn't you just</i>
<i>hang the phone up?</i>

1350
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:10,188
- Well, Joyce McKinney
had it in both hands

1351
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:12,096
screwed into her ear.

1352
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:14,634
I mean, she was really scary,
really scary.

1353
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:16,704
She appeared to kind of fly
across the room,

1354
01:03:16,804 --> 01:03:21,002
as far as I remember it,
and clung on to the curtains,

1355
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:24,009
which partly came away
on the rail.

1356
01:03:24,111 --> 01:03:25,669
She was completely hysterical.

1357
01:03:25,779 --> 01:03:27,110
Then she went for the balcony.

1358
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:29,944
I dived after her and sort of
grabbed her by the ankles.

1359
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,244
I didn't know whether
she was going to jump off,

1360
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,013
'cause if she had done, I think
there were probably tourists

1361
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:36,816
on deck chairs underneath.

1362
01:03:36,922 --> 01:03:39,185
She would've probably
taken them out too.

1363
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:42,886
So it would have been very
embarrassing, to say the least.

1364
01:03:42,994 --> 01:03:44,859
- I looked down, and I could see
all the reporters

1365
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:47,124
milling around outside
trying to get their shot,

1366
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:48,789
trying to get their shot.

1367
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:50,628
You know, even as far up
as I was,

1368
01:03:50,734 --> 01:03:52,201
they were trying
to get their shot.

1369
01:03:52,303 --> 01:03:55,863
And I thought, "All I have to do
is just climb up on this rail

1370
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:58,497
"and just splatter,
and I will be dead.

1371
01:03:58,608 --> 01:04:00,007
"I'll be in heaven.

1372
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:05,978
There will be no more tabloid
reporters ever to ruin my life."

1373
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:07,878
- She went a bit up the wall.

1374
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:09,917
She tried to climb up
and jump off the balcony.

1375
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:11,918
"I want to meet my Maker!"

1376
01:04:14,322 --> 01:04:17,814
- K.J. came running in
the motel room, and he's just,

1377
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:20,189
"Don't let 'em win!

1378
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:22,488
"If you die,
the truth dies with you,

1379
01:04:22,595 --> 01:04:25,063
"and nobody will ever know
what really happened.

1380
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:27,599
Nobody will know
how much you loved him."

1381
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:29,566
- She was screaming.
She was hysterical.

1382
01:04:29,669 --> 01:04:32,398
She was completely
out of control.

1383
01:04:32,504 --> 01:04:34,028
We got her to a hospital.

1384
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:37,370
We were thinking in terms of
a pill of some kind,

1385
01:04:37,476 --> 01:04:39,807
but this nurse appeared
with a large syringe

1386
01:04:39,911 --> 01:04:43,642
and just stuck it in her.

1387
01:04:43,748 --> 01:04:44,840
And we wheeled her out

1388
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,110
in this wheelchair
that was provided,

1389
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,151
unconscious,

1390
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,810
and got her back to the hotel.

1391
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,685
Her father, this gentle man,
came in with his wife

1392
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,986
and tried to put his arms
around Joyce.

1393
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:00,358
And she just sunk her teeth
into his forearm.

1394
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,626
And there was an awful kind
of tussle.

1395
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,893
And he managed
to get himself free,

1396
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,264
and there was blood
trickling down his arm.

1397
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,304
He'd been attacked by a vampire.

1398
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:17,977
Joyce then fled the whole lot
of us in her nightie.

1399
01:05:18,078 --> 01:05:21,444
And we kind of followed her
and chased her down.

1400
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:24,141
And there was this freeway
that went past the back

1401
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,276
of the hotel with huge trucks

1402
01:05:27,387 --> 01:05:30,651
and cars whizzing past
in both directions.

1403
01:05:30,756 --> 01:05:33,987
I remember seeing her
run across this freeway,

1404
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:39,825
miraculously being missed
by all these vehicles

1405
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,262
and kind of disappearing
somewhere into the distance.

1406
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:52,802
- I know.
Exactly.

1407
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:54,968
- Because would you believe
McKinney is back?

1408
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:56,169
Joyce McKinney,

1409
01:05:56,278 --> 01:05:58,337
the "sex in chains" girl,
arrested.

1410
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:00,847
- She kept us all entertained
in 1977.

1411
01:06:00,949 --> 01:06:03,383
- She used to phone me up
every day, two or three times,

1412
01:06:03,485 --> 01:06:05,918
for months, saying,
"Lawks, have mercy!

1413
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,148
I'll kill myself... what
the <i>Daily Mirror</i> said about me."

1414
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,451
And seven years later,

1415
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:13,082
she'll still pursuing
this unfortunate Mormon.

1416
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:14,285
Can you believe it?

1417
01:06:14,394 --> 01:06:16,521
- Oh, dear.

1418
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,222
- <i>You saw him in 1984?</i>

1419
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:19,389
- Yeah.

1420
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:20,625
Yeah, I was at the airport,

1421
01:06:20,734 --> 01:06:25,670
and his... overweight
Mormon wife saw me.

1422
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:28,399
And I guess she was disturbed
I was using the public airport.

1423
01:06:28,507 --> 01:06:29,939
She went and called the police
and said,

1424
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,372
"Oh, McKinney's here.
Go get her."

1425
01:06:31,476 --> 01:06:33,205
- <i>What was his job</i>
<i>at the airport?</i>

1426
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:36,803
- I hate to say this,
but he was a doo-doo dipper.

1427
01:06:36,915 --> 01:06:38,609
- <i>A doo-doo dipper?</i>

1428
01:06:38,715 --> 01:06:39,909
- Yeah.

1429
01:06:40,017 --> 01:06:41,382
- <i>What is a doo-doo dipper?</i>

1430
01:06:41,485 --> 01:06:43,544
- That's someone
who takes the doo-doo

1431
01:06:43,654 --> 01:06:45,485
off the back of the plane.

1432
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:47,579
They married him off
to this big, overweight woman,

1433
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,817
and they told her to start
having kids as quick as possible

1434
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:53,020
so that he would get over me.

1435
01:06:53,129 --> 01:06:56,063
That fact that I could have
given him children, I guess,

1436
01:06:56,164 --> 01:06:57,529
was bypassed.

1437
01:06:57,632 --> 01:07:00,123
I was kind of glad
she was not too good-looking.

1438
01:07:00,235 --> 01:07:02,066
I mean, If she had been
really great-looking,

1439
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,034
I would have probably felt
really awful, you know?

1440
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:05,435
Cried my eyes out,

1441
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:07,871
but it wasn't any competition,
if you know what I mean.

1442
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:09,499
The only thing she had
that I didn't have

1443
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,737
was 100 extra pounds,
and she was a Mormon.

1444
01:07:11,846 --> 01:07:17,715
- She was found lurking
outside his office.

1445
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:21,183
I think she was arrested
for stalking him or something.

1446
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:27,658
- <i>Do you still love him?</i>

1447
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:29,420
- I'll die loving him.

1448
01:07:29,528 --> 01:07:31,722
I never got married
because of him.

1449
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,372
I'm the incurable romantic,
you know?

1450
01:07:47,476 --> 01:07:50,309
The idea of marrying somebody
that I didn't love

1451
01:07:50,412 --> 01:07:52,642
and having to sleep with him
and have his kids

1452
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:57,241
and live a humdrum, blasè life
with half a love...

1453
01:07:57,352 --> 01:08:01,186
I would rather have
a short few weeks

1454
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:06,726
with someone who was
the star in the crown

1455
01:08:06,827 --> 01:08:10,786
than to spend my life
with someone and be miserable.

1456
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:13,388
Love is not a changing thing.

1457
01:08:13,499 --> 01:08:16,366
It doesn't... it's a steadfast
and eternal thing.

1458
01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:17,959
It's like an eternal flame.

1459
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,266
It doesn't just stop because
of circumstances or situations.

1460
01:08:21,373 --> 01:08:22,772
It goes on, even past death.

1461
01:08:22,874 --> 01:08:25,707
- It's a very bleak future
you paint for yourself.

1462
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,902
What is gonna happen to you?

1463
01:08:27,012 --> 01:08:29,344
- Well, first of all,
I want to write my book

1464
01:08:29,447 --> 01:08:31,937
and make sure
that the truth comes out,

1465
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:34,244
because, regardless
of what you've heard,

1466
01:08:34,351 --> 01:08:37,252
I haven't sold my life story
to anyone, to any newspapers.

1467
01:08:37,354 --> 01:08:40,015
The only newspaper I have talked
to has been the <i>Express,</i>

1468
01:08:40,123 --> 01:08:42,318
who did the article about
my adventures in America,

1469
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:43,483
and that's it.

1470
01:08:43,593 --> 01:08:45,060
And I want my story to be told.

1471
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:46,991
- Are you really prepared
to condemn yourself,

1472
01:08:47,095 --> 01:08:50,792
'cause that's what it is,
to a very solitary life?

1473
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:52,161
- Yes.

1474
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:01,502
Today's date
is September 25, 1986.

1475
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:03,042
September 25, 1986.

1476
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:07,045
It is the interior
of the McKinneys' house,

1477
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:08,808
the office.

1478
01:09:08,915 --> 01:09:12,351
This is the office
where the McKinney daughter

1479
01:09:12,451 --> 01:09:13,884
is currently working on a book.

1480
01:09:13,986 --> 01:09:15,977
Could you work
at this computer

1481
01:09:16,088 --> 01:09:19,615
with the Benfield coon dogs
barking outside your window?

1482
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:26,261
My father is trying
to take a nap.

1483
01:09:35,272 --> 01:09:38,331
Outside, both Benfield hounds
are barking.

1484
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:40,500
This shot is done
through the screen.

1485
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,750
This shot made
on August 8, 1986,

1486
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:56,551
shows absolutely nothing around.

1487
01:09:56,657 --> 01:10:01,026
This shot shows absolutely
nothing in the picture.

1488
01:10:03,796 --> 01:10:09,257
This shot made
on August 8, 1986,

1489
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:12,599
shows absolutely nothing
in the picture.

1490
01:10:13,872 --> 01:10:18,309
This shot made
on August 8, 1986,

1491
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,503
shows absolutely
no other animals

1492
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:21,737
or anything in the picture

1493
01:10:21,846 --> 01:10:26,146
to agitate the barking
Benfield hound.

1494
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,184
This is the same dog, of course,

1495
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:31,082
that's been barking
in the other pictures.

1496
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,963
I finally got
what's called agoraphobia.

1497
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:55,269
It's when you can't
go out of the house.

1498
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:57,536
We had a big old farmhouse

1499
01:10:57,644 --> 01:10:59,942
with a river on one side
and woods on the other.

1500
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:08,181
And we thought that was, like,
a natural barrier to paparazzi.

1501
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,221
But they would just
put on fisherman boots

1502
01:11:10,322 --> 01:11:11,914
and just wade
right through that river.

1503
01:11:14,893 --> 01:11:18,056
I remember one time a woman
came on our property,

1504
01:11:18,163 --> 01:11:19,858
ignored
the "no trespassing" signs,

1505
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:21,726
and she was just gawking
in the window,

1506
01:11:21,832 --> 01:11:22,821
like, trying to get up

1507
01:11:22,933 --> 01:11:25,663
to see what Joyce McKinney
looked like.

1508
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:27,361
It went on like that for years.

1509
01:11:31,307 --> 01:11:34,174
I could barely get out
to go feed the horses.

1510
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,184
So finally, I got me
this big old guard dog.

1511
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:46,719
His name was Tough Guy.

1512
01:11:46,821 --> 01:11:48,618
He was a huge dog.
He weighed about 150 pounds.

1513
01:11:48,723 --> 01:11:49,951
Solid muscle.

1514
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:53,424
Pit bull mastiff bulldog.
Jaws like a alligator.

1515
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:55,426
And I just put him right
out in the front yard like,

1516
01:11:55,528 --> 01:11:57,962
"Come on, boys.
Come on."

1517
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:04,391
One day, he got bee-stung.

1518
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:06,698
These two women
that worked at the pharmacy

1519
01:12:06,805 --> 01:12:09,330
who didn't like me
decided that it'd just be a hoot

1520
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:11,602
to add a zero onto
that Prednisone prescription

1521
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:12,903
for Joyce McKinney's guard dog.

1522
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,170
Wouldn't that be funny?

1523
01:12:14,278 --> 01:12:15,836
Probably drive him nutty,
wouldn't it?

1524
01:12:15,947 --> 01:12:18,814
Well, it drove him
more than nutty.

1525
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:22,612
The capillaries
in his brain exploded.

1526
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,018
But not before he attacked me.

1527
01:12:26,123 --> 01:12:27,784
He didn't know who I was.

1528
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,324
He amputated...
I can't raise this arm up.

1529
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:33,122
But he amputated my left arm.

1530
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:34,856
He tore off three fingers
on this hand.

1531
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:37,489
He ripped my intestines out
of my stomach wall.

1532
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,124
He shredded my knee

1533
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:43,068
from my right kneecap
to my ankle.

1534
01:12:43,171 --> 01:12:45,503
I was bleeding to death.

1535
01:12:45,607 --> 01:12:47,073
I was dying.

1536
01:12:50,477 --> 01:12:51,842
A few months before this,

1537
01:12:51,945 --> 01:12:54,311
I had found a little dog
by the side of the road

1538
01:12:54,414 --> 01:12:55,573
going through garbage cans.

1539
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:57,012
I named him Booger.

1540
01:12:57,116 --> 01:12:58,811
And Booger
was a little pit bull.

1541
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:01,548
I hit the brakes,
and I backed up,

1542
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:04,417
and I got out, and I said,
"Could you use a friend?

1543
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:06,491
"I could use a friend too.

1544
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:09,321
Okay, I'm a softie.
Get in the car."

1545
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:10,451
So he went...

1546
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:15,756
He had a little five-beat
musical bark, Booger did.

1547
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:17,527
Booger, Booger, Booger.

1548
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:18,761
I had taken him home with me,

1549
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:21,302
not realizing that he was
gonna be famous someday

1550
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:24,532
or that he would save my life
or change the lives... my life

1551
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:27,303
and the lives of so many people.

1552
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:30,037
The night that this big mastiff
attacked me, the guard dog,

1553
01:13:30,145 --> 01:13:31,737
I got next door
to where Booger was.

1554
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:33,337
I said, "Help me, Booger,"
and Booger shot out,

1555
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:35,177
and he jumped on that other dog
and pulled it off of me.

1556
01:13:36,618 --> 01:13:38,175
It was a fight to the death,
and I thought,

1557
01:13:38,286 --> 01:13:40,083
"Poor little Booger,

1558
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:42,622
he's gonna give himself
in a Christlike love for me."

1559
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,454
When I came home
from the hospital,

1560
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,891
he sat on the bed beside me,
and we healed together,

1561
01:13:47,994 --> 01:13:49,655
and we formed a bond,
a friendship.

1562
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,590
Booger was a very special dog.

1563
01:13:55,701 --> 01:13:58,864
Not only was he
a licensed service dog,

1564
01:13:58,971 --> 01:14:00,962
but one day he just got up
and unlocked the door,

1565
01:14:01,073 --> 01:14:03,768
and then he started
dialing 911 with his paw.

1566
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,342
He had a big button phone.

1567
01:14:05,443 --> 01:14:06,569
And I'd say, "Booger, help!

1568
01:14:06,678 --> 01:14:08,703
Dial 911."
He'd go, whomp!

1569
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:09,939
"Booger, I need a towel.

1570
01:14:10,048 --> 01:14:11,572
Go get me a towel
out of the dryer, buddy."

1571
01:14:11,683 --> 01:14:13,411
He'd go in there into the dryer
and get me a towel.

1572
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,451
"Hey, Booger, get me a pop
out of the refrigerator."

1573
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:18,646
And he'd go get me one,
and he'd so gently carry it

1574
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,779
so he wouldn't burst it
with his teeth

1575
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,687
and drop it in my lap.

1576
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:31,989
He got me through
that tough time.

1577
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,160
For ten years, he was my helper.

1578
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,204
My beloved old friend Booger
passed away in my arms

1579
01:14:38,305 --> 01:14:40,899
of cancer in April of 2006.

1580
01:14:41,008 --> 01:14:43,135
I tried everything
in the world to save him.

1581
01:14:43,244 --> 01:14:45,610
I took him to every
veterinary hospital I could.

1582
01:14:45,713 --> 01:14:47,077
I said, "You can't die, buddy.

1583
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,943
"You're all I have.
We're a package deal.

1584
01:14:49,048 --> 01:14:51,039
You can't die."

1585
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,744
That was the last command
I gave him, "You can't die."

1586
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:57,948
And he looked at me as if he
didn't want to disappoint me.

1587
01:14:58,056 --> 01:15:00,047
And those eyes,
with age-old wisdom,

1588
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,424
those dark brown eyes
looked at me like, "Don't worry.

1589
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:09,625
I'll see you again.
This is not the end for us."

1590
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:11,393
I just wanted to go to heaven,

1591
01:15:11,502 --> 01:15:13,230
and I thought God
would just have Booger there

1592
01:15:13,336 --> 01:15:14,462
on a cloud for me or something.

1593
01:15:14,571 --> 01:15:16,869
And I'd had such a sad life,
you know,

1594
01:15:16,973 --> 01:15:18,702
with all the tabloid mess.

1595
01:15:18,808 --> 01:15:21,742
And I thought,
"I just want the hurt to stop.

1596
01:15:21,844 --> 01:15:23,539
And I can't do without him."

1597
01:15:23,646 --> 01:15:25,511
Then I heard about cloning.

1598
01:15:25,614 --> 01:15:27,741
You know, I thought, "Well,
I'll just give it a stab."

1599
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,684
I contacted Dr. Byeong Chun Lee

1600
01:15:30,785 --> 01:15:33,652
and asked him
if it was possible.

1601
01:15:33,755 --> 01:15:35,655
I wrote him a letter in Korean,
translated it,

1602
01:15:35,757 --> 01:15:37,621
and then tracked down
his phone number.

1603
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:40,215
And he goes,
"I can clone your dog."

1604
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:41,692
I said, "Are you sure?

1605
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:45,390
I mean, is it possible
I could have my old boy back?"

1606
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,432
He goes, "I can."

1607
01:15:50,736 --> 01:15:54,399
- <i>Do you ever feel like God?</i>

1608
01:16:19,462 --> 01:16:20,951
- What their plan was

1609
01:16:21,063 --> 01:16:24,464
is to take a little piece
of tissue from Booger's tummy,

1610
01:16:24,566 --> 01:16:26,193
put it in liquid nitrogen

1611
01:16:26,301 --> 01:16:28,666
for its safe trip back
to Seoul, Korea.

1612
01:16:30,137 --> 01:16:33,504
They flew back with the help
of Homeland Security.

1613
01:16:33,607 --> 01:16:37,134
Homeland Security
guarding these little cells.

1614
01:16:37,243 --> 01:16:38,232
- <i>Guarding Booger.</i>

1615
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:39,710
- Well, to me,
it was Spirit Booger.

1616
01:16:39,813 --> 01:16:40,780
That's what we called it.

1617
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,110
It was like an orb of light

1618
01:16:43,216 --> 01:16:45,582
moved along the fuselage
of the plane.

1619
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,709
And people were saying,
"What is that?"

1620
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,449
But I knew.
I knew it was old Spirit Booger.

1621
01:16:51,557 --> 01:16:54,650
I closed my eyes, and I said
a silent prayer, and I said,

1622
01:16:54,759 --> 01:16:57,751
"Oh, Heavenly Father,
please take good care of him."

1623
01:16:57,862 --> 01:17:00,456
And it was like he spoke
to my heart, and said,

1624
01:17:00,565 --> 01:17:02,590
"Don't worry.

1625
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,031
"He's with me, and he's fine.

1626
01:17:05,135 --> 01:17:09,094
"And you, you are going
to be fine too,

1627
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:10,901
"because I've got Booger 1,

1628
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:13,339
"but I'm sending you back
Booger 2

1629
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:15,933
and a little something extra."

1630
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,334
- I get this
long-distance phone call.

1631
01:17:53,445 --> 01:17:55,309
It's Dr. Hong.

1632
01:17:55,413 --> 01:17:58,678
"Miss Brenann, what is best news
I can bring to you?"

1633
01:17:58,783 --> 01:18:01,274
And I said, "We're pregnant?

1634
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,976
We're pregnant!"

1635
01:18:03,086 --> 01:18:04,110
He said, "We are."

1636
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:09,522
On August the 5th,
I flew to Seoul, Korea.

1637
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:28,074
- Well, I found out what
the little something extra was

1638
01:18:28,176 --> 01:18:30,973
that Heavenly Father
had promised me.

1639
01:18:31,078 --> 01:18:32,602
There were five.
- <i>Five?</i>

1640
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:36,045
- Five cloned puppies,
all exactly like Booger,

1641
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:39,481
five mini Boogers lying there
like little black jelly rolls

1642
01:18:39,585 --> 01:18:41,917
with half the world press
crowding around.

1643
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:44,581
They just looked like
little tiny mini Boogers.

1644
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,350
It was the strangest feeling.

1645
01:18:50,228 --> 01:18:51,752
The weirdest thing is,

1646
01:18:51,863 --> 01:18:54,058
I was sitting in a hotel
in Seoul, Korea,

1647
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:56,325
and one of them got up
and opened the door,

1648
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:57,559
and he was four months old.

1649
01:18:57,668 --> 01:19:00,603
And I just went...

1650
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:01,830
I thought, "How'd he know that?

1651
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:03,200
I didn't train them to do that."

1652
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:05,206
You know, they have
those little refrigerators

1653
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:08,573
with little wooden doors,
like a cabinet, in hotels.

1654
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:10,873
And he just reached right up,
got that silver knob,

1655
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,241
and jerked it open
with his teeth

1656
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,473
just like old Booger used to do.

1657
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,049
And then, when one of them
got the leash

1658
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,208
and went over to the door

1659
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:17,979
and dropped it like,
"Walk me, now,"

1660
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,781
like Booger did,
it blew me away.

1661
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:23,322
I said, "These are his clones."

1662
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:25,654
- It was $25,000,
if I can remember.

1663
01:19:25,759 --> 01:19:28,818
- <i>Well, the original price was,</i>
<i>I believe, $150,000.</i>

1664
01:19:28,928 --> 01:19:30,361
- Was it?
God.

1665
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:31,760
She must like her dogs.

1666
01:19:31,865 --> 01:19:34,891
I don't know.
Some girl.

1667
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:36,434
- It was in all the papers.

1668
01:19:36,536 --> 01:19:41,029
"Dog cloning girl turns out
to be <i>the</i> Joyce McKinney,"

1669
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,904
because she pretended
it wasn't her to start with.

1670
01:19:44,009 --> 01:19:45,976
She called herself
Brenann McKinney.

1671
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:47,908
Something like Brenann,
was it?

1672
01:19:48,012 --> 01:19:49,741
- Berman McKinney,
or something like that.

1673
01:19:49,847 --> 01:19:51,838
I forget what name she used.

1674
01:19:51,949 --> 01:19:54,178
I knew right away it was Joyce.

1675
01:19:54,284 --> 01:19:55,444
- <i>Why?</i>

1676
01:19:55,552 --> 01:19:58,077
- Well, I think there was
a photograph.

1677
01:19:58,188 --> 01:19:59,780
And she hadn't changed
that much.

1678
01:20:01,324 --> 01:20:03,052
- I thought if I used
my middle name

1679
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:05,286
that I would just be left alone
by the press,

1680
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,294
because I don't see
any connection at all

1681
01:20:07,396 --> 01:20:08,761
between cloned puppies

1682
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:11,025
and a 32-year-old
sex-in-chains story.

1683
01:20:11,132 --> 01:20:13,566
I'm sorry, but I don't see
the connection.

1684
01:20:13,668 --> 01:20:16,136
But you should have seen
the way Associated Press...

1685
01:20:16,237 --> 01:20:17,966
those people slandered me
so bad.

1686
01:20:18,072 --> 01:20:20,164
In fact, if there's an attorney
listening to this

1687
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,935
that wants a good libel suit,
I've got one.

1688
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:24,067
- "I'll sue anybody," she said,

1689
01:20:24,178 --> 01:20:25,941
"who says I'm
that Joyce McKinney.

1690
01:20:26,046 --> 01:20:27,206
I'm not that Joyce McKinney."

1691
01:20:27,314 --> 01:20:30,214
But she had to admit
that she was.

1692
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:43,185
- I was afraid to have a love
affair of any kind after Kirk.

1693
01:20:43,295 --> 01:20:44,455
I was afraid to kiss a guy.

1694
01:20:44,563 --> 01:20:47,429
So I chose just
to be celibate and...

1695
01:20:47,531 --> 01:20:49,226
as Bridget Bardot once said,

1696
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,527
"I gave my youth to men,

1697
01:20:50,634 --> 01:20:53,262
and my old age I give to dogs
that I trust."

1698
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,234
Dogs and children love me.

1699
01:20:55,338 --> 01:20:56,805
They love Joyce McKinney,

1700
01:20:56,906 --> 01:21:00,342
because they sense in me
an innocence, you know?

1701
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:03,434
They sense in me a gentleness.

1702
01:21:03,545 --> 01:21:05,604
And they don't read
tabloid papers.

1703
01:21:05,714 --> 01:21:07,011
They love me for me.

1704
01:21:07,115 --> 01:21:08,639
- She's not an evil person.

1705
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:13,083
I mean, she's just a bit crazy,
eccentric, self-obsessed,

1706
01:21:13,187 --> 01:21:15,951
and self-involved
and manipulative

1707
01:21:16,057 --> 01:21:18,719
and barking mad, probably,
basically, but...

1708
01:21:18,826 --> 01:21:20,258
- <i>"Barking mad."</i>

1709
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,554
- Yeah.

1710
01:21:21,661 --> 01:21:23,652
- <i>I wish we had that expression</i>
<i>over here.</i>

1711
01:21:23,763 --> 01:21:25,094
- You can have it.

1712
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,067
- You can tell yourself
a million times,

1713
01:21:29,168 --> 01:21:30,658
"God knows the truth."

1714
01:21:30,769 --> 01:21:33,738
And it would be nice
if all you had to deal with

1715
01:21:33,839 --> 01:21:36,501
every day was God.

1716
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:38,838
But you don't.
You have to deal with people.

1717
01:21:45,782 --> 01:21:48,444
I didn't plan on any of
the tabloids destroying my life

1718
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:50,679
or the Mormons or the press
or the wire services.

1719
01:21:50,787 --> 01:21:52,414
That was not in my plans.

1720
01:21:55,358 --> 01:21:56,950
I really didn't have
much choice

1721
01:21:57,059 --> 01:22:01,155
other than to make
some kind of move in my life.

1722
01:22:01,264 --> 01:22:03,527
I had promised God
I was gonna write the book.

1723
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:05,862
Finally.
No matter how much it hurt me.

1724
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:11,601
But someone broke into
my pickup truck.

1725
01:22:11,705 --> 01:22:16,199
I had an entire cab
full of materials.

1726
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,505
I had court cases,
court records.

1727
01:22:18,612 --> 01:22:20,010
I had all
the interview witnesses.

1728
01:22:20,113 --> 01:22:22,047
I had all the exhibits.

1729
01:22:22,148 --> 01:22:25,982
I had the original
modeling portfolio

1730
01:22:26,085 --> 01:22:30,282
which matched the head
that was put on the naked body.

1731
01:22:30,389 --> 01:22:33,517
My whole life is
in those three suitcases.

1732
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:36,025
And this was an old pickup.

1733
01:22:36,128 --> 01:22:38,925
They pried the wing open
with an orange screwdriver,

1734
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,897
and they took coat hangers,

1735
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:44,263
pulled the door open,

1736
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:46,699
took absolutely everything

1737
01:22:46,803 --> 01:22:49,033
documenting the story
I've just told you,

1738
01:22:49,139 --> 01:22:50,538
took everything,

1739
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,870
with the exception of one little
yellow laundry basket

1740
01:22:52,976 --> 01:22:56,240
which had somehow
wedged under the seat.

1741
01:22:58,147 --> 01:22:59,876
At least I had something to show

1742
01:22:59,982 --> 01:23:03,781
that this nightmare ordeal
happened to what was once

1743
01:23:03,885 --> 01:23:06,945
a normal, all-American kid.

1744
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:16,660
"After her miraculous escape
to America,

1745
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:19,525
"Joyce retreats into seclusion
to write a book

1746
01:23:19,632 --> 01:23:20,997
"about her love story.

1747
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,795
"She vows never to marry,

1748
01:23:22,902 --> 01:23:24,927
"knowing fully
that she could never love

1749
01:23:25,037 --> 01:23:26,834
"another man other than Kirk,

1750
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:31,136
"for she will grow old alone.

1751
01:23:31,242 --> 01:23:34,439
"The love that once spanned
an entire continent

1752
01:23:34,546 --> 01:23:36,740
and ocean still exists."

1753
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,652
"Time changes, but the scene
is still the same.

1754
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:49,122
"Joyce is now
a lonely old woman.

1755
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:52,456
"Like Narcissus,
she is pining to death,

1756
01:23:52,748 --> 01:23:54,613
dying of a broken heart."

1757
01:24:10,731 --> 01:24:12,657
That's the conclusion of my book,

1758
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:15,859
but the love has never ended.

1759
01:24:16,305 --> 01:25:16,203

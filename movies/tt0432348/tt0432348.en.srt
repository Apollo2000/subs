00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Help! Anybody here??

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Help!

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,300
- Hello, Michael. I want to play a game.

5
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,800
So far, what you call this
your life,

6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,700
you've been living watching other.

7
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,300
The society calls you a informer,
a rat, a snitch.

8
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I call you unworthy
of the body you posses,

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,700
of the life that have been given.

10
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,300
Now, we will see if you are willing the
to look in world

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,700
better than that, to give up
the one thing you rely on in order

12
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
to go on living.

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,800
The device arround your neck is a
death mask.

14
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,500
The mask is on a spring timer.
If you do not locate the key in time,

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
the mask will close. Think
at this like a carnivorous plant.

16
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you looking right now is
your own body

17
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
no more than two hours ago.

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,900
Don't worry. You were put to sleep
and can't feel a thing.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,400
Taking to account that you are a 
great disadvantage here, I am going 
to give a hint from where hidden

20
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,100
the key. So listen carefully.
The hint is this:

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,300
it's right behind your eye!

22
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,100
How much blood you would share to stay
alive, Michael. Live or die.

23
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,100
- It's your choice.
- Who the fuck are you?!?

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Somebody help me!!

25
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,700
Help me!!

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,800
somebody... please...

27
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,200
No, no, no...

28
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
- Scuze me.
- Can I help you?

29
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,300
I came to look for Daniel Mathews.

30
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Sign this.

31
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,300
Thanks.

32
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,400
Let's go, Daniel.

33
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,100
-Take you long enough.
- I'm sorry, I didn't have a pencil note into my schedule.

34
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,700
- They will press charges, you know?
- Yes, they are assholes.

35
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,600
Of course they are, you stole from them.

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,800
That's why is so great for me. Your 
mother get to keep custody and
I gets to get you in custody.

37
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,100
What is it with you?

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,300
- It's a tough guy, can you stay on them?
- ...

39
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,100
Why you are such cop the whole time?

40
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,300
- Ei, that call beeing a father.
- Trust me, you are better as cop.

41
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,000
I think I should go back to
mom earlier.

42
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,300
- What did you said?
- What, can not hear me?

43
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,800
No, I can not hear you. Say again!

44
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,600
- I think I should go back to mom's...
- Well, then go!!

45
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
Jesus.

46
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,400
- Ei, is Daniel, leave a message.
- Is dad.

47
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,000
Sorry about yesterday. I haven't heard
from you. Give me a call, please.

48
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,900
Daniel...

49
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,700
Sorry sergeant. I thought was my son.

50
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah, I'll be right there.

51
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,300
- What do you got?
- County's best officials are 
working on a deadline.

52
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,000
A woman found a body and called us in.

53
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,900
She said that this place is
abandoned for about two years,

54
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
in spite of the people that live down here.

55
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,700
- Who?
- Homeless supposely.

56
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,500
A group of boys behind drugs.
It is a good place to prick.

57
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,000
- An estimate time of death?
- The forensic just got here.

58
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,200
But one of the officers said
that was your buddy.

59
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,000
He was not my buddy,
it was an informer.

60
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
The officer id him just
looking at him?

61
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,600
No, he was not possitive, for that
wanted you here.

62
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, I will look at his face and I'll 
tell you in two seconds if is him or not.

63
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,600
Very nice, bravo!

64
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,200
Yeah, is Mike.

65
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,000
- Will you tell me about that?
- I thought you want to see it for yourself.

66
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Ok, now I saw it.

67
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,100
I know that it is still early, but
up to now is Jigsaw pattern.

68
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,700
I've seen that. What he want with me?

69
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,400
Well, let's just pretend that is somebody new.

70
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Can you think at anyone who will
do that to your guy?

71
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
He was an informer, Kerry. If you want
a list of possible suspects...

72
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,100
grab a phone book.

73
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,700
Crackheads do not have engineering 
degree. I see that the cause of the death

74
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,400
it is apparent. ..  And you?

75
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Sure, will get an expert.

76
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,300
Look closer, Detective Matthews.

77
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,900
- For what?
- Ask who wrote it.

78
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,600
LOOKS CLOSE, DETECTIVE MATTHEWS.

79
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
<i>Hello Michael, I want to play a game.</i>

80
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,900
<i>So far, what could call this your
life, you've been living watching other.</i>

81
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,300
You and that have
a lot in common, Karen.

82
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah, he like to play games with people.

83
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,500
Scuze me?

84
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,600
Who sell shit like that
again on me in the crime scene?

85
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,900
- I'm not the one telling you he is.
- Doesn't mean I have to take the bait.

86
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,200
- This sound like a full case, allways it is.
- This desk is full of shit.

87
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,300
Well, counting that beyond of that work
and my son's criminal life,

88
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,000
and my f**king divorce,
let's say that am full of things to do.

89
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,600
Well, I'm sorry. I waited that,
maybe, you could bring that on.

90
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,400
- We are partners no more, Kerry.
- If you don't care about our 
partners, how about

91
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,800
the fact that your name is on
the wall? He ask for you.

92
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,300
Is not the first time when some
psychopat call me out.

93
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,400
What about the fact that I'm asking?

94
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,100
I cannot help you.
I am a Jigsaw expert.

95
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,900
When will you stop
beeing a cop?

96
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,200
<i>Look closer, Detective Mathews.</i>

97
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,100
<i>The guy wrote your f**king name on the wall.</i>

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,500
<i>Llook closer, Detective Mathews.</i>

99
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,100
- He ask for you.
- Allright, listen up.

100
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,800
These are the best entry points.

101
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,100
They are the only ones with direct 
street in front of each and good cover.

102
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,500
Now remember, we will make this in 
day light. I don't want to scare civilians.

103
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,900
I've been there, I know the location.
...

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
I want teams of 3.
Let's do this.

105
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,000
Just like in good all days, ha?

106
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,300
What a case big enough how it is.

107
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,500
Like a walk in the lab.

108
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Go, go, go ...

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,300
Team 1 in Broadbaker.
Dark side. We are going in.

110
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Go, go, go ...

111
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,500
Freeze!

112
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Ben, not!

113
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Officer down, officer down.

114
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,400
- The damned armed a trap.
- Officer down, officer down.

115
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,700
- I want the team in here now.
- Go, go!

116
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,900
Guys...

117
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,900
Talk to me, guys.

118
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
Freeze, don't move.

119
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,600
I want to see your hands.
I won't ask again.

120
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Put your hands where can I see them.

121
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Down on your kneels.

122
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,700
- Down on your kneels.
- I'm affraid I cann't do that.

123
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,200
Search him now!

124
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,700
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to one attorney.

125
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
If you can afford, one
will be appointed to you.

126
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
He is clean!

127
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,400
Hi.

128
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,400
Is that close enough?

129
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
Take his ass out from here.

130
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,700
Actually, I will need to remain here

131
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
while you deal with your
problem, Detective Matthews.

132
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,400
- What problem?
- The problem in that room.

133
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Keep him secure.

134
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,600
Clean.

135
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,700
Shit.

136
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,100
- What?
- I don't know.

137
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,700
Shit, I think that's my son.

138
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,600
He got my son.

139
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,800
What the f**k is that?

140
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,100
- Hey, what the fuck is that?
- It's your son Daniel, you 
remember him, don't you?

141
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,700
I know that you piece of shit, but what's
he doing on that fucking monitor?

142
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,600
I have not been looking at the monitors for
some time, so will be a little hard to say.

143
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,900
But I will imagine that he is coward
 in a corner with a look on his face...

144
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,800
- Eric, wait!
- You mother fucker, where is he?

145
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,600
Where is he? That is a problem that 
you have to solve before it is too late.

146
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Daniel has two hours, before the
gas creap into his nervous system,

147
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,000
begings to breaks down his body tisue

148
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,700
and he begin to bleed from
any orifices he has.

149
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Ah, yes! There will be blood.

150
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
- Tells me where he is.

151
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,000
He is at a safe place.

152
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,800
- Erik?
- I need a phone.

153
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
- Erik, listen to me.
- Just give me a phone.

154
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,800
- Looks, everything about this is profile.
- I need to be sure.

155
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,500
<i>  You reach Daniel's phone.
He is not here right now.</i>

156
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,800
- I'm sorry
- Yes, I'm countdown over here.

157
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,300
Give me bomb squad, now.

158
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
Hey...

159
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,900
Hey, wake up.

160
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
Can you hear me?

161
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
She is still breathing.

162
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,700
What is this? House arrest?
Are we in jail?

163
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,900
- No, this ain't jail.
- Yeah, you did a lot of time?

164
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,900
- Yeah, too much.
- Somebody open the fucking door.

165
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,000
I think nobody's listening.
Hey, what the fuck is this?

166
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
Somebody is listening.

167
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,700
No, that type of
cameras don't have sound.

168
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,600
Fuck!

169
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,000
Think that you can wake up in a room
without having idea of where you are?

170
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,500
- I guess you never been drunk before.
- I've been drunk... three years ago in college.

171
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,200
... that is not drunk.
That is kidnapping.

172
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,400
I watched that movie in TV last week.
This guy was a reporter

173
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,500
It was in that war zone, right?
- He will sleep at his hotel room

174
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,200
and when he wakes up, he is in a 
cell, without windows and no light.

175
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,800
And he spend 9 years in that room.

176
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,600
- 9 years? That's nothing. Get over it.
- What do you mean get over it?

177
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
I mean stop bitching about it
and let's do something.

178
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
- I think we should calm down.
- Shut up. I heard something.

179
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,800
What is it?

180
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,300
It's ticking. I hear a ticking.

181
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,600
Hey, calm down. What's your name?

182
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,000
- Amanda. Where am I?
- I don't know.

183
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,900
Nobody knows. We
just woke up here, like you.

184
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
No!!!!!! No!

185
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,600
- It's ok!
- No!!!!

186
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
- F**k!
- What?

187
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
What are you looking for?

188
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,500
What is this?

189
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Everything what we need to know is on this.

190
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>Greetings. And welcome.
I trust that you all are wondering</i>

191
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>where you are. I can assure you that your
location it is not important, what this walls</i>

192
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,300
<i>offer for you is important.
Salvation. If you earn it,</i>

193
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:14,000
<i>three hours from now the door to
this house will open. But unfortunatelly</i>

194
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,400
<i>you have two hours to live. Right now,
you are breathing a deadly nerve agent.</i>

195
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,400
<i>you've been breathing since you
arrived here. As you are familiar</i>

196
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,600
<i>with Tokio subway attacks will know it's
devastating effects on the the human body.</i>

197
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,500
<i>The only way to overcome it and walk
out that door, it is to find the antidote.</i>

198
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,000
<i>somewhere hide arround this house. One
of them is inside that safe in front of you.</i>

199
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,200
<i>You all possess the combination
of the safe. Think hard.</i>

200
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,700
<i>The numbers are in the back of your
mind. The clues of the order</i>

201
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,400
<i>can be found over the rainbow. Once you 
will realize what you have in common</i>

202
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,400
<i>you will be in better understanding
why you are here.</i>

203
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,300
<i>X mark the spot of the clue.
So, look carefully.</i>

204
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,200
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

205
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,700
- Who is this?
- What did you mean?

206
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,400
- How did you know where to find this?
- That is bullshit.

207
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,600
Do not attempt to use this key
on the door to this room.

208
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,900
- Fuck his rulles.
- Yeah, fuck this. That's a good idea.

209
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,900
- No, no, this is not a good idea.
- So what will gonna do?

210
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,800
- Will sit here?
- The note said not to use the key.

211
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,900
Who does give a shit about the note?
This all is a fucking big bad joke.

212
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,300
And I'm about to end it.

213
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,300
Better start to talk right now.
What is this?

214
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,600
- It's a game.
- Ain't no fucking game.

215
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,500
- His face was just blown out.
- He is testing us.

216
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,700
- Who is testing us?
- Jigsaw.

217
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,100
- Who the hell is Jigsaw?
- Do you read the fucking news?

218
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,500
- No, who is he?
- He is a serial killer.

219
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,100
No, is not. He is testing us.
He wants us to survive this

220
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,500
but we have to play by the fucking rules.

221
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I will ask again,
how does that know all this?

222
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,900
Because I've played before.

223
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,800
The tactics team is coming now
to discover where the video come.

224
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,100
What do you want from me?

225
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,800
- A little of your time, detective.
- I don't have time.

226
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,700
You asked me when I want and I 
told you. Believe me when I tell you, 
your son is in a lot of troule.

227
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,900
If I'll give a litlle of my time,
what then?

228
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,500
I just want to talk to you. Everyone
else must leave. Those are my conditions.

229
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,400
No, it's a crime scene.
Nobody leaves.

230
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,300
They don't have to leave the building,
they just have to live this area

231
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,400
long enough for me to talk with you.

232
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
If agree to with that, then you
will see your son again.

233
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,100
If I don't see more my son again, I 
swear to God, I'll rip your fucking head off.

234
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,100
I don't intend to mock you, officer,
but I'm cancer patient.

235
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,200
Have could you possibly put me in
anymore pain than I'm already in?

236
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,100
Just get them here now.

237
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,900
Tag team is on the way. They will
discover from where the video comes

238
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,300
In one hour, maybe two.
- Consider that he wants to 
talk with him alone.

239
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,900
- Then maybe should talk with him.
- Well fuck that. Five minutes, 
old school method.

240
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,400
- He's not gona respond to force,
you know that.
- Don't underestimate my methods.

241
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,900
I have been working in that
in case since the first day.

242
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,400
I have spending all the ways
to get the pieces together.

243
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,100
Maybe that's why you don't
have a family for yourself

244
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
and you don't understand this
man what's going through.

245
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,900
- Look...
- No, no, don't talk with me.

246
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,700
Listen, you already lost your son
sometime before because of me.

247
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,500
This won't happen again.

248
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,000
That is bullshit.
What we're gonna do?

249
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,200
Just deal with him.
Buy us more time.

250
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,600
You can win this Erik.
You can beat him.

251
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,700
<i> ... to find the antidote. There are several
dispersed in the house.</i>

252
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,900
<i>  One of them is inside of the safe in
front to you. All you have the</i>

253
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,700
<i>  combination for the safe. Think hard.
The numbers are behind your mind.</i>

254
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,400
<i>  they Think enough. The numbers
they are behind their minds.</i>

255
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>  The clues for the order can be...</i>

256
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,100
Shit.

257
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,800
Hey, wait for a little.
Where you going?

258
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
I'm gona find an antidote and
I'll get out rom here.

259
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,900
Antidote? Face, you were already in the
joint. You talk with owner of the chamber

260
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,000
you know that is no
antidote for that shit.

261
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,200
Look at this. The doors
are locked.

262
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Did you hear that? It is wood. Plaster.
It is not a fortress. It is a fucking house.

263
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,100
I am only saying let's just take our
time and come with a game plan.

264
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Well, you'll came up with a game plan?
All right? Now I'm going out of here.

265
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,700
Look.

266
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
- You ok?
- Yes, I'm fine.

267
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,500
I won't do that if I're you!

268
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,400
You don't know what
behind that fucking door.

269
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,800
Fuck. Shit.

270
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,800
They leave the room.

271
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,700
ok?

272
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,100
- Let's talk.
- Sit down Eric.

273
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
I want to play a game.

274
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,800
The rules are simple. What you
have to do is sit here and

275
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,200
to talk with me. Listen to me.
Because for the enough time

276
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
you will find your son
in a safe and secure state.

277
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,100
We didn't go properly
introduced. My name is John.

278
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,000
- How you like to be called Jigsaw.
- No...

279
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,500
They were the police and the press
that created that name Jigsaw.

280
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,900
I never ecuraged to claim that. The
jigsaw piece that I cut for my subjects

281
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,200
was more to be a symbol that at 
that subject was missing something, 
a vital piece of the

282
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,100
human puzzle: the
survival instinct.

283
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,600
This is all really, really interesting,
John. Right now I really want 
you to talk with me...

284
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,800
I am talking to you.
You are not listening.

285
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,400
- Don't forget the rules.
- I am listening to you.

286
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,500
and all of this is the same sick
fucking bullshit that come from
 you every two seconds

287
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
in each interrogation that I ever
did to all fucking people.

288
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,700
It is an interesting approach
to placeMarkus.

289
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,700
You didn't suppose to convinceing me that

290
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm your friend?

291
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,900
To lead me in a false sense of
security to confide me in you?

292
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,200
It is difficult to follow the manual when
you have my son, John.

293
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:45,200
The manual? What I'm doing to 
you right now? What would have 
made five years ago?

294
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,500
Would you have followed the manual?
Would you broken my jaw 
with a flashlight?

295
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,300
You seem to know a lot about me.

296
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,900
I know you once considered
a fearless policeman.

297
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,000
Do you fell a lot much safer now,
that you only seat behind the desk?

298
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,400
- I am feeling a lot of things right now.
- But you feel alive, that's what you fell.

299
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,700
And that's what you want.

300
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,500
Kindly... get me a glass of water?

301
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,400
I would very much appreciate this.

302
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
Fuck.

303
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,400
Well we estabiles that the macho
bullshit ain't gona open the door,

304
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,600
.. any more suggestions?
- Look who is talking.

305
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,500
The only door you know
to open is between your legs.

306
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,500
- Shut the hell up, all right?
- You shut the hell up!

307
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,400
- Imbecile ...
- The hell is ...

308
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,300
Ok, nobody take shit from
nobody. We estabilish that.

309
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,000
- Did you find anything?
- No, nothing.

310
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,000
- That tattoo, is Joliete. Right?
- Yeah, so?

311
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,000
- I did get restrain in there myself.
- Are you proud?

312
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,300
And you, what is your
corectional facility of your choice?

313
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,000
What is your point?

314
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,400
My point is, you were not like
that durring the highschool, right?

315
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,600
That make 3 of us that done time.
I think we should concentrate
 more on that tape

316
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,800
cause that tape said, we have
more in common that we know.

317
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,800
- I said, the three of us ......
- Hey!

318
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,000
I found a door over here.

319
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,900
I need a flashlight.

320
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,100
Over there.

321
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,200
Fuck.

322
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,900
Oh, shit!!

323
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,900
- Ei! Damm, kid.
- Sorry.

324
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,000
What the fuck is OBI?

325
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,000
Obi, is my name.

326
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,800
Hello Obi, I want to play a game.

327
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,200
Per years you have burnt those 
arround you enough lies and deceipts.

328
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,500
Now you have a chance to redeem
your soul for the games what 
you played for the other.

329
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,200
For playing one of mine.

330
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,600
Inside of the equipment there are
two antidotes for the poison

331
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,400
that runs in your veins. One is
a present of
mine for helping me to kidnap

332
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,900
the other ones. The second is yours
to donate. However, one of 
them will have a price.

333
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,800
Remembers that: once you are in hell,
only the devil can help you.

334
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,300
Wait a minute, what's that mean?
To kidnap the others.

335
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,500
- It was him that put us here.

336
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,500
the car... it was...

337
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:48,700
I knew that I knew him. You 
were the last person that I 
saw before I wake up here.

338
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,300
You did this.

339
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,000
Are you sure is him?
It better be sure.

340
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,400
I am sure.

341
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,900
You've done the same.
I did what I had to be done.

342
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,300
I will give you a choice.

343
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,200
- You have 5 seconds to get us out of here.
- I don't know the way out.

344
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,600
Bullshit. You put us in here,
you get us out from here.

345
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,900
- No, I can't.
- Then you are dead.

346
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,000
- Sorry.
- No, wait. Listen to me.

347
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,000
We got two antidotes in that
oven. We are wasting time here.

348
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
Wasting time? Are you kiddin' me?

349
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,100
- He kidnapp me in the middle of the night.
- We know even know 
what is in those syringes.

350
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,600
- Do you want to stick yourself to find out?
- Yeah.

351
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,500
Anyway, who will get them?

352
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,800
...

353
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,900
Right now, you go in there

354
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,700
or I kill where you stay.

355
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,300
If you will threat me with a knife,
at least to cut me a little.

356
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,900
I guss I'll go in there to get those needles.
If I'll get one.

357
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,600
- One for me.
- Hurry up.

358
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,600
Come on, man! Guys can pray
for this one.

359
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,600
Thank you, hommie.
Here we go.

360
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,400
- What the fuck is happening?
- Open the door.

361
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,600
- Open the door.

362
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,400
- It is locked.
- Open the door.

363
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,600
Open the fucking door.

364
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,400
- Come on, get him out of there.
- The door!

365
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,300
I will try.
I don't get to open.

366
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,200
Come out of there.

367
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Use your coat.
Use your fucking coat.

368
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,300
- Come on. Open the door.
- Stop that.

369
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,700
Come on!

370
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
- Stop it!

371
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,500
- It's a window here.
- He has the antidote.

372
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,100
- Stop that.
- Remove him then.

373
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,300
Stop that!!

374
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,900
Hang on man, will
get you out.

375
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,800
Stop it, stop it...

376
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,500
Stop that...

377
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,600
Yo, fuck away. Move, move!!

378
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,100
Shit!

379
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:17,400
The needles. He lost the needles.
I want the fucking needles!!

380
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,800
- Calm down.
- Fuck!.

381
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,000
The needles are fucking hot.

382
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,900
He had a choice.

383
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,300
Another one down, Kerry. How
much time will time lose with that bastard?

384
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,200
We are not wasting time,
we are doing what should do.

385
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,400
Didn't look like this to me!

386
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,100
You see, detective, the Darwin theory of 
the evolution, the survival of the more fort,

387
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,200
based on his little trip to Galapagos
is no longer applied on this planet.

388
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,900
We have human race to test
the edge or will to survive.

389
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,300
What the fuck do you want?

390
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,100
I'm trying to remain calm, isn't it?
And your son is walking 
arround on those monitors.

391
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,600
I cannot give what you want
if I don't know what the fuck it is.

392
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,300
You know what it is.
Just remember the rules.

393
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,900
No, you said you want to talk.
Then you said that you 
want to play a game.

394
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,300
You are talking, but
it means nothing.

395
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,000
- What is the cure for the cancer, Erik?
- What?

396
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,800
- The cure for the cancer. What is it?
- I don't know what is.

397
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,800
but I know is not to kill and to torture
people for your sick fucking pleasure.

398
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,600
I never murdered nobody in my
life. The decision are up to them.

399
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,900
Well, to put a gun to someone head
and force him to pull the gun

400
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,700
it is still murder.

401
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,900
Since when the use
of force solve a problem of your?

402
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,100
Why you're so desperate
to get your son back?

403
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,100
'Cause he is my son.

404
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,300
When was the last time when
you said to him that you love him?

405
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,300
<i>  Well, then go!</i>

406
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,300
Seems to me that closing son's death
is causing you to act.

407
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,100
When is your willing
to do that when a life is at stake?

408
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,700
I always loved my son,
that's never changed.

409
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,100
Mmm, it's changed now.

410
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,000
The knowledge of the death
changes everything. If I will tell you 
the exact date and time of your

411
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,500
own death, it will shut your world completely.

412
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,700
I know.

413
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,600
Can you imagine what is fell like to
have someone sit you down...

414
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,900
- John Cramer?
.. and tell you that you are dying?

415
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,600
The gravity of that?

416
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,300
That the clock is ticking for you.

417
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,300
In one second, the world
is crack open.

418
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,600
You look at things differently,
you smell things differently.

419
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,600
You savor everything, either a glass of
water or a walk in the park.

420
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,000
The clock is ticking, John.

421
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,300
Most people have the luxury
not knowing when that clock will go off.

422
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,800
And the irony of that is that keeps
for really living their lives.

423
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,000
It keep them drinking that glass
of water but not really tasting it.

424
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,400
You can still fix that, John.

425
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, but you can fix you?

426
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,100
I'm not fixable.
I have cancer.

427
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,500
You think that the cancer is
an excuse for what you done?

428
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,000
No.

429
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,200
The cancer is all what
started me and my work.

430
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,800
It was the moment I decided
to end my life,

431
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,200
and start a new with my work.

432
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
That brought meaning to it.

433
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,400
I literally, driving myself
to suicide. I failed.

434
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,000
My body is not strong enough
to fight cancerous cells.

435
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,400
Than I have lived for a plundge of ...

436
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,800
And for my amazement,
I was alive.

437
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,000
And I was determined to spend
the rest of my days

438
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,100
testing the fabric of
human nature.

439
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Do you understand, Erik?

440
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,700
You have the chance to do
something right now, John.

441
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Just tell where my son is.
I will help you.

442
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,700
I don't need your help, and I can
tell you that you stil don't understand.

443
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,000
Those who don't appreciate life,
do not deserve life.

444
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,000
- My son appreciate his life.
- But do you appreciate yours?

445
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,400
- Do appreciate your son's?
- Bullshit!

446
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,400
Don't forget the rules.

447
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
Will help to find your son.

448
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,400
Where are you?

449
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
No, we don't have 15 minutes. We need
that location to the video feed.

450
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,900
Hey, we should stop, ok?

451
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,400
Ok?

452
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,700
It is the second time when
I wake up in this shithole.

453
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,400
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.

454
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,800
but only if I want to. It's still
so much things to do.

455
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
So many people have to talk to me.

456
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,200
This can be it.

457
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,500
It's not.

458
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,000
Amanda, you said that
you survive this, right?

459
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,100
Do what?

460
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,600
This guy. Whatever is he doing ...

461
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,200
you said that you played
before. You survived.

462
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,000
- Yeah.
- So, we can survive.

463
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,400
Yeah.

464
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,600
Amanda, why you defend him?

465
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,000
Because I was a fucking junkie.

466
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,100
But the funny is,
I pass the little test.

467
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,000
If you passed the test,
why you are back here?

468
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,500
I was mean with myself.

469
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,200
- How long has been ...
- I started in jail.

470
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,700
- What were arrested for?
- Possesion.

471
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,300
But, if I said that...

472
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,200
Maybe you should talk with the
cop who arrested me.

473
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,400
- I guess you were never been
arrested before. - No.

474
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,300
I've been in trouble few times,
you know, and some other stuff.

475
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,300
My father is the ...

476
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,200
He is a real hard ass.

477
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,300
He probably is right now looking for me,
just to kick my ass for dissapereance.

478
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,100
- Yeah, probably.

479
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,100
We found a door. Come on.

480
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,300
Come on. We have to go.

481
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,200
It the only one without a lock,
but we can't get it open.

482
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,000
- How's going?
- It's stuck in some thing.

483
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,800
- Here, let me try it. Come on!
- Take it easy.

484
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,200
Back up, allright?

485
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
If is stuck,
it's a trap.

486
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,500
- Man, the whole house is a trap.
- Somebody doesn't want us in that room.

487
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,600
- Now what?
- I will make it back, ok?

488
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,500
- What else will do?
- We got 3 minutes to get it done.

489
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,800
<i>Hello Xavier, I want to play a game.</i>

490
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:35,600
<i>The game I want to play is very similar
with what you give that 
played as a drug dealer.</i>

491
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,200
<i>The game of offering 
hope to the desperate
for a price. I think we can agree</i>

492
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,100
<i>that your situation is desperate.
So I offer you hope.</i>

493
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,800
<i>The price you to pay is that you must
crawl in the same pit</i>

494
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,700
you force yours customers into.
By entering this room,

495
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,900
<i>a timer has been started</i>

496
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,700
<i>When the time expired, the door
in front of you will be locked forever.</i>

497
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,300
<i>-Guys!
- You must have find the key before</i>

498
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,800
<i>that the time runs out. Can you unlocked,
with the dreams that are locked inside?</i>

499
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,200
<i>I will give you just one hint
that's where the key is.</i>

500
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,000
<i>It will be as finding a
needle in the heist.</i>

501
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,600
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

502
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,400
Somebody is going there.

503
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,000
Nobody is fucking going in there...

504
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
- No, no...
- You are sick..

505
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,700
- What are you doing?!

506
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,600
- Stop, nooo !!
- Put her down!

507
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,400
Help me!!

508
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,700
Shit!

509
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,400
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

510
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,600
- We don't have time.
- O, shit.

511
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,400
- 'the fuck is wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

512
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,600
- You are fucking mind!
- Hurry up.

513
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,900
Keep going. We don't have time.

514
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Keep fucking looking.

515
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,600
- Come on!
- Fuck you!

516
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,300
Somebody help her.

517
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,300
'the fuck, guys?

518
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,600
No, no, nooooo ! ....

519
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,800
Come on.

520
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,600
Fuck.

521
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,300
- That's enough.
- That's no nealry enough.

522
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,300
Ahh, stop that bullsit.

523
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,800
Did you hear that tape?

524
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,700
He knows about us, our names.

525
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,300
There is something that
we are not seeing.

526
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,600
Yeah.

527
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,500
You said you
three you been there.

528
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,500
Make it 4.

529
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,300
- For what?
- Does it matter?

530
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,700
Anybody else?

531
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,700
What about you? You got juvenile
written all over you.

532
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,800
- No, never been.
- All right.

533
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,400
- Let's talk this out anymore.
- No more talking.

534
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,100
The only thing you people haveing
in common is holding me back.

535
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,900
I'm out.

536
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,700
- Where is that damm tactical team?
- Will be here any second.

537
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,800
I'm not listening to this any more.
Another second is to fucking long.

538
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,000
I know how this guy works, ok?
He is playing a game.

539
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,200
That mean we have to stay
a little bit longer.

540
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,900
Take a look at the clock.

541
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,600
You need something for that box,
or his son will end up in one.

542
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,600
His work. He want
to get done, that's how he's doing.

543
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,200
He wants
to be heard, to be studied.

544
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,000
Right, destroy his work.

545
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,500
How will get your conviction
without all those evidence, Eric?

546
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,400
- Don't mean a shit, big deal.
- So go ahead, destroy it.

547
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,400
I will!

548
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,300
Just knows will not save your
son if you do it.

549
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,800
- You kill my son, I kill you.
- Oh, yeah?

550
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,900
We both know what
sort of person you are.

551
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,500
- That sort of person that gun down

552
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,900
an unarmed suspect. The sort 
of person who plants evidence 
in order to obtain a conviction.

553
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,200
That sort of person that is abandoned
by the wife and hated by his son.

554
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,600
Shut the fuck up!

555
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,400
- He said he found a trace
through satellite.

556
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,900
Your tag team has arrived.
Just in time.

557
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,700
We right now found
the source of that video.

558
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,900
- Somebody haven't told you, Eric.
- I tired listening to you.

559
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,300
Maybe I can just show it to you.
Unfortunately, it be difficult 
for me to get it

560
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,600
myself, so you perhaps could ask the
people who are listening to that walkie

561
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,900
that he can get it for me.

562
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Brown desk. Second drawer.

563
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:16,000
You may not remember all those people.
But I am sure they remembers you.

564
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:23,800
You were the arresting officer of 
all they cases. And you were the 
one who plant all the evidence used

565
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,700
to obtain their convection. You 
are the one who put them 
away. Your son is playing a game

566
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:34,800
with a lot of people that don't like you
very much, detective. It will be a shame

567
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,700
that they discover who he was?

568
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,300
<i>  You all possess the combination
for the safe. Think hard.</i>

569
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,100
<i>  The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

570
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,800
<i>  The clue of the order can be
found, over the rainbow.</i>

571
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,200
Bitch.

572
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,500
- What are you doing?
- I haven't decide yet.

573
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,500
- You know, the others are scared of you.
- Good.

574
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,700
You and me... we keep going on
each other like back in the yard,

575
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,300
or we can come together and
figure out who is doing that to us.

576
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:24,100
You and others do what you want.
I already found what the fuck to do.

577
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,000
You remind me of me. You don't know
what kind of fuck up situation you in,

578
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:38,000
you have to find yourself a enemy.
You know want? I've got enemies.

579
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:44,400
Outside these fucking walls,
bro. And they are looking for me.

580
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,000
And if they will not find me, they go
after those close to me.

581
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,200
My family.

582
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:58,700
- You understand?
- No, I don't understand.

583
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:05,900
It's just me, and that's the way
I like it. Now, turn around.

584
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,800
- What?
- Turn around.

585
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,900
You son ...

586
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,100
- Oh, shit.
-No, we can't stop.

587
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,000
We've been here for two hour. If is
what's said true, then we got one hour

588
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,700
and that front door will open.
- We won't gona make it that long.

589
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,100
-Possible winning that's usual.
- She know what is talking about.

590
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,600
- Oh, yeah?
- X mark the spot.

591
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,300
- What?

592
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,900
X mark the spot is the answer.

593
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,500
What are you doing
with him?

594
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,500
- This is your father?
- Do you know him?

595
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,300
- Yeah. He put me away.
He set me up.

596
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,000
Tell me that is not your father.

597
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,100
I cannot trust in none of you.

598
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,900
You two are on your own.

599
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,200
Now we know what we have in common.

600
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,700
Please, I didn't know.

601
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,300
Mary Kate, Amanda... where are you?

602
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,600
Please, don't leave me.

603
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,600
We are moved.

604
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,900
Mary Kate, Amanda...
I found a way out.

605
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,500
Eight.

606
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,900
Mary Kate...

607
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,700
Don't run.

608
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,600
Eric. Eric. No!

609
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,400
We tried in your way.

610
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,500
Give me a fucking way!

611
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,200
Eric.

612
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,500
Fuck him.

613
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,300
I won't go now until
your son is pissing blood.

614
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,700
That's for their methods
that Daniel is condemned.

615
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,800
Help. Help me!

616
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,700
- Oh my God. Jonas.

617
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Help me. Help me!

618
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:25,500
Help.

619
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,300
- Please...
- It's ok.

620
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,900
- Help me.
- Ok...

621
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,600
Help!!

622
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,800
Help!

623
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,300
Help me!

624
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,400
Amanda.

625
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,600
Nobody is listening anymore, asshole.

626
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,500
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!

627
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,500
Here we go. You will
tell me where is he now?

628
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,000
Where?

629
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,500
Say it again.

630
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,900
Game over.

631
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,800
I'll take you to the house.

632
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,100
You will take me right now. Right now.

633
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,600
I'll take you, nobody else.

634
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,300
Me and you.

635
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,200
How we get out of here?

636
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,300
There is a button in the wall.
Better hurry.

637
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
There is no much time left.

638
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,400
Get a way out, now!

639
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,700
Go, go, go.

640
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,600
<i>Signal aquired</i>

641
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,900
We got them.

642
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,800
This is Kerry. They are both gone.

643
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,500
If I don't find my son,
I swear to God...

644
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,200
Kerry, they're gone.

645
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,000
Kerry, we got a lock on the house.

646
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,000
- Rigg, we got it.
- What?

647
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,700
- 237, Northwide, Crescent.
- 237, Northwide, Crescent. Got it.

648
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,500
Where to now?

649
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,800
Straight ahead.

650
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,500
Come on, where are you?

651
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,800
It turns right in Outbreak.

652
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,400
Open the fucking door.
Open the door.

653
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:00,500
There is nowhere to go.
I only want the numbers behind the head.

654
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,400
There's no where to go,
open the door, Amanda.

655
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,500
I can't hold it.

656
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,800
Come on, let me in.

657
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,500
- Open the door, come on!

658
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,800
Left to the next street.

659
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,800
Last house to the left.

660
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,600
Shit!

661
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,900
-What is Amanda?
- It's a door. A fucking door...

662
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,000
You have nowhere to go.

663
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,000
- Help me move this thing.

664
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,300
- Come on, Amanda.
- Shit, it's locked.

665
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,400
Let me in.
Come on, open the door.

666
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,000
Key, remember when we found
the tape recorder.

667
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,900
Where is it?
Where is it?

668
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,100
- Fuck.
- Jonas... Jonas have it last.

669
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,800
- Come on, Amanda.
- Find it. Fast.

670
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,600
Come on!

671
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,900
Open the door.
Let me in.

672
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:48,500
Eric, you got to need this key
to get inside the house.

673
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,800
No.

674
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,200
Where are we?

675
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,600
Run, run!

676
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,100
Daniel?

677
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,300
Daniel.

678
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,400
Daniel, we got to go.

679
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,300
- We got to go!.
- Run!

680
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,300
OK, let's go... let's go.

681
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,700
Go, go, go!

682
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,700
We're in.

683
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,400
Daniel.

684
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,700
Secure the area.

685
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,800
- Kerry, we're in the house.
- Can not see you, sergeant.

686
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,700
I repeat, can not see you.

687
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,300
I repeat, I can not see you.

688
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,300
- Where the hell are they?
- Where is the ...

689
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,900
Rigg, do you copy?

690
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,400
<i>  Hello Mr. Whannel, follow your heart.</i>

691
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,100
<i>  Best to check there first.
What the fuck is that?</i>

692
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,900
<i>  My name is very fucking 
confused. What's your name?
- Somebody kill ya, Mr. Lawrence.</i>

693
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,000
<i>  we should cut our currents.
What are you doing to me?</i>

694
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,100
<i>  No!</i>

695
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,200
<i>  He wants to get ...
- No, oh my God.</i>

696
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,700
Daniel.

697
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,200
Oh, no. Don't leave me.

698
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,100
Please.

699
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,000
- He is gone.
- Doesn't matter.

700
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,100
What I want to know is on the
back of his neck. Later is yours.

701
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:28,000
You still don't know your own number.
How will gonna get it if I don't tell you?

702
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,100
Daniel.

703
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,400
Fuck!

704
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,800
Daniel.

705
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,900
I still can not see you, sergeant.
Rigg, do you copy?

706
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,600
- Left side, clear.
- Right side, clear.

707
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,700
All clear.

708
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,900
Look after you, sergeant.
I repeat, can not see you.

709
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,200
- It's no live.
- Kerry, we are in the wrong fucking house.

710
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,700
- We are wasting our fucking time.
- Get them out of there.

711
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,500
Let's go.

712
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,600
Daniel.

713
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,100
Daniel.

714
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,100
Daniel.

715
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:40,400
Hello Eric, you probably don't 
remember me, but you 
changed my life once.

716
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:44,300
You send me to prison.
I was guilty of a lot of things.

717
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,100
but not the drug charge what
you framed before.

718
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,800
You don't know what that
do when you are locked away.

719
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,200
The second time
somebody changed my life

720
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,500
I was guilty.
- Hello, Amanda.

721
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,200
... but my life was saved that day.
- Did you say that you survived 
that, right?

722
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,100
Yeah.

723
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:09,900
I found myself father. A leader.
A teacher.

724
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,000
You must meet death...

725
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,800
if you want to be reborn.

726
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,300
- Help me.
- What is the cure for the cancer, Eric?

727
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,600
Those who don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

728
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:28,600
The cure for death itself?
The answer is immortality.

729
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,100
Daniel!

730
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,100
By creating a legacy, I'm living a life
who's remembers

731
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,600
you become immortal. Somehow,
the tables are turned.

732
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,500
- He ask for you.
- What do you want?

733
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,400
- I told you...
- He wants us to survive this.

734
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,600
I want to play a game.

735
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,000
- We have to play by the fucking the rules.
- The rules are simple.

736
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,000
What you have to do is
sit here and to talk to me.

737
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,500
If you'll do long enough, you will
found your son in a safe and secure state.

738
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,100
- What the fuck is this?
- Your son Daniel, do you remember him?

739
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,800
My father is a hard ass.

740
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,600
You are unworthy of the life
that have been given.

741
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,000
Now that your son faces death,
is cause you to forget all his sins.

742
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,000
Because we are only willing to do that
when his life is in danger?

743
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,800
Daniel!

744
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,900
- I don't listen to you.
- Don't forget the rules.

745
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,900
- Shut the fuck up.
- He is playing a game.

746
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,500
- He is not saying shit!
- That's the sort of person you are.

747
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,700
I won't go in hell until
that your son is pissing blood.

748
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,300
I'll take you to the house.

749
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,100
Somebody didn't told you, Eric.

750
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,700
It is I who will carry on
John work after he dies.

751
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,900
Daniel!

752
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,200
So go ahead. Destroy.

753
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:47,800
And you are my first test subject.

754
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,700
Now you are off away.
Helpless and alone.

755
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,500
- Game over.

756
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,600
I'll fucking kill you!!.

757
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,000
Biiitch!!

758
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,900
You fucking bitch!!!!!!

759
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,800
I'll fucking kill you!!

760
01:23:10,305 --> 01:24:10,546

2
00:01:57,377 --> 00:02:01,172
God, she's beautiful.
She's got the prettiest eyes.

3
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:03,758
She looks so sexy in that sweater.

4
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,054
I just want to be alone with her
and hold her and kiss her

5
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,309
and tell her how much l love her
and take care of her.

6
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:15,312
Stop it, you idiot!
She's your wife's sister.

7
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:20,734
l can't help it. l'm consumed by her.
lt's been months now.

8
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:24,362
l dream about her,
l think about her at the office.

9
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:28,283
Oh, Lee. What am l gonna do?

10
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,330
l hear myself mooning over you,
and it's disgusting.

11
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,417
Before, when she squeezed
past me in the doorway

12
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,086
and l smelt that perfume
on the back ofher neck...

13
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:43,089
Jesus, l thought l was gonna swoon.

14
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:49,346
Easy. You're a dignified financial advisor.
lt doesn't look good for you to swoon.

15
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,847
Elliot?

16
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:53,558
- Elliot? Sweetheart?
- Mm?

17
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:57,771
Have you tried these? They're wonderful.
Holly and her friend made them.

18
00:02:57,896 --> 00:03:01,066
Fantastic. Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

19
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:04,069
l know, l know.
She has all the cooking talent.

20
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:07,155
- No, you've got tons as well.
- l've eaten five of these.

21
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:11,034
- Holly, why don't you open a restaurant?
- Mm, we practically are.

22
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,081
Well... not a restaurant, but...
April and l are gonna do some catering.

23
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,541
- What? You're kidding.
- No, we decided.

24
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,543
Perfect.

25
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,963
We like to cook for friends, so...
until an acting job comes through,

26
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:26,383
we could make money
doing private parties.

27
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:30,595
- Great idea. That's where your talent lies.
- l know.

28
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,056
Get outta here.
Could l speak to you privately?

29
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,350
l'm her husband. She tells me anything.

30
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:38,728
Hannah, l need more money.
Don't get upset.

31
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,690
- l never get upset over that.
- This is the last time.

32
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:44,734
- l'm keeping strict accounts.
- Please, don't insult me.

33
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,654
- Someday l'll pay it back.
- l know. How much do you need?

34
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,864
- $2,000.
- Uh-huh?

35
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,244
l know it's a lot, but April and l have
this catering idea. lt's gonna be great.

36
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,121
You admit we're great cooks.

37
00:03:56,246 --> 00:04:00,250
ln order to get started, there are a few
things to buy and some old debts to pay.

38
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,169
Just tell me one thing.
Are we talking cocaine again?

39
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:07,215
l swear. We've already got some
requests to do dinner parties.

40
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,886
Obviously l'm not gonna be a caterer
for ever. We both still go on auditions.

41
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:15,598
Something could come up at any
moment, but the parties are at night.

42
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,102
l can still take my acting class.
l haven't done drugs in a year.

43
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:23,773
A whimpering, simpering child again

44
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,695
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered...

45
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,490
Mom and Dad are floating
down memory lane again.

46
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:36,286
- Have you tried Holly's shrimp puffs?
- They're fantastic.

47
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:40,915
l need an antihistamine for Mom's asthma
before she turns into Camille.

48
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,043
Mom's Camille every morning.

49
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:46,588
- At least she isn't drinking.
- Doesn't she look great in that dress?

50
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,965
She knows it
cos she's flirting with the men.

51
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:53,678
When she's 80 she may stop straightening
her garter belt when there's a guy around.

52
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:58,350
- Where's the antihistamine?
- Elliot's got them somewhere.

53
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,770
- Frederick didn't come with her.
- When does he ever?

54
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:05,440
He's such an angry...
He's such a depressive.

55
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:08,860
- l thought she was moving out.
- l don't know.

56
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,863
A pill he is

57
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,491
But still he is

58
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:19,579
All mine and l'll keep him until he is

59
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:21,998
Bewitched...

60
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,084
Watch out, you guys! Beep-beep!

61
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:28,338
Your kids are so adorable.
lt gets so lonely on the holidays.

62
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,925
Oh, gosh. Well, that's why
l invited Phil Gammage tonight.

63
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,261
- Hannah, he's such a loser.
- He's not a loser at all.

64
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,723
- He's the head of Daisy's school.
- He reminds me of lchabod Crane.

65
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:41,726
His Adam's apple jumps up and down
when he gets excited.

66
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,896
He's a lot better than your ex-husband.
He's got a good job.

67
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,232
- He's not a dope addict.
- Give me a break.

68
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:49,901
- Am l interrupting any sister talk?
- Mm-mm.

69
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:53,446
Good, because there are no
interesting single men at this party.

70
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:58,702
Well, listen. Maybe April would like Phil.
Phil Gammage? The tall guy?

71
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:01,871
Oh, yeah, l met Phil.
He looks like lchabod Crane?

72
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:04,874
l love that. That's my type. No, really!

73
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,545
No, we mustn't get discouraged.

74
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,091
Hannah will invite some men over
who don't look like lchabod Crane.

75
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:18,263
Maybe at Christmas, or if not Christmas,
New Year's, or maybe next New Year's.

76
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:19,514
Ouch!

77
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,933
- lt must be here someplace.
- Oh, you know?

78
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,436
l love that book you lent me,
The Easter Parade.

79
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,272
You were right.
lt had very special meaning for me.

80
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:29,524
How's Frederick? He didn't come.

81
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,360
You know. One of his moods.
But it wasn't a bad week.

82
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,654
- He sold a picture.
- Oh, great.

83
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,366
Yeah, it was one of his better drawings,
a very beautiful nude study.

84
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,160
Actually, it was of me.

85
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:44,664
lt's a funny feeling to know you're being
hung naked in a stranger's living room.

86
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,585
But you can't tell it's me, although...
You're turning all red, Elliot.

87
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,837
Oh, really?

88
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:53,715
- So... what else? What are you up to?
- l don't know.

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,884
My unemployment cheques
are running out.

90
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,803
l may do a course at Columbia
with the last of my savings.

91
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,056
- Like...?
- l don't know, exactly.

92
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,224
Sociology, psychology, maybe...

93
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,644
l always thought
l might work with children.

94
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,855
lncidentally, l always have
clients furnishing places.

95
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:13,234
Someone might be interested
in buying art. Shall l call you?

96
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:16,738
Yeah, sure. Frederick would
really be grateful for a sale.

97
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,657
Hey, guys! Dinner's ready!

98
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:20,909
You look so beautiful. Doesn't she?

99
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:24,829
l bumped into your ex-husband on
the street the other day. He's still crazy.

100
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:28,541
- He was on his way to get a blood test.
- Mickey's such a hypochondriac.

101
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:32,712
l wonder how he'd handle if there was
ever anything really wrong with him.

102
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:36,591
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

103
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,969
Dad...

104
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:42,305
- Dad...
- No, now this is a toast...

105
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,350
This is a toast. This is a toast.

106
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:52,357
You know, this beautiful Thanksgiving
dinner was all prepared by Hannah.

107
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:55,485
l had a little help from Mavis.
Also, Holly and April...

108
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,364
No, no. You did it. She did it.

109
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,200
And we drink to her,

110
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:08,039
and we congratulate her on her wonderful
accomplishment during this last year.

111
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:11,209
Her great success in A Doll's House.

112
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,174
l played Nora.
l'd hate to tell you what year.

113
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,554
And it's very difficult to behave
like Torvald's little chipmunk

114
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:26,474
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

115
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,729
Now, l think that lbsen would have been
damned proud of our Hannah.

116
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:32,689
Speech! Speech!

117
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:35,567
No, no. l've been very, very lucky.

118
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,069
When l had the kids,
l decided to stop working

119
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:42,198
and just devote myself to having
the family and l've been very happy.

120
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:46,411
But l've always secretly hoped that
maybe some little gem would come along

121
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:48,955
and tempt me back on the stage.

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,835
Now l got that out of my system, l can go
back to the thing that makes me happy.

123
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,504
Bravo! Bravo!

124
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:13,605
ls it my imagination
or does Elliot have a little crush on me?

125
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,067
lt's funny. l've had that thought before.

126
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,653
He pays a lot ofattention
to me all the time.

127
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:23,156
And he blushed tonight
when we were alone in the bedroom.

128
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,117
l wonder ifhe and Hannah are happy.

129
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:30,830
lt's funny. l still feel
a little buzz from his flirting.

130
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:39,589
- You want some coffee or tea?
- No, thank you.

131
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:42,676
- How about something to eat?
- No, nothing.

132
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,261
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

133
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:48,056
What am l gonna do with you? God!

134
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:54,229
Why didn't you come tonight? We all had
a terrific time. You would have enjoyed it.

135
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:58,817
l'm going through a period of my life
where l just can't be around people.

136
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:03,446
- l didn't want to abuse anyone.
- You wouldn't. They're all so sweet.

137
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,741
Lee, you are the only person
l can be with,

138
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,202
who l really look forward to being with.

139
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:13,456
You're too harsh with everyone.
You know that, don't you?

140
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,712
- lsn't it enough that l can love you?
- You're such a puzzle!

141
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:22,966
So sweet with me, and so
contemptuous of everyone else.

142
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:26,469
There was a time when you were
very happy to be only with me.

143
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:30,348
You wanted to learn everything
about poetry, about music.

144
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:35,103
Have l really taught you everything
l have to give? l don't think so.

145
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:43,028
Elliot said he might have
a couple of clients for you.

146
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:46,364
l'm sure those morons he handles
have a deep feeling for art.

147
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:50,201
You never know, they might.
He was just trying to do the nice thing.

148
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,537
- Because he likes you.
- Me?

149
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:55,415
Yeah. Elliot lusts after you.

150
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,044
Based on what? You never even see him.

151
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:02,297
When you see him, you come home
full of books he's recommended,

152
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:06,551
- or films you must see.
- Oh, no, no. He's my sister's husband.

153
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:11,097
And l think if you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him. He's very intelligent.

154
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:14,476
He's a glorified accountant
and he's after you.

155
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,440
And l prefer to sell my work to people
who appreciate it, not to rock stars.

156
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,401
You understand?

157
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:35,413
- Why can't we do the sketch?
- Standards and Practices say it's dirty.

158
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,750
They saw the rehearsal. They just
figured out what the words mean?

159
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:42,379
- Mickey, we got a half-hour to air.
- The show is five minutes short.

160
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:46,800
- How? We timed everything long.
- With no sketch, we're ten minutes short.

161
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:51,012
- How can they do that to us?
- lt's because our ratings are low.

162
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:53,640
- l have a migraine.
- Hey, Mickey! Listen.

163
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:57,560
You'd better go to Ronny's dressing room.
He took about 1600 Quaaludes.

164
00:11:57,686 --> 00:12:00,939
- l don't think he can do the show.
- Why me, Lord?

165
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:04,776
You Standards and Practices?
Why is the sketch dirty?

166
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,237
Child molestation is a touchy subject...

167
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:10,323
- Half the country's doing it!
- Yes, but you name names.

168
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:14,285
- We don't. We say ''The Pope''.
- That sketch cannot go on the air.

169
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:18,206
Hey! Who changed
my sketch about the PLO?

170
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,625
l had to make cuts. lt's four lousy lines.

171
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,795
- The whole premise is ruined!
- lt's not so delicate.

172
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,591
- Everybody's married to every line.
- l don't care! Don't tamper with my work.

173
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:31,344
- OK...
- You want 'em cut? l'll cut 'em myself.

174
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:36,182
Mickey, listen. lnstead of the child
molestation sketch, why don't we repeat

175
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:39,227
the Cardinal Spellman-Ronald Reagan
homosexual dance number?

176
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:43,481
- l don't feel good, Mickey.
- What did you do? Swallow a drugstore?

177
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:45,650
- l lost my voice.
- Oh, Jesus!

178
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:49,029
Ronny, you know, you do
have to go on in 25 minutes.

179
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:52,282
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer's startin' to kill me.

180
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:54,409
You want a Quaalude?

181
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,787
Christ, this show is ruining my health.

182
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,206
Meanwhile, my ex-partner
moves to California

183
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:04,586
and every stupid show he produces
turns out to be a big hit.

184
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,672
Brother, what am l gonna do with my life?

185
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:12,761
Speaking ofthat, l gotta remember
to see my ex-wife tomorrow.

186
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:17,015
- Hi.
- l know.

187
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,519
- Glad you could put in an appearance.
- l got two minutes. The show is killin' me.

188
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:24,731
l got a million appointments today.
lt just fell this way.

189
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:28,526
- l gotta see new comedians...
- Just two minutes on your sons' birthday.

190
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,279
- lt's not gonna kill you.
- Happy birthday, fellas!

191
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,782
Daddy brought presents!

192
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:37,577
Hey, a little hug? What is this?
How about a little action from the kids?

193
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:40,080
- How is everything?
- Everything's fine.

194
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:43,541
OK, you can open the presents now.
l wanna get a little reaction.

195
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,627
- How's Elliot?
- He's fine.

196
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:50,340
l'm trying to convince him to produce
a play. l think he'll find that satisfying.

197
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:54,135
l like him. l think he's a sweet guy,
the few times that l've met him.

198
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,931
Cos he's a loser. He's awkward
and he's clumsy, like me.

199
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,059
- l like an underconfident person.
- This is really nice.

200
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:04,354
- He's been wanting a mitt.
- You have good taste in husbands.

201
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,856
Thanks. That's a beauty!

202
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:09,317
lsn't that great? Come on, let's go!

203
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:12,320
Go out by the Sung vase and catch this.

204
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:14,155
Watch the...

205
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:19,536
Hannah's sweet, although sometimes
l still do get angry when l think ofthings.

206
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:23,248
What the hell.
At least l'm not paying child support.

207
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:26,376
God, l hope there's nothing
physically wrong with me.

208
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:30,255
- So what's the problem this time?
- l really think l have something.

209
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,466
l'm absolutely convinced.
Not like that adenoidal thing,

210
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:36,845
where l didn't realise l'd had them out.
But l was younger.

211
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,849
l saw your father this week about his
sinus and he complained of chest pains.

212
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:44,811
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac
of the family. He's, you know...

213
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:47,731
- You said you'd had some dizziness.
- Yes, a little.

214
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,775
And l think l'm developing
a hearing loss in my right ear.

215
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,572
Or my left ear. No, l'm sorry...
My right or my left ear. l can't remember.

216
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,198
OK, let's take a look.

217
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:23,183
Well, you have had a significant drop in
the high-decibel range in your right ear.

218
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:24,559
Really?

219
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:28,104
Have you been exposed to
a loud noise recently, or had a virus?

220
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:32,651
No, l've been perfectly healthy. You know
me. l always imagine that l have things.

221
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:37,572
- When did you first notice this?
- About a month ago. What do l have?

222
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:42,202
You've had some dizzy spells.
What about ringing or buzzing?

223
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,412
Yes, now that you mention it,

224
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:49,793
l have buzzing and also ringing.
Ringing and buzzing. Am l going deaf?

225
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,878
- lt's just in one ear?
- Yes.

226
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:55,590
ls it healthier to have
problems in both ears?

227
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,719
l'd like to make an appointment
for you at the hospital.

228
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:03,640
- l'd like to have them run some tests.
- The hospital? What kind of tests?

229
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,892
Now, don't get alarmed.

230
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:10,647
These are more sophisticated audiometry
tests than l can run here. lt's nothing.

231
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:13,274
Then why do l have to go
into the hospital at all?

232
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,654
l hear fine. So l'm a little weak on the
high decibels. l won't go to the opera.

233
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,157
There's no reason for panic.
l just wanna rule out some things.

234
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:25,120
- Like what?
- lt's nothing. Will you trust me?

235
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:30,583
Hello, Dr Wilkes? This is Mickey Sachs.
l wanna ask you a question.

236
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:35,422
- Sure, Mickey. What's up?
- lf you have a hearing loss in one ear,

237
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:41,094
and it's not from a virus or a loud noise
or anything, what are the possibilities?

238
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:47,100
Anything. Often it's hereditary.
Flu. Even a small noise'll do it.

239
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,977
Right, but nothing worse?

240
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:54,024
Well, yes, l guess the dark side
of the spectrum is a brain tumour.

241
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,694
Really?

242
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:01,114
- OK, so here's the new pages.
- Did Cards get these?

243
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,408
- Not yet, no.
- Let's hope it's good.

244
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:07,620
Yeah, really, really.
We'll be down in a minute, OK?

245
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:10,874
Mickey, what's the matter with you?

246
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,918
l feel dizzy, you know? l don't feel well.

247
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,713
Do you hear a ringing?
ls there a ringing sound?

248
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,840
Yeah, yeah. l hear it, l hear it.

249
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:20,342
- No, not that.
- Hello?

250
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,927
Yeah, we're gonna be
working late tonight.

251
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:25,055
No, we'll order out.

252
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,349
lf l have a brain tumour,
what am l gonna do?

253
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:30,644
You don't have a brain tumour.
He didn't say you had one.

254
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:34,981
No, they're not gonna tell you because
sometimes the weaker ones will panic.

255
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:37,400
But not you?

256
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:41,780
- Can you hear buzzing?
- Come on, we got a show to do.

257
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:45,241
- l can't keep my mind on the show.
- There's nothing wrong with you.

258
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:48,662
lf there isn't, why does he
want me to come back for tests?

259
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:51,539
- He has to rule out certain things.
- Like what?

260
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:55,543
- l don't know. Cancer.
- Don't say that. l don't wanna hear that.

261
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,673
- Don't mention it while l'm in the building.
- You don't have any symptoms.

262
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,258
l got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumour.

263
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:05,303
Two months ago you thought
you had a malignant melanoma.

264
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,265
Naturally. The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back.

265
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:13,770
- lt was on your shirt.
- Was l to know? Everyone was pointing.

266
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:17,941
- We've got to make booking decisions.
- l can't think of it.

267
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,820
This morning l was so happy.
Now l don't know what went wrong.

268
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,780
You were miserable this morning.

269
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:27,409
We got bad reviews, terrible ratings,
the sponsors are furious...

270
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:31,121
No, l was happy, but l just
didn't realise l was happy.

271
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,003
These are delicious!
What are they?

272
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:41,548
- Those are quail eggs. Aren't they good?
- They're very good.

273
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:44,342
My friend April makes those.
Try a shrimp puff.

274
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,554
- Oh, thank you. That looks good.
- l make those.

275
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:49,889
Excuse me.

276
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:51,725
Oh, thank you.

277
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:55,186
- The stroganoff is ready.
- We're a big hit!

278
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:59,357
ln this we are. Yesterday l auditioned for
Come Back Little Sheba. Not such a hit.

279
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:02,152
You will be. You'll get five jobs next week.

280
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:06,239
- Excuse me. Are there any more clams?
- Yeah, a few. Do you like 'em?

281
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,950
- l can't resist.
- Really? How flattering.

282
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:12,746
- Did you try the shrimp puffs?
- You are too attractive to be caterers.

283
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,914
- Something's wrong.
- We're actresses.

284
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,626
- ls this your first job?
- ls the food that bad?

285
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:18,918
No, not at all.

286
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:22,464
We need more bread and
bechamel sauce for the lasagne. Hi.

287
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:25,216
You're an actress with
a great flair for shrimp puffs.

288
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:29,471
No, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.
l do the crepes caviare.

289
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:32,474
- The quail is responsible for the eggs?
- Let's hope so.

290
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,477
Here, l stole you a couple of extra clams.

291
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:39,606
- lncidentally, l'm David Tolchin.
- Oh, April Knox. Hi.

292
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:40,815
- You're Holly?
- Yeah.

293
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,234
We're the Stanislavski Catering Company.

294
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:48,031
Now l'm gonna tell you the truth. l really
came in because l was bored by the party.

295
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:49,949
How are we more interesting?

296
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:53,244
Actually, l'm gonna listen to Aida,
if l'm not in your way.

297
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:54,579
Oh, no.

298
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:58,583
We saw Pavarotti in Ernani
at the Met, and l cried.

299
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,543
l cry at the opera.

300
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,880
l go limp in the last 
scene of La Traviata.

301
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,800
Me too. l have a private box at the Met.

302
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:11,221
l bring a bottle of wine. l open it, l sit
there, l watch and l cry. lt's disgusting.

303
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:13,723
- What do you do?
- l'm an architect.

304
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:16,768
- What kind of things do you build?
- Are you interested?

305
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:18,937
Yeah.

306
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:21,106
What time do you get off?

307
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:25,694
- The red one?
- lt's magnificent!

308
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,613
The design's deliberately
noncontextual, but l wanted

309
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:33,785
to keep the atmosphere of the street,
and the proportions, and in the material.

310
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,539
- That's unpolished red granite.
- ls that what it is?

311
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:40,208
- lt has an organic quality about it.
- Right.

312
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,796
Almost entirely, wholly interdependent,
if you know what l mean.

313
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:49,467
l can't put it into words.
The important thing is, it breathes.

314
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:53,138
You know, people pass by vital
structures in this city all the time

315
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:57,517
and never appreciate them. l get the
feeling you tune into your environment.

316
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:59,936
Oh, it's really important.

317
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,689
- What are your favourite buildings?
- Wanna see some?

318
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:05,191
- Yeah.
- Well, let's do it.

319
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:52,238
lt's just so romantic.
l just wanna put on a long gown

320
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:55,367
and open the French doors
and go on the balcony.

321
00:21:55,492 --> 00:22:00,205
lt's romantic. And it's got a
handsome partner sitting right beside it.

322
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,542
They fit right in together. And your eye
goes along, lulled into complacency,

323
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:09,005
- and then... look at this.
- That's disgusting. A monstrosity.

324
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:12,384
lt's really terrible,
and it ruins everything else.

325
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,262
- lt does.
- We have seen a lot of stuff today.

326
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:20,350
- Maybe we should start going home.
- Oh, jeez, yeah.

327
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:24,854
- Who gets dropped first?
- Oh, gee, l don't know.

328
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,109
- Well, l live downtown.
- Yeah, we both live downtown.

329
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:34,906
- lt depends on what way you wanna go.
- l know. lf we took Fifth,

330
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:38,368
- then we'd get to your house first.
- We could do that.

331
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:43,498
- Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
- Well, sometimes.

332
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,917
- You live in Chelsea, don't you?
- Yeah.

333
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:49,212
Well, l guess if you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

334
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:51,631
- Oh. OK.
- And then April.

335
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:53,383
Right.

336
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:04,602
Naturally, l get taken home first.
Obviously he prefers April.

337
00:23:04,728 --> 00:23:07,272
Ofcourse, l was so tongue-tied all night.

338
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:10,150
l can't believe l said that
about the Guggenheim!

339
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:14,362
My stupid little roller-skatingjoke.
l should never telljokes.

340
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:17,991
Mom can tell 'em, and Hannah,
but l kill 'em.

341
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:23,538
Where didApril come up with that stuff
about Adolph Loos and ''organic form''?

342
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:27,083
Well, naturally, she went to Brandeis.

343
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,086
But l don't think she knows
what she's talking about.

344
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,839
Could you believe the way
she was calling him ''David''?

345
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:37,844
''Yes, David. '' ''l feel that way too, David. ''
''What a marvellous space, David. ''

346
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,597
l hate April. She's pushy.

347
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:45,060
Now they'll dump me and
she'll invite him up. l blew it.

348
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:48,396
And l really like him a lot.

349
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,734
Oh, screw it. l'm not gonna get
all upset. l've got reading to do.

350
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,989
Maybe l'll get into bed early, turn on
a movie and take an extra Seconal.

351
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,659
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, Elliot! What are you doing here?

352
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:28,038
- l'm looking for a book store.
- ln this section of town?

353
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:32,208
Well, yes. l'm killing time. l have
a client near here and l'm quite early.

354
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:33,918
- How about you?
- Well, l...

355
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:37,088
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?

356
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:40,383
- Where are you headed?
- l was just going to my AA meeting.

357
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:43,595
Why do you still go to those?
You never touch alcohol.

358
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,142
You didn't know me before Frederick. l'd
start with a beer about ten in the morning.

359
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:53,438
- You must have been very unhappy.
- Yeah, unhappy and fat.

360
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:56,399
And l still find the meetings
very comforting.

361
00:25:56,524 --> 00:26:00,945
l'll never understand it. You're so
bright and charming and beautiful...

362
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:04,282
l think to myself ''What problems
could she possibly have?''

363
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:07,327
Don't let me get started on my childhood.

364
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:11,122
Oh, you know what? There is a book store
a couple of blocks from here.

365
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,292
lf you don't know about it,
you should. You'd love it.

366
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,461
Well, if you have some free time...?

367
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:18,630
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

368
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:23,051
lsn't this great?
They have everything here.

369
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:25,637
- Yes, it's wonderful.
- What book did you want?

370
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:27,764
- What?
- You wanted to buy a book.

371
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:31,434
No, l'm killing time. l just want to browse.

372
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:34,646
You've picked the right place.
You can stay all afternoon,

373
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,481
not buy anything and just read.

374
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:40,235
Unless, if you have some time,
we could get some coffee.

375
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:43,488
- No, l don't have time.
- No, l understand completely.

376
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:46,157
No problem. You're busy. l...

377
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:49,119
- You seem tense. ls everything OK?
- No, no.

378
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,037
- No?
- Uh, yes.

379
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:53,915
- Everything's OK?
- Yeah. How are you?

380
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,917
l'm... all right.

381
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,336
- How's Frederick?
- Fine.

382
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:01,381
We went to the Caravaggio
exhibition at the Met.

383
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:06,303
lt's such a treat to go through a museum
with Frederick. You learn so much.

384
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:10,432
- Do you like Caravaggio?
- Oh, yes. Who doesn't?

385
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:12,183
Look.

386
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:16,688
ee cummings. l'd like to get you this.

387
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:21,693
- Oh, no. l can't let you get me that.
- Yes, l'd like to, very much.

388
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:25,030
l read a poem of you
and thought of his last week...

389
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:28,033
a poem of his and thought of you!

390
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:31,369
- You'll be fine, though.
- This is great.

391
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:35,373
- l love ee cummings, but...
- Listen. l'd love to get you this.

392
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:39,419
- Are you sure?
- Maybe we could discuss it sometime.

393
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:48,219
- Well, thanks a lot.
- Thanks for showing me the book store.

394
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:51,556
Perhaps you could take me
to an AA meeting sometime.

395
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:54,142
- l'd love to see what goes on.
- Yeah, you'd love it.

396
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:57,562
lt's really entertaining.
l know you'd have a good time.

397
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:01,149
And don't forget the poem on page 1 1 2.

398
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,735
- lt reminded me of you.
- Really?

399
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:10,408
Page 1 1 2.

400
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:12,369
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

401
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:23,463
<i>Your slightest look
easily will unclose me</i>

402
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,174
<i>though i have closed myself as fingers,</i>

403
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:30,887
<i>you open always petal by petal
myself as Spring opens</i>

404
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:35,308
<i>touching skilfully,
mysteriously, her first rose...</i>

405
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,688
<i>I do not know what it is
about you that closes</i>

406
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:44,275
<i>and opens; only something
in me understands</i>

407
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:48,321
<i>the voice of your eyes
is deeper than all roses.</i>

408
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:54,911
<i>Nobody, not even the rain,
has such small hands.</i>

409
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:56,139
l wasn't too happy with the results
of your ENG or your BSER, either,

410
00:29:56,264 --> 00:30:01,227
which is why l sent you to Tomography,
where you saw that stuff rolling around.

411
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:03,938
You see this little grey area here?

412
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:07,776
That grey area's what l had hoped
that we wouldn't run into.

413
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:11,863
l'd like you to come in Monday morning
for a CAT scan.

414
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:16,618
- A brain scan?
- Mr Sachs, let's take it one step at a time.

415
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:21,957
We won't make any decisions until we
have all the information in front of us.

416
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:27,587
OK, take it easy.

417
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:30,256
He didn't say you had anything.

418
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:34,010
Hejust doesn't like the spot
on yourX-ray, that's all.

419
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:38,431
lt doesn't mean you have anything.
Don'tjump to conclusions.

420
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,392
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

421
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:43,353
You're in the middle ofNew York City.
This is your town.

422
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:47,107
You're surrounded by people
and traffic and restaurants. God...

423
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:50,443
How can youjust one day vanish?

424
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:55,115
Keep calm. You're gonna be OK.

425
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,158
Don't panic.

426
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:59,995
l'm dying! l'm dying!

427
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,831
l know it! There's a spot on my lungs!

428
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:07,085
All right, now take it easy.
lt's not on your lungs, it's on your ear.

429
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,298
lt's the same thing, isn't it?
Jesus, l can't sleep!

430
00:31:11,423 --> 00:31:15,051
God, there's a tumour in my head
the size ofa basketball!

431
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:18,221
Now l keep thinking
l can feel it every time l blink!

432
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:21,933
Oh, Jesus!
He wants me to do a brain scan

433
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:24,644
to confirm what he already suspects.

434
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:26,855
Look, l'll make a deal with God.

435
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,734
Let itjust be my ear, OK?
l'll go deaf, and blind in one eye, maybe.

436
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,737
But l don't want a brain operation.
Once they go into my skull,

437
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:38,199
l'll wind up like the guy with the wool cap
who delivers for the florist.

438
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:43,121
Relax, will ya? Your whole life, you run
to doctors, the news is always fine.

439
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:46,374
No, that's not true. What about years ago?

440
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,961
l'm sorry to say, Mr Sachs,
that you cannot have children.

441
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,132
Gee.

442
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:56,051
ls there no chance?

443
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:59,262
This doesn't mean that
you can't have a normal sex life,

444
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:02,432
but Mr Sachs' tests indicate
that he is infertile.

445
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:05,268
Small sperm volume and infertile.

446
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:07,771
ls there anything l can do?
Push-ups? Hormones?

447
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:10,649
- l'm afraid not.
- l gotta get a second opinion.

448
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:13,485
- This is the second opinion.
- Well, a third opinion.

449
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,695
l realise this is a blow.

450
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,158
My experience is that many very fine
marriages become unstable

451
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:24,746
and are destroyed by an inability
to deal with this sort of problem.

452
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:27,248
l hope you won't make too much of it.

453
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:32,504
One can adopt children, and there are
various artificial methods of fertilisation.

454
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:36,591
- l'm so humiliated.
- Could you have ruined yourself?

455
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:40,512
- How could l ruin myself?
- l don't know. Excessive masturbation?

456
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:43,556
Hey, you gonna start
knockin' my hobbies? Jesus!

457
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:47,978
- Maybe we can adopt a child.
- What about artificial insemination?

458
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:50,897
- What are you talkin' about?
- l would get implanted.

459
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:55,110
- By a stranger?
- They have banks where they're frozen.

460
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:58,822
- You want a defrosted kid?
- l want to experience childbirth.

461
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:02,867
- With a stranger?
- Just think about it, that's all l ask.

462
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:06,705
Oh, that was a wonderful show.
That's the best show you two ever wrote.

463
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,126
The funniest show that Mickey and l ever
did was the one we won the Emmy for.

464
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:16,548
l think as far as plain laughs go, that was
probably the best thing that we ever did.

465
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:21,344
Yeah, it was funny, but the show about
the two Frenchmen was funny and warm.

466
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:25,307
- We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
- Remember that summer in France?

467
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:27,642
Hannah, you had jet lag for six weeks.

468
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:31,563
Yeah, but it was... l guess
we had fun when we were there.

469
00:33:31,688 --> 00:33:33,815
Sorry. Coffee?

470
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,568
Listen, you guys... Want some more?

471
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:40,530
We had something
we really wanted to discuss with you.

472
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:44,784
Yeah. Jesus, this is very delicate.

473
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:48,204
And l only bring this up amongst friends.

474
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:53,376
This should not go
any further than this room.

475
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:55,545
l'm all ears.

476
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,258
Hannah and l can't have any children.

477
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:05,597
Now, l don't wanna get into whose
fault it is. lt's my fault that we can't.

478
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,891
The details are too embarrassing to...

479
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:13,730
We've decided, after a lot of discussion,
that we'd try with artificial insemination.

480
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:16,441
Yeah, l'm not so sure
that l like that idea myself.

481
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:21,988
And l didn't want to go to a sperm bank
and have some anonymous donor.

482
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:23,990
l just wouldn't want that.

483
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:28,161
We felt, if we were gonna do it, we'd like
somebody who we knew and liked,

484
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,830
and was warm and bright...

485
00:34:30,956 --> 00:34:33,375
You can say no.
Feel free to say no.

486
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,044
We realise it has all kinds of implications.

487
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:40,840
The point that we're making here
is that we need some sperm.

488
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:45,261
Gee.

489
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:51,768
Well, my first reaction, after the initial
shock, is flattered that you'd ask me.

490
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:55,730
l would be the father. You would
just have to masturbate into a little cup.

491
00:34:55,897 --> 00:35:00,652
- l can handle that.
- Obviously we wouldn't have intercourse.

492
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:04,739
Gosh, listen. l've gotta tell you the truth.
l'm a little uneasy about this.

493
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:09,786
- l know it's a lot to ask.
- Well, l feel for you, l do. l...

494
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:13,623
l'm gonna cry. You want
my husband to have a child with you?

495
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:18,920
Don't answer now. Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

496
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:24,426
l gave blood before...
and clothing to the poor.

497
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:27,679
OK, Norman, listen.
l really wanna talk about this at home.

498
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:31,433
l think it's a matter for
your analyst, and mine.

499
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:33,184
And maybe my lawyer.

500
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,189
We understand completely
if you feel you'd rather not.

501
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:44,529
l didn't mean to spoil the evening.
Let's move on to another topic.

502
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:48,575
So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins.

503
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,330
And maybe that did cause some trouble,
but l think we were drifting apart anyhow.

504
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:56,583
Now, instead ofman and wife,
we'rejust good friends.

505
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:00,253
Boy, love is really unpredictable.

506
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,839
<i>(aria from ''Manon Lescaut'')</i>

507
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:56,309
Lee? Frederick?
Say hello to Dusty Frye.

508
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:57,936
- Hi, Dusty.
- Hi.

509
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:02,023
Dusty's just bought a huge house in
Southampton and he's decorating it.

510
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,736
Yeah, it's kind of a weird place.
A lot of wall space. How you doin', man?

511
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:09,739
l told him about your work
and he's very excited.

512
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:12,742
l got an Andy Warhol,
and l got a Frank Stella too.

513
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:16,496
lt's very beautiful. Big, weird, you know?

514
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:20,959
lf you stare at that Stella too long,
the colours just seem to float. lt's weird.

515
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:23,461
Are you excited about
becoming a collector?

516
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:28,091
Yeah. l got a lot more to learn, though.
l really wasn't into art when l was a kid.

517
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:30,719
Do you appreciate drawings?

518
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:32,137
Yeah.

519
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:35,557
Oh, hey, wow. She's beautiful.

520
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:41,646
But really l need somethin'...
l'm lookin' for somethin' big.

521
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:44,649
- Frederick, show him the oils.
- They're in the basement.

522
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:47,777
Frederick's done a new series
that l'm sure you'd love.

523
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:50,655
- Are they big?
- Yeah, some of them are.

524
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,824
Cos l got a lot of wall space there.

525
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:56,244
l don't sell my work by the yard.

526
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:58,038
Oh, Frederick!

527
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:06,212
- How's everything?
- Oh, you know.

528
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:09,090
l talked to Hannah this morning.

529
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,801
She said you were going to
the country this weekend.

530
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:14,179
Yes, she loves to go out in the woods.

531
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:17,390
But l go nuts. lt's a conflict.

532
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:23,897
- l have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
- Oh, that's nice.

533
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:28,610
l figured l'd get
Frederick and Dusty together.

534
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:32,614
- Yeah, that's really nice of you.
- This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.

535
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:37,160
- He's got six gold records.
- Oh, speaking of records,

536
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,496
l bought that Mozart trio
you recommended.

537
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,332
The man in the shop showed me
another one you'd love.

538
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:45,877
lt's another Bach, second movement.

539
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:49,422
You have that one? l'd love to hear it.

540
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:54,177
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera, an architect.

541
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:58,056
Well, that's nice.
l'd love to see her wind up settled.

542
00:38:58,223 --> 00:39:00,266
She's a tense one.

543
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:11,569
lsn't that beautiful?

544
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:13,405
l know this.

545
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:17,450
Bach, F Minor Concerto.
lt's one of my favourites.

546
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,831
Uh...

547
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:26,126
Did you ever get around to ee cummings?

548
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:28,503
Yes, he's just adorable.

549
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:34,259
They have a very large gay clientele
where l get my teeth cleaned.

550
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:38,221
All the hygienists now wear gloves
because they're afraid of AlDS.

551
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:40,390
Oh, right.

552
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:46,604
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 1 1 2?

553
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:51,860
Yes, it made me cry,
it was so beautiful, so romantic.

554
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:56,114
l want so badly to kiss her.

555
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,826
Not here, you idiot.
You've got to get her alone someplace.

556
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:05,165
But l've got to proceed cautiously.
This is a very delicate situation.

557
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,958
OK, uh...

558
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,462
Ask her ifyou can see her for lunch,
or a drink tomorrow.

559
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:14,341
And be ready to make light
ofthe offer ifshe's unresponsive.

560
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:19,054
This has to be done very skilfully
and very diplomatically.

561
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:21,222
Did you ever read this one...?

562
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:25,727
- Elliot, don't!
- Lee, l'm in love with you!

563
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:29,147
What are you doing?

564
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:32,525
l'm sorry. l have to talk to you.
There's so much l want to say.

565
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:36,196
l've been in love with you for so long...

566
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:39,616
Forget it! l'm not interested in selling it.

567
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:43,036
l only asked if you had
something with a little puce in it!

568
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:44,037
What's wrong?

569
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:46,623
l don't care about your interior decorator!

570
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:51,127
l can't commit to anything without
consulting her first. That's why l have her.

571
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:55,465
This is degrading! You don't buy paintings
to blend in with the sofa!

572
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,677
lt's not a sofa. lt's an ottoman!

573
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:02,430
God, forget it.
Let's just get outta here, Elliot.

574
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:06,226
What a weirdo that guy is. Paranoid...

575
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:10,480
- What's the matter with you?
- l'll be OK.

576
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:14,192
- lt's no big deal. We just didn't hit it off.
- No, you go on ahead.

577
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:17,737
- Are you OK? You're sweating.
- Yeah, l just need some fresh air.

578
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:22,158
lt's probably something l ate.
l'll walk, you go ahead. Go on.

579
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:41,136
Hello.

580
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,388
Hello?

581
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,016
Hello!

582
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,109
Oh, there you are! l was looking for you.

583
00:41:56,234 --> 00:41:59,112
l must apologise.
l'm sorry. l'm so mixed up!

584
00:41:59,237 --> 00:42:01,281
How do you expect me to react?

585
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:03,992
l know, but l am in love with you.

586
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:07,662
- Oh, don't say those words!
- l'm sorry. l know, it's terrible.

587
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:10,582
- You know the situation.
- l know. l realise.

588
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:14,711
- What do you expect me to say?
- Hannah and l are in the last stages.

589
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:17,839
She's never said so, and
we're very close. She'd tell me.

590
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:20,216
lt's so sad. She's crazy about me,

591
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:23,553
but somewhere along the line,
l've fallen out of love with her.

592
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:27,265
- Not because of me, l hope?
- Oh, no, no... Well, yes! l love you.

593
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:32,145
- l can't be the cause of anything...
- No, it was inevitable that we part.

594
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,481
- Why?
- For a million reasons.

595
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:38,610
- But not over me?
- No, we're going in different directions.

596
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:40,737
- Poor Hannah.
- But how about you?

597
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:44,616
Do you share any of my feelings, or
is this an unpleasant embarrassment?

598
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:49,037
- l can't say anything.
- Be candid. l don't want you to feel bad.

599
00:42:49,162 --> 00:42:52,958
Yes, l have certain feelings for you,
but don't make me say anything more.

600
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:57,921
OK, OK, you've said enough. lt's my
responsibility now. l'll work things out.

601
00:42:58,046 --> 00:43:01,925
Don't do anything for me. l live with
Frederick, and Hannah and l are close.

602
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,763
- Yes, but you do care about me?
- Elliot, please, l can't be a party to this.

603
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,808
l'm suddenly wracked with guilt
just talking to you.

604
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:12,727
Your guilt is because you feel the same.

605
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:16,272
Oh, please, l have to go.
l have to get my teeth cleaned.

606
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:20,402
l have my answer. l have my answer.

607
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:23,488
l'm walking on air!

608
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,133
- God, am l glad to see you!
- Hi. How's she doing?

609
00:43:43,258 --> 00:43:46,511
She's in the kitchen there.
lt's the same thing.

610
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:49,639
She promises, promises.
And it's all lies, always.

611
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:51,558
Don't make it worse, Dad.

612
00:43:51,683 --> 00:43:53,643
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

613
00:43:53,768 --> 00:43:57,188
l'll get you some coffee.
That's enough of that. What triggered it?

614
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:59,691
We were making a commercial
at the mayor's office.

615
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:01,860
There was this young salesman

616
00:44:01,985 --> 00:44:06,698
and your mother was throwing
herself at him in a disgusting way.

617
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:11,911
Then she found she was too old to seduce
him, that he was just embarrassed by her.

618
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:13,246
Liar! Liar!

619
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:18,710
At lunch, she got drunker and drunker,
and finally she became Joan Collins.

620
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:23,256
All my life l've had to put up
with insults from this non-person!

621
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:27,010
This haircut that passes for a man!

622
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:31,598
He could never support us. lt's
a good thing we had a talented daughter.

623
00:44:31,723 --> 00:44:34,434
l can only hope that she was mine!

624
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,396
With you as her mother, her father
could be anybody in Actors' Equity!

625
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,191
She's talented,
so it's unlikely she's yours.

626
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:44,861
Dad, could you stay in the other room
and let me take care of her?

627
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:50,200
You never know when she's gonna fall off
the wagon and humiliate everybody.

628
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:52,702
Here, Mom. Drink this.

629
00:44:52,827 --> 00:44:56,122
You know, you're awful.
You probably were flirting.

630
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:59,584
No! l like to joke around and have fun

631
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:02,545
and he gets angry
because l get the attention.

632
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:07,592
He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older
and l've tried to stay young... at heart.

633
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:09,678
You promised to stay on the wagon.

634
00:45:09,803 --> 00:45:12,347
The sacrifices l've made
because of that man...

635
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:17,686
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering, his... mediocrity!

636
00:45:17,852 --> 00:45:19,938
OK, stop being so dramatic.

637
00:45:20,063 --> 00:45:22,524
He's the one that's laid
every ingenue in stock!

638
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:24,609
OK, OK.

639
00:45:24,776 --> 00:45:26,987
- They wanted me for a screen test.
- l know.

640
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:30,073
But l knew that he'd get up there
and flounder around

641
00:45:30,198 --> 00:45:34,577
with his expensive haircuts
and hairdos and clothes.

642
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,705
He's all show.

643
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:42,002
Now, how can you act when
there's nothing inside to come out?

644
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:57,225
She was so beautiful at
one time, and he was so dashing,

645
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:02,564
both ofthemjust full ofpromise
and hopes that never materialised.

646
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,153
Then the fights and the constant
infidelities to prove themselves

647
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:11,156
and blaming each other. lt's sad.

648
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:16,786
They loved the idea ofhaving us kids,
but raising us didn't interest them much.

649
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:22,125
But it's impossible to hold it against
them. They didn't know anything else.

650
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:28,423
You know, of all of us in the family, you
were the one blessed with the true gift.

651
00:46:28,548 --> 00:46:34,012
My true gift is luck, Mom. l just had
a lot of luck, from my first show.

652
00:46:34,137 --> 00:46:36,765
l thought Lee was the one
destined for great things.

653
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,853
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't
have your spark. She knows it.

654
00:46:41,978 --> 00:46:45,482
She worships you.
She wouldn't dare get up there on stage.

655
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:50,153
- Now, Holly's not shy.
- Holly's game for anything.

656
00:46:50,278 --> 00:46:52,155
- Holly takes after me.
- True.

657
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,824
l'd have been a great dope addict.

658
00:46:56,284 --> 00:46:58,328
Remember this, Hannah?

659
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:25,081
Mr Sachs, l'm afraid the news is not good.

660
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:30,170
lf l can show you exactly
where the tumour is,

661
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:34,174
and why we feel that
surgery would be of no use...

662
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:38,595
lt's over.

663
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,181
l'm face to face with eternity.

664
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:44,225
Not later, but now.

665
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:49,648
l'm so frightened,
l can't move, speak or breathe.

666
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,071
Well, you're just fine.
There's absolutely nothing here at all.

667
00:48:56,196 --> 00:48:58,448
And your tests are all fine.

668
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:03,745
l must admit, l was concerned,
given your symptoms.

669
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,831
What caused this hearing loss,
we'll never know for sure,

670
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:12,087
but whatever it was, it's certainly not
anything serious. l'm very relieved.

671
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:32,607
What do you mean, you're quitting? Why?

672
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:36,945
The news is good.
You don't have canc... the thing.

673
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,323
Do you realise what a thread
we're all hanging by?

674
00:49:40,448 --> 00:49:43,118
You're off the hook.
You should be celebrating.

675
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:46,037
Can you understand how
meaningless everything is?

676
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:50,125
l'm talking about our lives, the show,
the whole world. lt's meaningless.

677
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:54,421
- Yeah, but you're not dying.
- No, l'm not dying now, but...

678
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:58,341
When l ran out of the hospital, l was so
thrilled because l was going to be OK.

679
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:01,636
l'm running down the street,
and suddenly l stop. lt hit me.

680
00:50:01,803 --> 00:50:05,348
So l'm not gonna go today,
l'm not gonna go tomorrow,

681
00:50:05,515 --> 00:50:08,018
but eventually
l'm gonna be in that position.

682
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:12,397
- You're just realising this now?
- No, l've known it all the time.

683
00:50:12,522 --> 00:50:14,858
But l stuck it in the back of my mind

684
00:50:14,983 --> 00:50:18,778
because it's a very
horrible thing to think about.

685
00:50:18,903 --> 00:50:21,364
- Can l tell you something? A secret?
- Yeah, sure.

686
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:25,160
A week ago, l bought a rifle.
l went into a store and bought one.

687
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:27,370
lf l had a tumour, l was gonna kill myself.

688
00:50:27,495 --> 00:50:31,207
The only thing that might've stopped me
is my parents would be devastated.

689
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,376
l would have had to shoot them first.

690
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,796
And then my aunt and uncle.
lt would have been a bloodbath.

691
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:41,301
Well, you know, eventually
it is going to happen to all of us.

692
00:50:41,426 --> 00:50:46,556
But doesn't that ruin everything for you?
lt takes the pleasure out of everything.

693
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:50,518
You're gonna die, l'm gonna die, the
audience, the network, the sponsor...

694
00:50:50,644 --> 00:50:53,063
- l know, and your hamster.
- Yes!

695
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:56,566
Listen, kid. l think you snapped your cap.

696
00:50:56,691 --> 00:51:00,946
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda
or something, or go to a whorehouse.

697
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:03,239
l can't stay on this show. l need answers.

698
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:07,285
Otherwise, l'm telling you,
l'm gonna do something drastic.

699
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:29,849
- l thought you weren't coming.
- l almost didn't.

700
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:33,979
- l didn't sleep all night.
- No, l'm sure.

701
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:38,566
What are we doing, meeting
in a hotel room? lt's terrible.

702
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:41,569
l couldn't think where to invite you
without taking risks.

703
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,532
l promised myself l wouldn't let this
happen till you were living alone.

704
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:47,575
l was so torn when you called.

705
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:51,997
l've wanted to call you every day
since l first told you how l felt.

706
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:54,374
l resisted so many times.

707
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,254
Don't think badly of me.

708
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:04,009
This is not an easy situation.

709
00:52:04,175 --> 00:52:06,177
l know it isn't.

710
00:52:23,194 --> 00:52:25,238
That was just perfect.

711
00:52:26,197 --> 00:52:28,783
You've ruined me for anyone else.

712
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:31,995
l don't want anyone else ever to have you.

713
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:35,707
l was so worried
l wouldn't compare with Hannah.

714
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:39,878
Oh, my God. You really do have
those thoughts, don't you?

715
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:42,047
All the time.

716
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,549
l know she must be
a really passionate person.

717
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:50,055
Yes, she's very warm and giving,
but it's me that wants to be giving to you.

718
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,226
l wanna do things for you.
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

719
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:59,773
Oh, l'm being presumptuous.
Not that you need me...

720
00:52:59,898 --> 00:53:02,275
l want you to take care of me.

721
00:53:03,693 --> 00:53:06,571
And l love when you do things to me.

722
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:38,311
- You're late.
- Lucy and l kept talking.

723
00:53:38,436 --> 00:53:40,981
l didn't realise how late it had got.

724
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:45,986
You missed a very dull
TV show about Auschwitz.

725
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,365
More gruesome film clips,
and more puzzled intellectuals

726
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:54,869
declaring their mystification over
the systematic murder of millions.

727
00:53:54,995 --> 00:53:59,124
The reason why they can never answer
the question ''How could it happen?''

728
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,126
is that it's the wrong question.

729
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:05,213
Given what people are, the question is
''Why doesn't it happen more often?''

730
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:10,677
- Of course, it does, in subtler forms.
- l have a headache from this weather.

731
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:17,142
lt's been ages since
l sat in front of the TV,

732
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:20,061
just changing channels to find something.

733
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:22,522
You see the whole culture:

734
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:24,899
Nazis, deodorant salesmen,

735
00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:29,112
wrestlers, beauty contests,
the talk show...

736
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:33,867
Can you imagine the level of
a mind that watches wrestling?

737
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:39,039
But the worst are the fundamentalist
preachers: third-rate con men

738
00:54:39,164 --> 00:54:42,751
telling the poor suckers that watch them
that they speak for Jesus.

739
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:46,379
And to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

740
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:50,884
lf Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name,

741
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:55,138
- he'd never stop throwing up.
- Oh, God, would you please lighten up?

742
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:59,809
l'm really not in the mood to hear
a review of contemporary society again.

743
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:04,648
- You've been very nervous lately.
- l can't take this any more.

744
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:07,817
l'm trying to complete an education
l started five years ago.

745
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:10,528
l'm not your pupil. l was, but l'm not.

746
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:14,115
When you leave the nest, l want you
to be ready to face the real world.

747
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,451
We're going to have to
make some changes.

748
00:55:16,576 --> 00:55:19,663
- Like what?
- You know what. l'm suffocating.

749
00:55:19,788 --> 00:55:24,501
- Are we having this conversation again?
- Yes, we are having it again.

750
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:27,796
- l have to leave. l have to move out.
- Why?

751
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:31,257
- Because l have to.
- What are you going to use for money?

752
00:55:31,383 --> 00:55:34,928
l don't know. l thought maybe l'd
move in with my parents for a while.

753
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:39,808
l always told you you would leave me.
Does it have to be now?

754
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:43,269
Maybe it'll only be temporary,
but l have to try.

755
00:55:43,395 --> 00:55:46,481
Oh, Lee. You are my whole world.

756
00:55:50,235 --> 00:55:53,780
Good God. Have you been kissed tonight?

757
00:55:53,905 --> 00:55:56,283
- No.
- Oh, yes, you have.

758
00:55:56,408 --> 00:55:58,952
- You've been with someone!
- Stop accusing me!

759
00:55:59,077 --> 00:56:01,246
l'm too smart, Lee. You can't fool me!

760
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,415
- You're turning all red.
- Leave me alone!

761
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:06,042
Christ, what's wrong with you?

762
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:11,589
- l'm sorry.
- Couldn't you say something?

763
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:15,302
- You have to slither behind my back...
- l'm saying it now!

764
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:17,512
So you met somebody else?

765
00:56:18,513 --> 00:56:19,472
Yeah.

766
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:23,852
But you knew it was going to happen
sooner or later. l can't live like this!

767
00:56:23,977 --> 00:56:27,230
- Who is it?
- What's the difference? Somebody l met.

768
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:31,609
- But who? Where did you meet him?
- lt doesn't matter. l have to move out.

769
00:56:31,776 --> 00:56:34,195
You are my only connection to the world.

770
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:38,366
Oh, God, that's too much
responsibility for me. lt's not fair!

771
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:41,411
l want a less complicated life.
l want a husband,

772
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:45,749
- maybe even a child, before it's too late.
- Jesus! Jesus!

773
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:48,752
Oh, God, l don't even know what l want.

774
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:54,883
What do you get out of me,
anyway? l mean...

775
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:58,595
lt's not sexual any more.

776
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,516
lt's certainly not intellectual.
You're so superior to me in every way...

777
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:05,685
Don't patronise me!

778
00:57:07,187 --> 00:57:12,651
God, l should have married you
years ago, when you wanted to.

779
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:16,780
- l should have agreed.
- lt never would have worked.

780
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:22,744
l told you one day you would
leave me for a younger man. l...

781
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:37,342
What passion today with Lee!
She's a volcano.

782
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:43,098
lt was a totally fulfilling experience,
just as l'd dreamed it would be.

783
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:47,811
That's what it was. lt was like
living out a dream. A great dream.

784
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:52,482
Now l feel very good and cosy
being here next to Hannah.

785
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:55,360
There's something very lovely
and real about Hannah.

786
00:57:55,485 --> 00:58:00,073
She gives me a very deep feeling
ofbeing part ofsomething.

787
00:58:00,198 --> 00:58:04,244
She's a wonderful woman...
and l betrayed her.

788
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,997
She came into my empty life
and changed it,

789
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:10,792
and l paid her back by
banging her sister in a hotel room.

790
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:15,046
God, l'm despicable.
What a cruel and shallow thing to do.

791
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:17,549
l have to call her and say
what we did was crazy.

792
00:58:17,716 --> 00:58:21,928
lt can't happen again. l'm not that kind
ofman, and l value Hannah too much.

793
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:25,640
l love my wife.
Now l betrayed her. Oh, God!

794
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,978
- Where are you going?
- l've, uh, got to get a phone number.

795
00:58:30,145 --> 00:58:32,522
- l forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
- lt's so late.

796
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:34,691
Yeah, l can't believe l forgot.

797
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:38,570
lf he answers, l'll hang up.

798
00:58:38,737 --> 00:58:43,366
l'll tell her we can't communicate until
l terminate my marriage. lt's immoral.

799
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:47,621
Then time will pass, l won't call,
and she'll get the idea.

800
00:58:47,746 --> 00:58:50,415
Gotta stop this before l get in too deep.

801
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,628
l'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

802
00:58:54,753 --> 00:58:59,633
lt's 1 .30. She can't have a conversation
with me with him around.

803
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:01,885
l'm getting hysterical.

804
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,346
l'll call her first thing in the morning.

805
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,139
l'll call her at six.

806
00:59:06,264 --> 00:59:11,144
Frederick goes jogging at six.
l'll call her and nip it in the bud.

807
00:59:12,437 --> 00:59:14,481
l've got it! l've got it!

808
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:16,941
Hello?

809
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,526
Mel!

810
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:22,072
l would have hung up if you hadn't
answered and l won't do this again,

811
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:26,159
but l just had to tell you...
l feel very close to you tonight.

812
00:59:26,284 --> 00:59:28,536
Very, very close.

813
00:59:28,662 --> 00:59:30,497
Good night.

814
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:47,973
Millions ofbooks written
on every conceivable subject

815
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:52,769
by all these great minds, and in the end
none ofthem knows anything more

816
00:59:52,894 --> 00:59:55,730
about the big questions oflife than l do.

817
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:58,692
Jesus, l read Socrates.

818
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:03,196
This guy used to knock offlittle Greek
boys. What the hell's he got to teach me?

819
01:00:03,321 --> 01:00:07,742
And Nietzsche, with his
theory ofeternal recurrence.

820
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:11,204
He said that the life we live,
we're gonna live over and over again

821
01:00:11,329 --> 01:00:14,040
the exact same way for eternity.

822
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:19,754
Great. That means l'll have to sit through
the ''lce Capades'' again. lt's not worth it.

823
01:00:19,879 --> 01:00:22,966
And Freud, another great pessimist.

824
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:26,344
l was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.

825
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:31,599
My poor analyst got so frustrated,
the guy finally put in a salad bar.

826
01:00:31,725 --> 01:00:34,019
Look at all these people jogging,

827
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:37,355
trying to stave off
the inevitable decay ofthe body.

828
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,150
Boy, it's so sad what people go through

829
01:00:40,275 --> 01:00:44,404
with their stationary bike
and their exercise.

830
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:49,075
Look at this one. Poor thing.
She has to tote all that fat around.

831
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,453
She should pull it on a dolly.

832
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:56,333
Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the only answer.

833
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:59,794
l was in love with Hannah,
but it didn't work out too well.

834
01:00:59,919 --> 01:01:03,048
l even took her sister out.
Remember that, years ago?

835
01:01:03,173 --> 01:01:07,927
When Hannah and l got divorced and
she fixed me up with her sister Holly?

836
01:01:10,972 --> 01:01:14,726
l wanna be like you,
said l'm gonna fit into your group

837
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:20,690
l don't wanna be different,
said l'm gonna be just like you

838
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:26,029
Because l'm gonna buy the records
that they play on the radio

839
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,952
l'm gonna dance at clubs,
gonna do just what l'm told

840
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:36,915
And l'm bleedin', you know...

841
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,961
- Why are you makin' those faces?
- l can't hear you. l can't hear anything.

842
01:01:41,086 --> 01:01:45,590
- l'm gonna lose hearing in my ear.
- Listen, you're witnessing genius.

843
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:49,010
My ears are experiencing a meltdown.
l can't hear anything.

844
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:51,721
Can't you feel the energy,
the tangible energy?

845
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:54,349
The room's alive with positive vibrations.

846
01:01:54,474 --> 01:01:58,395
l'm frightened. After they sing,
they're gonna take hostages.

847
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,022
Don't, no, please.

848
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:04,442
- You want some? Come on!
- No, you've been doing that all night.

849
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:08,280
You're gonna burn a hole...
You're gonna develop a third nostril.

850
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:11,825
- Don't, please. Can we go?
- No!

851
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:16,997
Because l'm gonna buy the records
that they play on the radio...

852
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:21,042
l love songs about
extraterrestrial life. Don't you?

853
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:25,088
- Not if they're sung by extraterrestrials.
- l cannot communicate with you!

854
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:27,299
l never knew you were such a tight-ass.

855
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:31,428
Both your sisters have such good taste
in music. Where did you go wrong?

856
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,513
Do you mind? l'm my own person.

857
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:36,808
- Can l take you to hear something nice?
- lt's getting late.

858
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:40,061
- Come on, cos you're being angry.
- l'm not angry!

859
01:02:40,228 --> 01:02:43,982
You don't believe in ESP, you don't
like rock music, you won't get high...

860
01:02:44,149 --> 01:02:46,026
lt's like l'm dating Cardinal Cooke!

861
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:55,076
Why am l

862
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,038
Just as reckless as a child?

863
01:02:58,705 --> 01:03:01,333
Why am l

864
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:04,336
Like a racehorse runnin' wild?

865
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:07,547
Why am l

866
01:03:07,672 --> 01:03:10,884
ln a state of ecstasy?

867
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:15,889
The reason is cos something's
happened to me

868
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:18,600
l'm in love again

869
01:03:19,684 --> 01:03:22,437
And the spring is comin'

870
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:24,606
l'm in love again

871
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:28,485
Hear my heartstrings strummin'

872
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,654
l'm in love again

873
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:34,449
And the hymn they're hummin'

874
01:03:34,574 --> 01:03:39,788
ls those cuddle-up, huddle-up blues

875
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:41,957
l'm in love again

876
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:46,294
And l can't rise above it

877
01:03:46,419 --> 01:03:48,630
l'm in love again

878
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:52,133
And l love, love, love it

879
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:55,512
- Thanks for a swell time.
- lf you didn't like it,

880
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:57,305
you didn't have to talk over him.

881
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:00,850
- l was so bored.
- Tough. You don't deserve Cole Porter!

882
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:03,603
Stay with groups that look like
they'll stab their mothers.

883
01:04:03,728 --> 01:04:07,691
- At least l'm open to new concepts.
- And you snort cocaine all the time.

884
01:04:07,816 --> 01:04:09,901
Do you carry a kilo in your purse?

885
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:13,613
This crowd wouldn't know the difference.
They're embalmed.

886
01:04:13,738 --> 01:04:17,575
l'm glad Hannah got us together.
She's got a great instinct for people.

887
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:20,453
- l'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Yeah, me too.

888
01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:24,040
- l've been a little depressed lately.
- l had a great time tonight.

889
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:28,086
- lt was like the Nuremberg trials.
- l'll see myself home!

890
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:32,424
Yep, it was quite an evening.

891
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:35,260
Holly with her cocaine. Jesus!

892
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:38,972
She should have been wearing
a gold shovel around her neck.

893
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:42,809
She was polymorphously
insensitive, l think.

894
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:44,352
Too bad, too,

895
01:04:44,477 --> 01:04:47,731
because l always had
a little crush on her.

896
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,184
You just have to read the instructions.

897
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:27,979
You set one of these things
and you can take pictures underwater.

898
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:30,649
When we get to the country,
we'll try it in the lake.

899
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:32,817
- Can l try?
- Yeah, OK.

900
01:05:42,702 --> 01:05:44,829
Are you in a bad mood?

901
01:05:44,955 --> 01:05:47,499
l don't know. l'm just antsy.

902
01:05:47,624 --> 01:05:50,669
Yes, l know. The last few weeks
you haven't been yourself.

903
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:54,297
And tonight at dinner
you were kind of curt with me.

904
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:56,341
- Was l?
- Yes, you were.

905
01:05:56,466 --> 01:06:01,054
And when l brought up the idea of having
a baby, you jumped down my throat.

906
01:06:01,179 --> 01:06:04,224
- Well, l don't think it's a very good idea.
- Why not?

907
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:07,644
Because it's the last thing
in the world we need right now.

908
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,021
Why do you say that?
ls something wrong?

909
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:13,149
- l don't know.
- Well, tell me. Should l be worried?

910
01:06:13,525 --> 01:06:17,320
- Well, you got four children.
- l want one with you.

911
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:21,533
Well... l think we should
wait till things settle.

912
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:23,785
What does that mean?

913
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:27,497
We've been married four years.
How settled can things get?

914
01:06:27,622 --> 01:06:31,334
You have some very set plans on
how your life should be structured.

915
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:35,297
A house, kids, certain school,
a home in Connecticut...

916
01:06:35,422 --> 01:06:37,882
lt's all very... preconceived.

917
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:41,303
Yeah, but l... l thought you needed that.

918
01:06:41,428 --> 01:06:43,805
When we met,
you said your life was chaos.

919
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,600
l know, but there's
gotta be some give and take.

920
01:06:47,726 --> 01:06:51,771
Oh, listen. l don't know
what the hell l'm talking about.

921
01:06:51,896 --> 01:06:54,107
- Are you angry with me?
- No!

922
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:57,819
Do you feel, um...
Are you disenchanted with our marriage?

923
01:06:57,944 --> 01:07:00,322
- l didn't say that.
- Do you love someone else?

924
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:04,200
My God, what is this? The Gestapo? No!

925
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:07,621
- What are you not telling me?
- What kind of interrogation...?

926
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:11,458
Suppose l said ''Yes, l am disenchanted,
l am in love with someone else''?

927
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:14,544
- Are you?
- No!

928
01:07:14,669 --> 01:07:19,090
But you keep asking awful questions.
lt's like you want me to say yes!

929
01:07:19,215 --> 01:07:23,845
What are you talking about?
Of course not. l'd be destroyed.

930
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:26,806
For Christ's sake, stop torturing her.

931
01:07:26,931 --> 01:07:29,726
Tell her you want out and get it over with.

932
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:33,813
You're in love with her sister.
You didn't do it on purpose.

933
01:07:33,939 --> 01:07:37,150
Be honest. lt's always the best way.

934
01:07:37,275 --> 01:07:39,569
Can l help you?

935
01:07:39,694 --> 01:07:42,906
lf you're suffering over something,
will you share it with me?

936
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:45,075
Hannah.

937
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:48,119
You know how much l love you.

938
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:54,000
l ought to have my head examined.
l don't deserve you.

939
01:08:01,132 --> 01:08:04,469
l want to look good,
but l don't want to feel overdressed.

940
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:07,055
- No, not at all.
- Well, how about this?

941
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:10,850
l really like that.
l think that's a pretty colour on you.

942
01:08:10,976 --> 01:08:14,270
Ever think you'd be helping me
buy something to wear to the opera?

943
01:08:14,396 --> 01:08:16,606
l think it's great. l can't wait to meet him.

944
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:21,152
He's married and his wife's in and out
of institutions. She's schizophrenic.

945
01:08:21,278 --> 01:08:24,239
Sometimes she's terrific,
and then she just breaks down.

946
01:08:24,364 --> 01:08:29,411
He has a sweet daughter. When she goes
to college, he's gonna split permanently.

947
01:08:29,536 --> 01:08:33,081
He's paid his dues, but she helped
him through architectural school.

948
01:08:33,206 --> 01:08:35,375
You found all this out on one date?

949
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,004
l figured he's dying to open up. lt's so sad.

950
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:42,132
Now, what should l wear to my audition?

951
01:08:42,257 --> 01:08:46,344
l've got a singing audition for a Broadway
musical. Of course, l'll never get it.

952
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:48,305
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

953
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:51,599
- Really?
- Well, l mean, why not, you know?

954
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:57,480
- What have l got to lose?
- l know, l just... l didn't know you sang.

955
01:08:58,356 --> 01:09:00,817
You think everybody in
musicals sings so well?

956
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:02,777
No, no.

957
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:04,863
Just that... they sing.

958
01:09:04,988 --> 01:09:07,032
Well, you know...

959
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:12,621
- l sing a little. l mean...
- Oh, l know. No, l know.

960
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,583
Don't say that, cos confidence
is not my strong point.

961
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,294
No, l'm sorry. l didn't mean that.

962
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:21,463
l think l can fake my way through a song.

963
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,632
- Uh-huh?
- Easily.

964
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:30,555
- Why? You don't think it's realistic?
- No, l didn't... That's... No.

965
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,352
l just hate to see you put yourself
in a position where you get hurt.

966
01:09:35,477 --> 01:09:37,854
You know how you take
every single rejection

967
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:41,399
as a confirmation that you
have no talent or something.

968
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:44,444
- Yeah, well, maybe l'll get it.
- l hope.

969
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:47,656
Boy, you really know
how to cut me down.

970
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:50,742
What? No, don't be so sensitive.
Can't l say anything?

971
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:54,496
Well, l sing! For Christ's sake,
Hannah, you heard me sing!

972
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:57,290
OK! What happened?

973
01:09:57,415 --> 01:10:02,754
We were having a really nice time, and
suddenly everything went to bad feeling.

974
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:05,632
Nobody but you can do that to me.
l don't know why.

975
01:10:05,757 --> 01:10:08,551
Look, everything's going your way.

976
01:10:09,636 --> 01:10:12,305
You're right. l'm happy!

977
01:10:14,224 --> 01:10:18,561
Why must l let my insecurities
spoil everything?

978
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:22,440
This year's fancies

979
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:26,152
Are passing fancies

980
01:10:26,278 --> 01:10:28,363
But sighing sighs

981
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:30,448
Holding hands

982
01:10:30,573 --> 01:10:32,450
This my heart

983
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:34,786
Understands

984
01:10:35,495 --> 01:10:38,790
l'm old-fashioned

985
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:42,711
And l don't mind it

986
01:10:42,836 --> 01:10:46,881
lt's how l want to be

987
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:51,177
As long as you'll agree

988
01:10:52,053 --> 01:10:57,851
To stay old-fashioned

989
01:10:57,976 --> 01:11:01,896
With me

990
01:11:02,063 --> 01:11:03,732
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

991
01:11:03,857 --> 01:11:06,318
- lt was very nice.
- Terrific.

992
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:08,278
April Knox?

993
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:17,704
Someday

994
01:11:18,246 --> 01:11:20,915
When l'm awfully low

995
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:24,210
When the world is cold

996
01:11:24,836 --> 01:11:26,713
l will get a glow

997
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,675
Just thinking of you

998
01:11:31,426 --> 01:11:36,931
And the way you look tonight

999
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:41,227
You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

1000
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:44,773
l'm glad we have a catering job
this week. l'm low on money.

1001
01:11:44,898 --> 01:11:48,735
Yeah, we have Mr Morris Levine's
80th birthday on Riverside Drive,

1002
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:52,280
or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
depending on his health.

1003
01:11:52,405 --> 01:11:54,741
Oh, listen. David called me up.

1004
01:11:54,866 --> 01:11:56,034
What?

1005
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,455
David called me last night.
He wants to take me to the opera.

1006
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:03,667
- l didn't know what to say.
- You're joking.

1007
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:06,044
No, he called late last night.

1008
01:12:07,337 --> 01:12:10,048
l, uh... l'm very surprised.

1009
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:12,926
He wanted to take me to see Rigoletto.

1010
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:16,054
- And you're going?
- Well, l didn't know what to say.

1011
01:12:16,179 --> 01:12:18,264
First l said no, but then he pressed it.

1012
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:22,727
He said he'd taken you once
and he really wanted to invite me.

1013
01:12:24,437 --> 01:12:26,940
- But l'm seeing him.
- l know, l said that.

1014
01:12:27,065 --> 01:12:31,319
But he said it was something
he really felt like doing.

1015
01:12:31,444 --> 01:12:33,446
Gee, um...

1016
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,241
l don't know what to say.

1017
01:12:37,117 --> 01:12:41,663
lt's just an evening at the opera.
Did l do wrong in accepting?

1018
01:12:42,622 --> 01:12:44,457
Huh?

1019
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:53,049
Why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism?

1020
01:12:53,174 --> 01:12:57,637
Well, because l've gotta have something
to believe in, or life is meaningless.

1021
01:12:57,762 --> 01:13:03,310
l understand, but why did you make the
decision to choose the Catholic faith?

1022
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:06,354
First of all because it's
a very beautiful religion

1023
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,357
and it's a strong religion.
lt's very well structured.

1024
01:13:09,482 --> 01:13:13,945
l mean the against-school-prayer,
pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.

1025
01:13:14,112 --> 01:13:16,156
So at the moment
you don't believe in God?

1026
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:21,453
No, and l want to. l'm willing to do
anything. l'll dye Easter eggs, if it works.

1027
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,164
l need some evidence.
l gotta have some proof.

1028
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:27,959
lf l can't believe in God,
then l don't think life is worth living.

1029
01:13:28,126 --> 01:13:32,297
- lt means making a very big leap.
- Yes, well, can you help me?

1030
01:13:32,464 --> 01:13:35,133
Why? Oh, my God!

1031
01:13:35,258 --> 01:13:38,136
l don't understand.
l thought you'd be happy.

1032
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:41,264
- How can we be happy?
- Because l never thought of God before.

1033
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:45,101
- Now l'm giving it some thought.
- Catholicism? Why not your own people?

1034
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:50,398
Because l got off to a wrong foot with
my own thing. l need a dramatic change.

1035
01:13:50,523 --> 01:13:54,486
- You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
- l know it sounds funny, but l'll try.

1036
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:57,989
- But why? We raised you as a Jew.
- Just cos l was born that way...

1037
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:01,326
- l'm old enough to make decisions.
- But why Jesus Christ?

1038
01:14:01,451 --> 01:14:05,705
- Why shouldn't you become a Buddhist?
- That's totally alien to me.

1039
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,958
You're old. Aren't you afraid of dying?

1040
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,669
- Why should l be afraid?
- Cos you won't exist.

1041
01:14:10,794 --> 01:14:12,712
- So?
- That doesn't terrify you?

1042
01:14:12,837 --> 01:14:15,966
Who thinks about such nonsense?
When l'm dead, l'll be dead.

1043
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,260
- But aren't you frightened?
- Of what? l'll be unconscious.

1044
01:14:19,386 --> 01:14:21,471
l know, but never to exist again?

1045
01:14:21,596 --> 01:14:24,307
- How do you know?
- lt doesn't look promising.

1046
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:28,478
Who knows what l'll be?
l'll either be unconscious or l won't.

1047
01:14:28,603 --> 01:14:32,107
lf not, l'll deal with it then.
l'm not gonna worry now.

1048
01:14:32,232 --> 01:14:33,733
Mom, come out!

1049
01:14:33,858 --> 01:14:38,154
Of course there's a God,
you idiot! You don't believe in God?

1050
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,074
lf there's a God, why is there
so much evil in the world?

1051
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,994
On a simplistic level,
why were there Nazis?

1052
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:47,247
- Tell him, Max.
- How the hell do l know?

1053
01:14:47,372 --> 01:14:49,874
l don't know how the can opener works.

1054
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:15,377
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's Holly?

1055
01:16:15,502 --> 01:16:18,838
She's auditioning for a TV commercial.
She said she'd be late.

1056
01:16:18,964 --> 01:16:23,093
- How's she doing?
- When she's depressed, she's manic.

1057
01:16:23,218 --> 01:16:25,679
l think it was a good idea
to invite her to lunch.

1058
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:31,017
l hope you say it was your idea. Every
time l try to help, she gets so defensive.

1059
01:16:31,142 --> 01:16:34,104
She's just embarrassed
in front of you, that's all.

1060
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:36,147
- So how are you?
- Me? l'm OK.

1061
01:16:36,273 --> 01:16:37,941
- Do you miss Frederick?
- No.

1062
01:16:38,066 --> 01:16:41,111
Elliot and l can't think of anyone
for you to go out with...

1063
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:45,073
How are you? Are you doing OK?
How's Frederick? l mean, Elliot?

1064
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:50,495
l guess he's fine. l don't know. He's been
kinda moody lately, the last few months.

1065
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,873
l don't know what's wrong.
He's distant and difficult.

1066
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:56,793
When l try to talk to him,
he says everything's fine.

1067
01:16:56,918 --> 01:17:00,755
l just leap to the worst conclusion,
that he's seeing someone else or...

1068
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,341
Oh, no. Everyone thinks things like that.

1069
01:17:03,466 --> 01:17:08,346
Well, l just came from an audition
which l did not get. So what's new?

1070
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:12,142
- They said l was too offbeat-looking.
- What the hell do they know?

1071
01:17:12,267 --> 01:17:14,561
- And guess who's there, auditioning.
- April?

1072
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:17,105
- Oh, gosh.
- You got it. l was very polite.

1073
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:20,317
l maintained my poise. l said hello.

1074
01:17:20,442 --> 01:17:23,945
l never trusted April.
She has eyes in the back of her head.

1075
01:17:24,112 --> 01:17:28,908
She and the architect are now a very
definite item, which l still cannot believe,

1076
01:17:29,034 --> 01:17:32,203
although it's put an end to the
Stanislavski Catering Company.

1077
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:34,998
l have to speak to you,
and you're gonna get impatient,

1078
01:17:35,123 --> 01:17:37,334
but l have to borrow some more money.

1079
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:41,212
- Well, that's fine...
- What l've decided to do is some writing.

1080
01:17:41,379 --> 01:17:45,425
l've had it with acting. These
meaningless auditions are cattle-calls.

1081
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:48,970
l can't handle another rejection.
You know, let's face it here.

1082
01:17:49,137 --> 01:17:52,307
l've gotta latch onto something in my life.

1083
01:17:52,474 --> 01:17:58,021
Something with a future.
l'm not 16 any more. lt's just... crazy.

1084
01:17:58,146 --> 01:18:02,734
But l've got an idea for a story,
more than one,

1085
01:18:02,859 --> 01:18:06,571
and l just need a few months,
or a year, even.

1086
01:18:06,696 --> 01:18:10,283
l've picked up a lot about
dramatic structure from acting class.

1087
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:15,830
That's good. lt just seems to me
that... six months or a year,

1088
01:18:15,956 --> 01:18:18,375
if you spent it more productively...

1089
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,753
- Like what?
- Well, l don't know. Um...

1090
01:18:21,878 --> 01:18:25,966
Didn't Mom mention there was something
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

1091
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:30,720
- That's clerical.
- No, it was in the publicity department.

1092
01:18:30,845 --> 01:18:34,224
- That can lead to other things.
- l knew you'd be discouraging!

1093
01:18:34,349 --> 01:18:36,643
l'm not. l'm trying to be helpful.

1094
01:18:36,768 --> 01:18:41,231
You don't just say one day ''l'm
finished as an actress. Now l'm a writer.''

1095
01:18:41,356 --> 01:18:44,442
- You mean, not at my age.
- Please, we came to have lunch.

1096
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:48,154
Yeah, OK, right. Forget it. What's to eat?

1097
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,700
l just want a salad.
You really think l'm a loser, don't you?

1098
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:54,244
- You're being ridiculous.
- You are. Stop it.

1099
01:18:54,369 --> 01:18:56,705
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

1100
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,958
You never have faith in my plans,
you undercut my enthusiasm...

1101
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,627
Not so, no. l think
l've been very supportive.

1102
01:19:02,752 --> 01:19:05,630
l try to give you honest,
constructive advice.

1103
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:07,966
l'm always happy to help you financially.

1104
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:11,636
l've gone out of my way to introduce you
to interesting single men...

1105
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:14,431
- They're all losers.
- You're too demanding.

1106
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:17,851
l could tell what you thought of me
by the men you fixed me up with.

1107
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:20,437
- That's not true!
- l know l'm mediocre.

1108
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:23,982
Would you stop attacking Hannah?
She's going through a rough time.

1109
01:19:24,107 --> 01:19:27,694
- Why are you so upset?
- You've picked on her since she came in.

1110
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:30,030
Leave her alone. l'm suffocating.

1111
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:32,866
What's the matter, Lee?
Why are you so sensitive?

1112
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:35,744
Listen. You wanna write, write.

1113
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:38,079
Let's just not talk about it any more.

1114
01:19:38,246 --> 01:19:41,833
Take a year, take six months,
whatever you want.

1115
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,837
Who knows? Maybe you'll
be sitting with a good play.

1116
01:19:46,004 --> 01:19:49,507
What's the matter with you?
You look pale. Are you OK?

1117
01:19:49,633 --> 01:19:51,968
Yeah, you know, l'm just...

1118
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:56,931
l've got dizzy all of a sudden and
l have a headache. l think we need to eat.

1119
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:18,995
l can't seem to take action.
l'm like Hamlet, unable to kill his uncle.

1120
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,666
l want Lee, but l can't harm Hannah.

1121
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,877
And in no other area
am l a procrastinator.

1122
01:20:28,254 --> 01:20:31,967
Meanwhile, Lee has no direction.
She's taking courses at Columbia.

1123
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:34,052
Butjust randomly.

1124
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:37,597
l try not to call her, but then she calls me,

1125
01:20:37,722 --> 01:20:43,687
and then l call, and we try to resist
meeting, but once in a while we meet.

1126
01:20:43,812 --> 01:20:47,399
Sometimes we argue because
l can't break up my marriage.

1127
01:20:47,524 --> 01:20:52,529
Sometimes we wind up making love,
and we both feel terrible.

1128
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:54,864
But it's my fault.

1129
01:20:56,199 --> 01:21:00,870
For all my education, accomplishments
and so-called wisdom,

1130
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:03,999
l can't fathom my own heart.

1131
01:21:04,124 --> 01:21:06,001
Krishna, Krishna

1132
01:21:06,126 --> 01:21:08,545
Hare, Hare...

1133
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,964
Why do you want to be a Hare Krishna?

1134
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:16,761
Well, l'm not saying l want to join, but l
know you guys believe in reincarnation.

1135
01:21:16,886 --> 01:21:19,848
- What's your religion?
- l was born Jewish.

1136
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:23,476
Last winter l tried to become a Catholic,
and it didn't work for me.

1137
01:21:23,602 --> 01:21:25,687
l studied and l gave it everything,

1138
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:29,316
but Catholicism for me was:
die now, pay later.

1139
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:33,069
- l couldn't get with it, and l wanted to.
- Are you afraid of dying?

1140
01:21:33,194 --> 01:21:35,614
Well, yeah, naturally. Aren't you?

1141
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:39,326
Does reincarnation mean my soul
would pass to another human being,

1142
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:42,454
or would l come back as a moose
or an aardvark or something?

1143
01:21:42,621 --> 01:21:46,875
Take our literature,
read it over and think about it.

1144
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,129
- OK. Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

1145
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:56,885
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna be a Krishna?

1146
01:21:57,052 --> 01:22:00,972
You're gonna shave your head and put on
robes and dance around at airports?

1147
01:22:01,139 --> 01:22:03,725
You'll look like Jerry Lewis.

1148
01:22:03,892 --> 01:22:05,894
God, l'm so depressed.

1149
01:22:16,112 --> 01:22:18,990
The nights are really getting cooler.

1150
01:22:19,115 --> 01:22:22,994
Summer went so quickly. Soon it'll be fall.

1151
01:22:25,038 --> 01:22:27,791
My literature professor really likes me.

1152
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:30,961
lt was fun being out with him last night.

1153
01:22:31,086 --> 01:22:35,465
Funny, l feel like l'm betraying Elliot,
but that's ridiculous.

1154
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:38,843
Why shouldn't l see Doug?
Elliot's not free.

1155
01:22:39,928 --> 01:22:41,972
Just go one step at a time.

1156
01:22:43,056 --> 01:22:46,017
Let's see what the next few months bring.

1157
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:48,937
Hannah? Hi!

1158
01:22:49,062 --> 01:22:53,900
Listen, you'll be happy to know that your
money has not gone completely to waste.

1159
01:22:54,025 --> 01:22:58,029
No, l have an actual first rough draft
of something l wrote.

1160
01:22:58,154 --> 01:23:00,240
Yeah, yeah.

1161
01:23:00,365 --> 01:23:03,535
l showed it to Lee and
she gave me some good pointers.

1162
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:07,455
Listen, l'm pretty near where you live.
Could l just drop it off?

1163
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:12,294
When you have some time, read it,
and we'll talk at Thanksgiving.

1164
01:23:12,419 --> 01:23:15,547
OK? All right. Oh, wait, listen.

1165
01:23:16,423 --> 01:23:21,845
l think Lee met an interesting guy
at Columbia. He sounds really nice.

1166
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:27,559
Yeah, OK, all right. Well,
we'll talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.

1167
01:23:29,019 --> 01:23:32,355
Now, here's a song that Norma sang

1168
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,317
on that trip we made
up to the show in Buffalo.

1169
01:23:35,442 --> 01:23:38,403
And, oh, was she beautiful that night!

1170
01:23:38,528 --> 01:23:41,156
- Come on!
- Oh, yes, you were, dear.

1171
01:23:41,281 --> 01:23:45,452
Don't you remember that night?
She was so beautiful

1172
01:23:45,577 --> 01:23:47,954
that when men saw her
walking along the street,

1173
01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:51,958
they'd drive their cars
right up on the sidewalk.

1174
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,878
- That right, honey?
- A slight exaggeration.

1175
01:23:55,003 --> 01:23:57,047
But only slight.

1176
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:25,784
You've been very cold to me tonight.

1177
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:27,577
No.

1178
01:24:27,702 --> 01:24:29,955
ls something wrong?

1179
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,166
Not here.
There are too many people around.

1180
01:24:35,085 --> 01:24:36,795
Hey, Hannah?

1181
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:42,592
l think Lee is really serious about
her new boyfriend. He sounds really nice.

1182
01:24:42,717 --> 01:24:45,804
l'm so happy for her. l think she's in love.

1183
01:24:45,929 --> 01:24:49,766
- Hey, what's the matter?
- l'm real upset about what you wrote.

1184
01:24:49,891 --> 01:24:52,727
- My script?
- lt's obviously based on Elliot and me.

1185
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:56,356
- Oh, so loosely.
- No, not loosely. Real specifically!

1186
01:24:56,481 --> 01:24:58,108
ls that how you see us?

1187
01:24:58,233 --> 01:25:02,821
Can l not accept gestures and feelings
from people? Do l put people off?

1188
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:05,615
- lt's a made-up story.
- No, it's real exact!

1189
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,076
The situations, dialogue, everything.

1190
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:11,371
lt's full of intimate details
between Elliot and me,

1191
01:25:11,496 --> 01:25:14,749
which l don't see how you
could even possibly know about!

1192
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:17,127
A conversation we once had
about adoption?

1193
01:25:17,252 --> 01:25:20,839
Lee mentioned that to me,
so obviously you discussed it with her.

1194
01:25:20,964 --> 01:25:23,300
l took the essence and
l blew it up into drama.

1195
01:25:23,425 --> 01:25:27,137
How could Lee know about these things?
l don't tell her everything.

1196
01:25:27,262 --> 01:25:29,055
Wow. l guess l hit a nerve.

1197
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:33,768
You make it sound like l have no needs.
You think l'm too self-sufficient?

1198
01:25:33,893 --> 01:25:36,479
Hannah, that's not what l meant.
You know?

1199
01:25:36,605 --> 01:25:39,399
Everybody relies on you
for so much. You're so giving!

1200
01:25:39,524 --> 01:25:41,901
lt's no criticism.
We love you, we're grateful.

1201
01:25:42,027 --> 01:25:44,279
You're grateful but you resent me.

1202
01:25:44,404 --> 01:25:48,116
Wow. l don't wanna have this
conversation. l didn't do anything wrong.

1203
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:51,202
You told me yourself
you and Elliot were having problems.

1204
01:25:51,328 --> 01:25:53,872
We were, but they're my business.

1205
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:56,583
l don't see how you could
know it in such detail!

1206
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:00,337
How does Lee know about these things?
How? They're private!

1207
01:26:00,462 --> 01:26:04,299
- Why don't you share them with us?
- l don't want to bother everyone.

1208
01:26:04,424 --> 01:26:07,052
That's the point. l'd like to be bothered.

1209
01:26:07,177 --> 01:26:10,847
How could you know about these things?
Has Elliot been talking to you?

1210
01:26:11,014 --> 01:26:14,684
No, he hasn't. lf l offended you, l'm sorry.

1211
01:26:17,938 --> 01:26:21,024
lt's over, Elliot.
l don't know how to be any clearer.

1212
01:26:21,191 --> 01:26:23,860
- l know l deserve it...
- l'm just as much at fault.

1213
01:26:23,985 --> 01:26:27,489
- l have such feelings for you...
- l've got to be honest with you.

1214
01:26:27,614 --> 01:26:28,657
l've met someone else.

1215
01:26:28,782 --> 01:26:31,242
- What do you mean?
- l've met someone else.

1216
01:26:31,368 --> 01:26:35,330
- l told you l wouldn't wait for ever.
- lt hasn't been for ever.

1217
01:26:35,455 --> 01:26:38,792
lt's been nearly a year and
you're still married to my sister,

1218
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:42,796
which l now realise is fine. You're much
more in love with her than you know.

1219
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:46,633
- But we made so many plans.
- And in a way you led me on.

1220
01:26:46,758 --> 01:26:49,177
l truly believed you were
unhappy with Hannah.

1221
01:26:49,302 --> 01:26:51,596
Otherwise l would
never have been drawn in.

1222
01:26:51,721 --> 01:26:55,225
l was very weak. So were you.
Now l've met someone...

1223
01:26:58,728 --> 01:27:01,606
- Dinner soon?
- About 1 5 minutes.

1224
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:07,320
- But you're in love overnight.
- l care a great deal about him, yes.

1225
01:27:07,445 --> 01:27:11,324
- Lee...
- lt's over. Elliot, l mean it. lt's over.

1226
01:27:14,494 --> 01:27:18,206
Sweetheart, l loved your script.
l thought it was so clever.

1227
01:27:18,331 --> 01:27:21,251
You're my mother.
Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker.

1228
01:27:21,376 --> 01:27:23,837
l particularly liked
the character of the mother,

1229
01:27:23,962 --> 01:27:27,465
just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.

1230
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,051
- l'm so proud!
- Oh, Mom, thanks.

1231
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:33,305
Here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right?

1232
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:37,183
Are we supposed to have beer?
Yes, let me hear it!

1233
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:39,185
How's that, Fletcher?

1234
01:27:39,311 --> 01:27:43,440
Doll, to Thanksgiving. Here's a little
toast, doll. Come on, bottoms up!

1235
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:48,194
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee
about us, about our personal life?

1236
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,988
Me? Of course not.

1237
01:27:50,113 --> 01:27:55,243
Holly wrote things about us that are so
personal, they must have come from you.

1238
01:27:55,368 --> 01:27:58,121
l've got a headache and
l don't like being accused!

1239
01:27:58,246 --> 01:28:04,419
l'm not accusing, l'm asking. Do you
find me too giving, too competent?

1240
01:28:04,586 --> 01:28:07,672
- Too disgustingly perfect or something?
- No.

1241
01:28:07,839 --> 01:28:11,009
What is it? What's come between us?
How have l alienated you?

1242
01:28:11,134 --> 01:28:14,554
- Hannah, my head is throbbing.
- You never wanna talk about it.

1243
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:18,767
Every time l bring it up,
you change the subject. What is it?

1244
01:28:18,892 --> 01:28:21,728
We're communicating less,
you sleep with me less...

1245
01:28:21,853 --> 01:28:24,773
Hannah, l am very mixed up! Now, please!

1246
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:28,193
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back? Do you?

1247
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,654
You must. They seem to
know so much about us.

1248
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:33,740
Maybe l've asked advice
once or twice, or made a joke.

1249
01:28:33,865 --> 01:28:37,702
Do you talk to Holly, or Lee,
or what? Do you phone them?

1250
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:39,871
Leave me alone, can you?!

1251
01:28:39,996 --> 01:28:42,958
Jesus, l've told you.
l need someone l can matter to!

1252
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:45,585
You matter to me, completely.

1253
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:49,673
lt's hard to be around someone who gives
so much and needs so little in return.

1254
01:28:49,798 --> 01:28:51,675
l have enormous needs.

1255
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,303
Well, l can't see them,
and neither can Lee or Holly!

1256
01:29:55,822 --> 01:29:58,700
lt's so pitch black tonight.

1257
01:30:00,452 --> 01:30:02,495
l feel lost.

1258
01:30:03,913 --> 01:30:05,957
You're not lost.

1259
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:17,636
l love you so much.

1260
01:31:08,019 --> 01:31:12,232
l don't know if you remember me, but we
had the worst night of my life together.

1261
01:31:12,357 --> 01:31:14,567
- l remember you.
- Yes, you do recall?

1262
01:31:14,693 --> 01:31:18,822
l was walking past and l just
saw you and l thought l'd come in.

1263
01:31:18,947 --> 01:31:22,867
- We didn't hit it off.
- We did all but exchange gunshots.

1264
01:31:22,993 --> 01:31:25,328
- How are you?
- Good. You look wonderful.

1265
01:31:25,453 --> 01:31:27,747
- Oh, no.
- Yeah? No, you do.

1266
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:31,626
lt was a terrible evening. Remember
slamming the cab door in my face?

1267
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:35,213
You came dangerously close
to emasculating my nose

1268
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:38,883
- in a really horrible way.
- That was a long time ago.

1269
01:31:39,009 --> 01:31:40,969
- People change.
- l hope you've changed.

1270
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:43,263
- l hope you have too.
- l hope so, for your sake.

1271
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:48,268
Your personality left something
to be desired, namely a personality.

1272
01:31:48,393 --> 01:31:50,770
So how are you? What are you doin'?

1273
01:31:50,895 --> 01:31:54,441
Oh, nothing much. Just some stuff.
Little of this, little of that.

1274
01:31:54,566 --> 01:31:58,695
Was that an embarrassing question?
Are you out of work or something?

1275
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:02,782
- No, well, l've been trying to write.
- Have you? That's interesting.

1276
01:32:02,907 --> 01:32:05,035
- What kind of stuff?
- Oh...

1277
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,330
- You're not interested in this.
- No, you can tell me. l am.

1278
01:32:08,455 --> 01:32:10,999
Millions must say to you
''l've written something.''

1279
01:32:11,124 --> 01:32:13,335
- Nobody ever said it. This is it.
- Really?

1280
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:18,965
- Would you be willing to read something?
- Yes, if it would mean anything to you.

1281
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:23,094
l don't know why it would.
You've always hated my taste in the past.

1282
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:25,347
- No, l haven't!
- You have.

1283
01:32:25,513 --> 01:32:30,685
l think it might make a great television
script, and you're so active in television.

1284
01:32:30,852 --> 01:32:34,689
Not any more.
l haven't been in television for a year.

1285
01:32:34,856 --> 01:32:39,736
No, l may have to get back into it cos my
accountant says l'm running out of cash.

1286
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:44,449
But no, l sort of dropped out for a year,
which is a long, dull story.

1287
01:32:44,616 --> 01:32:47,827
- You're OK, though?
- Yes, l'm fine. How are you?

1288
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:49,746
- l'm fine.
- What about your script?

1289
01:32:49,871 --> 01:32:53,375
l'd love it if you'd read it
cos l really would value your opinion.

1290
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,587
But you have to remember while you're
reading and you're cursing my name

1291
01:32:57,712 --> 01:33:00,799
that this is my first script.
Well, it's not my first.

1292
01:33:00,924 --> 01:33:04,511
That was about Hannah and
her husband, but Hannah read it.

1293
01:33:04,636 --> 01:33:07,055
She got really angry and l felt badly.

1294
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:12,185
- l can't imagine what you wrote.
- lt wasn't anything bad, but l don't know...

1295
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:15,397
So l threw it out, but l have this other one.

1296
01:33:15,522 --> 01:33:19,025
Well, you know,
if you want me to, l would read it.

1297
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,903
l don't know... Could l come over
tomorrow and read it to you?

1298
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:25,907
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
You must be joking!

1299
01:33:26,032 --> 01:33:29,244
l've been doing
all my own reading since l was 40.

1300
01:33:29,369 --> 01:33:32,330
l think it's lucky l ran into you. Maybe.

1301
01:33:32,455 --> 01:33:34,499
What about me? l should have kept going.

1302
01:33:34,624 --> 01:33:38,503
l have a nagging sensation
that l should have kept walking

1303
01:33:38,628 --> 01:33:40,964
and not begun this conversation.

1304
01:33:42,173 --> 01:33:44,926
<i>''We all go through life
playing the hand we're dealt.''</i>

1305
01:33:45,051 --> 01:33:48,263
<i>''Craig: And what hand were you dealt?''</i>

1306
01:33:48,388 --> 01:33:53,059
<i>''Emily: l'm two high pair,
maybe even aces up.''</i>

1307
01:33:53,184 --> 01:33:56,271
<i>''The problem is,
you've got three deuces.''</i>

1308
01:33:57,606 --> 01:33:59,649
That's the end.

1309
01:34:00,567 --> 01:34:05,739
No, you can tell me straight.
lt's okay. Just tell me what you think.

1310
01:34:05,864 --> 01:34:07,574
lt's great.

1311
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:09,951
l'm... speechless.

1312
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:14,581
l was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

1313
01:34:16,374 --> 01:34:20,295
l don't know what to say.
l'm moved and l laughed and l...

1314
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,881
l was on the edge of my seat.
lt's wonderful.

1315
01:34:23,006 --> 01:34:26,384
l'm totally stunned. This is not an insult.

1316
01:34:26,509 --> 01:34:30,805
l'm amazed that you can...
l just thought it was great.

1317
01:34:30,972 --> 01:34:33,642
- Really?
- Yes. l was absolutely...

1318
01:34:33,767 --> 01:34:36,686
What made you think
of that climax scene,

1319
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:40,315
where the architect is walking home
with his actress girlfriend

1320
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:43,985
and the schizophrenic ex-wife
jumps out and stabs him to death?

1321
01:34:44,152 --> 01:34:48,073
- lt just came to me one day.
- lt was just fabulous.

1322
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,492
Gosh, you really think l can write?

1323
01:34:50,659 --> 01:34:53,578
There's one or two things
l would do differently myself,

1324
01:34:53,745 --> 01:34:57,040
but who cares? lt was fabulous.

1325
01:34:57,165 --> 01:35:02,379
l mean lt. l'm so impressed!
l am. You've made my day.

1326
01:35:02,504 --> 01:35:06,967
lt was just great.
l was set to be bored stiff.

1327
01:35:07,092 --> 01:35:11,471
- Would you like to have lunch?
- l would love to talk about the script.

1328
01:35:11,596 --> 01:35:14,015
- l think we could do something with it.
- OK.

1329
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:17,602
And l'd like to hear what made you
suddenly decide to drop out of life.

1330
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:20,313
- Who cares?
- No, l care.

1331
01:35:20,438 --> 01:35:23,233
You used to be so ambitious and...

1332
01:35:23,358 --> 01:35:25,610
God, you really liked it?!

1333
01:35:47,924 --> 01:35:52,429
Gosh, you really went through a crisis,
you know that? How did you get over it?

1334
01:35:52,554 --> 01:35:58,184
When l ran into you, you seemed
just perfectly fine. You seem fine now.

1335
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:03,273
Well, l'll tell you. One day,
about a month ago, l really hit bottom.

1336
01:36:03,398 --> 01:36:07,944
ljust felt that in a Godless universe,
l didn't want to go on living.

1337
01:36:08,069 --> 01:36:13,533
Now, l happen to own this rifle, which
l loaded and pressed to my forehead,

1338
01:36:13,658 --> 01:36:16,161
and l remember thinking.;
l'm gonna kill myself.

1339
01:36:16,286 --> 01:36:19,164
Then l thought.; what ifl'm wrong?

1340
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:22,459
What ifthere is a God?
After all, nobody really knows that.

1341
01:36:22,584 --> 01:36:25,962
But then l thought.;
no, maybe is not good enough.

1342
01:36:26,087 --> 01:36:28,590
l want certainty or nothing.

1343
01:36:28,715 --> 01:36:31,801
And l remember very clearly
the clock was ticking

1344
01:36:31,927 --> 01:36:34,971
and l was sitting there, frozen,
with the gun to my head,

1345
01:36:35,096 --> 01:36:37,474
debating whether to shoot.

1346
01:36:39,809 --> 01:36:45,398
All ofa sudden, the gun went off. l had
been so tense, l'd squeezed the trigger.

1347
01:36:45,565 --> 01:36:50,028
But l was perspiring so much, the gun
had slid offmy forehead and missed me.

1348
01:36:50,153 --> 01:36:54,199
Neighbours were pounding on the door

1349
01:36:54,366 --> 01:36:57,452
and, l don't know, the whole scene
wasjust pandemonium.

1350
01:36:57,577 --> 01:37:03,249
And l ran to the door, l didn't know what
to say. l was embarrassed and confused.

1351
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:07,712
My mind was racing a mile a minute,
and ljust knew one thing.

1352
01:37:07,837 --> 01:37:14,302
l had to get out ofthat house, just
get out in the fresh air and clear my head.

1353
01:37:14,427 --> 01:37:18,223
And l remember very clearly
l walked the streets.

1354
01:37:18,348 --> 01:37:24,437
l didn't know what was going through my
mind. lt all seemed so violent and unreal.

1355
01:37:24,562 --> 01:37:28,149
And l wandered for a long time
on the Upper West Side.

1356
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:33,780
lt must have been hours. My feet hurt and
my head was pounding. l had to sit down.

1357
01:37:33,905 --> 01:37:38,159
l went into a movie house. l didn't know
what was playing. ljust needed a moment

1358
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:40,787
to gather my thoughts and be logical

1359
01:37:40,912 --> 01:37:44,374
and put the world
back into rational perspective.

1360
01:37:53,216 --> 01:37:56,595
And l went upstairs
to the balcony and l sat down.

1361
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:01,975
The movie was a film that l'd seen
many times in my life since l was a kid,

1362
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,269
and l always loved it.

1363
01:38:04,394 --> 01:38:06,855
And l'm watching these people
up on the screen

1364
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,233
and l started getting hooked on the film.

1365
01:38:10,358 --> 01:38:16,906
And l started to feel.; how can you even
think ofkilling yourself?. lsn't that stupid?

1366
01:38:17,032 --> 01:38:19,159
Look at all the people on the screen.

1367
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:22,787
They're real funny, and
what ifthe worst is true?

1368
01:38:22,912 --> 01:38:27,167
What ifthere's no God and you
only go around once and that's it?

1369
01:38:27,292 --> 01:38:29,753
Don't you want to be
part ofthe experience?

1370
01:38:29,878 --> 01:38:32,714
What the hell? lt's not all a drag.

1371
01:38:32,839 --> 01:38:36,217
l'm thinking to myself.;
l should stop ruining my life,

1372
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:41,473
searching for answers l'm never gonna
get, andjust enjoy it while it lasts.

1373
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:46,436
And after, who knows? Maybe there
is something. Nobody really knows.

1374
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:52,400
l know ''maybe'' is a slim reed to hang
your life on, but it's the best we have.

1375
01:38:52,525 --> 01:38:58,114
Then l started to sit back and
l actually began to enjoy myself.

1376
01:38:58,281 --> 01:38:59,824
Oh, Freedonia

1377
01:38:59,991 --> 01:39:01,701
Oh, don't you cry for me

1378
01:39:01,868 --> 01:39:03,870
Cos l'm coming round the mountain

1379
01:39:04,996 --> 01:39:06,373
Um...

1380
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:10,752
Look, there's something that's been
bothering me for a long time.

1381
01:39:10,919 --> 01:39:15,882
l just thought l'd tell you what it was
and just sort of clear the deck here.

1382
01:39:16,007 --> 01:39:20,345
l've always regretted the way l behaved
that evening we went out.

1383
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:24,557
- l just thought l'd tell you that...
- Don't be silly. Don't be ridiculous.

1384
01:39:24,683 --> 01:39:27,852
l was the... You know, it was my fault.

1385
01:39:29,354 --> 01:39:34,234
So you wanna go out to dinner again?
Do you have any interest in that?

1386
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:37,696
- Sure.
- Are you free this evening?

1387
01:39:37,821 --> 01:39:39,823
Yeah, yeah.

1388
01:39:45,954 --> 01:39:48,206
l want ice! Who's got some?

1389
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:49,874
Oh, there it is.

1390
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,085
Hey, where's Holly? She's late.

1391
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:55,088
Did you read Holly's last thing?
She's really developed.

1392
01:39:55,213 --> 01:39:57,299
She really writes good dialogue.

1393
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:59,926
Hannah, can l say you're
going to play Desdemona?

1394
01:40:00,051 --> 01:40:03,555
- Mom, it's only television.
- But it's public television.

1395
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,725
To me, Shakespeare doesn't
get any greater than Othello.

1396
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:11,062
- You with some big, black stud. l love it!
- Oh, honey!

1397
01:40:37,005 --> 01:40:40,008
Oh, Lee. You are something.

1398
01:40:41,092 --> 01:40:45,221
You look very beautiful.
Marriage agrees with you.

1399
01:40:47,557 --> 01:40:52,520
Everything that happened between us
seems more and more hazy.

1400
01:40:53,897 --> 01:40:58,026
l acted like such a fool.
l don't know what came over me.

1401
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:02,530
The complete conviction
that l couldn't live without you.

1402
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:05,617
What l put us both through!

1403
01:41:05,742 --> 01:41:10,872
And Hannah, who, as you once said,
l love much more than l realised.

1404
01:41:14,793 --> 01:41:18,338
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!

1405
01:41:19,756 --> 01:41:23,551
- Hi, Daisy. l didn't miss dinner, did l?
- No.

1406
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:26,763
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving!

1407
01:41:26,888 --> 01:41:29,975
Happy Thanksgiving, Amy.

1408
01:42:31,161 --> 01:42:33,204
lt's beautiful.

1409
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,835
- Don't be nervous. lt's your husband.
- Hi.

1410
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,670
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Okay.

1411
01:42:40,795 --> 01:42:43,465
- When did you get here?
- Just a few minutes ago.

1412
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:45,800
- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks.

1413
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:50,263
l was talking to your father before.
l was telling him that it's ironic.

1414
01:42:50,388 --> 01:42:53,141
l used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah.

1415
01:42:53,266 --> 01:42:56,645
l never thought that
l could love anybody else.

1416
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:02,359
And here it is, years later, and l'm married
to you, and completely in love with you.

1417
01:43:02,484 --> 01:43:06,488
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

1418
01:43:08,615 --> 01:43:13,662
lt would make a great story, l think. A guy
marries one sister and it doesn't work out.

1419
01:43:13,828 --> 01:43:18,917
Then, years later,
he winds up married to the other sister.

1420
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:21,962
l don't know how you're gonna top that.

1421
01:43:23,129 --> 01:43:25,131
- Mickey?
- What?

1422
01:43:26,549 --> 01:43:28,551
l'm pregnant.

1423
01:43:29,305 --> 01:44:29,825

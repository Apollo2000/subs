she had a wound on her chest.

00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:02,019
I've scoured every
police database I can find,

475
00:50:02,153 --> 00:50:03,221
Zoe never shows up.

476
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:04,889
But look at this.

477
00:50:05,022 --> 00:50:08,192
Jimmy, check out this
missing person's report.

478
00:50:08,326 --> 00:50:12,429
- [Jimmy] Martina Lopez?
- No, Zoe.

479
00:50:12,562 --> 00:50:16,200
Elena's been lying to us
the whole time, Jimmy.

480
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:18,002
Her real name isn't Elena.

481
00:50:18,135 --> 00:50:21,438
It's Sofia Lopez,
and Zoe is Martina Lopez.

482
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:25,442
Both reported missing. The people
controlling all this, they're clearly...

483
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:29,080
They're bringing people here. They're changing
their names, they're erasing their past.

484
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:32,749
I mean, the people here
in Wander, they're all trapped.

485
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,959
Jimmy, she knows you.
Gives us away.

486
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:44,561
- I'll be round back.
- Roger that.

487
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:51,162
- Why'd they send you to me?
- It's all your fault!

Jesus Christ, Arthur.

497
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:42,480
Goddamn.
Did you shoot her, Arthur?

498
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:44,781
Jimmy, I can't remember
telling you

499
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:47,184
where I was
in my voice mail.

500
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:49,053
Huh?

501
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,089
"Jimmy's in on it."

502
00:52:52,223 --> 00:52:54,892
- That's the last thing she said.
- Let's just take a deep breath.

503
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:57,461
No, Jimmy, see,
I'm getting confused

504
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,998
and I can't decipher
if it's you or if it's me!

505
00:53:01,132 --> 00:53:02,166
All right.

506
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,603
I'll make a confession, Arthur.

507
00:53:08,538 --> 00:53:10,341
I lied to you.

508
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:14,677
Elena first made contact with me through
the PI website that I built for you.

509
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:18,149
And I told her
to call the show.

510

[sighs]

511
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:23,287
I, uh, needed the money.

512
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:26,656
And I'm sorry, all right?

513
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,861
But I always had a gut feeling
that there was...

514
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:33,064
there was something more
to all of this...

515
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:35,166
Wander, Elena, Zoe...

516
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,802
- [Arthur] Jimmy.
- Some link between here

517
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:41,272
and what happened
to your family.

518
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:44,108
- Don't talk about my family.
- And I was right.

519
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,944
We were right.

520
00:53:47,078 --> 00:53:49,612
Jimmy, I'm barely
hanging on here.

Arthur.

522
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,020
We're pinning down the truth.

523
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:00,858
Stay with it.

524
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:03,894
You know me.

525
00:54:04,428 --> 00:54:05,896
Do I, Jimmy?

I never wanted blood

It's a war, Jimmy...

between the dark
and the light.

536

Light.

537

You're light, Jimmy.

I hope so.

Every name on this ledger

Every one of these people

- Martina, Sofia...
- Zoe and Elena.

We got these two.

544
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,979
All right, I saw them
at the truck stop

545
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:04,181
and then trapped
at the Fox Hole.

546
00:56:04,315 --> 00:56:07,184
Men, women, different ages,
various races.

547
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:09,186
Yeah, but they all have
one thing in common.

548
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,021
Hell yeah,
they're all immigrants.

549

That's Ukraine, Syria,
Trinidad, Korea.

Well, we're gonna find out.

I'm going back to the Fox Hole.

Hell yeah.

557
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:38,015
This needs to be exposed.

to investigate a murder.</i>

to something bigger.</i>

out, Wander. It's a sleepy old town.

- He's... he's fine.
- I'm gonna go.

- Shell, this is not your battle to fight with him.
- He's done this before.

570
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,345
He stretches stories, changes the
truth, becomes completely delusional.

571
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:16,714
Right, and who does
he always drag into it?

572
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:19,049
He's going to end up hurting
himself or someone else.

573
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:21,452
Like you. And I don't want
that to happen.

So let's give it the night.

And if he still doesn't
answer his phone,

576
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:29,460
we will go down there and we'll go down
together and we'll sort it all out.

All right,
this is the Fox Hole.

No one's here
this time of day.

I'm gonna download everything
from the computers.

You get the footage of
everything from inside the lab.

If I go down...
you keep running.

you gotta promise me one thing.

632
01:04:12,669 --> 01:04:14,438
<i>You are helping
our country grow</i>

635
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:24,916
<i>So what type of medical testing
did you volunteer for?</i>

636
01:04:25,049 --> 01:04:28,485
<i>A C68 biochip,
the world's leading device</i>

- [man] They're here!

639
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:34,291
Stay here.
Keep downloading that.

640
01:04:34,424 --> 01:04:36,259
[Arthur] Turn around, Jimmy.

641
01:04:36,393 --> 01:04:39,830
- [alarm wailing]
- Gotta be a way out of here. Stairs in back...

642
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:44,334
Come on, Jimmy!

643
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:45,469
- [gunshot]
- Ah!

644
01:04:45,602 --> 01:04:47,604
[gunfire continues]

645
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:56,948
Jimmy!

646
01:05:04,387 --> 01:05:05,822
Jimmy!

647
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:11,828
I'm sorry, Arthur.

648
01:05:18,236 --> 01:05:20,403
So close, Arthur.

649
01:05:22,974 --> 01:05:26,576
[woman] Come on, move!
Move! Up the stairs!

650
01:05:29,113 --> 01:05:32,016
Come on!
Go, go, go! Come on.

651
01:05:43,194 --> 01:05:45,295
[sniffles]

652
01:05:48,266 --> 01:05:50,333
Bag, phone, keys.

653
01:05:50,467 --> 01:05:53,403
If you want the truth about what happened to
your wife and daughter, you'll work with me.

654
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:55,907
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.

655
01:05:59,043 --> 01:06:00,077
Move!

656
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:03,647
And there was
a woman too, Elsa.

657
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,083
<i>CIA, I think.
She took me to the garage.</i>

658
01:06:06,217 --> 01:06:08,718
She's the one in the photos
you texted me, Shell.

659
01:06:10,855 --> 01:06:11,956
[Nick] Her?

660
01:06:13,323 --> 01:06:14,624
Yeah.

661
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:16,861
[Nick]
<i>Her name's Kimberly Clark.</i>

662
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:19,596
She was actually a witness
at the crime scene.

663
01:06:20,131 --> 01:06:21,598
No, she wasn't.

664
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:25,870
<i>She took me to a safe house.</i>

665
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:29,073
<i>Sheriff Santiago was there.</i>

666
01:06:31,175 --> 01:06:35,679
<i>And they told me
who was behind everything.</i>

667
01:06:42,686 --> 01:06:44,255
They prey on runaways.

668
01:06:44,387 --> 01:06:46,523
Lower class, broken homes.

669
01:06:46,656 --> 01:06:49,392
Immigrants.
There, I said it for you.

670
01:06:49,526 --> 01:06:52,330
[Elsa] They lure them here with
the promise of money, housing,

671
01:06:52,462 --> 01:06:54,531
in exchange
for medical testing.

672
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:57,834
Insert the implant
and they're trapped.

673
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:01,538
I'm not who you think I am,
Arthur.

674
01:07:02,173 --> 01:07:03,807
We're all on the same team.

675
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:06,543
You can call me "Elsa."

676
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:09,113
Come on, I got something
to show you.

677
01:07:12,984 --> 01:07:16,653
His real name
was Filipe Jimenez.

678
01:07:16,786 --> 01:07:18,856
Your John Doe from the church.

679
01:07:22,293 --> 01:07:26,030
He's a Colombian refugee who escaped
when his implant malfunctioned.

680
01:07:26,163 --> 01:07:28,199
Canton couldn't have you
looking into things,

681
01:07:28,332 --> 01:07:30,968
- so he had the body stolen from the morgue.
- Who's Canton?

682
01:07:31,102 --> 01:07:34,771
Victor Canton.
Early adopter of chip technology.

683
01:07:34,906 --> 01:07:36,773
He single-handedly
advanced the field.

684
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:39,377
He developed tech
that could track movement,

685
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:41,145
location, vitals.

686
01:07:41,279 --> 01:07:42,779
It was revolutionary.

687
01:07:42,914 --> 01:07:45,349
And attractive
to foreign investors.

688
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,417
Now, what's
the Oryon Project?

689
01:07:48,352 --> 01:07:51,521
Canton changed. He got greedy.

690
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:53,324
Funding sources
became anonymous.

691
01:07:53,456 --> 01:07:54,959
Bigger parties
with deeper pockets.

692
01:07:55,092 --> 01:07:56,894
The fact that Wander
uses immigrants

693
01:07:57,028 --> 01:07:59,462
for its testing
is not an accident.

694
01:07:59,596 --> 01:08:01,933
He took a black ops
government security contract

695
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:03,935
and shifted his focus
to border control.

696
01:08:04,068 --> 01:08:07,604
Border control. He'll control everybody.
So there's that.

697
01:08:07,737 --> 01:08:11,309
The chip links directly to the
subject's central nervous system.

698
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:16,881
When it reaches a set radius,
it could be frozen or shut down.

699
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,516
And you guys can murder
whoever you want.

700
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:22,719
Not exactly how
Canton sees it, but yes.

701
01:08:22,852 --> 01:08:26,589
[Santiago] He told us his intentions were
to progress the greater good of humanity,

702
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:28,926
not to create weapons
for the highest bidder.

703
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,095
And you just go along
for the ride, huh?

704
01:08:33,998 --> 01:08:35,565
Not anymore.

705
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:37,935
Wander has helped shape
Canton's business model.

706
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:40,770
Him and his investors are on the
verge of going wide with the tech.

707
01:08:40,905 --> 01:08:43,908
- Why am I here?
- Canton was the one that made the call

708
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:45,943
on the hit and run
of your car.

709
01:08:49,646 --> 01:08:51,514
He killed my daughter?

710
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:55,987
I wanted you to know that.

711
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:02,792
I am so sorry.

712
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:12,136
You've been watching me?

713
01:09:12,269 --> 01:09:14,738
Because I've been waiting for the
day I could tell you all this.

714
01:09:14,872 --> 01:09:17,008
You deserved
to know the truth.

715
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:19,210
The truth.

716
01:09:19,343 --> 01:09:22,712
Arthur, you are here because I
wanna offer you an opportunity.

717
01:09:22,846 --> 01:09:25,883
- What opportunity?
- I know the pain Canton's actions

718
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:27,650
have caused you with Tanya.

719
01:09:27,784 --> 01:09:30,287
I know how you struggle
with what happened to Cleo.

720
01:09:30,421 --> 01:09:32,756
You don't know anything.

721
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:36,693
[Elsa] I've lost people too.
It's not right.

722
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:40,264
Canton is hardly ever here
in Wander,

723
01:09:40,398 --> 01:09:42,832
but there's a meeting set
tomorrow morning.

724
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:46,836
It's his last meeting before
he sells the Oryon Project.

725
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:49,572
Arthur, you can't tell me you
don't wanna go face to face

726
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:52,276
with the man that destroyed
your family,

727
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:55,112
to get revenge
for your daughter.

728
01:09:56,013 --> 01:09:57,181
Justice.

729
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:03,720
That's the opportunity
I'm offering you.

730
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,145
[Arthur] <i>The plan was...</i>

731
01:10:29,113 --> 01:10:30,680
<i>it was set.</i>

732
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:34,218
<i>That's when
I called you, Shell.</i>

733
01:10:42,426 --> 01:10:43,527
Arthur!

734
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,063
Shelley, Jimmy's dead.

735
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,870
But, uh, the things,
they changed.

737
01:11:05,382 --> 01:11:07,084
First time meeting him.

01:11:13,057 --> 01:11:14,492
Luis.

739

[song continues]

740
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,341
Follow my lead.

741
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:03,073
Santiago,
what are we doing here?

742
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:04,308
Now!

743
01:12:05,376 --> 01:12:06,911
[gunfire]

744
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:09,413
What are you doing?

745
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:12,183
Always knew
I couldn't trust you.

746
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,958
Elsa, Santiago told me
you were shot dead yesterday.

747
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,327
Had to get you here somehow.

748
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:28,831
Lost your focus a long time ago,
Victor, and I'm tired.

749
01:12:35,339 --> 01:12:36,907
What are you doing?

750
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:47,318
You want your apology?
Now's your chance.

751
01:12:48,818 --> 01:12:52,456
Victor Canton,
meet Arthur Bretnik.

752
01:12:56,227 --> 01:12:59,063
Do it, Arthur.
He murdered your daughter.

753
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:04,168
You think killing me
is gonna stop any of this?

754
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:08,539
Shooting me is exactly
what they want.

755
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:11,141
You shoot, they win.

756
01:13:13,344 --> 01:13:15,045
Just why don't you say it?

757
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:18,048
- You have no idea the complexities...
- Say it!

758
01:13:18,182 --> 01:13:20,317
- This is bigger than all of us.
- Say it!

759
01:13:20,451 --> 01:13:24,188
You were supposed to be alone.
I wasn't driving the truck.

760
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:26,056
Say it!

761
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,324
Say it!

go, go, go, go!</i>

766
01:14:45,936 --> 01:14:47,571
Arthur, it's okay.

767
01:14:50,341 --> 01:14:53,177
Drop the gun. I'll handle this.

768
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,612
Get to the office
and wipe down the computer.

769
01:15:15,866 --> 01:15:17,101
It's done.

770
01:15:59,243 --> 01:16:00,577
Give us a minute.

771

[Shelley]
<i>You know, these are psychotics.</i>

772

<i>And they're known
to create acute anxiety</i>

773

and paranoid delusions in people
with a history of mental illness.

774
01:16:14,391 --> 01:16:16,994
How long you been mixing these?

775
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,730
They played you.

776
01:16:19,864 --> 01:16:23,033
You don't know how powerful these people
are. They're connected everywhere.

777
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,869
For all I know,
this is all part of it.

778
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:28,172
Listen, I'm here as your lawyer,
not just your friend.

779
01:16:28,305 --> 01:16:31,241
And I wonder if there's anything
we're missing.

780
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:33,210
You want proof?

781
01:16:34,077 --> 01:16:36,346
I have one of the chips in me!

782
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:40,217
After the accident,
they put a chip in me.

783
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:42,319
Are you one of them?

784
01:16:43,954 --> 01:16:46,457
I think you're sick again,
Arthur.

785

[Arthur] <i>You need
to check the addresses again.</i>

786

- [Shelley] <i>We checked... They checked every address.</i>

01:16:54,498 --> 01:16:56,667
- [Shelley] <i>It was boarded up.</i>
- <i>Check 'em again.</i>

789
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,504
[Shelley] <i>And the property was reclaimed
after the owner died. The bank claimed it.</i>

790
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:03,440
<i>And the morgue where you said
you found the bodies,</i>

791
01:17:03,574 --> 01:17:06,043
<i>it hasn't been in use
for years.</i>

792
01:17:14,985 --> 01:17:17,087
We found your car.

793
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:18,989
What do you mean,
you found my car?

794
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:27,064
<i>You... you found it?
You found my car?</i>

795
01:17:27,197 --> 01:17:28,632
[Shelley] <i>Yeah.</i>

796
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,537
What's the problem?
'Cause it has all the files from the case.

797
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,606
It has the addresses
I can't remember.

798
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:38,775
[Shelley] But the problem is
what we found in your car.

799
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,444
[Arthur] What did you find?

800
01:17:42,112 --> 01:17:44,314
Jimmy. [sighs]

801
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:00,664
He was decapitated.

802
01:18:13,978 --> 01:18:15,612
Did I...

803
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:25,282
Hi.

804
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:28,852
[chattering]

805
01:19:31,889 --> 01:19:33,457
Morning.

806
01:19:47,137 --> 01:19:48,940
You and that stuff.

807
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:51,475
Anything interesting?

808
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:59,416
We're all just puppets
to the man.

809
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:02,853
Arthur Bretnik,
my resident conspiracist.

810
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:11,561
I like airplanes.

811
01:20:13,196 --> 01:20:14,765
[chuckles]

812
01:20:48,365 --> 01:20:50,267
How you doing, Arthur boy?

813
01:20:51,002 --> 01:20:52,269
[Arthur] Jimmy.

814
01:20:55,173 --> 01:20:56,908
I knew it.

815
01:20:58,308 --> 01:20:59,776
I knew it.

816
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:02,146
I made you a promise.

817
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:05,415
Tanya will never want
for anything.

818
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:10,454
Of that, you can be sure.

819
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,297
Whose body
was in the trunk?

820
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:23,667
[Jimmy] Does it really
matter, Arthur?

821
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:29,974
Did Canton actually order
the hit on my family?

822
01:21:32,009 --> 01:21:33,111
I need to know.

823
01:21:33,243 --> 01:21:34,644
You deserved your revenge.

824
01:21:34,778 --> 01:21:36,346
- Yes or no?
- [Jimmy] Arthur.

825
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,749
- Tell me!
- [Elsa] Yes, Arthur.

826
01:21:39,217 --> 01:21:40,885
He did.

827
01:21:41,018 --> 01:21:43,386
We owed you that much.

828
01:21:44,654 --> 01:21:45,957
Why me?

829
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:49,459
[Elsa] Every good
conspiracy needs a patsy.

830
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:56,333
[Jimmy]
<i>When Filipe and Zoe escaped,</i>

831
01:21:56,466 --> 01:22:00,470
<i>Wander and Canton
became a liability.</i>

832
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:04,441
<i>We needed to clean things up.</i>

833
01:22:04,574 --> 01:22:07,778
<i>We knew if we left you
enough clues...</i>

834
01:22:10,413 --> 01:22:12,984
<i>nudged you
in the right direction...</i>

835
01:22:17,621 --> 01:22:19,891
<i>someone in your mental state</i>

836
01:22:20,024 --> 01:22:22,392
<i>might be able
to shoulder the burden</i>

837
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:25,196
<i>of tying up loose ends.</i>

838
01:22:25,328 --> 01:22:28,431
If anyone ever tries to expose
what's happening in Wander,

839
01:22:28,565 --> 01:22:31,869
we'll be able to deflect,
pin it back to you.

840
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:36,073
A man unhinged.

841
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:40,410
[Arthur] Who are you people?

842
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:42,445
[Jimmy] And you said it
yourself, Arthur.

843
01:22:42,579 --> 01:22:44,748
It's all about keeping
a tight grip.

844
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:50,487
Immigration, incarceration,
border control...

845
01:22:53,257 --> 01:22:55,492
these are all
big concerns for us.

846
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,762
Pawn, patsy or dead.

847
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:04,302
Two outta three ain't bad,
huh, Jimmy?

848
01:23:04,434 --> 01:23:07,504
Hmm, you're a good man,
Arthur.

849
01:23:09,539 --> 01:23:11,808
A silent warrior.

850
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,164
[Arthur] <i>All right now,
Thought Junctioneers.</i>

851
01:23:33,297 --> 01:23:36,033
<i>I wanna talk about trust, okay?</i>

852
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:37,434
<i>Who do you trust?</i>

853
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:39,937
<i>Can you trust, I don't know,</i>

854
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:43,007
<i>say, the person sitting
next to you, huh?</i>

855
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,810
<i>And what do you really know
about them? Look at their face.</i>

856
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:51,581
<i>They look like they have a
modicum of morality or ethics.</i>

857
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,583
<i>But do they really?</i>

858
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:56,020
I am powerful.

859
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:59,123
I am protected.

860
01:23:59,257 --> 01:24:01,025
<i>Now why don't you try
an experiment for me?</i>

861
01:24:01,158 --> 01:24:04,295
<i>Next time you hear about a homicide
or an unfortunate accident,</i>

862
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:07,631
<i>I want you to look at the
person associated with that act</i>

863
01:24:07,764 --> 01:24:09,532
<i>and ask yourself,</i>

864
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:12,636
<i>"If he was walking down
the street,</i>

865
01:24:12,769 --> 01:24:17,774
<i>would you believe that
he is capable of such an act?"</i>

866
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,013
Hmm.

867
01:24:33,124 --> 01:24:35,725
[Arthur] <i>Look at the
person sitting next to you.</i>

868
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:39,663
<i>Look at them.
I mean really look at them.</i>

869
01:24:39,796 --> 01:24:42,499
<i>Look in their eyes,
look inside their soul.</i>

870
01:24:42,632 --> 01:24:47,905
<i>Ask yourself questions, "Is he capable
of that?" "Am I capable of that?"</i>

871
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:49,907
[nurse] You ready
for our walk?

872
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:55,812
- Arthur.
- [Arthur] <i>Search your souls, people.</i>

873
01:24:55,947 --> 01:24:58,115
<i>You don't know
what you're gonna find.</i>

874
01:24:59,383 --> 01:25:02,686
- Arthur, open up!
- <i>This is Atlas Major with Thought Junction.</i>

875
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:05,923

<i>Look, I haven't been
totally honest</i>

879
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:21,198
<i>about what I've been
working on here in Wander.</i>

<i>I got hired
to investigate a murder.</i>

<i>All I ever wanted

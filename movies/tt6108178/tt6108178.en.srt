2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,034
In the beginning,

3
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,396
Hashem made
three types of creatures,

4
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,189
the angels,

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,155
the beasts,

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,476
and the human beings.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,596
The angels, He made
from His pure word.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
The angels have
no will to do evil.

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,079
They cannot deviate for one
moment from His purpose.

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,432
The beasts have only their
instincts to guide them.

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,349
They, too,
follow the commands of their maker.

12
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,995
The Torah states

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,080
that Hashem spent almost
six whole days of creation

14
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,992
fashioning these creatures.

15
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,312
Then, just before sunset,

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,156
He took a small
quantity of earth

17
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,793
and from it He fashioned
man and woman.

18
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,560
An afterthought?

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,036
Or His crowning achievement?

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,954
So, what is this thing?

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,190
Man?

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,190
Woman?

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,037
It is a being with
the power to disobey.

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,514
Alone among
all the creatures

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,159
we have free will.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,157
We hang suspended

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,959
between the clarity
of the angels

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,878
and the desires
of the beasts.

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,990
Hashem gave us choice,
which is both a privilege and a burden.

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,151
We must then choose

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,958
the tangled life

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,190
we live.

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,716
Call an ambulance.

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,350
Rav.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,270
Rav.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,950
Open your eyes.

37
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,516
Take a breath.

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,717
And so you were 15 when you first...
First got a tattoo?

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,075
That one really hurt.

40
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,517
That one hurt,
and it was Jesus there.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,719
- Jesus really hurt.
- Mmm-hmm.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,669
It's lovely.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Are you getting
what you need?

44
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,199
This is fantastic, yeah.
Thank you. Are you all right?

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,280
I'll need a smoke
in a bit.

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,756
Mmm-hmm.
Five more minutes?

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,036
I got it.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,195
Mmm-hmm.

49
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,518
Chin down a little bit.

50
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,637
That's lovely when
you smile a little bit.

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,913
- Ronnie.
- Not now.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,510
Ronnie.

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,155
You need to speak
to this man.

54
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,190
Hello there.

55
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,399
- Yes.
- Is Dovid here?

56
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,994
- Yes.
- Thank you.

57
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,197
Rabbi, there's
someone here to see you.

58
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,038
- Who is it?
- She didn't say.

59
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,675
Thanks, Naomi.

60
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,949
Dovid.

61
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,355
Ronit.

62
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,399
Ronit.

63
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,954
We weren't expecting you.

64
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,599
No?

65
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,391
- I thought...
- May you live a long life.

66
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
Thank you.

67
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm sorry, I forgot.

68
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,193
Did you come straight
from the airport?

69
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,990
Yeah.

70
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,677
Yeah, I'll go to a hotel.

71
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,275
There's people here
to honor the Rav.

72
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,590
Right.

73
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,830
You okay?

74
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,910
Yeah.

75
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,795
How did he die?

76
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,316
Pneumonia, finally.

77
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,399
I'll just find a place
to put these.

78
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,914
- Take this.
- I'll be back.

79
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
- Right.
- Thank you.

80
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,590
Yeah.

81
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,110
Hello.

82
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,990
Hello.

83
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,590
Ronit.

84
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,878
- Fruma?
- It's really you!

85
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,835
Moshe.

86
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,799
Ronit, you're here.

87
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,478
Of course you're here.

88
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,797
Oh.
Hello.

89
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,996
Fruma.

90
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,270
Ronit.

91
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,270
Uncle Hartog.

92
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,870
How are you?

93
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,156
I'm all right.

94
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,475
May you live a long life.

95
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,996
Yeah. Take your coat off.

96
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,113
Come on, and the scarf...

97
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,919
- No, I'm keeping this.
- And the gloves.

98
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,036
Fruma.

99
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,190
So,

100
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,710
you came.

101
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,030
Are you all right?

102
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,035
Have you
got any coffee?

103
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,594
- Can I have some?
- Come.

104
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,432
Do you still take it black?
- Yeah, thanks.

105
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,120
I'll get a cab in a bit.

106
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,792
Stay here, Ronit.

107
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,592
Oh, no, that's all right.
Thank you.

108
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,710
Stay here.

109
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,750
Really?

110
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,430
Thanks.

111
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,395
Hmm.

112
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
So you came to...

113
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,510
To mourn the Rav.

114
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,880
Why else would I be here?

115
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,917
You were never
very predictable.

116
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,592
Are you still
angry with me?

117
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,319
You left very suddenly.

118
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,836
You married?

119
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,875
Mmm.

120
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,915
When did that happen?

121
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,510
A while ago.

122
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,512
Say more. Who is she?
Do I know her?

123
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,313
Oh, God, it's
not Hinda, is it?

124
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,920
Dovid, you didn't marry
Hinda of Hendon, did you?

125
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,197
Oh, you did. You did, you married Hinda.
Oh, shit, Dovid, no.

126
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,509
No.

127
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,236
- No, I didn't marry Hinda.
- Well, that's good.

128
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,278
Although that does leave about 20
women out there identical to Hinda.

129
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,113
- Why are they all exactly the same?
- Don't be cruel.

130
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,310
Hello, Esti.

131
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,954
Ronit. How are you?

132
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,274
I'm, um,

133
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,717
- here, which is strange.
- Mmm-hmm.

134
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,950
How are you?

135
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,840
Uh, may you live
a long life.

136
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,030
Thank you.

137
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,478
You look very, uh,

138
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,873
- New York.
- Well...

139
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,793
Goodness, you look
very frum, Esti.

140
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,040
Shall I take
more food out?

141
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,555
Don't, leave it, let's talk.
Why doesn't

142
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,711
- Dovid's wife do it?
- When she appears.

143
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,238
So who is
Mrs. Kuperman, Esti?

144
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,313
Do we approve?

145
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,875
Ronit was going
to go to a hotel,

146
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,997
but I told her she
should stay with us.

147
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,200
Ah, yes, yes. You must.

148
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,635
Yeah, I'll fold down the bed
in the spare room.

149
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,110
I'll do it. I'll do it.
It's fine.

150
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,515
You're married.

151
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,630
Yes.

152
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
Yes we are, Ronit.

153
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,070
Nobody told me.

154
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,235
Why didn't you
let me know?

155
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,040
You disappeared.

156
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,470
Wow.

157
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,270
Okay.

158
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,760
Congratulations.

159
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,593
No, no,
please. Please.

160
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,190
- Come.
- Okay.

161
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,959
The Hesped is going
to be a big event.

162
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,273
You and Esti
got married?

163
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,594
It was always
the three of us.

164
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,909
Yeah, you went away.

165
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,829
Left the two of us.

166
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,397
Well, I would have come over,
if you'd told me he was ill.

167
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,312
The Rav didn't
want you to know.

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,153
He became very frail at the end.
He probably

169
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,589
didn't want you
to see him like that.

170
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,709
You still should
have called me.

171
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,876
This week has been
harsh, Ronit.

172
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,113
Hmm? Please?

173
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,834
My father just died.

174
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,036
I know.

175
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,550
I know, I was there.

176
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,110
Well,

177
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,678
at least you let me know
he was dead.

178
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,556
It's important that this week
is conducted with honor.

179
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,270
Honor?

180
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,680
It's the most
important thing.

181
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,470
Of course it is.

182
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,157
Sorry, it's
a bit of a mess.

183
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,997
- I'll get you some hangers.
- - Thanks.

184
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,150
What?

185
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,556
I look older?

186
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,359
- I wasn't thinking that.
- Mmm.

187
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,353
I look tired.

188
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,235
We all do.

189
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,118
Esti, do you think
I should stay somewhere else?

190
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,596
Do what you want.

191
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,589
Do the windows open?

192
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,670
No.

193
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,392
Uh, if you want to smoke
you need to go downstairs.

194
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,710
Here.

195
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,318
I brought you
an extra blanket.

196
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,436
"Rav Krushka's
untimely death

197
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,359
"is a crushing blow
to Anglo-Jewry.

198
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,039
"He was a giant of the faith.

199
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,033
"Sadly, he left
no children."

200
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,635
Lazy journalism.

201
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,475
- That would have upset the Rav.
- Childless.

202
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,078
It was probably written
by some 12-year-old reporter.

203
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,830
Forget about it.

204
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,593
Everybody loves him
so much.

205
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,352
I used to wonder if I loved him as
much as all those strangers did.

206
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,116
Sometimes I used to wonder
if I loved him at all.

207
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,710
- You're his daughter.
- Mmm-hmm.

208
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,914
But he was closer to you.

209
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,680
He enjoyed teaching me.

210
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,590
So,

211
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,677
get some sleep, Ronit.

212
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,790
Good night.

213
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,996
Oh, I brought you, um...

214
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,913
I brought this for...
Well, for you.

215
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,430
It's...

216
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,678
- Oh, it's your pictures.
- Yeah.

217
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,750
Wonderful.

218
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,669
Thank you.

219
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,750
Pleasure.

220
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,990
Good night.

221
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,757
So is it good being
married to each other?

222
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,910
Yes.

223
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,834
We're very happy.

224
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,750
Good night.

225
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,910
You all right?

226
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,950
That's my dad.

227
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,196
Come on, let's go.

228
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,595
Sorry for your loss.

229
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,710
You okay?

230
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,396
Yes.

231
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,476
Good morning,
Mrs. Kuperman!

232
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,994
Morning, Rina.
How are you?

233
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,554
- Good, thank you.
- Good.

234
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,438
- How was your week?
- Good.

235
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning.

236
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,870
Good morning, Hannah.

237
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,431
At first, as she's never had
a class of her own, but no.

238
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,590
Good.

239
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,036
I've really appreciated
the time off.

240
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,150
Of course.

241
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,233
It's good to have
you back, Esti.

242
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,350
Oh, thank you.

243
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,360
Good morning, girls.

244
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,511
Good morning,
Mrs. Kuperman.

245
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
Well, I missed you.

246
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,159
- Yosef.
- Rabbi!

247
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,276
Morning.

248
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,792
- Dr. Rigler.
- Good morning.

249
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,913
How is your speech
coming along?

250
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,873
I'm working on it.

251
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,390
- It will be a wonderful Hesped.
- I hope so.

252
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,437
The Rav would be
very proud of you, Dovid.

253
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,230
Appreciate that.

254
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,595
Ronit Krushka
is staying with you, hmm?

255
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,995
Yes, she is.

256
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,710
Good day.

257
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,519
"A bundle of myrrh
is my beloved to me,

258
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,749
"that lies all night
between my breasts.

259
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,832
"My beloved is to me
as a cluster of henna blooms

260
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,072
"in the vineyards
of Ein-Gedi."

261
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,600
Is it about sensuality?

262
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,076
That is, the way in which
true love manifests itself?

263
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,794
But might it also be

264
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,317
that between a male
and a female

265
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,153
that there's something
higher than that.

266
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,958
But isn't it that the
references to sensual pleasures

267
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,554
celebrate physical
love here?

268
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,995
The enjoyment of that love becomes,
in this context, the highest.

269
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,597
"See, you are fair,
my love,

270
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,360
"you are fair,

271
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,873
"your eyes are doves.

272
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,800
"See, you are handsome,
my beloved, yea, pleasing,

273
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,431
"and our bed is verdant."

274
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,317
Could I have a piece
of apple strudel?

275
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,636
And, um, also,
could I get one of these?

276
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,190
The Linzer biscuit, yeah.

277
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,595
- Linzer biscuit?
- Yeah.

278
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,793
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

279
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,195
Do you have shoes?

280
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,235
Yeah, okay.

281
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,916
Candles...

282
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,000
What? Is it wrong?

283
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,795
It's only Uncle Hartog.

284
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,469
No, and Rabbi
and Rebbetzin Goldfarb.

285
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
He still invited me?

286
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,159
No, I have invited you.

287
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,154
- Come on.
- Okay.

288
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,794
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

289
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,270
Okay.

290
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,359
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

291
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,076
Good Shabbos.

292
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,276
Good Shabbos.

293
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,950
- Amen
- OTHERS: Amen.

294
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,795
We understood it
the first time,

295
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,513
you don't have
to explain it.

296
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,910
She always

297
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,559
overexplains a joke.
That's the trouble.

298
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,037
- He never lets it go.
- Hard to get by with such a Jewish name.

299
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,033
Every day he mentions his name.
It's unbelievable.

300
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,520
What kind of
a name is "Andy"?

301
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,956
He's got nothing else to say
about him except his name.

302
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,918
What? No, I have something else to say.
He's a nebbish.

303
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,751
- Yeah, that's the other thing.
- I'm sorry, I love my son.

304
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,832
This is his
own father talking.

305
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,480
- Yeah, what do you think?
- I love him.

306
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,796
So our youngest, Basha,
just had her second boy.

307
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,836
And they named him Daniel, for my father.
Ah, mazel tov.

308
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,472
They live in Australia.
It's too far.

309
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,950
Melbourne.

310
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,633
Thirty-seven grandchildren!

311
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,879
- Mazel tov.
- Not bad.

312
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,594
We saw your photos
in a magazine.

313
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,278
It was the pictures of the
twins that you showed us.

314
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,556
But they
called you Ronnie Curtis?

315
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,154
That's my
professional name.

316
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,557
What was wrong with
your real name, Krushka?

317
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
You should be proud of it.

318
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,756
Artists change
their names sometimes,

319
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,832
- don't they, Moshe?
- That's right, Fruma.

320
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,395
Women change
their names every day.

321
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,230
They take their
husband's names

322
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,879
and their own
history is gone.

323
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,270
Don't they?

324
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,433
I wouldn't talk
about "gone."

325
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,876
Not gone.

326
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,717
Yes, they do.

327
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,870
Ronit,

328
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,159
you look so like
your mother.

329
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,674
Oh, don't start!

330
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,554
Hasn't she got Leah's eyes,
don't you think, Moshe?

331
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,040
Yeah, she's got
beautiful eyes.

332
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,918
- Oh, she's a beauty.
- Uncle...

333
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,833
Your dear sister
was taken far too soon.

334
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,315
And now the Rav.

335
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,234
This must be a terrible
shock for you, Ronit.

336
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,230
You're away, it's a shock.
Of course it is.

337
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,320
We never thought
we'd see you again.

338
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,473
Sorry to disappoint you.

339
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,630
Ronit...

340
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,797
- More coffee?
- Oh, no. No thanks.

341
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,440
I'd love to talk to you about the house,
though, at some point, Uncle.

342
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,316
Yeah, sorry.

343
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,550
Come to the office.

344
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,400
- We'll talk about it there.
- All right.

345
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,234
You know, you must take your
mother's candlesticks, Ronit.

346
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,397
From the house.
Yes, of course, and then

347
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,116
- you must give them to your children.
- Oh, I don't want children.

348
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,793
I'm not having children.

349
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,758
You keep them and then
you pass them on.

350
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,556
Yes. Yes. I want
to sell the house, Uncle.

351
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,315
Do you think you can help me to sell it?
No, please.

352
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,831
- Not now.
- I'm gonna need some help, though.

353
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,196
- Yes, but not... Ronit...
- Sorry.

354
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,272
How old were you, Dovid,

355
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,596
when the Rav took
you in and taught you?

356
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,796
Thirteen, was it?

357
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,472
Mmm... Yeah.
Twelve, thirteen.

358
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,757
Dovid has been
doing great work.

359
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,872
Wonderful work.
Wonderful work.

360
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,875
A lot has changed
since you were here.

361
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,719
There's a lot of problems.

362
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,794
Housing, and jobs...

363
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,390
The youth.

364
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,633
Even an incident with drugs.

365
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,395
Perhaps people should stop
having so many children.

366
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,040
It's nothing we
cannot deal with.

367
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,239
And you're not married.

368
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,757
You must find
someone, Ronit.

369
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,080
- It's not funny growing old alone.
- Oh, well I'm rarely alone.

370
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,793
I've got wonderful friends.

371
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,440
I expect you have lots of fun.
But that will pass.

372
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,238
But being married, well,

373
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,754
that's the way
it should be.

374
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,517
Oh, is it?
The way it should be?

375
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,354
Or is it just
institutional obligation?

376
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Now, Ronit,
stop right there.

377
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,912
I mean, Uncle,
let's just say

378
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,992
I stayed here
for one more year.

379
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,799
Let's think about this,
okay, right?

380
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,599
I would be
married off to whoever

381
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,400
and then, after ten years
in some loveless marriage

382
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
I might have ended up
killing myself.

383
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,997
Or I would've felt
like killing myself.

384
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,478
I am really jetlagged,
so I think I should...

385
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,114
I'm gonna hit the road.

386
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,839
And, I'll see you both
back at the house.

387
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,471
It was great to see you,
Rabbi, Rebbetzin, Fruma.

388
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,070
Happy Shabbos, darling.

389
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,112
Uncle,
thank you for dinner.

390
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,193
- I'll see you guys...
- Why don't you walk her home,

391
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,473
- and I'll catch up.
- Okay.

392
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,319
Sorry.

393
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,312
Thank you,
it was delicious.

394
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,639
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

395
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,030
Ronit.

396
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,116
Hmm.

397
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,951
Why is Rebbetzin
Goldfarb so mean?

398
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,160
She has a good life.
What does she want?

399
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,510
Mmm.

400
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,920
What does anybody want?

401
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,316
What do you really want?
Do you know what you really want?

402
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,437
Yes, I do. I do know.

403
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,831
I want my dad to know
that I loved him.

404
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,035
Do you think
he knew that?

405
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,435
Yes, yes, he did.

406
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,270
He had to know.

407
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,640
I'm so sorry,
so sorry, Ronit.

408
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,114
The Rav...

409
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,279
You've lost your father.

410
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,031
It goes well, actually.
It's lovely, yeah.

411
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,476
I don't normally wear such a bright color.
It's really good.

412
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,671
It goes with the tempo.
It looks beautiful.

413
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,190
- So if you want to just...
- You can just...

414
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,916
- He's ready for you now.
- Thanks.

415
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,632
Um, the wig...

416
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,509
- Uh, Ronit, hello.
- Hello.

417
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,512
- Let's go upstairs, shall we?
- Okay.

418
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,910
Come in.

419
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,749
Have a seat, please.

420
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,550
Ronit...

421
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,549
I've gone frum!

422
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,637
Please don't joke. Hmm?

423
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,630
So...

424
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,395
These are the keys for you to
gather any personal possessions.

425
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,596
A lot of keys.

426
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,875
Hmm.

427
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,550
Would you help me sell it?

428
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,270
Clause three.

429
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,440
"Last will and testament
of Rav Shlomo Krushka."

430
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,351
Rav Krushka, bless his memory,
left the house

431
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,598
and everything in it
to the synagogue.

432
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,318
- I'm sorry if that's a shock.
- No.

433
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,189
It's just a house.

434
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,311
A father should have a child to
look after him in his final hours.

435
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,790
I didn't know
that he was ill.

436
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,116
How could you know
when you're not here?

437
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,640
You were all he had left.

438
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,630
I know.

439
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,113
It must be very
painful for you

440
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,829
not to receive
the Rav's forgiveness.

441
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,233
Hello, Mrs. Kuperman!

442
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,393
- Hello, Shmuli!
- Hello.

443
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,949
- Rivkah, hi.
- Hello, Esti.

444
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,710
- You look great.
- Oh, thank you!

445
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,795
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're good. We're good!

446
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,280
- Good, good.
- And, and,

447
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,432
all the help, Esti,
it was very appreciated.

448
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,710
Of course.

449
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,993
Hi, Shayna. Hi!

450
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,030
Oh, so sweet.

451
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,234
I saw Ronit just now.

452
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,076
Oh...

453
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,393
- Where?
- She was just walking down the street.

454
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,560
She hasn't changed,
has she?

455
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,510
No...

456
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,190
She hasn't.

457
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,115
Oh, okay.

458
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,992
- See you later.
- Bye, bye.

459
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,833
- Bye.
- Bye, Mrs. Kuperman.

460
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,912
There, there.
There, there.

461
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,635
Ronit?

462
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,672
Uh... You're
wearing a wig.

463
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,470
No.

464
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,000
Here. Here, let me.

465
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,830
There you go.

466
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,190
Thank you.

467
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,879
I'm sorry
it's such a mess. I...

468
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,432
Your uncle said he was taking
care of everything, and...

469
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,678
He didn't want us
to touch anything

470
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,359
before they
take it away.

471
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,235
Hmm.

472
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,034
He left it all
to the synagogue.

473
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,555
Mmm-hmm.

474
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,276
Would you really want it?

475
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,277
Financial freedom? No.

476
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,995
That would be
far too easy.

477
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,677
Would've been nice, though,
if he'd just mentioned me in his will.

478
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,514
Left me a pipe.

479
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,990
I know.

480
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,189
I'm not gonna go
to the Hesped.

481
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,190
- What?
- There's no point in my being here.

482
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,155
I'm gonna change
my ticket.

483
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,830
But...

484
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,031
Mmm.

485
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,078
You know, what really gets me
is I never took his portrait.

486
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,230
So, all he did all day,

487
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,834
was stay in here
and read the Torah

488
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,152
and the commentaries on the Torah
and the notes on the commentaries

489
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,237
- and the debates on the notes.
- Mmm.

490
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,031
And it meant we could
do what we wanted.

491
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,837
Esti, do you think
I should go back early?

492
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,910
No.

493
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,790
No.

494
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,596
No, I don't think
you should leave at all.

495
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,959
Oh, thank you.

496
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,950
Thank you.

497
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,150
Oh...

498
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,640
Ronit...

499
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,595
Esti...

500
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,030
When I saw you...

501
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,640
Me too.

502
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,997
Esti, Esti, Esti...

503
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,870
Oh, no.

504
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,031
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

505
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,110
No, it's...

506
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,275
It's okay.

507
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,116
I'm really sorry.

508
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,793
It's fine.

509
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,070
I...

510
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,199
You do look
like your mother.

511
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,680
Oh...

512
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,031
Ronit, are you okay?

513
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,037
It was me
who rang the shul

514
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,279
in New York
to let you know.

515
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,958
I'm just gonna
get some air.

516
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,912
Why did you get married, Esti?
Why didn't you just leave?

517
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,391
Do you remember what the Rav
used to say about marriage?

518
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,510
- No.
- You do.

519
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,920
"Will you grow
old alone?"

520
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,273
No, no. "Will you grow old
with no family, no joys?"

521
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,473
"Dovid is
a good boy. He...

522
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,759
"He has a generous heart,
and he's crazy about you. Marry him."

523
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,436
So everything was
all right when I left?

524
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,870
No.

525
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,158
I was ill.

526
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,710
What sort of ill?

527
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,036
In my head.

528
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,233
The Rav was afraid for me,

529
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,596
and if I had to sleep
with a man,

530
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,831
why not with
our best friend?

531
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,878
Oh, Esti...

532
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,910
I think, I think he felt that
marriage would cure me.

533
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,237
It hasn't been
a complete disaster.

534
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,835
And that's enough?

535
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,917
Do you have to have
sex every Friday?

536
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,593
- It's expected.
- It's medieval.

537
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,830
It's not mandatory.

538
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,037
Nobody gets beaten
if they don't feel like it.

539
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,793
What happened to you?

540
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,190
Nothing.

541
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,155
You happened to me.

542
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,158
And then I started teaching
and that became important.

543
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,479
You can teach anywhere.

544
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,677
I really love the girls.

545
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,752
And I give them ambition.

546
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,600
To do what? Push out seven
babies and be a good wife?

547
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,673
Don't. Don't.
I'm a good teacher.

548
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,277
- And I help them to value themselves.
- Okay, but what about you?

549
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,235
That is me.

550
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,270
Huh.

551
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,350
What?

552
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,310
Do you want a cigarette?

553
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,318
No.

554
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,395
And you? Are you happy?

555
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,750
Yes, I am.

556
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,514
Have you been
with other women?

557
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,270
No.

558
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,990
Not really.

559
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,709
Mmm.

560
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,790
And you?

561
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,030
No.

562
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,270
But, Esti...

563
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,437
Do you still
only fancy women?

564
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,994
Mmm-hmm.

565
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,440
Your bag is, um...

566
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,510
What?

567
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,752
It's extremely erotic.

568
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,679
- Can I take it for a spin?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

569
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,953
You're not frum.
You don't get one.

570
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,190
Oh, please.

571
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,474
- No.
- A quick spin. Come on.

572
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,036
- Please.
- Fine. Have a turn.

573
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,396
One sexy bag, baby.

574
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,200
What about children?

575
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,714
I have three in the bag.
All redheads.

576
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,074
I think it suits me.

577
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,832
This is where
you first kissed me.

578
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,757
It's insane
that you're here.

579
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,559
Oh, fuck!

580
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,795
Ronit?

581
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,396
Is that you?

582
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,591
- Yes.
- What are you doing here?

583
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,669
Oh, I'm just having a wander
around the old places.

584
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,153
This is my husband, Lev.

585
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,350
This is Ronit,
the Rav's daughter.

586
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,591
Remember? I told you
all about her.

587
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,320
How's it going, Lev? Hi.

588
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,796
I hear that you're
attending the Hesped.

589
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,676
The Rav was
a truly great man.

590
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,877
Oh, yes, I know,
I'm his daughter.

591
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,389
Would you like
a cigarette?

592
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,112
Was that
Rebbetzin Kuperman?

593
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,356
No.

594
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,356
Esti!

595
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,196
Are you all right?

596
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,754
Uh, yes. I'm fine.

597
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,316
Esti...

598
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,794
I'll be out in a minute.

599
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,194
What's happened?

600
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,190
What?

601
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,916
What's happened?

602
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,073
<i>"'Tis true.
There's magic in the web of it.</i>

603
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,995
"A sibyl, that had number'd
in the world

604
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,790
"The sun to course
200 compasses,

605
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,470
"In her prophetic fury
sew'd the work.

606
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,270
"The worms were hallow'd
that did breed the silk,

607
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,829
"And it was dy'd in mummy
which the skilful

608
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,434
"Conserv'd of
maidens' hearts."

609
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,509
Very good, Sara.

610
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,520
So what stands out for you
in the play so far?

611
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,996
The handkerchief.
With the strawberries on it.

612
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,309
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,319
And why is
that significant?

614
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,590
Anyone?

615
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,513
Do you remember what Othello
says about how it was made?

616
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,595
Yes, Rina.

617
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,752
He says that the red of it
was dye from virgins' blood.

618
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,400
That's right.
That's right. Yes?

619
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,675
And the lies.

620
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,599
Iago just lies more and more.
And you don't know why.

621
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,235
Mmm. And the killing,
Mrs. Kuperman.

622
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,596
- That was horrible.
- It was.

623
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,120
Her death is very shocking.

624
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,630
But...

625
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,272
- I'm sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Kuperman.
- It's all right.

626
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,113
Mrs. Shapiro needs
to see you.

627
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,320
Uh, thank you.
I'll go in the break.

628
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,120
Immediately, she said.

629
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,713
Keep reading the scenes
in pairs, girls.

630
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,075
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

631
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,594
Good morning, girls.

632
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,956
Good morning,
Miss Scheinberg.

633
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,993
Carry on reading
where you left off.

634
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,675
Come in, Esti.

635
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,356
Mrs. Shapiro...

636
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,070
Have a seat.

637
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,194
We would all be very happy if you
chose to take on the Rav's work.

638
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,636
There are always obstacles, of course,
to anything that is challenging.

639
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,030
It would be difficult to
measure up to the Rav

640
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,789
in any meaningful way.

641
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,470
And your wife.

642
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,912
She would welcome it
if you took over the shul?

643
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,710
Yes. Esti will support me with
whatever decision I make.

644
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,954
And Ronit Krushka?

645
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,551
We were surprised
at her presence.

646
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,760
Ronit is grieving.

647
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,913
And we will make her
very welcome at the Hesped.

648
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,230
Of course.

649
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,436
And Esti? She won't be
distracted by Ronit's return?

650
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,956
Why should she be?

651
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,992
This is my house
we're talking about.

652
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,230
I keep it in order.

653
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,910
Good.

654
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,430
Hello.

655
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,355
Esti? What's happened?

656
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,472
- Are you all right?
- Not here.

657
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,030
Yesterday,

658
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,557
I behaved like an adolescent.

659
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,639
So stupid
and so senseless.

660
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,114
Did someone
say something?

661
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,193
Yes! Yes!
And I live here.

662
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,760
Tell me,
what did they say?

663
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,073
The headmistress, she...

664
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,120
It doesn't matter.
I...

665
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,520
We need to stop this.

666
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,156
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

667
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,554
I can't do this. I can't.

668
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,030
Okay.

669
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,874
We try here.
We try to lead a good life.

670
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,514
I know. I know.

671
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,879
And I do believe profoundly.

672
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,800
The word of Hashem
is my life.

673
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,510
I am...

674
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,600
I'm going to
leave tomorrow.

675
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,399
I don't want you to go.

676
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,914
I don't want that.

677
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,392
Esti, I didn't know anything like this was
going to happen. I really didn't. I...

678
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,235
I didn't even know that I was
going to see you for sure.

679
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,150
Can we just go somewhere else?
Can we just get out of here?

680
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,040
Please, come on.
Come on.

681
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,191
We need to just
go somewhere else.

682
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,350
Come here.

683
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,718
I used to think about
your life in New York.

684
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,720
Mmm.

685
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,197
I tried to imagine
your room.

686
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,720
I kept track of
the time difference.

687
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,392
So I knew when you were awake
and when you were asleep.

688
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,470
What?

689
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:52,111
I was just thinking of
the Rav walking in on us.

690
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,634
Oh, don't.

691
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,916
His face.

692
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,436
What did he say?

693
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,032
"Hashem,
strike me dead!"

694
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,919
Oh, no!

695
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,715
It was awful.

696
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,473
I want to take your picture.

697
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,753
For the <i>Jewish Messenger?</i>

698
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,596
No. No.

699
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,114
Look at me.

700
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,749
Esti, look at me.

701
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,110
Esti?

702
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,520
Sorry I'm so late.

703
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,595
Did you eat something?

704
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,390
Don't...

705
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,313
Mrs. Shapiro made a formal
complaint about you and Ronit.

706
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,236
What?

707
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,554
She came to you?

708
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,350
Yes.

709
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,950
Tell me the truth.

710
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,555
I, uh... I kissed Ronit.

711
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,950
You kissed her?

712
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,676
I'm sorry.

713
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,910
Esti!

714
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,753
- What are you doing to us?
- I've tried!

715
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,274
- I have!
- What do you want?

716
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,919
- I've tried!
- What do you want?

717
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,275
You want to be hurt again?

718
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,992
Has Ronit asked you
to go back with her?

719
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,070
Oh, Dovid!

720
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,399
She'll go back to her friends.
Her men.

721
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,280
What's wrong with you?

722
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,634
What's wrong with you?

723
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,837
I mean, what is it?
Just tell me.

724
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,320
You can tell me.

725
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,954
- Can I? Can I?
- Yes.

726
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,959
- We've always been honest with each other.
- Have we?

727
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,594
- We have. Yes.
- Have we?

728
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,956
I got the message to Ronit
about her father.

729
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,960
- I wanted her to come back.
- No.

730
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,679
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

731
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,519
- She's taking advantage of you.
- Look at me.

732
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,155
- You can't even see it, you're blind.
- No, no one's taking advantage.

733
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,959
- You're blind!
- No!

734
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,156
Look at me!

735
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,239
I wanted it to happen.

736
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,920
And when we were girls...

737
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,990
Even then, it was the same.
It's always been this way!

738
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,631
I have always wanted it.

739
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,280
I think you should leave him.

740
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,230
Really?

741
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,953
And where would I go?

742
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,069
I'm late for school.

743
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,670
Rabbi...

744
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,950
Fruma.

745
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,230
Elliot.

746
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,637
The Rav would be so happy
to know that you came.

747
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,275
I'm so glad we could come.

748
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,675
Joey, thank you for coming
from so far.

749
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,078
- Rabbi, I wish you long life.
- Thank you.

750
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,393
- Rabbi.
- Thank you for being here.

751
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,239
- The Rav will be immensely missed.
- Thank you.

752
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,719
- We're very sorry.
- Thank you for coming.

753
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,190
Very sorry.

754
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,150
Are you not eating?

755
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,750
It's good.

756
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,191
- Very good.
- Hmm.

757
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,157
I booked a flight.
I'll be leaving tonight.

758
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,870
What?

759
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,675
Oh.

760
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,990
That's good.

761
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,275
That's good.

762
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,393
I hope the Hesped goes well.

763
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,069
Now it will.

764
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,790
What about you?

765
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,710
What?

766
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,954
What will you be doing?

767
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,592
Uh, I don't know.

768
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,870
Try. Try to explain it to me.

769
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,792
I can't.

770
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,313
Oh, I should pack.

771
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,236
Goodbye.

772
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,353
It's easier to leave,
isn't it?

773
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,390
No, it isn't.

774
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,675
Are you free?

775
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,596
Excuse me.

776
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,910
Hello?

777
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,950
Dovid?

778
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,070
No.

779
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,199
No, she's not with me.

780
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,634
When did you last see her?

781
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:33,192
Well, she'll be back, Dovid,
don't worry.

782
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,595
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

783
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,157
Oh, I'm sorry, Dovid, can I call you
back when I've gone through security?

784
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,031
Hello. Hello,
where are you flying to today?

785
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,790
New York.

786
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,716
Esti!

787
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,590
Esti.

788
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,350
Esti!

789
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,435
Hmm.

790
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:02,230
Esti?

791
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,153
I wish she'd never
contacted you.

792
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,396
Well, I'm glad that she did
the right thing.

793
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,280
My father died.

794
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,992
- You weren't even going to let me know.
- Can you see why I didn't?

795
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,160
I was protecting my wife.

796
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,870
Dovid...

797
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,717
I want you to give me
my freedom.

798
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,120
Esti, come here.

799
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,794
I was terrified.

800
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,033
I'm sorry.

801
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,959
I didn't mean
for you to worry.

802
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,950
I'm pregnant.

803
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,030
A child.

804
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,919
Hashem is looking over us.

805
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,869
I don't think we should be
together anymore.

806
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,674
- It's His wish.
- No.

807
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,152
I was born
into this community.

808
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,194
I had no choice.

809
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,079
I want my child to be free
to decide.

810
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,152
We've waited so long
for this.

811
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,953
Please give me my freedom.

812
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,151
No, no, no...

813
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,517
- Dovid, you can't...
- Stay out of it.

814
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,030
I can't.

815
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,590
I'm sorry.

816
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,709
You came back.

817
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,233
- Fruma.
- Esti.

818
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,554
I don't want to upset anyone.
I just need to honor my father.

819
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,356
I know.

820
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,990
Please.

821
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,315
Amen.

822
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,231
Why don't you come
to New York?

823
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,430
Why don't you just come
to New York and be with me?

824
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,873
Rav Krushka's departure

825
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,194
leaves us

826
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,279
facing a void,

827
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,755
bewildered.

828
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:41,556
Today,

829
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,957
we take comfort in knowing

830
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,954
that his legacy
will be preserved

831
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,112
and carried through
to the next generation.

832
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,152
I call upon a new voice,

833
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,394
Rav Krushka's
closest disciple,

834
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,350
spiritual son

835
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,116
and successor,

836
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,359
Rabbi Dovid Kuperman.

837
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,389
Rabbi Kuperman.

838
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,071
Rav Krushka often spoke about
the duty of the teacher.

839
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,110
The duty...

840
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,954
I'm sorry, I can't...

841
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:52,110
The Rav's only child, Ronit Krushka,
is here with us today.

842
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,152
The Rav's final words
to us...

843
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,551
Why did he choose to discuss
the idea of choice?

844
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,910
And freedom.

845
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,477
There's nothing so tender

846
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,952
or truthful

847
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,510
as the true feeling
of being free.

848
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,957
Hmm? Free to choose.

849
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,154
The Rav was a giant of Torah.

850
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,514
But it wasn't a giant
we saw collapse that day.

851
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,435
It was a man.

852
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,317
He talked of the angels

853
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,234
and of the desires of
the beasts.

854
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,158
And with his final words,

855
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,153
he reminded us of this.

856
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,959
We are free to choose!

857
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,600
You are free.

858
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,354
You are free!

859
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:57,718
I cannot accept the honor or

860
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,117
position that is offered
to me.

861
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:05,750
I do not have
sufficient understanding.

862
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,595
Please forgive me.

863
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,353
I'm just, uh, slipping out.

864
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,710
Shalom.

865
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,154
Goodbye, Dovid.

866
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,279
- Morning.
- Good morning.

867
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,950
Morning.

868
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,270
Morning.

869
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,199
Is that you, then?

870
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,630
Goodbye.

871
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,990
Goodbye.

872
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,359
May you live a long life.

873
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,878
May you live a long life.

874
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,519
- Which terminal?
- Five, please.

875
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,832
Ronit! Wait!

876
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,309
Stop! Could you stop, please?
Stop the car.

877
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:26,832
You will be
a brilliant mother.

878
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:31,557
You're going to be brave
and beautiful.

879
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,350
I love you.

880
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,270
I love you.

881
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,114
Will you tell me
where you are?

882
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,955
Yes. I will.

883
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,150
Excuse me?

884
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,832
Do you mind
if we make a small detour?

885
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,235
Goodbye, Dad.

886
01:49:26,305 --> 01:50:26,399

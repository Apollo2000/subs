00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,644
I'm gonna stop you right there.

320
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,481
You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:

321
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,274
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

322
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,318
You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.

323
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:33,155
Some flaw deep in your core being

324
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,658
simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

325
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,368
You see that as a sign of weakness.

326
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,079
To me, that's your greatest strength.

327
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,916
It also tells me I can count on you
to cover my ass.

328
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,435
Because coming over here from the CIA

329
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,169
was a lateral move,
some say a step down.

330
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,670
But I did it

331
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,672
because of you.

332
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,841
Don't make me regret it.

333
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,438
Make the call.

334
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,401

(PLANE ENGINES POWER DOWN)

What do you think you're doing, Erika?

337
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,915
It may be your mission,

338
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,084
but this is the CIA's plane.

339
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,877
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

340
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,212
We don't have time for this.

341
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,172
I have a team in Paris
ready to grab Lark

342
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,799
as soon as he leaves the Palais.

A G5 standing by
to rendition him to Gitmo,

where a waterboard is waiting.

345
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,598
Spend 24 hours we don't have
to pull a confession we can't trust

346
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,852
from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.

347
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,604
We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.

348

This scenario is precisely
why the IMF exists!

349

The IMF is Halloween, Alan.

350
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,613
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks
playing trick-or-treat.

351
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,157
And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,

352
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,285
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

354

Yes. They would.

355
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,123
That's the job.

356
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,710
And that's why I want
one of my own men on the scene

357

to appraise the situation.

HUNLEY: The answer is no.

I have operational authority here,
direct from the President.

364

You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.

365
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,480
I have already, and he agrees
with me. My man goes

366
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,608
or no one goes.

367

No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

to make Lark cooperate?

384
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,559
I bump him in the crowd.

385
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,646
In ten seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,

hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

that easily, Hunt.

642
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,173
An armored motorcade
under heavy police escort

643
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,175
will transport him via this route.

644
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,511
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.

645
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,557
The motorcade will automatically take
the preplanned alternate route here,

646
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,226
where we'll extract the asset.

647
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,313
Extract the asset?

648
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,742
The asset.

649
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:19,705
We paid a great deal of money
for this information.

650
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,374
They gave us everything
but this man's name.

651
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,002
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

652
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:27,880
His name is Solomon Lane.

653
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,633
British Special Agent turned anarchist.

654
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,677
He used rogue covert operatives

655
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:36,055
to create a terror network
called the Syndicate.

656
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,975
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

657
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:42,311
As ugly as they come.

658
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,315
WALKER: He was captured
by American agents two years ago.

659
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,610
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

660
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,904
passed around from
one government to another

661
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,407
to answer for his crimes.

662
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,745
You seem displeased, Lark.

663
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,415
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

664
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,752
I came to Paris for plutonium.

665
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,588
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

666
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:11,590
I'm just a broker.

667
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,759
I connect a buyer and a seller.

668
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:18,180
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

669
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,516
Extract Lane

670
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:22,851
and make a trade.

671
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,520
WIDOW: That's right.

672
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,277
How do I know
the seller has what I want?

673
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:52,798
WIDOW: A down payment in good faith.

674
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,468
A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours

675
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:59,305
in exchange for him.

676
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,731
All right.

677
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,692

(INAUDIBLE)

679
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:46,703
Kill everyone?

680
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,414
That's your plan?

681
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:50,749
There will be no witnesses.

682
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,752
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

683
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,295
He's in an armored box.

684
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,006
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

685
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,008
You want your plutonium,

686
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,261
this is the price.

687
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,723
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

688

That's John Lark you're talking to.

689
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:15,357

690

691

693

SLOANE: <i>You have got to be kidding me.</i>

694
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,061
If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

695
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:56,231
I wanted Lark to break him out,
not Ethan Hunt.

696
00:46:56,315 --> 00:47:00,152
I wanted Lark at the exchange,
not Ethan Hunt.

697
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:03,363
I wanted Lark to lead us
to the plutonium

698
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:05,240

699

the corpse we pulled

701
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,221
out of the men's room
at the Grand Palais?

702
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,039
I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.

00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:13,540
More likely one of Lark's recruits.

704
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:15,834
Not according to our intelligence.

705
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,128

706
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,757
Hunt.

707
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:26,053
You've long held suspicions that Lark
was an American agent.

708
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,763
Someone who knew our every move.

709
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,057
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

710
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,102
You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark.

You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

712
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,151
It won't work.

713
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:44,571
Think about it.
Would a man as careful as Lark

714
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,698
really stick his neck out like that?

715
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:48,784
For a face-to-face with the White Widow?

716
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,578
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

717
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,455
And if he was really smart,

718
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:56,166
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

719
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,168
in front of a reliable witness.

720
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,253
Me.

721
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:02,714
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

722
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,717
So he pays a man
to play the part of Lark

723
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:06,969
and has him killed.

724
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,222
And under the guise
of serving his country...

Why?

Why would Hunt turn?

730
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:23,318
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

731
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,822
They were believers in a cause.

732
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,408
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

733
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,286
they turned
against their masters.

734
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:35,581
How many times has Hunt's
government betrayed him,

735
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,416
disavowed him, cast him aside?

736
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,502
And how long before
a man like that

737
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,379
has had enough?

738
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,674

01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:23,145
This is how I come home.

971
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:25,022
But you were out.

972
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:26,523
You were free.

973
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:28,358
We are never free.

974
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,987
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

975
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,781
To them, I'm as much
of a threat as he is.

976
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:39,328
I kill him, or I never stop running.

977
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:44,041
Now tell me where he is.

978
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,547
I can't help you.

979
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:53,342
I will get to him one way or another.

980
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:56,929
Please don't make me go through you.

<i>Are you here in London?</i>

ETHAN: <i>I am.</i>

986
01:16:57,447 --> 01:16:59,449
Are you ready to meet the courier?

987
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:02,286
<i>Yes. Where do I go?</i>

988
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:04,329
Where would you like to meet?

989
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:43,493
Mr. Secretary.

990
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:46,747
I prayed to God that it wasn't true.

991
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,415
BENJI: Well, in his defense, sir,

992
01:17:48,498 --> 01:17:49,958
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

993
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,436
a great many people
would have been killed.

994
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,712
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

995
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:56,965
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

996
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,760

999

...at which point, we were
told to come to London

1000
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:23,658
and await further instructions.

1001
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:25,243
And what happens now?

1002
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:27,120
Now,

1003
01:18:28,163 --> 01:18:29,748
we meet the Widow in 20 minutes.

1004
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:31,333
She'll take us to a courier

1005
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,503
who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.

1006
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,171
Or, in our scenario,

1007
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:38,632
Benji.

1008
01:18:39,049 --> 01:18:40,175
Jesus.

1009
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,593
I'm sorry, what?

1010
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,279
ETHAN: Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.

1011
01:18:43,303 --> 01:18:44,983
Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.

1012
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:46,139
Absolutely not.

1013
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,575
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

1014
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:48,600
Benji.

1015
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,520
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

1016
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,688
and I will do so at any cost.

1017
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,440
Even if I have to trade Lane.

1018
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:56,942
The real Lane.

1019
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:59,069
And I will never let him go.

1020
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:02,155
When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games,

1021
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,533
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

1022
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:06,618
You let us worry about the Apostles.

1023
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:09,121
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

1024
01:19:09,204 --> 01:19:10,664
A bigger problem?

1025
01:19:11,415 --> 01:19:12,916
- Ilsa.
- BENJI: Ilsa?

1026
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,543
Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?

1027
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:15,812
How is she mixed up in all of this?

1028
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:18,171
She's been ordered
to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

1029
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:21,675
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

1030
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:22,801
Yeah.

1031
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:24,094
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

1032
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,446
- ETHAN: No, not us. Not us.
- Yeah.

1033
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,722
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

1034
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:28,849
And she will kill me!

1035
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:30,118
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1036
01:19:30,142 --> 01:19:32,222
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

1037
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,939
- I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

1038
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:37,458
ETHAN: Right now,
we don't have a lot of time.

1039
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,001
We have to get ready for this meeting.

1040
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:40,485
HUNLEY: The meeting is a trap.

1041
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:43,780
The White Widow is working with the CIA.

1042
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:45,407
She has been since the beginning.

1043
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:49,327
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

1044
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:51,955
Capturing the plutonium,
and the Apostles, and John Lark

1045
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,499
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

1046
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:57,461
But if Sloane knew the meeting was
a trap, why didn't she just tell us?

1047
01:19:57,544 --> 01:19:59,647
HUNLEY: Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John Lark,

1048
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:01,423
including one of us.

1049
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:04,676
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

1050
01:20:07,179 --> 01:20:08,597
According to that dossier,

1051
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,141
a trail of electronic evidence
connects Hunt

1052
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:14,394
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

1053
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:16,855
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

1054
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:18,982
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Delbruuk.

1055
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:21,401
And, of course,
Hunt handed over the plutonium

1056
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:23,320
to the Apostles himself.

1057
01:20:23,403 --> 01:20:25,363
Now, those facts, coupled with

1058
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:28,158
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

1059
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:30,785
corroborate a CIA narrative

1060
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,663
that Hunt has snapped.

1061
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:36,291
And that his search for Lark
is nothing but a cover

1062
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:38,210
to hide the fact that Lark...

1063
01:20:39,294 --> 01:20:40,295
...is me.

1064
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,758
HUNLEY: I've got to hand it
to you, Ethan.

1065
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,177
Normally, when people refer to you
as your own worst enemy,

1066
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,845
it's just a figure of speech.

1067
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:56,520
I'm afraid Sloane's got
some questions for her as well.

1068
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,689
The Widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

1069
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,234
And where did Sloane
get this information?

1070
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:04,778
HUNLEY: She didn't say.

1071
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:07,948
She did, however, grant me
the opportunity to bring you in,

1072
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,200
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

1073
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:12,661
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

1074
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:14,871
- Sir, you can't do that.
- HUNLEY: Hunt.

1075
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:17,499
I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.

1076
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:18,959
That's why we're taking him back.

1077
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:22,170
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

1078
01:21:22,254 --> 01:21:23,439
- Ethan...
- ETHAN: Sir, what do you

1079
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:24,631
think this is? A coincidence?

1080
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:25,816
That someone just happened upon this?

1081
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,468
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

1082
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:30,428
Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in.

1083
01:21:30,512 --> 01:21:31,513
Don't you see?

1084
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:33,348
This, sir...

1085
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,433
This is the trap.

1086
01:21:35,517 --> 01:21:37,394
- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

1087
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:40,063
There are still two plutonium cores
in the wind!

1088
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,440
And you lost them!

1089
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:46,903
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

1090
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:50,115
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

1091
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,701
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

1092
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:57,205
Good God, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

1093
01:21:57,622 --> 01:22:00,458
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

1094
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:03,295
This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

1095
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:05,213
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

1096
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:07,632
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

1097
01:22:07,716 --> 01:22:09,926
or the IMF, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

1098
01:22:11,428 --> 01:22:12,762
And if I refuse?

1099
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:15,015
What do you think he's here for?

1100
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:16,349
You think he's some observer?

1101
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:17,892
He's an assassin!

1102
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,520
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

1103
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:23,607
You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down

1104
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:25,442
and kill you.

1105
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,281
It's the job.
No hard feelings.

1106
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,241
Accept it, Ethan.

1107
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:35,493
You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

1108
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:39,414
No, sir. No.

1109
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:42,626
HUNLEY: I am not asking you.
I am giving you a direct order.

1110
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:45,337
This mission is terminated.

1111
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:47,172

Stickell, he's your friend.

1113

but you left me no choice.

before we meet the Widow.

You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones

- Benji needs to get ready.

happened in the world,

Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

If we remove that key,
then it should short out

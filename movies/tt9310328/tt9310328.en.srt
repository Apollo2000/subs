00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,208
<i>In the 21st century,</i>

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,291
<i>mankind began colonizing outer space...</i>

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,125
<i>expanding the world they live in,</i>

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,333
<i>as well as life itself.</i>

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,333
PLANET LATIMER

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,083
Move! You idiot!

7
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,041
Go around that way.

8
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,500
Get lost.

9
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,166
You little twirp!

10
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:30,791
Damn it...

11
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,083
The hell are you doing?

12
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,958
- There she is!
- Get her!

13
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,833
What...?

14
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,000
The heck?

15
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,416
Over there, the elevator!

16
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,041
Close... Come on, close!

17
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,416
Damn it!

18
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,625
The fuck she playing at?

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,333
<i>Consciousness was digitized</i>

20
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:37,166
<i>and stored on a device called a "stack."</i>

21
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,625
<i>Digital consciousness
became one's identity,</i>

22
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,750
<i>the body,
nothing but a replaceable vessel.</i>

23
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,833
<i>In an age where bodies
became disposable objects called sleeves,</i>

24
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:56,208
<i>physical death no longer inspired
any fear or dread in people.</i>

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,166
<i>The rich started to enjoy lifespans</i>

26
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:03,500
<i>that were as long as the stars.</i>

27
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,208
The world's a stage
with players and voyeurs!

28
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,541
If it's all the same,
you might as well dance, come on!

29
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:28,166
For tea to raise your spirits,
go straight to the left.

30
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,916
If you want to screw a dead lover,
come around back to the right.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,958
We've got a premium sleeve
waiting for you.

32
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,250
Sick of Latimer?

33
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:52,791
The needlecast behind the dance floor
will send you to another planet.

34
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,333
Here we go!

35
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,767
- There she is.
- The world's a stage...

36
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,125
- Come here!
- ...with players and voyeurs!

37
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,500
This one's been transmitted
from another planet.

38
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,916
Hand him Case 305.

39
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,333
The needlecast?

40
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,583
You.

41
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,083
Get me a mirror.

42
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,083
At least put something on, will ya?

43
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
Hey.

44
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,958
Mr. Tanaseda told us to give this to you.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,125
Let me through!

46
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,666
Out of the way!

47
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,708
Boss is worried about you, Miss Holly.

48
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,625
It's dangerous for you to be out alone.

49
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,416
Come back to headquarters.

50
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,583
Let go. I'm leaving this planet.

51
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,541
You can't protect me.

52
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,458
What the...?

53
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,833
Holly Togram?

54
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,583
Come with me.

55
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,875
Liar! You said
you'd needlecast me over there.

56
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,083
Are you listening?

57
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,875
We had a deal.

58
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,708
Mute member three.

59
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,875
- <i>Muting member three.</i>
- Hey!

60
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,208
I see you met my guy, Takeshi.

61
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,500
How does that sleeve suit you?

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,875
We prepared the highest grade
soldier's body available there.

63
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:04,875
Reflexes are good,
but it has a heavy nicotine addiction.

64
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,041
Still get the urge to smoke in VR, do you?

65
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,416
The hand remembers.

66
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,375
So Mr. Tanaseda,

67
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,291
didn't you want me
to look into your brother's death?

68
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,458
I doubt the girl knows anything.

69
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,833
That girl is a tattooist
for the Mizumoto syndicate,

70
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,291
the yakuza organization
my brother used to head.

71
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,416
She'll get you into Mizumoto HQ
without arousing any suspicion.

72
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,916
I don't need her to get in.

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,958
I don't doubt it.
You are an Envoy, after all.

74
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,208
However,

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,833
the mystery of my brother's real death
lies in the succession ceremony.

76
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:58,416
A tattooist is needed for the ritual.

77
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,166
I need her to get into the ceremony?

78
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,333
That's right. The ceremony is in two days.

79
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,416
If we miss this one,
we'll have to wait years for the next one.

80
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,541
<i>Mute deactivated manually.</i>

81
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,500
We had a deal!

82
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,416
- You said you'd transmit me!
- Mute member three.

83
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,958
- <i>Muting member three.</i>
- Why...

84
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Adjust display levels.

85
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,541
Your payment is as we discussed.

86
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,291
The grudges against you
in Harlan's World...

87
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,166
I'll make them disappear.

88
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,541
That's it?

89
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,041
What more could you want?

90
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,666
<i>End command entered.</i>

91
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:53,416
Takeshi Kovacs, the last living Envoy
who brought down the Saito syndicate.

92
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,541
What? You're Takeshi Kovacs the Envoy?

93
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,541
It's been a year since
Quellcrist Falconer and your sister died.

94
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,416
What more do you have to lose?

95
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,583
I'm counting on you, Takeshi Kovacs.

96
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,666
We're going to Mizumoto HQ.

97
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,375
No way!

98
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,916
Plus, Envoys are terrorists.
You're a fugitive.

99
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,166
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,750
If the assassin comes back,
we're done for.

101
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,166
That brat...

102
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,666
What am I, a babysitter?

103
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,708
What's your problem...

104
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Holly of the Mizumoto syndicate?

105
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,375
I'm Gena of UN's CTAC.

106
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,750
I need you to cooperate.

107
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,875
CTAC? What do you want with me?

108
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,375
You were talking
with the Tanaseda syndicate.

109
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,208
They're under strict CTAC surveillance.

110
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,125
I learned about you
from that communication.

111
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,791
Thought we wouldn't know?

112
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,750
How careless of you.

113
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,833
As are you.

114
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,333
I'm her babysitter.

115
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:40,833
Come over here.

116
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,166
Are you a Mizumoto yakuza?

117
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,875
There's no bigger scum
than gangsters who use children.

118
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,375
Requesting backup!
Second platoon, come in...

119
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,875
Get behind me.

120
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,041
Are they with you?

121
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,583
What do you think?

122
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,916
Help...

123
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,125
A "real death"...

124
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,666
His digital consciousness
won't be retrievable.

125
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,958
His sleeve... it's enhanced for combat.

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,291
CTAC and ninja sleeves...

127
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,250
This job can't get any worse.

128
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,375
It's after her!

129
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,875
There are more?

130
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,583
Duck, Holly!

131
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,041
This is Gena.

132
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,625
Enemy fighters have wiped out the unit.

133
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,500
Requesting body collection.

134
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,083
Holly of the Mizumoto syndicate,

135
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,458
why would they target
a tattooist like you?

136
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,375
I'm... leaving the Mizumoto syndicate.

137
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,583
CTAC is looking into
the Mizumoto syndicate.

138
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
What's going on inside?

139
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,250
Who hired those mercenaries?

140
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,333
Shinji...

141
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,125
He's planning a coup.

142
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,333
Shinji... The incoming boss?

143
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,250
I'm taking you back to the syndicate.
We need you to cooperate.

144
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,333
No!

145
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,916
Hold on. We have business
with the Mizumoto syndicate, too.

146
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,833
Step aside.

147
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:34,125
Why don't I arrest you
and hand you over to the UN,

148
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,916
Mr. Babysitter?

149
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,250
Planning on walking into
a yakuza headquarters wearing that?

150
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,583
Damn it.

151
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,708
Neither of us want any more trouble,
do we?

152
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,458
Wait.

153
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,916
I'm not going back there!

154
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,666
<i>Let me go! I want to get off this planet.</i>

155
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,125
<i>Forget it. Tanaseda won't listen to you.</i>

156
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,541
Pretty open for a yakuza headquarters.

157
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,458
They run a hotel, too.

158
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,375
It's connected to headquarters.

159
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,500
Ogai.

160
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,791
Holly. I see you went out again.

161
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,458
I told you it's dangerous.

162
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,166
So is this place.

163
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,416
Thank you both for escorting Holly here.

164
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,916
She's always going off by herself.

165
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:45,583
The Mizumoto syndicate proudly presents
the oldest luxury hotel on Latimer,

166
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,416
the Wild Geese.

167
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,916
I am Ogai, your guide.

168
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,083
Do you have a reservation?

169
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,666
You can also choose to just dine.

170
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,958
Let me know if you'd prefer that.

171
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,750
However, the karaoke house
on the 11th floor

172
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,125
is only open to overnight guests.

173
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,666
- We hope you understand.
- Holly.

174
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,041
Turn him off.

175
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:20,166
Ogai RM 62217 can only be
deactivated by Genzo.

176
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,166
Genzo... The boss?

177
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:30,125
Yes. Ogai's master is Genzo,
head of the Mizumoto syndicate.

178
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,125
Of course, that will switch over
once the succession takes place.

179
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,208
Holly.

180
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,375
So you're back.

181
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,625
I keep telling you not to go out alone.

182
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,916
You must be Genzo.

183
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,833
Turn him off, will you?

184
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,000
What did you just say?

185
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,416
What kind of way is that
to talk to Mr. Shinji?

186
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,791
You want your ass kicked?

187
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,208
Looks like there was no need to change
after all.

188
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,791
Shut up. It's not my fault.

189
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,708
This is Mr. Shinji, our incoming boss.

190
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,625
You better show some respect.

191
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,791
Put the gun away, you bastard!

192
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,833
Shinji. These two are my bodyguards.

193
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,583
They saved me from an attack
where two of our men were killed.

194
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,791
You were attacked again?

195
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,791
This is...

196
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,750
Ken Kakura.

197
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,166
Gena.

198
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:57,625
That's still no reason
to disrespect Mr. Shinji, is it?

199
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,708
There must be consequences.

200
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,458
Mr. Shinji? Wait...

201
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,708
Sorry about that.

202
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,333
A token of remorse.

203
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,333
No, thanks.

204
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,083
It's too much for him to accept.

205
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,125
Give it the burial it deserves, will you?

206
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,958
You're one lucky guy.

207
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,625
Ogai.

208
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:01,750
Take these guests
to our most expensive room.

209
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:11,875
This suite is the crown jewel
of our hotel, <i>Vita Sexualis.</i>

210
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:20,916
We also offer various kinds
of room service to fit your needs.

211
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,333
It's the perfect room for newlyweds.

212
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,458
Excuse me.

213
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,666
I'm going to see Genzo.
Come with me, Mr. Bodyguard.

214
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,166
I pass.

215
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,291
Lead the way.

216
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,875
Please. Follow me, sir.

217
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,750
So you're Ken?

218
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,958
I'm Genzo, head of the Mizumoto syndicate.

219
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,416
Sorry to be lying down like this.

220
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,541
You can get up.
I can do this part without looking.

221
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,083
In this room, Holly is the boss.

222
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,916
She's been a troublemaker
ever since she was little.

223
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,583
Glad you survived, kiddo.

224
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,625
You're with the Tanaseda syndicate,
aren't you?

225
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,500
Right now, I'm just Holly's bodyguard.

226
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,416
I'm inside the Mizumoto headquarters.

227
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,666
<i>Find out anything about the coup?</i>

228
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:21,291
Holly Togram claims
the incoming boss Shinji is behind it.

229
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,291
<i>A coup by the incoming boss?</i>

230
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,375
<i>But why...?</i>

231
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,625
<i>Anything else to report?</i>

232
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,083
I haven't killed any yakuza yet.

233
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,333
<i>I'd almost forgotten your motive.</i>

234
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,500
<i>I was surprised when I heard</i>

235
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,458
<i>that an Envoy defector
would be joining a CTAC mission.</i>

236
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:49,333
<i>But now you are considered a hero
among the top brass at CTAC,</i>

237
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,083
<i>Reileen Kawahara.</i>

238
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:56,041
<i>Though, I suppose your code name
on the job is Gena.</i>

239
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,708
Good evening.

240
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,083
It seems I've gotten lost.

241
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,500
I'm trying to get back to my room.

242
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,416
Can you point the way?

243
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:16,125
Your boss Tanaseda
is the son of our founding boss.

244
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:21,916
This was our second boss,
Tanaseda's younger brother.

245
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,208
Tanaseda is still alive, isn't he?

246
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,250
Using sleeve after sleeve.

247
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:32,041
He's one of the most feared yakuza
in the entire universe.

248
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,541
Why would a fearless man like him

249
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,291
send one of his men our way
all of a sudden?

250
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,000
What did you come here for?

251
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,833
Come back here, Genzo.

252
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,666
If there's a coup brewing...

253
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,250
you'll want help.

254
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,041
Again with the rumors.

255
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,541
I'm sick of it.

256
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,250
A coup is unthinkable.

257
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,708
There have been attacks, though.

258
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,541
Tell me, Ken.

259
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:15,250
Do you know why Mizumoto
became the biggest syndicate on Latimer?

260
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,750
In our syndicate,

261
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:23,791
the previous boss always dies
when a succession happens.

262
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,375
Not just the sleeve...

263
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,833
the stack dies too.

264
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,500
A "real death."

265
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,541
This tradition was created
to prevent any one boss

266
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,750
from holding onto power forever
and ruining the syndicate.

267
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,416
The boss gives his life to the syndicate.

268
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:48,000
The men also give their lives
to the syndicate.

269
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,166
That is our code.

270
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:58,750
What's the point of choosing death
in the world we live in?

271
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:03,291
Humanity has more or less
achieved eternal life.

272
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:08,708
That is all the more reason to have death
as the foundation

273
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,375
of a giant entity such as Mizumoto.

274
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,333
All right, that's it for today.

275
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,416
That's amazing!

276
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,625
Can you get in anywhere with that?

277
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,166
I'll show you something more amazing.

278
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,041
Come here, you.

279
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,000
One down.

280
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,625
I saw your brother's picture.

281
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,375
He died according to the syndicate's code.

282
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,958
A code, you say?

283
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,750
You don't believe it?

284
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,958
Perhaps if it had only been my brother.

285
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:12,791
But my father was a wicked man,
the very embodiment of evil.

286
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:18,333
To think that scum of a human
would give up his life to honor a code...

287
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,541
it's unthinkable.

288
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,541
You believe there's something
behind this tradition?

289
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,583
It seems that way, yes.

290
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:33,041
That tattooist girl seems to be crucial
to the succession ritual.

291
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:39,333
She needs to be protected. At least
until the ceremony begins, in two days.

292
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,750
Someone's here.

293
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:53,958
I'll get it.

294
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,416
Who's there...

295
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:23,416
What's this, a part of your consciousness
that failed to upload?

296
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,166
What're you doing in here, idiot?

297
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,875
Who are they?

298
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,416
Someone's here.

299
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,708
I'll get it.

300
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:33,999
Who's there...

301
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,041
It's Dad and Mom.

302
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,166
I thought Genzo was your dad.

303
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,416
Of course not.

304
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,958
Look. Dad was shot in the head,

305
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,708
and Mom's stack is intact, too.

306
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,041
They haven't found the stacks?

307
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,208
They're both still alive.

308
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,958
You need Mizumoto's help
to find your parents' stacks?

309
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:05,750
Genzo says he'll help look for them.

310
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,041
But I can't bear it any longer.

311
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,208
You should delete this data.

312
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,291
How can I?

313
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,708
You're just clinging to the memory
of dead people.

314
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Let's go.

315
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,083
Spend too much time with fragmented data
and it'll take over your consciousness.

316
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,375
Holly...

317
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,333
come on.

318
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,208
Who is...

319
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You idiots.

320
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:53,833
How long does it take to kill one kid?

321
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,875
Two days...

322
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,958
Only two days to the succession.

323
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,583
Get it through your head!

324
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,250
You okay?

325
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,416
Tell me, are you?

326
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,041
I'm sorry.

327
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,833
You have to understand,

328
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,875
it hurts to hit you, too.

329
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,000
Those damn bodyguards...

330
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,416
Next time, you're finished!

331
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:42,083
ONE DAY TO THE SUCCESSION CEREMONY

332
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,791
Just as I thought.

333
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,041
The damn yakuza.

334
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Gena!

335
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,791
Why are all these yakuza here?

336
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:49,041
One of our security guards, Nogaki,
was found dead.

337
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,833
Boss ordered increased security.

338
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I see.

339
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm going to see Genzo.

340
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,416
Will you come with me, Gena?

341
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,333
Fine, then.

342
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,750
What is this, a parade?

343
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,333
No need to get cheeky.

344
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,416
What the...?

345
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,083
Who's there?

346
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,708
Taniguchi!

347
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,166
The fuck did you just do?

348
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,916
What are you standing around for? Get him.

349
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,041
You bastard!

350
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,875
Kill them!

351
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,458
Taste this!

352
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,125
What are they doing here?

353
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,958
That won't work.

354
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,333
Ken!

355
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,666
Come on, follow me.

356
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,083
Miss Holly?

357
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:53,416
What the...

358
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:56,083
The fuck? Watch it!

359
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,291
Help us, Ogai!

360
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,666
Property destruction detected.

361
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,458
Calculating amount of damages.

362
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:34,291
Insurance will not cover
for depreciated...

363
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,458
- Ogai! We're being attacked.
- My, oh my!

364
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:41,541
Holly is my friend.

365
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:29,041
It seems I've caused the most destruction.

366
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,416
Kid...

367
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,166
Why are they so desperate to get you?

368
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Well...

369
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,166
that's because...

370
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,666
Tell me everything if you want to live.

371
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,916
I'm not throwing away my life
because you wouldn't talk.

372
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,500
I'm...

373
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,583
going to kill the boss.

374
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:09,833
<i>To help realize the founding boss' idea
for a succession system,</i>

375
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:15,875
<i>the tattooist Margot invented a piece
of technology to embed a special program</i>

376
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,375
<i>into the tattoo traditionally worn
by the Mizumoto boss.</i>

377
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,791
<i>By performing the succession ritual,</i>

378
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:30,750
<i>the program runs, destroying the stack
contained in the previous boss' sleeve.</i>

379
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:37,250
<i>The tattoo is passed onto the next boss,
and the ritual is repeated.</i>

380
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:44,000
If Shinji kills you, he'd be able
to avoid real death. In other words...

381
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,291
He stays in power forever.

382
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,541
Is there a backup
of that tattoo technology?

383
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,833
So only you can access it?

384
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:01,958
What?

385
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,583
Gena...

386
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,958
we should treat your wounds.

387
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:07,875
Let's go back to the room.

388
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,750
Aren't you going to see Genzo?

389
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,666
Your treatment comes first.

390
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,041
Yes.

391
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:27,791
According to the data I acquired,
Shinji is definitely behind the coup.

392
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,416
How shall I proceed?

393
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,625
<i>Your mission is accomplished.</i>

394
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,291
<i>We have enough leverage over Mizumoto.</i>

395
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:38,041
<i>If the coup succeeds,
we can blackmail Shinji.</i>

396
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:41,875
<i>If it fails, we still have intel
on the boss' tattoo.</i>

397
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,666
<i>It's time for you to withdraw.</i>

398
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,125
<i>Your source, was it Holly Togram?</i>

399
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,958
<i>She needs to be eliminated.</i>

400
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
<i>That's all.</i>

401
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,291
CTAC is no better than the yakuza.

402
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:20,291
<i>He'll chop your off your limbs
And rip off your skin</i>

403
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,916
<i>And sew your pieces onto him</i>

404
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:32,916
<i>Stay at home, don't go out alone</i>

405
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:39,833
<i>Or the Patchwork Man will crack your bones</i>

406
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:49,875
<i>Or the Patchwork Man will crack your bones</i>

407
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Big brother...

408
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,666
What were you singing?

409
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,166
A song my baby sister used to like.

410
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,458
Right...

411
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,375
I'm going into VR.

412
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,666
Watch her while I'm away.

413
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:13,833
Gena?

414
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,916
Yeah, okay.

415
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,875
Do you believe it, Takeshi?

416
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,375
That their code is real?

417
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,250
That they're willing to tattoo themselves
with a self-destruction device?

418
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,250
Who knows?

419
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:47,375
I have no insight
into the thoughts of an old geezer.

420
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,125
What does age have to do with it?

421
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:53,750
We live in an age
where bodies are replaceable.

422
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:57,458
I could be 2,000 years old,

423
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,500
or I could be 18.

424
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,541
No 18-year-old talks like that, old man.

425
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,458
My brother...

426
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,083
I missed you.

427
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,833
I was the one that rescued you.

428
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:36,958
Will the men honor the code?

429
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,916
I wonder.

430
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,791
I for one wouldn't trust a guy
with such an obnoxious laugh.

431
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,875
Obnoxious laugh?

432
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,916
Yeah.
Genzo laughs like a strangled chicken.

433
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:57,083
Anyway, something will happen
at tomorrow's ceremony.

434
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,666
What?

435
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,125
Takeshi,

436
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,875
there's something I'd like you
to investigate before the ceremony.

437
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,250
Welcome back.

438
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,041
So, what were you discussing?

439
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,541
Apparently, there's more to the ritual
than what Holly told us.

440
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,916
I need to look into it.

441
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,875
Shinji will want to kill Holly
before the ceremony begins.

442
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,083
Look after her while I'm gone.

443
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:53,333
I'm not her babysitter.

444
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,750
Why are you still here?

445
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,333
None of your business.

446
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:04,666
There's no sign of reinforcements coming
or you leaving.

447
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,291
What's CTAC up to?

448
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,541
I received orders to withdraw earlier.

449
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,083
I see.

450
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,083
You should get out, too.

451
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,791
Didn't think you'd be concerned.

452
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,041
Face those ninjas alone and you'll die.

453
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,250
Your stack will be destroyed.

454
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,083
I can't back out now.

455
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,583
You should run.

456
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,416
What's the point of dying
for someone else's cause?

457
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:38,333
If I run, I'll be surrounded by enemies.

458
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,000
It's suicidal.

459
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:45,541
Why are you always putting your life
on the line for other people?

460
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,875
What do you know about me?

461
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:03,166
<i>To increase security
ahead of tomorrow's ceremony,</i>

462
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,750
<i>we will now conduct a system update.</i>

463
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,875
There isn't much time.
I'm going to check out their HQ.

464
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,583
Ken.

465
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,250
You'll need a security pass.

466
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,041
A souvenir, is it?

467
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:23,625
See ya.

468
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,625
Holly, wake up.

469
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:36,375
What's the matter, Gena?

470
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,041
Listen closely.

471
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:42,208
There's something you need to know.

472
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,041
Bingo, old man.

473
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:46,666
DAY OF THE SUCCESSION CEREMONY

474
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,166
- Really?
- Ogai.

475
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,666
What's the news?

476
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,250
Mr. Ken and Ms. Gena,

477
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,291
have you seen the flying firework devices
around the building?

478
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:02,791
Not interested.

479
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,291
What do you want?

480
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:11,583
I'll be controlling the fireworks display
after the ceremony.

481
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,791
It's my time to shine.

482
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:17,291
Over here, you two.

483
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,041
What did you do?

484
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,791
I took a picture.

485
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Show us the picture, Ogai.

486
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:28,416
Certainly.

487
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,125
Enough joking around.

488
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:32,625
What do you want?

489
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:38,541
Due to increased security levels,
certain areas are off-limits today.

490
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,458
The communal bath on the tenth floor
and the 11th floor...

491
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,750
What the...?

492
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:45,875
What was that?

493
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,791
Something must have happened.

494
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,333
I'll go check it out.

495
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,916
Holly's gone.

496
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:01,875
What was that?

497
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,083
The fireworks have exploded.

498
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:08,958
Perfect timing.

499
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:12,333
Use this diversion
to get rid of the bodyguards.

500
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:16,791
The tattoo won't be finished
until just before the ceremony.

501
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,583
There's still time.

502
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:19,958
Yes, sir.

503
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,208
Don't screw up this time.

504
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,291
What?

505
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,666
A firework malfunction
caused the explosion.

506
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:39,999
Boss...

507
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,416
We can't let it interfere
with the ceremony.

508
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,916
We're finishing the tattoo now.

509
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,166
You bastard...

510
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,958
Miss Holly is missing.

511
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,000
Sweep the hotel and headquarters.

512
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:09,999
Yes, sir.

513
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Wait.

514
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,291
Holly is probably at the ceremony.

515
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,666
Why would you know that?

516
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,500
Ninjas took her, didn't they?

517
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:19,583
Listen...

518
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,333
I was sent here by Tanaseda.

519
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,875
I'll share everything I know.

520
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,375
We need to join forces.

521
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,166
That can wait.

522
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:42,833
Damn it. They had to show up today?

523
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:46,041
Your precious ceremony is a farce, too.

524
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,791
Our current boss Genzo

525
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:01,125
has faced death in the name of honor.

526
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,916
But this is not the end of him.

527
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:08,791
Untethered to the body,
his soul shall transform into a dragon,

528
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,083
leading me along the path to glory.

529
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:21,125
Congratulations on your inauguration,

530
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:24,958
Mr. Shinji, or shall I say Mr. Genzo?

531
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:29,000
Or did you go by yet another name
before that?

532
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:30,416
Who are you?

533
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,375
How did you gain access?

534
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,666
How many times have you ascended
to boss now?

535
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,791
Father...

536
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,625
Hideki!

537
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:46,291
It's just like you to come up
with a hairbrained plot like this.

538
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,375
Ogai, what's going on?

539
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,500
I'm working on it.

540
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,875
By having the boss give up their life,

541
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:57,875
you ensured absolute loyalty
from your men.

542
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:06,666
<i>But in reality, you've been taking over
the new boss' sleeve.</i>

543
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:45,541
<i>You robbed them of all the hard work
they put into the syndicate.</i>

544
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,000
How despicable...

545
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,083
and utterly shameless you are.

546
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,625
Shut off the audience.

547
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:55,708
In other words...

548
00:51:56,208 --> 00:52:01,250
<i>the boss of the Mizumoto syndicate
has always been...</i>

549
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,416
you and only you, Father.

550
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:05,583
Ogai,

551
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:06,958
shut it off, now!

552
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,583
Father...

553
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,541
did you kill my brother, too?

554
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,208
I've closed down the system.

555
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:29,208
Holly. Hurry up and finish my tattoo.

556
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,916
All I need is to complete the ritual.

557
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,666
Why is it red?

558
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,833
It should be blue for inaugurations.

559
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:19,416
Did you just try to activate
a stack destruction program?

560
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:22,666
You want me dead?

561
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,125
I've had enough.

562
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,416
I'm sick of all the lying, the killing.

563
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,583
Shut up!

564
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,666
Hurry up.
Finish the tattoo and complete the ritual.

565
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:44,666
Then give me back my parents' stacks.

566
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,083
What are you talking about?

567
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,791
Gena found the records.

568
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:57,833
I know my parents' stacks were purchased
by the Mizumoto syndicate a long time ago.

569
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,333
So it's true?

570
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:08,166
Give me back my mom and dad!

571
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:20,958
There.

572
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,500
Dad... Mom?

573
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,083
You fool.

574
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:34,708
No!

575
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,583
You traitor!

576
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,625
What's this?

577
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,333
Don't worry.

578
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:53,958
They know who you are.

579
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,375
You've got to be kidding me.

580
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:01,875
How many...
How many men gave their lives for you?

581
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,625
What about the code of honor?

582
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,083
Honor?

583
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:12,750
None of you were interested in honor.

584
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:17,916
You just wanted a cause
to blindly fight and die for.

585
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,875
Must be nice to live in ignorance.

586
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:27,000
You have no idea the sacrifices I've made
to build up the Mizumoto syndicate.

587
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:30,916
You kill boss after boss
and yet you speak of sacrifice?

588
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:36,166
I gave their worthless existences meaning.

589
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:42,458
You all, too.
You just wanted a stage to dance on.

590
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,166
You ought to be grateful.

591
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:50,416
Me. My very soul...

592
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:53,750
is the essence of the Mizumoto syndicate.

593
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:59,000
An actor who doesn't know his time is up

594
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,041
will have to be dragged off stage.

595
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,708
After him!

596
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,833
Get him!

597
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,958
Where is he hiding?

598
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:30,250
That piece of scum...

599
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
What's this?

600
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:41,541
What's going on?

601
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,750
Get away!

602
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,666
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

603
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,083
I can't stand yakuza who use children.

604
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,500
I can rebuild the syndicate
whenever I want.

605
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,333
All I need is for you to die.

606
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,000
Get behind me, Holly.

607
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:54,916
Die!

608
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:56,916
Gena!

609
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:45,541
You bastard!

610
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:07,916
Ogai! You have to defeat him.

611
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:11,083
Please help us, Ogai!

612
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,791
My master is...

613
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:17,333
the new boss, Shinji.

614
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:19,041
Ogai...

615
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:21,916
Please.

616
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:29,458
What a tearjerker. Poor little Holly.

617
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:33,833
Mom and Dad dead. No more friends either.

618
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,833
I see your horrid laugh hasn't changed...

619
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:56,916
Father.

620
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,250
Hideki!

621
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:01,916
You were here on Latimer?

622
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,416
They say you should be there
for a parent's death.

623
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,291
You...

624
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:13,041
Mr. Ogai. I believe I sent some data
to your customer service station.

625
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,666
Did you see it?

626
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,291
Allow me to check. One moment, please.

627
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,083
What are you up to, Hideki?

628
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:28,500
Ken found consciousness transmission
records for each of the past bosses.

629
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,583
What...

630
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:35,916
That body is Shinji's,

631
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,875
but the stack belongs to the founder.

632
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,291
So what?

633
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,875
I'm the boss.

634
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,291
In the past...

635
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,666
and until the end of time.

636
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,250
The current boss is Shinji.

637
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:53,250
You are not the boss.

638
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Holly is my friend.

639
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,416
Ogai!

640
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,875
Please wait three seconds.

641
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:10,166
Ogai!

642
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,708
My brother!

643
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:18,750
My brother...

644
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,291
<i>Big brother...</i>

645
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,041
Big brother.

646
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:46,666
Show us your true self, you coward.

647
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,958
I don't know about tradition or honor...

648
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:01,083
but all I see is a man hiding
in someone else's sleeve.

649
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:08,625
You maggot.

650
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,083
Bring it on.

651
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,333
You god damn piece of shit!

652
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:25,291
You little punk!

653
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,666
Father.

654
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:10,125
We haven't completed the ritual yet.

655
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,208
Holly...

656
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,916
Die, you devil!

657
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,375
You only die once.

658
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,708
Make sure you remember it.

659
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,541
I don't want to die...

660
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:49,583
I don't want to die...

661
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,000
Hideki.

662
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,625
I don't want to die.

663
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,458
Help me, Hideki.

664
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,750
Do it for your father.

665
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,666
I still want to live...

666
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,125
My last act of filial piety.

667
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:33,750
MIZUMOTO

668
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,458
"I got rid of Holly."

669
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,791
That's what I told CTAC.

670
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,541
Gena!

671
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,625
Now you can needlecast anywhere.

672
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:55,791
Yes.

673
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,041
Are you sure you don't want this picture?

674
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:01,791
Delete it.

675
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:03,541
I don't want it.

676
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:05,791
As you wish.

677
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:10,916
By the way, Mr. Ken,
Mr. Tanaseda is waiting for you upstairs.

678
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:12,958
Got it.

679
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,958
All right... Guess I'll head off.

680
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,416
Goodbye...

681
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,750
my brother.

682
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,500
So, Margot...

683
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,750
You're starting to grow tall.

684
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:51,333
Would you like to switch to a new sleeve
like always?

685
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:55,541
I'm thinking of growing old
in this sleeve.

686
01:07:56,416 --> 01:08:02,458
I want Ken and Gena to recognize me
when I reunite with them as an adult.

687
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,250
Okay.

688
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:16,125
Have you talked to the yakuza
on Harlan's World?

689
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:17,541
Talked to them?

690
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,625
Not yet.

691
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,416
We had a deal.

692
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:25,666
I have another mission for you.

693
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:32,083
You said if I did the job,
you'd mediate with the yakuza.

694
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:35,083
I never said it was just one job.

695
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,375
You've got to be kidding me.

696
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,541
Are you ready?

697
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:47,958
Mr. Tanaseda...

698
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,625
you might be more like your father
than you think.

699
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,416
Where's the next job?

700
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:16,708

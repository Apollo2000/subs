00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:16,619
Where are y'all headed?

3
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,597
Well, we're trying to get up
to Santa Susana Pass Road

4
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,140
but however far you can take us.

5
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,979
- Oh, Spahn Ranch?
- Hey, yeah. How did you know?

6
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,972
Yeah, well, not quite, uh,
all the way up there.

7
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,939
My, uh, my aunt lives nearby.

8
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,600
What you got there?

9
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:35,224
Some money, I guess.

10
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:37,260
Hey, if you're gonna take us
all the way

11
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:39,435
we should buy you breakfast.

12
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,643
Right on.

13
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,554
I don't know.

14
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,014
I thought
"Tiptoe Through The Tulips"

15
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:59,489
was a pretty far-out song
if you're a little high.

16
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,252
I guess I was a lot high
when I first heard it.

17
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,874
Seems like a fag to me.

18
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:06,496
Hey, watch it.

19
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:08,878
Tex here told the army
he was an acid head homosexual

20
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,569
to get out of the war, so..

21
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,916
I'm not actually a homosexual.

22
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,471
I mean, who sings like that?

23
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:17,300
Guy with his voice
all high like a girl

24
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:19,060
and his tiny
little whatchamacallit.

25
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:20,579
It's a put on.

26

Everything's a put on.

27
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,241
Tiny Tim is just having fun.

28
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,209
Hey, we better get out of here.

29

Wow. I thought

00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:21,355
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

54
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,116
Pardon me, ladies.
Karlene, can I speak with you?

55
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:27,430
- Sure.
- Ooh.

56

You guys, go ahead.

57
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,749
I need your help

58
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,509
over
in the Special Security Unit.

59
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:38,831
Since the death penalty
was lifted

60
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,823
no one knows
what to do with them.

61
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,688
The Governor doesn't want them in general population

62
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:46,207
so they are on death row
indefinitely.

63
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:51,109
Just the three of them, stuck in those cells 23 hours a day.

64
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,044
I can't let them rot in there.

65
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:07,884
Good morning, ladies.

66
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,817
- Hi, Miss Carlson.
- Hello, Miss Carlson.

67
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,130
I'd like you to meet
Karlene Faith.

68
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,132
- Hi, Karlene.
- Nice to meet you, Karlene.

69
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,409
Nice to meet you all.

70
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,515
Karlene is a graduate student
at UC, Santa Cruz

71
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:20,172
and she teaches
some of the inmates here.

72
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:21,898
Now that you're gonna be
staying with us

73
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,693
I think it's a good time

74
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,661
to talk about taking
some classes with her.

75
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:28,802
So that... that means we are
staying in the SSU for good then?

76
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,702
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

77
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:36,396
We're offering college courses
to residents here.

78
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,743
You'd be free to study
just about anything you want.

79
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:41,677
Literature, Philosophy,
Journalism.

80
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,344
Are we gonna learn about shit
like Women's Lib?

81
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,059
Language, please, Susan.

82
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,892
We don't have to study
Women's Lib, no

83
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,412
although I do teach a Women's
Studies course here in CIW.

84
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,035
Women's Studies.

85
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,277
Far out.

86
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:58,832
I'll leave you ladies to it.

87
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,603
- Thank you, Miss Carlson.
- Bye, Miss Carlson.

88
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:03,284
- Bye, Miss Carlson.
- Oh, thank you, Jimmy.

89
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,469
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

90
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,943
Hey, Karlene,
do you want some grape Tang?

91
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,093
Pretty please, Jimmy,
can we have

92
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:09,359
some grape Tang for our guest?

93
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,016
Thanks, Jimmy.

94
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,053
Jimmy always takes care of us.

Where did you find her?

143
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:09,678
She was hanging around my harem
for a while.

144
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:12,370
But it was turning into a bad
scene with my old lady.

145
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,028
Beautiful Brother Bobby.

146
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,202
He really knows
how to make love to the girls.

147
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,248
That's what they all tell me.

148
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,757
Sadie's made love to Bobby,
right?

149
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,735
Yeah, we've all made love to him
at this point, huh?

150
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,554
I can't take
another man's woman.

151
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,384
She's not mine, Charlie.

152
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,662
Gypsy told me all about you
and the family.

153
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,630
- I can't take her.
- Charlie.

154
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,840
I think we should let her stay.

155
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,671
She digs us and she's hungry.

156
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,052
She's a seeker.

157
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:46,266
Where are your parents?

158
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,855
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm on my own journey.

159
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,167
Well, what do you have for us?
Do you have a car?

160
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,755
- No.
- Well, then we'll get you one.

161
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,966
We'll get you a car.
We'll find you a car.

is a too much thing.

163
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,739
Old ego is a too much thing.
He'll make you fool yourself.

164
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:01,730
You'll think
you're somebody else.

165
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:04,042
You'll ride
that whole subway train.

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,015
You like her, you teach her.

167
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,027
You keep an eye on her,
and you see if she belongs with us.

168
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,950
And, you,
Katie is my everything.

169
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:17,435
Katie is me. You pay attention
to what she does.

170
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,887
If you're even half as good
as her, then you can stay.

171
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,206
When I first met Charlie,
I just knew.

172
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,831
Hopped on a bus
and I never looked back.

173
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,699
But Charlie's like a... beacon
of light or something.

174
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,116
I mean, look at you,
you're here.

175
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,981
- Hey, Tex.
- Hello there.

176
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,223
How you doing?

177
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,055
Tex hasn't reached
awareness yet.

178
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,679
He's still working
on letting go of his ego.

179
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,927
Charlie says,
"Let go of your ego

180
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,895
and be like a finger
on a hand."

181
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:09,073
Come on.
I want you to meet George.

182
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:11,213
George Spahn. It's his ranch.

183
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,524
Hello?

184
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,883
Squeaky is so kind to him.

185
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,989
- She's a generous soul.
- I'll say.

186
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,888
It's beautiful here.

187
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:33,338
We don't get hung up about sex.
You get it?

188
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,790
We just be.

189
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,688
We let things happen.

190
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,829
We let go.

191
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:42,934
I think you're gonna love it.

192
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:44,798
Hurry up now, everybody.
Come on.

193
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,007
- Dennis.
- Hey, girl.

194
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,978
And who is this pretty thing?

195
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,118
- I'm Leslie.
- Ah, welcome.

196
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,672
I'm not in this family, but..

197
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,779
...I dig this family.

198
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:02,505
Hi.

199
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,341
Beach Boys Dennis?

200
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,101
That's really Dennis Wilson?

201
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:15,001
- He's just Dennis to us.
- Time for communion.

202
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,764
You've turned on before,
right?

203
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,972
Millions of times.

204
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,562
Just, uh, wasn't expecting it
right now.

205
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,550
I spent my life in jail for you.

206
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,865
So that you could ride
your bicycles.

207
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,522
Have your birthday parties.

208
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,871
I never had a life.
I don't even know what life is.

209
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,875
But you all had a life.

210
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,257
Your parents told you what to do
and you did it.

211
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,810
And for payment, you got what?

212
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,226
You got
little cookie cutter minds.

213
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,231
Look what happened to Sandy.

214
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,889
Spoiled Sandy.

215
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,029
Spoiled Sandy had to come
to her new daddy

216
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,100
to find something real.

217
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,796
Take off your clothes for us,
Sandy.

218
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,496
Do it.

219
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,200
Help her. Come on.
Can't you see she needs help?

220
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,310
Tex.

221
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,520
Get up here.

222
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,556
Go on.

223
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,970
Now you look at how
parents abuse their children.

224
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,627
If they loved her

225
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,802
why did they allow doctors
to cut up her body like this?

226
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,669
And then they felt bad

227
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,809
and then they spoiled her.

228
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,711
And now Sandy can't let go
of her ego.

229
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,957
It's not your fault,
it's your parents' fault.

230
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,924
Would you say that to me?

231
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,031
It's my parents' fault.

232
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:06,137
And it's not your fault.

233
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:09,969
It's not my fault.

234
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:13,973
Now turn around.

235
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,115
It's not your fault.

236
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,910
It's not my fault.

237
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,567
It's your parents' fault.

238
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:25,018
It's my parents' fault.

239
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:32,094
Now come and tell her
that she looks beautiful.

240
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,510
- You look beautiful, Sandy.
- You look beautiful.

241
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,719
- You're beautiful.
- Perfect.

242
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:39,999
You look beautiful.

243
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,484
We love you so much.

244
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,523
You look so beautiful.

245
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,733
You are beautiful, Sandy.

246
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,653
So he led Katie away

247
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:52,001
and I asked Squeaky
if Katie was Charlie's old lady.

248
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,039
And Squeaky told me

249
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,835
"Nobody belongs
to anybody here

250
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,837
"except Charlie.

251
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:03,116
We all belong to Charlie."

252
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,015
I thought
that was pretty far out.

253
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,502
Then she says, "If you're lucky,
he'll pick you next."

254
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:12,263
Every girl should have a daddy
like Charlie.

255
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:21,824
Something for you to take a look
at for next week.

256
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:30,971
The Bible is the only book
Charlie let us have around.

257
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,456
Charlie says
that authors are evil.

258
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,216
Trying to play mind tricks
on the reader.

259
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:37,737
So do you feel like
you'd be doing something bad

260
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,532
by studying with me?

261
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:41,948
Because if you are going
to do these classes with me

262
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,915
you're going to have
to read books.

263
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,059
I'm also gonna leave
a copy of this.

264
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,027
Have any of you read it?

265
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,858
This book changed my life.

266
00:18:57,101 --> 00:19:00,173
It looks like
it could be interesting.

267
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:04,246
Can you believe Charles Manson
wouldn't let them read?

268
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:08,216
It's been three years since
they had any contact with him.

269
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,046
But all they do
is talk about him

270
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,876
and spout his bullshit.

271
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:16,120
I want you to come talk to them.

272
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,915
You should do
your poetry workshop.

273
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,675
No way.

274
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,609
There are real victims
in this prison.

275
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,577
They're the ones I wanna help.

276
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,856
Maybe these women
are victims too.

277
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,858
Would you be saying that
if it was your sister?

278
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:33,241
Your pregnant sister
who got stabbed 20 times.

279
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:44,942
It's Leslie's shower time

280
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,151
so it's your time
in the yard, Pat.

281
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,743
And, Susan, I guess it's just
gonna be you and me for a bit.

282
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:55,884
Perfect opportunity
for a hand job.

283
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:58,818
Just teasing, Jimmy.
I know you love your Alice!

284
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,895
Oh, there you go. Wow.

285
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,415
Those tomatoes
are looking great.

286
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,382
We'll give you some
when they are ripe.

287
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,476

00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:04,815
Good morning.

294
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:09,337
Charlie's sending us
on a garbage run to LA today.

295
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,373
You're coming with me.

296
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:12,971
He says you can split
at the end of the day

297
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:15,308
and go on your way
if you want to.

298
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:17,276
But I don't wanna go.

299
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,623
Charlie is the most
beautiful person I've ever met.

300
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:22,142
- Does he want me to leave?
- No.

301
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,354
I don't know.

302
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,700
Oh.

303
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,402
Don't go through a big change
about it, okay?

304
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:32,118
Just get up and let's go.
Come on.

305
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,331
Wake up, sleepy heads.

306
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:41,403
Come on.

307
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,166
Welcome to Spahn Ranch,
ladies and gentlemen.

308
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:49,342
500 acres of gorgeous land
with horses you can rent

309
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:51,482
and remains
of the famous movie set.

310
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,553
Uh, who here likes
the New Western?

311
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:57,039
Okay, well, guess what. "Bonanza," "The Lone Ranger.."

312
00:21:57,074 --> 00:22:00,698
- How do you like our bus?
- It's far out.

313
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,849
It's a joke on all the straights we pass on the road.

314
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:04,806
They think we're a movie crew.

315
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,568
Listen up, girls,
I have a new rule.

316
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:11,295
No women will ever carry money.
Not even pennies, you dig?

317
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,583
That's why I'm sending Paul
with you.

318
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:15,299
You give your panhandling money
to him.

319
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,337
You... you still here?

320
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,651
Alright, good.
Well, give your money to Paul.

321
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:26,897
Come on.

322
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:31,902
Attagirl.

323
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,008
Don't stay out
too late now, kids.

324
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:37,114
Bye.

Oh, no, no.
We don't eat dead animals.

331
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,387
Charlie says
it's like eating fear.

332
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:11,286
Hey, man.
You guys can't be in there!

333
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,909
Don't be uptight, friend.
We're not hurting anyone.

334
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:15,394
O... okay,
but my manager won't...

335
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,534
"But my manager won't."

336
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:20,260
Oh, be nice to the square.
He doesn't know any better.

337
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,262
Come join us.
You're kind of cute.

338
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:25,024
Maybe you could just quit
your job and run away with us.

339
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:29,477
I'm... I'm serious.

340
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:31,444

Thank you.

346
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:11,450
Mother Mary.

347
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:14,038
Now we can eat.

348
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:23,738
Does anybody know
what time it is?

349
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,473
No.

350
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:38,373
I'm just messing with you.

351
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,411
You know what time it is,
it's now.

352
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:44,044
Look, there's a reason
I asked you to give up

353
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:45,874
your watches and your clocks
and your calendars.

354
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,763
I know that was difficult,
but where did it get us?

355
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:51,869
- You, do you feel more free?
- Yes, Charlie.

356
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,871
And why is that, Katie?

357
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,839
- I'm living in the now.
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,807
I don't need a soulless gadget
to tell me how to live.

359
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:00,336
I don't wanna be
like the plastic people.

360
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,914
Exactly.

361
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:04,537
That's what our parents
and our schools taught us.

362
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:07,402
You live by these numbers.
You play by these rules.

363
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:08,852
That time is over.

364
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,475
I'm here to make the new rules
and the new rules are no rules.

365
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,580
Oh, yeah.

366
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:45,164
I think it's time for us
to give you a name.

367
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,822
Now what is it those, uh,
those people named you

368
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,445
the ones you occupied a house
with and called a family?

369
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:52,447
- Les...
- No, I don't wanna know.

370
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,178
You're gonna be Lulu.

371
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:01,905
Welcome, Lulu.

372
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:04,942
Welcome.

373
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:09,878
Yeah, what do we think
of that, guys? Lulu.

374
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:12,053
- Yeah! There we go.
- Lulu.

375
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:14,918
- Lulu.
- Hi, Lulu.

376
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,195
- Lulu.
- That's far out!

377
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:19,992
- Hi, little Lulu.
- Hi, Lulu.

378
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:21,245
See, what we're trying
to do here is

379
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:22,822
we're trying to break down
inhibitions.

380
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:25,238
We're trying to live
in our bodies every night.

381
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:27,689
Touch each other.
Touch yourselves.

382
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,070
See?

383
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,362
It's not a foreign country.
Your body's like a plant.

384
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,917
If you don't give it love,
then... it will die.

385
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:23,952
A little birdie told me Tex here
doesn't know how to give head.

386
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:27,715
To me, man,
that's... that's a crime.

387
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,485
- Come on, Charlie.
- Now don't get uptight, man.

388
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:31,511
I want my family to know
each other in every way.

389
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:33,272
We got no secrets.
We got no shame.

390
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:36,068
It's not your fault
that no one taught you.

391
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:38,380
- You heard of Freud?
- Yeah.

392
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:40,072
Well, looky here, man.

393
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,420
The dude was always talking
about oral fixations.

394
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,733
I mean, we all got 'em.

395
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:47,700
Cat was right.
You need to suck on something.

396
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:50,116
That's why you got a mouth.
That's why women got titties.

397
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,566
You see kids?
They're always sucking

398
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,947
on their thumbs
or their fingers

399
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:54,949
or they're chewing on suckers
or jawbreakers.

400
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:56,571
And people are always
sticking pickles

401
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:58,711
or smokes and zuzus
in their face, you dig?

402
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:02,301
Point is, Tex, if you're gonna
suck on something

403
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:04,337
then you better be
fucking good at it, man.

404
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,410
Gypsy, you get your fine ass
up here now. Come on now.

405
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,586
Don't get uptight, man.
Come on.

406
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,795
We got no secrets.
We got no shame.

407
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:17,523
Now look.

408
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,561
Oh, alright. I see you.

409
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:26,359
You see this guy? This is
the guy who needs attention.

410
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:28,258
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,536
But you gotta be slow,
like you care.

412
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:33,539
Come on now.

413
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,893
Give it to her, Tex.

414
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,621
It's okay.

415
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:48,027
Don't get uptight
about Sandy, man.

416
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,203
She's having an ego death.

417
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:54,344
What we're trying to do here,
man, is submit. Let go.

418
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:57,934
Get rid of materialistic culture
of hang-ups. You dig?

419
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,868
We're all about love here.

420
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:04,319
Except sometimes, there has
to be some death itself.

421
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,771
Changes, tears.

422
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:11,326
Weird trips.

423
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,847
That's how it is.

424
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:16,987
That's how it's always been.

425
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,752
Oh, that's cool. You're not
into it. That's okay.

426
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:01,387
You don't have to do anything
you don't wanna do here.

427
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:03,585
It's not, that's not
what we're about.

428
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,451
Let's just go back.

429
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:10,799
No. I... I want to...

430
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,975
stay here with you right now.

431
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,689
What is it you don't like
about your body?

432
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,452
Come on now,
you hate something.

433
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,695
All women do.
What is it, tits too small?

434
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:46,766
Huh?

435
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,528
Ass too big?

436
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,566
What is it for Lulu?
No, don't you hide for me.

437
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,604
Tell me what it is
that you hate.

438
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,849
My thighs, I guess.

439
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,956
- Too fat.
- No.

440
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:07,729
You are perfect.
You say it to me.

441
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:09,030
You say I am perfect.

442
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,447
I am perfect.

443
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:13,655
I am perfect.

444
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:17,004
I am perfect.

445
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,937
I am perfect.

446
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,490
I am perfect.

447
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:33,641
Hey, little girl.

448
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,334
Now listen to me.

449
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,649
If you wanna be free
of all the bad experiences

450
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,547
and inhibitions
that are crushing you

451
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:47,241
you have to imagine that you are
making love to your daddy, okay?

452
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:50,727
That's what all the girls want
and can never have.

453
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:09,918
Ladies, we have our own
special cell for school now.

454
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:13,646
I'm not sure what you all did
to make Miss Carlson

455
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:16,339
like you so much,
but she gave the okay.

456
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:18,789
Thanks, Jimmy.

457
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,005
It's been a long time.

458
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:31,319
Ah, I'm sorry, ladies.
I'm gonna have to break that up.

459
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:33,873
- It's not really allowed to..
- Okay.

460
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,258
Ta-da.

461
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,226
- Lovely.
- Yeah.

462
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,160
Okay.

463
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:52,202
Okay.
Let's talk about this one.

464
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:55,516
- Did you all read it?
- It was horrible.

465
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,518
It was very depressing.

466
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:59,830
I felt really bad for the women
in those situations.

467
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:05,077
A lot of women right here
in this prison

468
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,838
are survivors
of domestic violence.

469
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:09,875
They defended themselves

470
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,015
and this is where
it landed them.

471
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,086
That is so sad.

472
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:16,468
That makes me really sad.

473
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:19,436
Are you friends with them?
Do you help them?

474
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:20,782
Yes, and yes.

475
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:24,752
I'm working with a woman now
who's trying

476
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:27,341
not to let her daughter
be put into foster care.

477
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,412
She killed her abusive husband

478
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:33,036
she went to prison,
and now her kid has no parents.

479
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,003
- What's her name?
- How long is she in for?

480
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,488
How old is her kid?

481
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,630
I'm not really allowed
to give details like that.

482
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,701
Well, what about you?
Do you have kids?

483
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,013
Yes. I have four kids.

484
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:49,017
And what does your husband do?

485
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:50,950
As much as I'd love
to talk about me

486
00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:52,228
I am here to teach you

487
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:54,575
and I am not a subject
that merits a college class.

488
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,614
I feel so lucky.

489
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,927
We'll have to decorate.
Make things for it.

490
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,309
- It's like being home again.
- Yeah.

491
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,069
The family BC.

492
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,589
- BC?
- Before the crimes.

493
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,074
When everything was about love.

494
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,525
Yeah. Like when Mary gave birth
to Pooh Bear.

495
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,286
And we all witnessed
the miracle.

496
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,741
- You can do it.
- Yeah. You got this, mama.

497
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:29,127
- One, two, three, push!
- One, two, three, push!

498
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:32,578
- Charlie's here.
- It's alright, baby.

499
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:34,684
It's alright. It's alright.
Nice and easy.

500
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,306
Paul, why don't you play
some music?

501
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:38,964
We want this motherfucker
to come out dancing, right?

502
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:40,493
You just push, honey.
You take it easy.

503
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:42,140
Go with the motion.

504
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,659
Go with the motion, Mary.

505
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,662
Somebody get me a razor blade
and sterilize it for me, please?

506
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,158
Come on, darling.
Come on, darling.

507
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,332
You can take it
nice and easy now.

508
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:53,185
You take it nice and easy now, alright?

509
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,912
Just go with the motion,
darling.

510
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,441
You're gonna go with the motion.
Alright.

511
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:58,649
Great, I'm gonna make
a little cut now.

512
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:02,332
- Charlie!
- One, two, three.

513
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,103
Oh, no, you're gonna give it
to me right now.

514
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,750
Give it to me now.
Oh, there we go. There we go.

515
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,545
That's it, come on,
one more, one more time!

516
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,754
One more time! One more time!
One more time now.

517
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,320
Come on, darling!
Here we go, here we go!

518
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:16,933
Come on! Come on! Come on!

519
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,831
Come on now.
You give me that squeeze!

520
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:21,386
- Push!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

521
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,802
Push!

522
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,976
That's alright. That is coming!

523
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,461
Oh, yeah. Oh, we got it!

524
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:29,290
We got it! Oh!

525
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:31,534
Dig this. The little
motherfucker, man, he's out!

526
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:33,363
Woo! Yee-haw!

527
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:36,573
Alright, we got a baby!
We got a baby!

528
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,541
We got a baby!

529
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:40,232
Dig this little dude, Mary.

530
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,130
Take this little one.

531
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,511
Alright now, alright.

532
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:46,928
- Yeah, you did so good, mama.
- Yeah.

533
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,758
- There you go.
- So beautiful.

534
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,656
Alright, darling.

535
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,558
Dig this little dude.

536
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,140
"And the fifth angel sounded

537
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:29,281
"and I saw a star fall
from heaven unto the Earth.

538
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:33,078
"And to him was given the key
of the bottomless pit.

539
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:34,735
And he opened
the bottomless pit..."

540
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,944
Do you know
about the bottomless pit?

541
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:39,049
We're gonna find it.
Well, I'm gonna find it

542
00:37:39,084 --> 00:37:40,672
and we're gonna live in it.

543
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:42,846
The question is your answer.
Keep reading.

544
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,505
That's Charlie.

545
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,576
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, listen, this is Kay.

546
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:51,130
Well, how do you do?

547
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,857
Welcome, ma'am.

548
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:58,206
Oh, I see.

549
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:00,519
You make a man ashamed
to show his pecker.

550
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:04,212
That's what Eve did.

551
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:06,145
Look where that got us.

552
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:13,567
Do I make you uncomfortable,
little girl?

553
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:17,778
No.

554
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,297
You're just rude.

555
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,264
Is that what daddy taught you,
to be polite?

556
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,543
No. No, my daddy taught me

557
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,165
not to take shit
from men like you.

558
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,651
That's what he taught me.
- Keep reading.

559
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,826
- Charlie, I...
- Go home to daddy, little girl.

560
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:34,035
You don't belong here.

561
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,278
Shoo.

562
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:38,971
I'm sorry, Charlie.

563
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:45,771
"And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the Earth."

564
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:48,602
Get her out of here so I don't
have to look at her piggie face.

565
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:54,193
You see that, Lulu.

566
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:56,403
Not every stupid hippie girl
can waltz onto my land

567
00:38:56,437 --> 00:38:59,060
and get a free dinner.

568
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:01,028
I need to see something
in your eyes.

569
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:07,137
Keep reading.

570
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:12,453
"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the Earth."

571
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:13,834
The Beatles.

572
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:15,560
"And unto them
was given power.."

573
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:16,940
Me.

574
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:18,401
"...as the scorpions
of the Earth have power."

575
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:19,391
Me.

576
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:20,806
"And it was commanded them

577
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:23,257
"that they should not hurt
the grass of the Earth

578
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,603
neither any green thing.."

579
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:00,432
I have wings
and I can fly now.

580
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:05,161
Charlie says
there's gonna be a revolution

581
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,370
and we're gonna wait it out
in the bottomless pit.

582
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,613
Like it says in Revelations.

583
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:10,453
And that there will be babies
that are homeless

584
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:13,411
and they need saving
from all the killings.

585
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,034
And then we'll stay underground
and make music

586
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:18,450
and make love
until the violence is over.

587
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:20,152
And then... and then
when it comes time for us

588
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:22,143
to rise to the surface again,
some of us

589
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:24,939
will begin to feel budding wings
on our backs.

590
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:26,389
- Wings?
- Yes.

591
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,391
Some of us want to become
winged elves.

592
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:31,877
Me and Sandy, Squeaky.

593
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:33,983
Charlie says it would happen.

594
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,918
Karlene thinks we're crazy.

595
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:41,128
No.
I would never use that word.

596
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:46,478
I'm just surprised
to hear some of this stuff.

597
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:48,998
You've to admit
it's pretty far out.

598
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:55,418
You must know that elves

599
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,834
are mythical creatures

600
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:02,149
and therefore human beings
can't turn into elves

601
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:03,530
or sprout wings?

602
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:10,191
Well, hey, man, it's no more
far out than heaven and hell.

603
00:41:10,226 --> 00:41:12,746
- Yeah. Charlie says that...
- Yeah, but what do you think?

604
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:16,922
Pat, do you still think
it's possible

605
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:19,649
that you will become
a winged elf?

606
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,862
Well, I guess not now.
Not... not when we're in here.

607
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:28,969
You won't become a winged elf

608
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:31,454
whether you're in here
or out in the world.

609
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:46,158
Karlene, tell us
about your kids.

610
00:41:46,193 --> 00:41:47,539
Pretty please?

611
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:50,128
What are their names?
How old are they?

612
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:52,406
We spend too much time
talking about us in here.

613
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:58,032
They are 15, 14, 11 and 7.

614
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,828
You have a 7-year-old?

615
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,554
He must miss you so much.

616
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:05,419
- I see him every weekend.
- I didn't mean it like that.

617
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,633
I took my family
all around the world.

618
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:16,672
To Germany, to France,
to Ethiopia.

619
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:19,019
We've been through a lot
together

620
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:21,884
and they are always
surprising me.

621
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:24,093
Mom, I have a new family now.

622
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,751
Leslie,
what are you talking about?

623
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:29,477
We're your parents.

624
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:32,066
Mom, please stop crying.

625
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:35,414
Listen to me.
I need you to stop loving me.

626
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:37,382
You're never gonna see me again.

627
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,493
♪ Your home
is where you're happy ♪

628
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:47,047
♪ It's not where your.. ♪

629
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:48,876
We were all way into our trips

630
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:50,671
and hanging out inside the bus

631
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:53,329
when Charlie just decides
he has to go.

632
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:54,951
He starts running down the road

633
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:57,436
we all start begging him
to come back to us.

634
00:42:57,471 --> 00:42:59,887
"Charlie! Charlie!"

635
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,787
It was really scary.

636
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:04,547
We can all laugh about it now.

637
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,283
Right at that moment,
I was probably sitting

638
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:08,068
in my secretarial school

639
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:10,035
freaking out
but not even knowing it.

640
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,212
We don't talk about our pasts.

641
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:17,525
We don't have pasts.

642
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,458
Our lives started
when we met Charlie.

643
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:21,253
But Charlie talks
about his time in prison...

644
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:23,531
How dare you question Charlie?

645
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,775
You need to talk less
and listen more.

646
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,886
- Dennis!
- Dennis!

647
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:38,961
Hi.

648
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,558
Hey.

649
00:43:50,593 --> 00:43:53,182
Hey, beautiful.
Did you miss me?

650
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:56,357
No, we've been busy.

651
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:58,843
Lots going on here.
Charlie wants...

652
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,362
Oh, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

653
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,433
Let's talk about
what Greg wants.

654
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:05,332
What does Greg want?

655
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:09,301
Stand up girls, let's give
the guys what they want.

656
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:19,726
You're all beautiful

657
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,349
but right now, I just wanna
get high and play music, man.

658
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,662
Come on then,
the girls are always here.

659
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,803
Let's go play.

660
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:37,951
I came to tell you something,
Charlie.

661
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,885
I talked the band
into recording your song

662
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,162
"Cease To Exist."

663
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,476
- Everyone likes it, man.
- That's far out.

664
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:48,720
Yeah. I can't promise
more than that though.

665
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:52,137
We'll just see
how it works out.

666
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:56,555
♪ Pretty girl

667
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,143

668
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:01,699

670
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,533
Alright, man.

671
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:17,093
Hey, Charlie. This is Linda.

672
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,854
Well, hey there.

673
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:20,131
Looky, looky here.

674
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:23,548
Where's that baby's daddy?

675
00:45:23,582 --> 00:45:26,309
We split. He went sailing
around the world or something.

676
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:28,898
Take that baby to be with
the other little kiddies here.

677
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:34,145
Tex tells me
that you have a car?

678
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:38,287
Alright.
I think we can keep her.

679
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:41,186
Let me show you around.

680
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,226
Don't worry.
Ruth Ann is great with the kids.

681
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,790
And just think,
if you're loyal to Charlie

682
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:49,885
she will always
be taken care of.

683
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:52,784
Here everything
belongs to everyone.

684
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:55,442
Gypsy tells me you had a far-out
session making it with Tex.

685
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:56,684
Yeah.

686
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,859
When we came,
my... my fists were clenched

687
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:01,068
and my sides and arms
were paralyzed.

688
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:02,898
That's your ego dying.

689
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:05,245
Is that bad?
To have your ego dying?

690
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,869
No. That's what Charlie's
trying to help us do.

691
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:11,907
Kill our egos.
Be one consciousness.

692
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,672
- Love you, sweetheart.
- Come on. Let's go.

693
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,697
What... what happened?
Is your mom okay?

694
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:47,218
Oh, she's fine.

695
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,979
Oh.

696
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,686
I just can't stand it.

697
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:09,274
She might think
I ended up in here

698
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:12,208
because of something they did or the way that they raised me.

699
00:47:21,908 --> 00:47:24,807
No one has visited her
the whole three years.

700
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,846
I told my mother
to stop loving me..

701
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:32,228
...and she would never
see me again.

702
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:35,162
She kept loving me, anyway.

703
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,487
Now listen up. I want everyone
to show my good friend Phil here

704
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:50,729
a lot of love tonight.

705
00:47:50,764 --> 00:47:52,076
He's my jailhouse brother.

706
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,329
We were at San Quentin together.

707
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,975
So Katie, Lulu,
why don't you come

708
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,390
and make the man feel welcome?

709
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:59,911
♪ I feel much better
on the other ♪

710
00:48:00,774 --> 00:48:02,534
♪ Side ♪

711
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,642
Shit. Well, look at that.

712
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:11,036
You know, we all thought
he was fucking crazy in prison.

713
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,304
Talked a lot of nonsense, but..

714
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,272
...maybe I should have listened.

715
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:19,344
Now my good friend Dennis here

716
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,622
has an announcement to make.

717
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:24,349
Uh, yeah, Charlie's song

718
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:27,456
"Cease To Exist"
is on the record.

719
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:40,952
Now all you need to do is
get your friend Terry Melcher

720
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:42,540
to come up here
and listen to me play

721
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:43,955
and I know he'll wanna sign us.

722
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,544
I'll do my best
to get him out here, man.

723
00:48:46,578 --> 00:48:47,994
Now that's right.

724
00:48:57,175 --> 00:48:58,763
Alright, man. Thanks.

725
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:03,147
Now, Katie,
get everyone together.

726
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:05,504
Tell them just stop what they're
doing right now and come here.

727
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:07,427
- Okay.
- Soon. Now.

728
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,950
Terry Melcher is coming
to hear me play.

729
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:16,263
So we need to be ready. I mean,
we need to be more than ready.

730
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:18,127
Terry Melcher.

731
00:49:18,162 --> 00:49:20,164
Terry Melcher!

732
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:21,855
Come on.

733
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:23,488
Dennis' producer,
the guy who can give me

734
00:49:23,512 --> 00:49:25,065
a record deal, goddamn it.

735
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,308
Yeah.

736
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:28,586
When Terry hears me play,
he's gonna lose his mind

737
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,347
which means the world
gets to hear my music.

738
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:33,971
And then all the lost
young loves during the mayhem

739
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:35,524
and the killing
will hear my music

740
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:37,526
and they will know that
they have a home.

741
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,149
So, guys, make this place
look spotless.

742
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:42,427
Get rid of all the stuff
that stinks.

743
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:44,705
And, girls,
you bake some cookies.

744
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,948
Go to the grocery store.

745
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,882
I don't want no garbage run food
for Terry.

746
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:51,954
And I want a deer skin shirt and
pants held together by laces.

747
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,061
I want him to see my commitment
to going back to the land.

748
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:58,616
But don't they have to kill
the deer for that?

749
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:11,767
Lulu has a question. Would you
like to repeat that, Lulu?

750
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,979
Don't they kill the deer...

751
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,808
What we have here..

752
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,265
...what we have here
is a contradiction.

753
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,164
Lulu thinks
she sees a contradiction

754
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:32,857
and her tiny female brain
is gonna have a freak out.

755
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:36,654
If you think
I'm going against my own words

756
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:38,656
then maybe you just aren't
evolved enough yet

757
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,038
to understand what's going on.

758
00:50:43,868 --> 00:50:46,802
Old JC said a lot of things
his followers didn't understand

759
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,425
and they stuck around.

760
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,979

Sounds good, Charlie.

786
00:52:09,747 --> 00:52:10,989
I didn't ask for your opinion.

787
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:13,268
I asked for your titties

00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,567
Hey, man. How you doing?

796
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:38,845
We got some special zuzus
and food for ya

797
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:40,605
and of course,
we got the girls.

798
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,849
Thank you, Charlie.
I don't have a lot of time.

799
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:45,023
We'll just get down
to the music, huh?

800
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:47,164
- Play me something.
- Alright.

801
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:50,339
Look, you gotta be all business,
then yo, we'll be all business.

802
00:52:50,374 --> 00:52:53,480
I guess the music's really
the love, anyway, right?

803
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:55,206
Yeah, man.

804
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:57,381
Alright. Here we go.

805
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:07,287
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Melcher.

806
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,117
Appreciate your time.

807
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:12,706

Alright now.

835
00:55:19,937 --> 00:55:22,526
So what do you think
of our place, man?

836
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,872
I mean, we dig it here,
you know.

837
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:27,220
We learn it's possible to live
without restrictions.

838
00:55:27,254 --> 00:55:30,672
I mean, dig it, we live
on other people's garbage

839
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:31,752
and we live well, you know...

840
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:34,054
Hey, Charlie, man,
let's take a walk.

841
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:36,263
Talk about the music.

842
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:37,817
Alright, man.

843
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,621
You know, I mean, look,
we get off into these trees..

844
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,693
...we go walking.

845
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,902
Gotta take the horses out,
you know.

846
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:56,698
Yeah, so, uh..

847
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:59,908
That was perfect.
So beautiful.

848
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,603
You girls made me cry.
Your voices were so sweet.

849
00:56:05,638 --> 00:56:07,053
It's all happening.

850
00:56:09,676 --> 00:56:11,609
That music you were playing..

851
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,269
Finally, the world gets to hear
Charlie's music.

852
00:56:16,303 --> 00:56:18,271
More popular than Jesus.

853
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:20,031
That suit looks outasight.

854
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:21,999
He looks like
a rock star already.

855
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:36,254
Well, man, what did he say?

856
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:38,256
He looked like
he was really digging it.

857
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:40,845
Is he gonna sign you
like he should?

858
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,607
I mean, he gave me money.

859
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:44,711
How much is it?

860
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:46,437
I couldn't sign a contract
on the spot.

861
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:48,370
That's just not how
Charlie Manson operates.

862
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,028
My word is my bond. I don't need
no written contract.

863
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:54,928
What about that money?

864
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:56,654
Well, it's just hay money.

865
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:58,725
I'm sure he wanted the horses
to eat well.

866
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:03,016
You know, let's eat
some of the cookies

867
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,490
those motherfuckers didn't want.

868
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:53,746
Who made this salad dressing?

869
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:56,231
I did.

870
00:57:58,716 --> 00:58:00,753
Well, smells a bit like piss.

871
00:58:03,687 --> 00:58:06,724
Well, that's 'cause
I pissed in yours.

872
00:58:06,759 --> 00:58:08,657
Don't play that shit with me,
woman!

873
00:58:10,348 --> 00:58:11,349
Look at me! Look at me!

874
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:14,525
I will not listen
to that kind of talk.

875
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,494
You take that shit down the
road. You dig what I'm saying?

876
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:18,633
Look at me. Look at me.

877
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,531
Look at me in the eye.
Look me in the eye.

878
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:25,053
What?
You wanna fucking hit me?

879
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:26,503
Fuck you!

880
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,194
Get the fuck out of here.

881
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:29,954
- You wanna fucking hit me?
- Ah, no!

882
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:30,989
Huh?

883
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:33,820
I will break
your fucking wrist.

884
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,581
I will break
your fucking fingers!

885
00:58:35,615 --> 00:58:38,515
What? What? Stop fighting!

886
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:39,964
Stop fighting me.

887
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,518
You stop fucking..

888
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,591
Stop fighting me. Whoa.

889
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,765
Whoa. Whoa.

890
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,085
Quit fighting me.

891
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:11,996
Get up.

892
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:19,763
Now you go back in the kitchen
and go, go about your business.

893
00:59:38,022 --> 00:59:39,990
You can go ahead and eat, Sandy.

894
00:59:56,247 --> 00:59:57,939
Hey, are you okay?

895
00:59:59,078 --> 01:00:00,527
Oh, yeah.

896
01:00:01,943 --> 01:00:03,703
Yeah, I feel good.

897
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:06,257
Listen.

898
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:09,823
Getting hit by the man you love
is no different

899
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,229
than making love to him.

900
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:14,438
Charlie just gives me
what I need.

901
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,552
I brought you gifts.

902
01:00:41,534 --> 01:00:43,501
I love the way new books smell.

903
01:00:44,606 --> 01:00:46,297
Thank you so much.

904
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:47,585
We have a Christmas present
for you.

905
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:49,646
Did you bring it, Katie?

906
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,756
Sadie did this. The sun.

907
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,034
And that's a butterfly.
Lulu did it.

908
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:09,113
It's just like the one
we made for Charlie.

909
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:16,949
Ready, baby girl?

910
01:01:16,983 --> 01:01:18,260
I got this.

911
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:24,853
You see that? She trusts me.
She's not afraid.

912
01:01:24,888 --> 01:01:26,003
You'd die for me,
wouldn't you, girl?

913
01:01:26,027 --> 01:01:28,132
Of course, Charlie.

914
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,341

01:01:42,422 --> 01:01:45,184
Tex tells me he got
into a little complication

920
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:47,082
with a black man.

921
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:48,256
It might come back on us.

932
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,284
This album is a musical roadmap to our future.

933
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:52,803
Now when he talks
about the piggies

934
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:54,943
he's talking about the rich
and the powerful

935
01:02:54,978 --> 01:02:57,049
needin' a damn good whacking.
The "Blackbird."

936
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:59,499
It's the black man's time
to rise.

937
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:02,675
And "Revolution 1,"
it's a call to arms. It's time.

938
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:05,126
"Revolution 9,"
it's the soundtrack to the war.

939
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,024
It's guns. Screaming.

940
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,474
Does that make you feel afraid?

941
01:03:08,508 --> 01:03:11,442
No. It's like you always said
it would be.

942
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:13,455
You're damn straight it's like I always said it would be.

943
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:15,112
You should feel proud.
You should all feel proud.

944
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,276
And why should you all
feel proud? Lulu, why?

945
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,150
Because we're already living
like revolutionaries.

946
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,349
Yes! Now dig this.

947
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:22,971
In Revelations, in the Bible

948
01:03:23,006 --> 01:03:24,801
it talks about the locusts
coming to Earth.

949
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,043
Now that's the Beatles.

950
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:27,873
And he talks about
the locusts having scales

951
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:29,219
like iron breastplates.

952
01:03:29,253 --> 01:03:31,255
That's the Beatles' guitars.
And dig this.

953
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:34,155
He talks about five angels
coming to Earth.

954
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,364
Now this five angels,
four of them are the Beatles

955
01:03:36,398 --> 01:03:37,606
the other one is me.

956
01:03:37,641 --> 01:03:39,677
And the other one is me
because I am given the key

957
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:41,438
to the shaft
of the bottomless pit.

958
01:03:41,472 --> 01:03:42,819
And where is
the bottomless pit?

959
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:45,062
The one you told us about
in Death Valley?

960
01:03:45,097 --> 01:03:47,858
- The one we're going to find.
- Yes!

961
01:03:47,893 --> 01:03:50,688
So "Helter Skelter"
is the thing, man.

962
01:03:50,723 --> 01:03:52,898
It's what
the black man's gonna do

963
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:54,831
to start the race war.

964
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,142
But just like the Bible says

965
01:03:56,177 --> 01:03:58,869
I will lead my family
to the bottomless pit

966
01:03:58,904 --> 01:04:01,009
and we will live out the war
underground

967
01:04:01,044 --> 01:04:03,322
and we will expand to 144,000

968
01:04:03,356 --> 01:04:06,463
and then we will come back
like the 12 tribes of Israel.

969
01:04:06,497 --> 01:04:08,983
And when we come back,
the black man will not know

970
01:04:09,017 --> 01:04:10,985
how to act or how to be

971
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:13,228
or how to govern
or what to do.

972
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:16,059
And so, we cannot leave!

973
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:18,130
We cannot leave
because you're white people

974
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:19,303
and you will be murdered.

975
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:20,857
You will be made
into black slaves.

976
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,755
And Tex, Tex!

977
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:25,102
Tex is gonna be sorry
that he ever left our tribe.

978
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:33,041
- Thanks for coming out here.
- That's okay.

979
01:04:33,076 --> 01:04:35,043
Hey, look,
my wife just wants to know

980
01:04:35,078 --> 01:04:36,976
all about these
crazy Manson girls.

981
01:04:37,011 --> 01:04:38,736
Yeah.

982
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:41,015
I get asked
about them a lot too.

983
01:04:41,049 --> 01:04:42,049
Yeah.

984
01:04:46,434 --> 01:04:49,161
Um, okay,
now you were all just kids

985
01:04:49,195 --> 01:04:52,819
when the Watts Riots happened,
but it's a perfect example.

986
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,304
Here you have black Americans

987
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:57,928
oppressed for generations,
at the end of their rope.

988
01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,526
You know, things got
out of hand back then

989
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,311
but the message was sent.

990
01:05:01,345 --> 01:05:03,761
Yeah, Charlie said that
Watts was the beginning.

991
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:05,532
I really think that
a race war would have started

992
01:05:05,556 --> 01:05:06,764
if they hadn't put us in here.

993
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,320
The black man is rising up
and his time is coming.

994
01:05:10,354 --> 01:05:12,253
Do you think it's still coming?

995
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,014
Um..

996
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:18,845
Well, Bobby Seale was bound
and gagged in a courtroom

997
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,951
but last year they let him go,
so..

998
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:25,749
We don't know who that is.

999
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:30,892
Black Panthers?

1000
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,723
Y'all don't get any news
in here at all?

1001
01:05:34,758 --> 01:05:37,450
Oh, yes.
We know the Black Panthers.

1002
01:05:37,485 --> 01:05:39,118
Charlie said that
black people wouldn't be able

1003
01:05:39,142 --> 01:05:40,833
to lead themselves
after the revolution

1004
01:05:40,867 --> 01:05:42,800
that they would need his help.

1005
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:46,770
Yeah, I heard that he said that.

1006
01:05:46,804 --> 01:05:48,910
It's okay, he said
you wouldn't understand now

1007
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,016
but that you would thank him
later.

1008
01:05:52,603 --> 01:05:53,603
But..

1009
01:05:54,674 --> 01:05:56,331
You don't think that's true?

1010
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:59,610
I find that to be
a deeply racist idea.

1011
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:01,509
That black people would need
a white man

1012
01:06:01,543 --> 01:06:03,614
to tell them what to think.

1013
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:05,169
When black people
take their power back

1014
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:06,482
there's no chance
in hell that...

1015
01:06:06,514 --> 01:06:07,584
Charlie said...

1016
01:06:07,618 --> 01:06:09,931
Let's listen to what
Bill has to say.

1017
01:06:13,728 --> 01:06:16,075
There's no chance in hell
that we would turn

1018
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,044
to a white person
for leadership.

1019
01:06:19,078 --> 01:06:23,117
And black people were
brought here as slaves in 1619.

1020
01:06:23,151 --> 01:06:24,946
And even after slavery

1021
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,913
and the eventual abolishment
of slavery

1022
01:06:26,948 --> 01:06:29,709
we are still
getting crushed by racism.

1023
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,817
We don't trust the white men

1024
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:36,337
and we certainly don't need one
to lead us.

1025
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:37,717
You hear me?

1026
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:42,999
The trouble with blackie is

1027
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:44,966
he wants to fuck
all the white women

1028
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,381
turn all the white babies
brown.

1029
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:49,419
We can't have that.
That's what makes whitey mad.

1030
01:06:49,453 --> 01:06:51,041
Well, we're gonna
help blackie out.

1031
01:06:51,076 --> 01:06:53,940
We're gonna start a race war
called Helter Skelter.

1032
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:56,012
And we start this war
by killing some white people

1033
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:58,048
and making it look like
the black man's work.

1034
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:01,017
Blackie's been waiting
for this. Blackie is waiting.

1035
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:02,984
And then the piggy cops
will come down on blackie

1036
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,710
when they find
the rich dead piggies.

1037
01:07:04,744 --> 01:07:06,746
Then the revolution will begin.

1038
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:08,852
You understand me?

1039
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:11,130
Helter Skelter is upon us.

1040
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:18,241
Lulu, what's wrong?

1041
01:07:19,897 --> 01:07:22,831
Did you ever start to think
that maybe Helter Skelter

1042
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:24,799
isn't coming down at all?

1043
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:28,078
That Charlie was wrong?

1044
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:29,873
No. No.

1045
01:07:32,117 --> 01:07:35,051
Don't let this place
get to you.

1046
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,363
It would be happening right now if we weren't in here.

1047
01:07:39,124 --> 01:07:40,573
Please don't give up now.

1048
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:42,713
- Okay.
- Please, I need you.

1049
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:46,510
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

1050
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:15,608
Lulu, this knife might be
the only thing

1051
01:08:15,643 --> 01:08:17,679
between you and blackie
slitting your throat.

1052
01:08:17,714 --> 01:08:19,198
Thrust and jab
like you mean it.

1053
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:21,304
Thrust. Jab. Lift.

1054
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:23,927
Stab the chair.

1055
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:33,039
Good, Mary.

1056
01:08:40,392 --> 01:08:42,980
I know everyone thinks
we're these scary creatures

1057
01:08:43,015 --> 01:08:45,569
who committed
these horrible crimes

1058
01:08:45,604 --> 01:08:49,815
but we were just engaging
in the dance of life and death.

1059
01:08:49,849 --> 01:08:52,162
Charlie says there is no death.

1060
01:08:52,197 --> 01:08:55,303
So you're saying it's okay
to take someone's life?

1061
01:08:57,202 --> 01:08:59,445
Leslie, Susan,
is that what you think?

1062
01:09:00,757 --> 01:09:01,757
No.

1063
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:05,071
I'm saying
that I'm starting to think

1064
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:08,868
that the devil took a hold of me
so I could find my way to God.

1065
01:09:08,903 --> 01:09:10,870
So Charlie is the devil?

1066
01:09:10,905 --> 01:09:14,046
No, Charlie is Charlie
and the devil is the devil.

1067
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:20,259
So you all still believe

1068
01:09:20,294 --> 01:09:23,193
that thing he was talking about

1069
01:09:23,228 --> 01:09:24,712
Helter Skelter?

1070
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:35,481
The other night, I started
to doubt it and I got shaky.

1071
01:09:37,483 --> 01:09:40,555
You felt doubt.
What made you feel that doubt?

1072
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,557
That was just for a minute,
right, Lulu?

1073
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:44,180
She doesn't doubt anymore.

1074
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:48,598
Sorry to
interrupt your studies, ladies.

1075
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,604
I am afraid I have bad news.

1076
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:58,159
The decision has come down
and you will remain here in SSU

1077
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,334
for the duration
of your sentences.

1078
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,476
Fucking motherfuckers!

1079
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,306
They can't fucking
do this shit to us!

1080
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:09,135
We're fucking human beings!

1081
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,276
You are considered
an escape risk

1082
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,829
and too well known.

1083
01:10:13,968 --> 01:10:15,521
No!

1084
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,874
I'm never gonna
see Charlie again.

1085
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:28,810
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

1086
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:30,340
There's always parole.
You could get out.

1087
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:33,263
No, you. You could get out.

1088
01:10:33,298 --> 01:10:35,231
They'll never let me
out of here.

1089
01:10:40,305 --> 01:10:42,376
It's my fault you're in here.

1090
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,414
Charlie said make sure everyone
does something that night

1091
01:10:46,449 --> 01:10:48,382
and I made sure you did.

1092
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,834
You must hate me.

1093
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:01,533
I could never hate you.

1094
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:26,937
Good afternoon, ladies.

1095
01:11:26,972 --> 01:11:28,836
Special treat for you today.

1096
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,320
No school.

1097
01:11:30,355 --> 01:11:32,495
Just a mini concert.

1098
01:11:32,529 --> 01:11:34,462
Ladies, I brought Robin
to play for you..

1099
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:45,749
Ladies, why would you do this?

1100
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:50,582
Charlie spoke to us last night.
He told us to.

1101
01:11:50,616 --> 01:11:52,549
He told us to protest.

1102
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,346
Jesus fucking Christ.

1103
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,316
How the hell
did they get razors?

1104
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,455
The guards love them.

1105
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:04,320
They have all kinds of things
in their cells.

1106
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:05,631
Are you okay?

1107
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,703
It's just as long as
they're stuck alone together

1108
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:12,535
in that unit just repeating their
brainwashing back to each other..

1109
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:17,239
I mean, they're never gonna see
the real world again

1110
01:12:17,263 --> 01:12:19,818
so what is it
we can really do for them?

1111
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:26,238
I just wanna remind them

1112
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:27,619
if I can..

1113
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:33,418
...of who they were before
they ever met Charles Manson.

1114
01:12:34,867 --> 01:12:37,594
I just wanna give them back
themselves.

1115
01:12:52,126 --> 01:12:53,714
Let's go take a walk.

1116
01:12:54,818 --> 01:12:56,786
Where's Charlie?

1117
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,615
He went somewhere with Paul.

1118
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,790
Seems like
he's been gone forever.

1119
01:13:03,655 --> 01:13:06,278
- You like living here?
- Yeah. You should join us.

1120
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:08,142
- Nah, I need my freedom.
- Freedom?

1121
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:10,109
That's all we have here.

1122
01:13:17,116 --> 01:13:18,324
I like you.

1123
01:13:19,636 --> 01:13:21,638
You should come away
on adventures with me.

1124
01:13:21,673 --> 01:13:24,158
I have a lot
of responsibilities here.

1125
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:26,125
We're preparing for a war.

1126
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:28,069
Well, if we're all gonna die

1127
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:29,819
we better get
to making love, huh?

1128
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:31,821
Well, I don't know about that.

1129
01:13:31,855 --> 01:13:32,994
Come on.

1130
01:13:33,029 --> 01:13:35,238
You might be my last chance,
baby.

1131
01:13:45,075 --> 01:13:47,181
Hey. Who the fuck are you?

1132
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:52,876
Sorry, man. I came..

1133
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:55,672
I came with Danny and them guys.

1134
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:57,478
- I thought you...
- Get the fuck out of here.

1135
01:13:57,502 --> 01:13:59,065
And don't you come back
unless you're invited

1136
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:00,366
which you wont be.

1137
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:02,679
Get up. Get out.

1138
01:14:02,714 --> 01:14:04,485
You want me to help
get your dick in your pants?

1139
01:14:04,509 --> 01:14:06,442
Get the fuck out of my barn!

1140
01:14:08,651 --> 01:14:11,032
You guys got a weird scene
going on up here, man.

1141
01:14:14,139 --> 01:14:16,037
You ask me first!

1142
01:14:18,143 --> 01:14:20,248
You don't just whore around.

1143
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:23,079
That is it.

1144
01:14:23,113 --> 01:14:25,944
No more hippie kids looking
for a free ride and a quick lay.

1145
01:14:25,978 --> 01:14:28,740
Nobody has any visitors
unless it goes through me.

1146
01:14:28,774 --> 01:14:31,432
We need to stay focused
on our scene.

1147
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,020
No more outsiders.

1148
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,111
I'm gonna go on an adventure.

1149
01:14:57,009 --> 01:14:59,115
You can come.

1150
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:00,323
Bring Lulu.

1151
01:15:02,463 --> 01:15:05,673
Bring that Linda girl.
We'll use her car.

1152
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:07,295
We get
in the rich people's houses

1153
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,195
and we get in their heads,
you dig?

1154
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:13,439
You just, you get in
and get out. Don't be afraid.

1155
01:15:13,474 --> 01:15:15,890
Mess things up a bit,
but don't break anything.

1156
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:17,478
Alright, take a wallet
here and there

1157
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,998
but mostly just let them know
that they're not safe.

1158
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:21,862
But what if they wake up?

1159
01:15:21,896 --> 01:15:24,968
Don't allow them to. Use your
training, man. Be invisible.

1160
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:42,563
He'll wake up and say, "Honey,
where did I put my wallet?"

1161
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:47,119
And he'll say, "Why did you put
the portraits upside down?"

1162
01:16:49,225 --> 01:16:50,813
What's in the wallet?

1163
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:55,818
Uh, uh, sixty bucks
and three credit cards.

1164
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:57,992
Well, that's nothing.
Next time we tie some piggies up

1165
01:16:58,027 --> 01:16:59,960
and we scare them to death.

1166
01:17:25,054 --> 01:17:29,127
Lulu, I think
you should leave here.

1167
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:31,094
I came to help you do that.

1168
01:17:34,408 --> 01:17:37,687
It looks like you're being made
to stay here against your will.

1169
01:17:37,722 --> 01:17:39,793
I can take you right now.

1170
01:17:39,827 --> 01:17:42,450
You can drop that broom, get on
my bike and we'll be gone.

1171
01:17:44,245 --> 01:17:46,178
Nobody will stop us.

1172
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:08,131
No.

1173
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:12,826
I'm staying here.

1174
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,449
I want to be here. I-I mean..

1175
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:16,899
Thank... thank you.

1176
01:18:21,766 --> 01:18:23,906
Are you sure about this?

1177
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,563
I ain't expecting nothing
from you.

1178
01:18:26,598 --> 01:18:27,644
I mean,
we... we ain't gotta ball

1179
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:29,912
just 'cause I get you
out of here.

1180
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:32,328
You just look like you need
rescuing, that's all.

1181
01:18:39,197 --> 01:18:40,508
I'm sure.

1182
01:18:51,968 --> 01:18:53,176
Let's go.

1183
01:19:35,598 --> 01:19:37,807
You wanna leave me?

1184
01:19:37,842 --> 01:19:38,843
Jump.

1185
01:19:57,654 --> 01:20:00,243
That's my Lulu.

1186
01:20:00,278 --> 01:20:02,383
I knew you weren't going
anywhere.

1187
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:37,004
Hi.

1188
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:40,594
How are you?

1189
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:45,564
I've realized

1190
01:20:45,599 --> 01:20:49,534
if I succeed in making them
really accept what they did..

1191
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:53,952
...then they will have to live
with that horror.

1192
01:20:55,678 --> 01:20:58,405
Isn't that what prison's for?

1193
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:00,234
Atonement?

1194
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:02,754
Taking responsibility
for one's actions?

1195
01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:08,691
They will have to live
with that horror every day

1196
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:10,520
for the rest of their lives.

1197
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:14,835
I'm opening the door
to that torment.

1198
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:19,736
To the place where
their punishment truly begins.

1199
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,536
- I like the 9-11.
- Yeah, me too.

1200
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:29,332
I like the little guy though.

1201
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:31,024
That's, uh, that's personal.

1202
01:21:32,094 --> 01:21:33,233
Personal?

1203
01:21:56,014 --> 01:21:58,534
I mean, it was just like
you said it'd be out there.

1204
01:21:59,949 --> 01:22:02,710
Plastic people everywhere.

1205
01:22:02,745 --> 01:22:04,885
But I belong here with you.

1206
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:09,648
Well, then get ready to fight.

1207
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:20,590
Now we put the piggy
in the chair.

1208
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:22,351
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1209
01:22:22,385 --> 01:22:24,042
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1210
01:22:24,077 --> 01:22:25,768
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1211
01:22:25,802 --> 01:22:26,987
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1212
01:22:27,011 --> 01:22:28,333
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1213
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:29,748
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1214
01:22:29,772 --> 01:22:31,094
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1215
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:32,475
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1216
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:33,983
- Who's the piggy?
- Who's the piggy?

1217
01:22:34,018 --> 01:22:35,305
- Kill the piggy.
- Kill the piggy!

1218
01:22:35,329 --> 01:22:36,813
- Kill the piggy.
- Kill the piggy!

1219
01:22:36,848 --> 01:22:38,170
- Kill the piggy.
- Kill the piggy!

1220
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:40,438
Now imagine we just yanked
this piggy out of his car.

1221
01:22:40,472 --> 01:22:42,416
I want you to look at him and I want you to stare at him

1222
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,407
and I want you to scare him
to death!

1223
01:22:48,032 --> 01:22:49,975
Now we could tie him up
and we could scare the piggy

1224
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:51,218
into willing us
all of his money.

1225
01:22:51,242 --> 01:22:52,933
We could kill his family
in front of him

1226
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,866
but I need you
to give this gift to me.

1227
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,903
Are you willing
to die for me, Tex?

1228
01:22:57,938 --> 01:23:00,285
Are you willing
to let me kill you?

1229
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,460
Yeah, Charlie.

1230
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:05,014
Charlie, you can kill me.

1231
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:07,465
You can kill me. I'm ready.

1232
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:11,952
I'm ready.

1233
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,919
We put the piggy in the chair.

1234
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,690
You can kill me, Charlie.

1235
01:23:25,724 --> 01:23:27,347
- I can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1236
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:29,038
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1237
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:30,626
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1238
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,110
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1239
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,698
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1240
01:23:33,732 --> 01:23:35,055
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me.

1241
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:36,632
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me!

1242
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,058
- We can kill you.
- You can kill me!

1243
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:39,945
- We can kill you!
- You can kill me!

1244
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,199
- We can kill you!
- You can kill me!

1245
01:23:41,223 --> 01:23:42,776
- We can kill you!
- You can kill me!

1246
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:50,025
Tex Watson's gone.

1247
01:23:51,785 --> 01:23:53,338
He doesn't exist anymore.

1248
01:23:55,306 --> 01:23:57,032
Now there's just this.

1249
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:01,312
A body named Tex

1250
01:24:01,346 --> 01:24:03,521
that carries around
a little piece of Charlie.

1251
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:07,352
A little piece of the infinite.

1252
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,052
It's Charlie Manson, baby.

1253
01:24:17,086 --> 01:24:18,363
Yeah, for Terry.

1254
01:24:19,882 --> 01:24:22,781
Yeah, well, I can call back,
but..

1255
01:24:22,816 --> 01:24:24,887
Yeah, man, I dig.
That's cool. I can call back.

1256
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:26,406
That's no problem. Alright.

1257
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,426
You think I don't know
you're there, Terry?

1258
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:37,417
You think I don't know
you're there?

1259
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:38,670
I'll burn your fucking eyes out

1260
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:39,660
with this fucking cigarette.

1261
01:24:39,695 --> 01:24:41,283
You fucking weasel fuck.

1262
01:25:11,554 --> 01:25:13,038
Oh.

1263
01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:15,455
Hello. Welcome. Do I know you?

1264
01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:18,389
Uh, no, no,
I'm just looking for Terry.

1265
01:25:18,423 --> 01:25:20,839
Terry Melcher.
I've been to a few parties here.

1266
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:23,256
- Hey, have I met you before?
- No.

1267
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,395
Well, um..

1268
01:25:25,706 --> 01:25:28,744
...Terry moved to Malibu,
so he's not here.

1269
01:25:28,778 --> 01:25:31,264
But are you a friend of Terry's?

1270
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:34,853
- Please come in if you want.
- No, no, thank you.

1271
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:44,932
Okay. Goodnight.

1272
01:25:44,967 --> 01:25:46,071
Goodnight.

1273
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:01,811
- Thank you.
- Well, of course.

1274
01:26:01,846 --> 01:26:04,400
...world-famous director
Roman Polanski.

1275
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:06,989
Beautiful Sharon Tate
had no way of knowing

1276
01:26:07,023 --> 01:26:09,440
the horrific tragedy
that would soon befall her.

1277
01:26:09,474 --> 01:26:11,787
I can feel very alone
at a party

1278
01:26:11,821 --> 01:26:13,927
on the set or in general

1279
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:16,585
if I'm not in harmony
with the things around me.

1280
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,726
I'm very sensitive
to ugly situations.

1281
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,037
I'm quick to read people

1282
01:26:21,072 --> 01:26:23,661
and I pick up
if someone's reacting to me

1283
01:26:23,695 --> 01:26:25,835
as just a sexy blond.

1284
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,285
Times like those, I freeze.

1285
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,631
Lord Jesus..

1286
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,357
Who would you like to be
in your next life?

1287
01:26:30,392 --> 01:26:32,463
I open up the door to my heart.

1288
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:36,087
Please come in
and forgive my sins.

1289
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:39,539
No!

1290
01:26:41,023 --> 01:26:42,197
Dig.

1291
01:26:44,854 --> 01:26:46,960
The time is now, man.
Helter Skelter.

1292
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:48,513
You go into Terry Melcher's
old house

1293
01:26:48,548 --> 01:26:50,860
and you make it look like
blackie's work.

1294
01:26:59,559 --> 01:27:01,537
Couple of weeks ago, me and Mary went on an acid run

1295
01:27:01,561 --> 01:27:03,977
in Hollywood, you know.

1296
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:06,773
Even though they gave us this,
this really special stuff

1297
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:08,809
called Orange Sunshine.

1298
01:27:08,844 --> 01:27:10,328
And when we got outside

1299
01:27:10,363 --> 01:27:12,365
we were convinced
that we were invisible.

1300
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,197
Yeah. So we hitched a ride
over the Canyon, right

1301
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,441
and the driver, all of a sudden,
he just jerks around

1302
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:21,212
and he starts screaming
at us, you know, like

1303
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,790
"Who are you? What the fuck
are you doing to my car?"

1304
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:26,310
So we realized

1305
01:27:26,344 --> 01:27:28,829
that we actually were invisible

1306
01:27:28,864 --> 01:27:31,487
and what Charlie said was true.

1307
01:27:31,522 --> 01:27:33,696
Once you burn every thought
out of your head..

1308
01:27:35,491 --> 01:27:38,460
...there's nothing left
for anyone else to see.

1309
01:27:38,494 --> 01:27:41,256
So we were staring
into the setting sun..

1310
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,431
...and..

1311
01:27:44,466 --> 01:27:46,399
...it felt like we were looking
right at God.

1312
01:27:47,607 --> 01:27:49,056
And I realized..

1313
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:52,553
...I realized that the closer
the sun got to setting

1314
01:27:52,577 --> 01:27:55,994
the closer I knew
the end of the world was.

1315
01:27:56,029 --> 01:27:58,169
What Charlie said was true.

1316
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:00,930
The apocalypse is at hand
and the present world is dying.

1317
01:28:02,622 --> 01:28:06,177
From then on, I haven't had
a trace of doubt in my mind.

1318
01:28:06,211 --> 01:28:08,490
It's coming down
and it's coming down fast.

1319
01:28:33,756 --> 01:28:35,240
Please.

1320
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:37,588
Please, just take me with you.

1321
01:28:37,622 --> 01:28:40,349
Please just let me live
to have my baby.

1322
01:28:45,596 --> 01:28:46,804
Please.

1323
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:53,673
Kill her.

1324
01:28:59,195 --> 01:29:00,438
No, no, no.

1325
01:29:01,888 --> 01:29:04,718
Adorned with bright,
shiny things

1326
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:08,688
I see that as something
totally pure and beautiful.

1327
01:29:08,722 --> 01:29:10,424
And what do you make
of some of the dark subjects

1328
01:29:10,448 --> 01:29:11,622
in your husband's films?

1329
01:29:11,656 --> 01:29:13,520
Everything that's realistic

1330
01:29:13,555 --> 01:29:15,833
has some sort
of ugliness in it.

1331
01:29:15,867 --> 01:29:18,456
Even a flower is ugly
when it wilts..

1332
01:29:18,491 --> 01:29:21,114
Sadie, can you, please,
turn it down?

1333
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,668
The ocean
when it becomes violent.

1334
01:29:26,326 --> 01:29:28,880
Was informative

1335
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:30,434
interesting

1336
01:29:30,468 --> 01:29:32,919
but so graphic.

1337
01:29:32,953 --> 01:29:35,266
I saw Lulu blushing
when she was reading it.

1338
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,509
I wasn't.

1339
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:39,557
Karlene, don't take this
the wrong way

1340
01:29:39,581 --> 01:29:41,962
but are you a lesbian?

1341
01:29:41,997 --> 01:29:44,033
This seems kind of like
a lesbian book.

1342
01:29:45,241 --> 01:29:47,209
No, I'm not, Susan.

1343
01:29:47,243 --> 01:29:49,798
Oh. I'm sorry.

1344
01:29:50,971 --> 01:29:52,007
And glad.

1345
01:29:53,457 --> 01:29:56,563
It's against the Lord's way
and I would worry for you.

1346
01:29:56,598 --> 01:29:59,808
Well, we will have to agree
to disagree there.

1347
01:30:02,155 --> 01:30:04,675
You can tell us if you are.

1348
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:07,643
I won't pass judgment on you.

1349
01:30:07,678 --> 01:30:10,543
It's just that
you dress that way

1350
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:12,890
and you never talk
about your husband, so..

1351
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,825
My husband and I split up
a year ago.

1352
01:30:18,723 --> 01:30:22,278
I don't like... talking
about him much.

1353
01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:23,452
He's not a good man.

1354
01:30:23,487 --> 01:30:24,833
I never saw you as someone

1355
01:30:24,867 --> 01:30:27,007
who would be with a bad man.

1356
01:30:29,562 --> 01:30:32,806
There are a lot of things
about all of you

1357
01:30:32,841 --> 01:30:35,430
that I would never guess
from looking at you.

1358
01:30:37,328 --> 01:30:40,055
Like, did you really believe

1359
01:30:40,089 --> 01:30:43,955
that you were going to find
an underground cave

1360
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:46,613
and live that way
during the revolution?

1361
01:30:48,753 --> 01:30:52,377
So much of what you've told me
doesn't make logical sense.

1362
01:30:53,758 --> 01:30:55,898
How would you survive in a cave?

1363
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,080
We wanted to believe
something big was gonna happen.

1364
01:31:07,669 --> 01:31:08,773
I mean..

1365
01:31:11,293 --> 01:31:14,296
Do you remember in 1969..

1366
01:31:15,815 --> 01:31:18,162
...it really felt like
there was gonna be

1367
01:31:18,196 --> 01:31:21,234
a huge cosmic shift

1368
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:23,478
and things were never
gonna be the same?

1369
01:31:25,928 --> 01:31:28,862
Like there was
gonna be some big thing

1370
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:30,864
that was gonna
change everything?

1371
01:31:32,038 --> 01:31:33,798
Come on, Karlene..

1372
01:31:35,006 --> 01:31:36,594
...you were there.

1373
01:31:37,699 --> 01:31:39,666
Didn't it feel that way to you?

1374
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:41,944
Yeah, it did.

1375
01:31:44,395 --> 01:31:46,984
It felt that way
to most people I know.

1376
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,265
But it didn't make them
kill strangers.

1377
01:31:54,405 --> 01:31:55,958
But we had to.

1378
01:31:59,272 --> 01:32:00,894
It was for..

1379
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:03,759
For what?

1380
01:32:05,727 --> 01:32:07,522
What was it for?

1381
01:32:18,602 --> 01:32:19,810
My hand hurts.

1382
01:32:23,192 --> 01:32:25,505
The... the knife didn't have
a proper handle

1383
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,576
and it just kept hitting
the bone.

1384
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:34,134
So it's all going down
like Charlie said?

1385
01:32:36,447 --> 01:32:37,448
Yeah..

1386
01:32:39,243 --> 01:32:40,485
It's pretty heavy.

1387
01:32:41,763 --> 01:32:43,834
But... but it's like
Charlie said.

1388
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:47,354
"If you love everything

1389
01:32:47,389 --> 01:32:51,048
then you don't have to think
about things." Right?

1390
01:32:52,325 --> 01:32:54,499
- Right on.
- Okay.

1391
01:32:58,365 --> 01:33:02,024
- What was it like?
- The people were very young.

1392
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:05,959
It didn't seem right.

1393
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:11,413
But it was the right thing
to do.

1394
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,073
Charlie asked me to do it
and I did it.

1395
01:33:17,281 --> 01:33:20,008
No ego. No trip.

1396
01:33:20,042 --> 01:33:21,986
Charlie taught us that death
and life are the same thing

1397
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:24,564
so there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1398
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,670
You can't be afraid
if you don't exist.

1399
01:33:31,433 --> 01:33:32,468
Yeah.

1400
01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:57,148
Honey, can you rub my feet

1401
01:33:57,183 --> 01:33:58,667
just for a minute?

1402
01:33:58,702 --> 01:34:00,635
It's always just for a minute.

1403
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,881
That will be Cory letting us
know she got in okay.

1404
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:18,929
Get up.

1405
01:34:21,725 --> 01:34:23,658
Stand over here.
Last night was too messy.

1406
01:34:23,692 --> 01:34:26,695
Tonight we're gonna go out
and we're gonna get it right.

1407
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:27,869
Uh-huh?

1408
01:34:32,736 --> 01:34:34,185
I wanna go.

1409
01:34:37,913 --> 01:34:40,122
You come along then.

1410
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,354
Well..

1411
01:35:09,186 --> 01:35:11,084
...there's two people in there.

1412
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:13,880
I got them ready for ya.

1413
01:35:15,226 --> 01:35:17,332
They're calm.
Don't freak them out.

1414
01:35:19,644 --> 01:35:21,232
Do something witchy.

1415
01:35:23,959 --> 01:35:25,892
And find your own way home.

1416
01:35:40,286 --> 01:35:41,805
What are you gonna do?

1417
01:35:41,839 --> 01:35:44,186
You're gonna kill us,
aren't you?

1418
01:35:44,221 --> 01:35:47,051
Did he say to kill them?
- You're gonna kill us.

1419
01:35:54,058 --> 01:35:55,784
Please, don't do this.

1420
01:35:55,819 --> 01:35:57,096
Where's my wife?

1421
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:58,856
I have a chest full of money
at the store.

1422
01:35:58,891 --> 01:36:02,066
Please. No! No! No! No! No!

1423

Go!

1429
01:36:31,268 --> 01:36:33,270

Come on now, Lulu.

1441
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,343
Charlie says
everyone has to do something.

1442
01:39:08,321 --> 01:39:10,461
It was all for nothing.

1443
01:39:23,371 --> 01:39:26,132
We did those horrible things
for nothing.

1444
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:28,307
Lulu, we did what we had to do.

1445
01:39:30,447 --> 01:39:32,690
Call me Leslie now, please.

My name is Leslie.

1447
01:39:44,012 --> 01:39:46,083
We didn't have to do any of it.

1448
01:39:49,259 --> 01:39:50,812
But we did.

1449
01:39:55,506 --> 01:39:56,956
And why?

1450
01:40:03,445 --> 01:40:06,379
Do you know why, Katie?

1451
01:40:09,762 --> 01:40:10,866
Sadie?

1452
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:14,732
Why did we do those things?

1453
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,053
Jimmy?

1454
01:40:25,088 --> 01:40:27,090
Jimmy, can I get out, please?

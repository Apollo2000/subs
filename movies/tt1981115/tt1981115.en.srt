
6
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:08,783
Malekith.

7
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,660
Asgard's forces are upon us.

10
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,689
Send in the Cursed!

19
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:57,642
Their deaths will
mean our survival.

20
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,103
This war is far from over.

250
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,804
The Aether awakens us.

251
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:06,433
The Convergence returns.

347
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,525
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

348
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,737
I can barely remember a
time before the light.

349
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:38,658
Our survival will
be your legacy.

350
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:44,347
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

351
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:45,681
I will reclaim the Aether.

352
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:47,016
I will restore our world.

353
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,752
And I will put an end to
this poisoned universe.

420
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:26,969
The worlds are nearly aligned.

421
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,143
You will be the
last of the Kursed.

422
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:36,937
Let my life be sacrificed.

423
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:40,608
It is no less than
our people did,

424
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,443
or you have done.

425
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,203
You will become darkness,

426
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:57,124
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

427
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:06,258
Until then, no power our
enemies possess can stop you.

428
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:16,143
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

542
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:06,022
Heal. You will need your
strength to reclaim the Aether.

543
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:10,109
And when you wake, we
will kill them all.

763
01:08:16,056 --> 01:08:19,393
We must strike now.

764
01:08:20,435 --> 01:08:21,436
No.

765
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:28,694
Asgard is meaningless.

766
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:34,825
The Aether has found
its way home.

1127

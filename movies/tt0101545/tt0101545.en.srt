2
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,700
That wasn't a store robbery.

3
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,802
That was an assassination.

4
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,173
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

5
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:48,542
How do I know?

6
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:52,213
I spent a little time with
the FBI's
organized crime unit.

7
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,548
I guess you could say that
I'm intimately knowledgeable

8
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,617
with the seedy and rancorous
workings of the mob

9
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,287
in the Midwest
section of this country.

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,422
I know a gangland
slaying when I see one,

11
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,524
and that's exactly
what this baby is.

12
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,361
I'd look into it
myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.

13
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,164
Think I'll take
the private jet out

14
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,800
and fly to Spain,
pick up the little lady.

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,636
Do the subsonic tummy
bump at 30,000 feet.

16
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,472
Then glide back into the U.S.
of A. By dawn.

17
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:23,177
I know what you're gonna say,
"Jim. Jim Dodge, settle down.

18
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,446
"Relax. You owe it to
yourself."

19
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,581
I'll tell you what I
tell everybody else.

20
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:31,585
Any little Fraulein that
expects anything more from me

21
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,287
than a little bit of pleasure
and a little bit of danger

22
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,489
and a great set of pectorals,

23
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,425
she's looking for
a fall right on her ass.

24
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,232
Hubie, Hubie, Hubie, Hubie!

25
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,234
Get out of here!
Let me tell you something.

26
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,736
If you know
what's good for you,
don't you ever come back!

27
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,038
Wait a minute, now, Hubie.

28
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,674
You're not gonna find someone
who has the relationship
with those animals

29
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,443
that I do.

30
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,178
Listen to the dogs, Hubie.
They love me!

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,783
It all started when I was 15.

32
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,819
That's when I invented
the artificial cow heart.

33
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,556
Oh, that was a big thing.

34
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,792
A little before your time,
but it made all
the newspapers,

35
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,528
ABC, NBC, CBS,
they all picked up on it,

36
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,798
but it's more or less
a hobby for me, boys.

37
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,001
Scoot over!

38
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,437
Actually,

39
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:28,442
today I decided that I've gone
just about as far I can go

40
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,611
in the animal
health-care business.

41
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,814
But that's your question.
The reason that I'm not
at work this afternoon,

42
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:38,652
is because I was made an offer
that I simply cannot refuse.
I sold.

43
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,454
Whatcha gonna do
with the cash, Jim?

44
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,423
I don't know. Maybe
I'll invest it overseas.

45
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,458
I've got some projects
in eastern Europe right now.

46
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,294
I don't know. I've got
everything a man needs.

47
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:49,330
Jim, you just bought
the animal hospital.

48
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,865
How come you sold it so fast?

49
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,969
Tax problem.

50
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,472
And here's my
accountant right now.

51
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,808
Earl, take a bow.

52
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,011
20 minutes for lunch, okay?
Go buy another suit.

53
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,347
He works for me.

54
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,616
He's scouting some
real estate for me right now.

55
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,018
Yeah,
but the market's real tight.

56
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,424
I like the new uniform,
Lorraine.

57
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,028
You know, with
the right shoes and handbag,

58
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,397
that might be suitable
for a cocktail party.

59
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,434
So... Question.

60
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,803
When in
the world are you going
to start serving sashimi?

61
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,805
Maybe when I
find out what it is.

62
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,744
You've
never heard of sashimi?

63
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,912
You've got to be kidding.

64
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,350
It's this special
Japanese fish you eat raw.

65
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,817
With a little butter sauce,

66
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,887
and you're ready
to go to heaven.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,925
I'd hire you in a minute
if I hadn't already
fired you so many times.

68
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,662
Did you ever
think of leaving town?

69
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,032
Thousands of people
over in St. Louis...

70
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,370
Got no idea how
full of shit you are.

71
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,641
You've been alive for
21 years, my friend.

72
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:11,812
Plenty of time for most people
to find a place
for themselves.

73
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,916
Well,
I'm not like everybody else.

74
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,586
You know what I'm saying?

75
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,688
Yeah, that's for sure.

76
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,526
How about if I...

77
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,728
I work for you for free?

78
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,032
No.

79
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,635
I'm afraid not, Jimmy.

80
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,938
Think about St. Louis.

81
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,008
Hey, Josie.
- Hi.

82
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,410
Fill her up?

83
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,577
Fill her up.

84
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,732
How you doin'?

85
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,451
You got fired again,
didn't you? Didn't you?

86
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,018
Yeah.

87
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,520
Who told you that?

88
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,856
Hubie Marshall
called me at work.

89
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,991
He called you at work?

90
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,862
That's it. Okay,
I'm gonna... I'll speak...
What'd he say?

91
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,731
He said he fired ya!

92
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,033
He said that?
And you believed him?

93
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,502
Damn straight I do!

94
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:46,874
With all due respect, Dad,
you're Mr. Gullible,
sometimes.

95
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,042
The truth of the matter is,
Dad, I resigned.

96
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,144
I'll tell you
something else, Dad.

97
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,179
Shut up, Jimmy!

98
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,548
When I took the job,
I had no idea

99
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:57,585
it was gonna be
a hire-fire situation.

100
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,953
Luther Betenhauser's boy
is doing much better.

101
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,188
What's wrong with him?

102
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,623
Fell off his
grandfather's silo.

103
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,891
He's got brain damage.

104
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,092
He does not.

105
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,794
He does, too.

106
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,629
Hoover Fey says his
tongue's gonna hang out

107
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,197
the side of his mouth
the rest of his life.

108
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,032
And when he dies
and they bury him,

109
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,502
at the funeral they're
gonna put a mask on him.

110
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,837
Do I have to listen to
this while I'm eating?

111
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,607
Let's talk about
something else.

112
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,080
Josie McClellan
moved to New York.

113
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,050
She did not. I saw her today.

114
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,052
Well,
I don't know how you could.

115
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,022
I heard at the bank
that she got tired
of taking care of her father,

116
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,423
and she told him
to jump in a lake,

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,893
and then she left for New York
to get her MBA in
high-fashion design

118
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,630
at the University
of New York City.

119
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,233
I just saw her down
at the gas station
in living color.

120
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,936
We had a cup of java together.

121
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,006
Well,
I'm gonna take Lou Selby's
word over yours any day.

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,810
Lou Selby.
Lou Selby's a drunk.

123
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,647
You know, for a guy who's just
lost his umpteenth job,

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,615
you sure are handy
with the tongue sword.

125
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,684
You got canned again?

126
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,686
Well, he didn't get canned.

127
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,755
He got fired.

128
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,924
That's gotta be
some kind of a record.

129
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,230
Not only are you
an obnoxious slug,

130
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,067
but you're
a freeloading obnoxious slug.

131
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,969
Well, you should talk.

132
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,137
What are you?
In your mid-forties
and still living at home.

133
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,275
I'm 24, and I pay rent.

134
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,077
So do I.

135
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,144
You did pay rent.

136
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,583
Dad, you mean
you're cutting my rent?

137
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,651
Hell, no!

138
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,252
You're not paying a rent
'cause you don't have a job

139
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,554
and you don't have any money.

140
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,691
You're out of school
and you live in this house,
you pay rent!

141
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,813
Jim! Yo, Jim!

142
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,848
Jim, wake up!

143
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,017
Hey, get up!

144
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,254
Get up!

145
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,929
You know, getting this job,

146
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,031
restoring your
faith and pride in me

147
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,099
is a number-one
priority right now, Dad.

148
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,603
Priority ought to be making
something of yourself.

149
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,171
That's right up there.

150
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,342
When I was your age,
I couldn't wait to get
out of my folks' house.

151
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,946
I love living at home.

152
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,993
I don't think this is such
a great place for
me to work, Dad.

153
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,264
Okay,

154
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,600
say I don't get this job,
hypothetically.

155
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,770
Are you gonna be upset?

156
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:06,073
You don't get this job,
you're on a bus to St. Louis.

157
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,908
St. Louis?

158
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,678
Uncle Jeff's offered
to put you to work
in his garden shop.

159
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,412
I don't know
anything about gardening.

160
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,948
You will learn!

161
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,251
I'm getting
a distinct feeling that
you want me out of your life.

162
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,254
I don't want you
out of my life.
I want you out of my house.

163
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,892
Wow.
Out!

164
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,727
Okay, okay, okay.

165
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,345
Are you
sure I can't offer you
a coffee and a bear claw?

166
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,980
No, thanks.

167
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,782
They're very good,
they're fresh.

168
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,383
No, I'm fine.

169
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,219
You don't want one,
and I don't need one.

170
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,222
Right!

171
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,656
I love the darn things,
though, I tell you.

172
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,292
You know, I got a sweet tooth,
I could eat those
things by the dozen.

173
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,061
By the looks of it, I have.

174
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,763
Right.

175
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,299
I tell ya, I'm so excited
that you're considering

176
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,902
joining the Target team.
We all are.

177
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,872
I appreciate that.

178
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,275
Good, then, let's cut
right to the chase, shall we?

179
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,947
We're prepared to
offer you $42,500 a year,

180
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,049
with a full benefit package.

181
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,885
That's dental, medical,

182
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,987
profit sharing, pension,

183
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,857
expense account,
car allowance,

184
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,792
vacation, of course,

185
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:35,095
and any and all
relocating expenses.

186
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:39,699
This is our first,
best, and last offer.
What do you think?

187
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,369
Well...

188
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,739
C.D., with all due respect,

189
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,307
I came in here

190
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,210
with the number 45
in my mind, and...

191
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,196
Hmm.

192
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,968
You've got me.

193
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,470
45 it is.

194
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,407
Welcome aboard.

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,942
Thank you.

196
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,076
I'd like to buy you lunch.

197
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,211
No, no, no.

198
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,546
Your money's no good here.
Lunch is mine, all right?

199
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,148
I'm not going to
argue with you.

200
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,516
You better not.
I'm bigger than you are.

201
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,086
Hang on a second, will you?
I told her to hold my calls.

202
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,521
Get it.

203
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,123
Yeah, Peg. Uh-huh.

204
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,827
No, it's okay.

205
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,261
No, he's right here
with me now.

206
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,863
Hi, Peg.

207
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,098
We just closed the deal.
Uh-huh.

208
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:49,302
Oh, it was a slam-dunk, too.
I got him for 45.

209
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,276
No, he's right here.

210
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,413
What do you mean,
he missed the plane?

211
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,218
Then who the hell
am I talking to?

212
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,156
Oh, Lord!

213
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,161
I'll, uh...
I'll get back to you.

214
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,464
Hey, I know a great
little Italian place

215
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,400
that has the best
pasta primatonis in the...

216
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,269
Excuse me a minute,
will you, please?

217
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,837
Lovely wife you have there.

218
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,138
Dodge, James?

219
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,074
Mmm-hmm.

220
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,479
James, I'm afraid we have
a little
misunderstanding here.

221
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,215
You see, I thought you
came in for the, uh...

222
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,485
Operations Manager's job.

223
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,054
I have you down here
as night cleanup boy.

224
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,193
Well, I'm a little overpaid

225
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,096
for night cleanup boy,
wouldn't you say, C.D.?

226
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:54,935
The truth is, James,
I can offer you
$4.44 per hour.

227
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,341
Uh, four, four... $4.44...

228
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,176
$4.44.

229
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,145
What about the benefits?

230
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,447
Two fifteen-minute breaks
and a half hour for lunch.

231
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,619
And the title is,
uh, night cleanup boy?

232
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,621
Yes.

233
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,092
I'll take it.

234
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,194
Oh, and, uh, lose the curl.

235
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,898
Welcome to the Target team.
Thank you.

236
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,903
So the parrot says,
"Of course, I can talk.
Can you fly?"

237
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,211
I don't want any damn Japanese
automobile plant in this town.

238
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,083
It means jobs.

239
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,186
I don't need a job.

240
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,222
Your governor's tryin' to use
my town as a political chip.

241
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,623
Gentlemen, I resent that.

242
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:54,928
Well, there could be some
specific benefits
for you personally.

243
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,567
Josie!

244
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,405
Yeah?
Come here.

245
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,541
I want you to
meet these gentlemen
from the governor's office.

246
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,012
Come on in here, honey.

247
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,963
Honey, I want you
to meet Bill, uh...

248
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,198
Uh, Bob.

249
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,167
Uh, Bob Bosenbeck.

250
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,571
Bob.

251
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,655
Dave.

252
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,228
My pleasure, Dave.

253
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,964
Right.
Dave Hockner.

254
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,169
I don't want to
interrupt your meeting.

255
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,238
Very nice to meet both of you.

256
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,306
Bye.

257
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,042
Bye.

258
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,548
Josie?

259
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,517
Josie!

260
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,395
You pull another
stunt like you did today,

261
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,231
I'll beat the livin'
daylights outta you!

262
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,620
All right, out!

263
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:07,727
Out of here, man.
Get out of here!

264
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,828
Get out of the car!

265
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,683
Right on time!

266
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,123
Everything's going as planned.

267
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,425
You ordered a limousine?

268
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,095
Of course.

269
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,264
My first day at work.

270
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,334
How's it gonna look
if my dad drives me?

271
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,402
A little treat to
myself for getting the job.

272
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,304
It was only 50 bucks.

273
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,208
Right on time, Henry.

274
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,743
Yes, sir.

275
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,545
Henry, the sign...

276
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,280
Very well, sir.

277
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,585
Ciao!

278
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,594
Hey, Jim, where are you going?

279
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,165
Hello, boys.

280
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,533
Going to Paris on an F-14.

281
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,436
Got a little peace meeting
with the Vice-President
of Bulgaria.

282
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,306
Business, you know?
Then I'm going to Venice,

283
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,841
for a big spaghetti dinner
with the princess of Austria.

284
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,578
A beautiful lady...
Really big bones.

285
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,414
Remember to brush
your teeth, Melvin!

286
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,584
You, too, Sidney! Adios!

287
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,155
Jim is so cool!

288
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,642
Bobby.

289
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,746
Got a loose tile here.
First thing in the morning,

290
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,316
I want you to take
some epoxy cement
and take care of this.

291
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,418
I don't need a lawsuit, okay?

292
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,820
I've got
enough to worry about.

293
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,823
Who's he?

294
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,525
Attention shoppers.

295
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,993
The store will be
closing in five minutes.

296
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,597
Please bring all your
purchases to the front.
Thank you.

297
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,670
Are you a slacker?

298
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,841
Uh... No, uh, Presbyterian.

299
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,076
What did you say?
What did you say?

300
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,346
I'm askin' you
a simple question.

301
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,548
Are you lazy?
No, sir.

302
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,816
'Cause the last guy
that wore that uniform
was a lazy slacker,

303
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,652
and I fired his no-good butt.

304
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,789
Uh... About the uniform,

305
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,491
will I be getting my own?

306
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,860
You work out,
which I doubt,

307
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,628
you can have
yourself a new name patch.

308
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,403
Eh, uh... Would I be
able to have it laundered?

309
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,372
It smells a little bit
like Darnell.

310
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,375
I don't think you know
who you're messin' with, boy.

311
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,777
Right, after you clean
the ladies' and
men's crappers,

312
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,912
I'm talking about
you'd better be able
to eat off those bowls.

313
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,781
Oh, sure.
You clean my coffeemaker,

314
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,449
then you wax my desk.

315
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,651
Uh, clean what?

316
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,453
You clean my
coffeemaker and wax my desk!

317
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,489
I got it!

318
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,657
You, uh, sweep the aisles,
startin' with
health and beauty,

319
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,559
and you work your way over
to juniors and misses.

320
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,529
Ups and downs, leaving your
debris in the cross aisles.

321
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:10,663
So I start with
health and beauty...

322
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,731
What did I just say?

323
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,966
I just said to start
with health and beauty, okay?

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,668
Then you do your cross aisles.

325
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,537
That'll bring your
dustbin into play.

326
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,772
You take the debris.
You load it into the dustbin.

327
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,675
You take the dustbin out
to the loading dock area

328
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,611
and you empty it
into the receptacle.

329
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,845
You got that? Easy as pie.

330
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,547
Yeah.

331
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,549
Now, I was employed
for a brief period
at Del Taco, and...

332
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,419
I don't care about your
Del Taco experiences, boy.

333
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,821
All right. Now,
we've got this little problem
in this store with grazers.

334
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,656
You know what
a grazer is, boy?

335
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,825
Is that some
sort of farm term?

336
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,660
A grazer is
a customer or an employee

337
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,429
that eats off the shelves,
okay?

338
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,097
Sort of similar
to a cow grazing
in a field of grass.

339
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,800
Only this isn't
a field of grass, okay,
and you're not a cow.

340
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,503
There's no eatin'.
You're not being
paid to eat, so don't!

341
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,871
You got any questions?

342
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,406
Not right offhand, no.

343
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,807
You think you can handle it?

344
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,142
Oh, I'll give it
the old college try.

345
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,810
Don't touch me!

346
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,113
Well,
despite our age difference,

347
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,449
I think I'm really gonna
enjoy working with you.

348
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,017
Let's get
something straight, boy.
You ain't workin' with me.

349
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,986
You're working for me.

350
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,722
Still,
I think it's gonna be fun
being around you.

351
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:10,990
Yeah, I ain't gonna
be anywhere near you.

352
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,793
I'm gonna be home
pumping the pasties
out of Colleen Jackson.

353
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,127
You're not going to be here?

354
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,596
Hell, no.

355
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,834
I'm gonna be here by myself?

356
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,605
Yeah, that's right!
And you'd better stay out
of the ladies' undergoods.

357
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,543
Wait a minute.
Nobody told me
I'd be here alone.

358
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,878
What are you doing?

359
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,179
Saving money.

360
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,147
Wait a minute. Are you
turning off the lights?

361
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,750
In 25 seconds, you got light
in every third aisle.

362
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,951
When the sun
comes up, you turn off

363
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:39,886
all the lights.
You understand?

364
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,023
No, I don't understand.
Just hold on a second!

365
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,858
I'm locking you in.

366
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:49,128
When I come back
at 7:00 to open up,
I'll let you out.

367
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,566
You're locking me in?

368
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,034
What do you take
me for, a fool?

369
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,638
Nobody gets a set of keys
on their first night. Nobody!

370
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,607
Now, get to work!

371
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,575
What if there's a fire?

372
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,843
Then the fire
department will come.

373
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:05,845
I could perish!

374
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,013
Boo!

375
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,817
You can't do this.
I'm locked in,
alone, in the dark.

376
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,852
That was not a part
of my employment agreement.

377
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:26,793
Ah!

378
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,692
9:17?

379
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,963
Time for a break.

380
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,923
Hello.

381
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,860
Anybody out there?

382
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:09,829
When I accepted the...

383
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:13,032
The post of President,
grand Pooh-Bah of Target,

384
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,336
realizing that I have brought

385
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,940
meaningfulness and
peace and happiness,

386
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,209
into the lives of
thousands of people.

387
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,713
Jim Dodge, of Monroe,

388
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,715
top moneymaker on the tour.

389
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,117
His father's here today,
Bud Dodge,

390
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,019
and sister Penny,
a sad, sad story,

391
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:36,122
was just admitted to
university hospital.

392
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,992
While trying to pop a zit,
her head
mysteriously exploded.

393
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,085
Dad! Hi!

394
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,020
Jim,
do you know what time it is?

395
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,924
You know,
I'm starting to think
about Christmas and gifts,

396
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:15,294
because I'm in a big store
and I'm starting to
get a lot of gift ideas.

397
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,763
Hi.

398
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,197
Mom, hi!

399
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,166
How's it going?

400
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,302
Well, I finished
all my janitor stuff,
I've finished most of it.

401
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,204
I've got to save
some stuff for later.

402
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,273
But it's easy as hell.

403
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,042
Um, honey, it's a little late.

404
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:33,112
Yeah, it is kind of late.
Well, sleep tight.

405
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,482
See you in the morning.

406
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,117
Love you, too.

407
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,457
Mr. James Dodge!

408
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,416
Oh. He can't be happy
as the night cleanup boy.

409
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,087
Sweetheart...

410
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,523
He wants us to
call him a janitor.

411
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,330
Maybe I should have spent
less time harping
and more time helping.

412
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,567
Harpin' and helpin' him what?

413
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:07,139
Harpin' on him to leave,
and helpin' him become the...

414
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:10,209
Good, mature,
productive person he could be.

415
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,134
Are you all right?

416
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,604
Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

417
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,638
And you?

418
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,675
What are you doing here?

419
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,645
I work here.

420
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,614
Have a good one, Officer Don.

421
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,585
Okay, Carl. Keep in touch.
Let me know if
you hear anything.

422
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,220
You bet.

423
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:05,424
Well, sir,
she didn't leave on the bus.

424
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,594
Apparently, she isn't here.
Let's go look for
her someplace else.

425
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,131
She wouldn't be dumb
enough to thumb, would she?

426
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,534
Does she have any friends
that she might
have run off with?

427
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,603
Boyfriends?

428
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:21,407
Would you just get in the car
so we can go look
for the girl, please?

429
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,442
I'm tired,
I had to get out of the bed,

430
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,477
I haven't had any coffee.
I don't feel good.

431
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:26,979
My daughter, I don't know
where the hell she is.

432
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,580
And you're
standing by the car there,

433
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,449
sounding like some goddamn
preacher or something!

434
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,151
Come on. Get in the car!

435
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,154
Prick.

436
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,294
Are you sure you
didn't hurt yourself?

437
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:45,064
Oh, no. Are you kidding?

438
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,499
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

439
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,035
Can I ask what you were doing?

440
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,037
Uh...
Oh, I was roller-skating.

441
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,472
I know, but why?

442
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,574
Oh, why not?

443
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:59,311
I got bored. One thing
led to another and...

444
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:02,414
And I'm roller-skating
in my shorts.

445
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,616
Better question would be,
"What are you doing here?"

446
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,186
Shopping.

447
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,688
Well, we've been
closed for five hours.

448
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,091
Yeah. I fell asleep.

449
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,492
While shopping?

450
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,194
No,
in the ladies' dressing room.

451
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:18,664
That makes no sense.
You're
a high-profile young ingenue.

452
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,499
I was debating...
What?

453
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,036
Whether or not to get
arrested for shoplifting.

454
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,173
Doesn't your father own, like,
$10 million worth of
real estate in this town?

455
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,807
Well, it's not my fault.

456
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,609
No, no, I didn't imply such.

457
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,812
It just seems funny
that someone of your...

458
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,614
Wealth?

459
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,349
If you will.
Would be shoplifting...

460
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,718
I didn't do it.
I chickened out.

461
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,455
Would consider shoplifting.

462
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:47,226
It's a long,
dull, self-indulgent,
highly unromantic story

463
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,628
about an overbearing father,

464
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,797
deceased mother and brother

465
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,501
and a completely confused girl
who looks a little like me.

466
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:36,175
I sure am glad you dropped by.

467
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,810
I was getting pretty
tired of being with myself.

468
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,684
I guess...
I guess, I'm what you
call a people person.

469
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,222
What are you cooking?

470
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,357
Uh, Hobo Chicken.

471
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,659
It's a glazed
chicken in wine sauce

472
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,595
with vegetables
and skin-on potatoes.

473
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,730
Silverware... Silverware...

474
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,170
It's only 210 calories.

475
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,405
And I don't know
if you're watching

476
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,574
your figure, but I sure am.

477
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,742
Uh, if you can just
grab a serving spoon

478
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,844
over there,
I think we'll be set.

479
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,419
Uh, keep your
distance from these things.

480
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,588
I think it's safe
to keep five feet.

481
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,728
I think they're about done.

482
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,366
Well,
dining room's right this way.

483
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,570
Mmm!

484
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,540
Mmm. Oh.

485
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,211
I think my father poured
the cement for your pool.

486
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:49,548
He's a cement contractor.
Good man.

487
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,318
Bud Dodge?

488
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,953
My mother works at Hoenicker's
over Christmas, part time.

489
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,855
My sister's
a teller at the bank.

490
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,758
My brother's in grade school.
He's not
employed at the moment.

491
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,561
I used to work at
the animal shelter.

492
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,931
But I was terminated.
And now...
Now I'm working here.

493
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,236
Do you always talk this much?

494
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:15,374
Yeah, I guess I do.

495
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,409
I like talking to people.

496
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,780
I was thinking maybe
you should go into sales.

497
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,181
I've actually tried that.

498
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,824
Some fresh ground pepper?

499
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,360
Please.

500
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,630
Some people don't
like a lot of pepper.

501
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,432
Say when.
That's fine.

502
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,435
I happen to
really like it a lot.

503
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:46,838
I think it enhances
the natural flavor
of the chicken.

504
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,312
I hope you don't
take this the wrong way.

505
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,315
I've had dreams about you.

506
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,450
You've had dreams about me?

507
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,553
Not recently.

508
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,689
I've had dreams
about you in the past.

509
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,292
I've had dreams about
entire cheerleading squads,

510
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:08,360
so don't get me wrong.

511
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,562
It's kid stuff, you know.
How 'bout you?

512
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:11,930
Do I dream?
Mmm.

513
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,368
That's about all I do.

514
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:33,785
Raisin' a kid's hard work.
You got any kids?

515
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,688
No, sir. No, sir.
And from
listening to you talking

516
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,590
and from observin' this,

517
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,760
I'm kinda grateful old Emily
turned up infertile.

518
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,747
Shouldn't you be
cleaning up the store?

519
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,015
I got plenty of time.

520
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,685
Big store.
Huge.

521
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,988
Always smoke cigars?

522
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,959
I enjoy a good one
after a fine meal.

523
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,927
It settles the stomach.

524
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,797
You're the town liar, right?

525
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,870
What?

526
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:28,907
I'm sorry.
That really came out wrong.

527
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,642
I don't see how
something like that
could come out right.

528
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,010
I guess I meant that's
what people call you.

529
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,512
But I didn't mean to imply
that it's actually true.

530
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,680
People are
actually calling me that?

531
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,382
I thought you knew.

532
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,783
Know what?
That I was the town liar?

533
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,984
You didn't?

534
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,051
No. I'm not.

535
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,920
I think that you might have
the wrong information.

536
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,054
I didn't mean to offend you.

537
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:45,857
Did you think that
was a compliment?

538
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,993
No. No. And I apologize.

539
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,696
You know, I can't
repeat things like that.

540
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,365
Don't think about it.
It's all right.

541
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:55,834
As I said, I think you've got
the wrong information.

542
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,836
But, if people
are calling me that,

543
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,539
it's only
because they're small,
cheap, petty, and jealous.

544
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,941
Small towns are notorious
for that kinda thing.

545
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,142
I'm sure
there's a word for me.

546
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,677
Oh, yeah. Sure.

547
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:06,845
What do they call me?

548
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,046
A tease.

549
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,548
Tease?

550
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,785
Yeah, I can see that.

551
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,086
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

552
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,789
Actually, I never teased.

553
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,058
This is becoming amusing.

554
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,960
Who exactly calls me a liar?

555
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,862
Everybody.

556
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,564
Everybody.
No, not everybody.

557
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:26,965
I'm sure there's
some old people in town.

558
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,500
Right.

559
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,508
Well, what do you think?

560
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,009
What do I think?

561
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,880
Do you think I'm a liar?

562
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,015
Well,
I don't know you well enough.

563
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,819
You've known me
for almost 17 years.

564
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,121
We went to the same schools
from kindergarten on up.

565
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,891
I knew of you,
but I didn't
know you personally.

566
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,194
That's always bothered me.

567
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,931
I mean, that old "in-out,
us-them" thing.

568
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,500
That's the way it's been.

569
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:02,834
I know.
It's always bothered me.

570
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,170
Sure, but it's
water over the dam now.

571
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:08,607
Yeah, but it's
your dam and my water.

572
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,442
I got crapped on
a lot of years.

573
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,611
I just meant that
it's in the past.

574
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,481
Well, the present is
a result of the past.

575
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,683
I look at my high
school yearbook,

576
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:20,752
and I don't see
four fabulous years.

577
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,921
Actually, what I'm reminded of
is what it feels like

578
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,023
to have my
underwear yanked up my ass

579
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,526
by some big football player
with arms like
telephone poles.

580
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,928
Okay,
and where are those guys now?

581
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:36,067
I know they're not
working nights at Target.
I'll tell you that.

582
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,904
Yeah. You know,

583
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,906
I look at my yearbook

584
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,142
and I see four fabulous years

585
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,679
that are gonna be
the highlight of my life.

586
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,781
Here's what it's like...

587
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:53,018
First,
you feel a hand going down
the back of your pants

588
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,786
and tighten around
the elastic waistband...

589
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,522
Highlight.

590
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,189
Sometimes I'd
actually see stars.

591
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,958
It's not going
to get any better.

592
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,594
And if I was
particularly unlucky,

593
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,963
my shorts would like
rip completely free

594
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,498
and I would get this
really drastic fabric...

595
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:07,733
Jim? Do you hear me?

596
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:11,837
Yeah.

597
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,877
I don't really care
about a graphic description
of a childhood prank.

598
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,112
Hey, that prank was
a motif in my life.

599
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:29,254
You know,
I'm locked in this store here

600
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,257
because I didn't have
the guts to steal a skirt,

601
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,126
so I could get arrested
and embarrass my father

602
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,796
in this stupid,
desperate, childish,

603
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,931
pathetic
attempt to leave home.

604
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,568
And you
have your underwear
yanked up your ass.

605
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,503
I have my entire
life yanked up my ass.

606
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,274
Well,
you're speaking figuratively.

607
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,543
I was speaking literally.
And you're happy.

608
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:52,744
You know, you're happy.

609
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,581
I'm not happy.

610
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,115
I'm working nights.

611
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,718
Uh,
everybody thinks I'm a liar.

612
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,286
My whole
family's laughing at me.

613
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,655
Reverend Harwell gave me
the finger last week.

614
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:04,956
Okay, okay, you're not happy,

615
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,725
but at least you have
some control over your life.

616
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,694
So do you.
My father controls my life.

617
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,129
You're over 18.

618
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,098
You can tell him to drop dead,
and get on a plane.

619
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,265
So can you.

620
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:15,567
I don't want to.

621
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,070
I like living at home.

622
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:20,305
No, you don't.

623
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,174
What am I, a garden snail?

624
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,277
An involuntary
muscle in a janitor suit?

625
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,046
I,
uh, I know what I want to do.

626
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,616
What could you possibly like

627
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,951
about living at
home at your age?

628
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:37,055
The meals are great.
I mean, there's the, uh...
There's cable.

629
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,827
Um, the accommodations
are excellent, five-star.

630
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,829
What do you care if I'm
living at home or not?

631
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,833
Hey, I didn't come
here to irritate you.

632
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,334
Well, you're beginning to.

633
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,774
Great.
That's really great.

634
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,777
I gotta stop saying
those kinds of things.

635
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,312
Those freakin' kids!
I knew I couldn't trust 'em.

636
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:04,650
Town liar.
That's a nice rep. Nice rep.

637
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,351
I bet it was Gregory,
that little weasel.

638
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,253
Top secret,
top secret, I tell 'em,

639
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:10,055
and they still
shoot off their mouths!

640
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,123
If I'd really
been a French spy,

641
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,626
those little tots
would've gotten me killed!

642
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,394
Piano wire
wrapped around my neck.

643
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,129
My testicles
shoved down my throat,

644
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,165
a piece of
dynamite stuck up my ass.

645
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,639
She's so beautiful.

646
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,609
And I'm the town liar.

647
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,785
Jim, there's no
reason to lie right now.

648
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:22,187
There's no one to impress.

649
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,955
You know,
I'm not impressed by a man

650
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,791
telling me he
likes living at home.

651
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:29,127
Excuse me. I'm not lying,

652
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,262
and I'm not
trying to impress you.

653
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,431
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

654
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,001
I have to clean dead flies
out of the lighting fixtures.

655
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:39,204
Okay, okay, my error.
I apologize.

656
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:43,174
It's just that I
can't imagine a man,

657
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,444
giving up his independence,
his right to mate,

658
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,080
to have a family,

659
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:52,450
to have children,
to build a life for himself,

660
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,819
for good cooking.

661
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,086
Hold on.

662
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,956
I have not given
up my right to mate.

663
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,225
I have
the right to mate

664
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,261
anytime I feel like mating.

665
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,864
You go out with someone.

666
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:07,498
You bring her home.

667
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,534
You introduce her to...

668
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:12,770
Mom, Dad, sis, Billy,

669
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,973
Woofie the dog.

670
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,875
Cocktails in
the rumpus room, and then

671
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,310
do it on the bunk bed?

672
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:21,279
Oh,

673
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:23,114
let's analyze that remark.

674
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,550
First, I don't have a dog,

675
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,285
my brother's not named Billy,

676
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,421
and I don't even
have a rumpus room.
So I don't even...

677
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,023
You know what I mean.

678
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,831
Yeah, I know what you mean.

679
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,567
Spit on me,
make me feel lousy.

680
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,909
Jim?

681
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,412
You said something
that wasn't true.

682
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:57,015
No.

683
00:46:57,048 --> 00:47:01,519
No, I said that I can
have sex when I want to,

684
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,389
and I do. I do.

685
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,425
However, I was
looking forward to a nice,
quiet evening of janitoring.

686
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,030
I don't think you see
what I'm getting at.

687
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,532
I see what you're getting at.

688
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,202
I'm a lying monk
with an Oedipus complex

689
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:18,236
and an appetite
for home cooking.

690
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,138
Don't forget. You're
the indecisive shoplifter.

691
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,140
Yes! Exactly!

692
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,242
I would do anything
to be in your shoes.

693
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:27,445
These are Darnell's shoes.

694
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:30,148
You know, you have freedom,
and you're not using it.

695
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,284
It makes me sad.

696
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:35,921
Well, you have
the collective wealth
of the entire town,

697
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,556
and you're trying to
get yourself arrested.
Now, that makes me sad.

698
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,591
That makes me sad, too.

699
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,060
That's pretty stupid.

700
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,261
It's very stupid.

701
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,464
Are you serious?

702
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,900
I mean,
you haven't been drinking?

703
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:50,501
This isn't the bottle talking?

704
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,603
No.

705
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,341
Then why don't you
just talk to the guy?

706
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:01,412
For the same reason
that you can't leave home,

707
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:03,381
I can't tell my
father to go to hell.

708
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:06,451
Why not?

709
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:12,123
Because I don't
want to be alone.

710
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:41,419
Mr. McClellan?

711
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,057
You ever have any
family problems,
you and your daughter?

712
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,194
What the hell do
you think this is?

713
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,397
You got a point.

714
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:00,038
Would you go
with me somewhere?

715
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,542
Where?
Florida?

716
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,412
Wyoming? Spain?

717
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,580
It doesn't really matter,
just away somewhere.

718
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,550
I'd love to.

719
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,087
I just can't afford to be

720
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,189
capricious and
carefree like yourself.

721
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:21,993
I, uh, I've gotta set
my sights on something
and really go for it.

722
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,429
Night janitor?

723
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,432
It's a beginning.
I'm looking at...

724
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,134
It's an end.

725
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,704
Maybe if you had,
like, a destination in mind,

726
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:36,107
that would make
all
the difference in the world.

727
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,310
Why?

728
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,712
Well,
uh, I'm, uh, I'm just not

729
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:44,215
built to
aimlessly roam the world.

730
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:46,484
I'm too
conservative for that.

731
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,754
Well,

732
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:52,057
I was thinking
about Los Angeles.

733
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,125
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

734
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,461
What for?

735
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,495
Live. Work.

736
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,066
At what?
Whatever.

737
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,734
And what about your father?

738
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,372
When I don't die,

739
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:10,575
he'll realize that I
can make it on my own.

740
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:14,712
If I do,
he'll have the satisfaction
of knowing that I can't.

741
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:18,216
If I run and he
brings me back,
or if I go back on my own,

742
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,784
either way he's just,
uh, gonna beat
the shit out of me.

743
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:21,586
So it doesn't
really make a difference.

744
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,121
What, uh, literally?

745
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:27,725
Yeah.

746
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,495
Sad.

747
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:32,763
Yeah, it's sad.

748
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,266
Until he throws you
across the room, it's sad.

749
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,768
I'm just afraid
to live with him,

750
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:39,537
and I'm afraid to
live without... You know,

751
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,507
you didn't come to
work to hear this stuff.
I'm really sorry.

752
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,774
That's all right.

753
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,143
I'm gonna clean this up.

754
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:55,353
I'm, uh, I'm just surprised.

755
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,288
I thought everything
was okay, you know.

756
00:50:58,289 --> 00:50:59,557
I figured you got
a nice car, you got

757
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,791
a nice house,
you got some money.

758
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,327
Everything's okay.

759
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,129
It should be,

760
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:05,630
but it's not.

761
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,665
It's twisted,
and it's distorted,

762
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,401
and it can't be changed,
and it cannot be saved.

763
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,344
I'll go with you.

764
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,217
Really?

765
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:28,453
Yeah.

766
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,856
We have to get a car.

767
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,260
Let's get through the night,
first.

768
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,627
I have money.

769
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:37,762
How much?

770
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,464
$52,000.

771
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:43,201
On you?

772
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,571
In my purse.

773
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,786
$52,000. Wow.

774
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:05,456
I've never seen so
much money in my life.

775
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,692
This is
more than my house cost.

776
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,262
Jim,

777
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:13,431
now that I'm
spending the night,

778
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,166
how can I pay you back

779
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,468
for being so cold to
you in high school?

780
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,207
Do you need
an answer right away?

781
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,641
No.

782
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,511
Sometime before
the sun comes up.

783
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,516
Well, uh,

784
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,485
you're probably not
going to remember this,

785
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,887
but, uh,

786
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,590
there was a homecoming dance
our sophomore year.

787
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:40,825
Mmm-hmm.

788
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,227
Do you remember Mrs. Noble?

789
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,896
Large, hairy gym teacher

790
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,798
with a suspiciously
cumbersome groin bulge?

791
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,600
I had her for two years.

792
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,202
Well, she made
everybody switch partners

793
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:52,503
because all the fat girls
were dancing together,

794
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,205
and the doinks,
myself included,

795
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,640
were standing
against the wall,

796
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,808
blowing spit bubbles.
Right.

797
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:03,614
Well, uh, for three-quarters
of one verse of a slow song,

798
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,484
we danced together.

799
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:09,520
You reeked of Stridex.

800
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,423
Oh, no, that was Larry Fry.

801
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:14,925
I'm sorry.

802
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,528
I don't remember.

803
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,564
Well...

804
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,499
You got your hair
caught in my braces.

805
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,668
I don't remember.

806
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,969
Well, it's not important.

807
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:28,973
I had...

808
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:30,675
Well, I just always...

809
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,711
Dreamed of
finishing that dance.

810
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:37,982
Okay.

811
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:44,922
Oh, don't, uh, don't feel
you have to answer right away.

812
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,493
It's just a small portion
of my life that's incomplete.

813
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,695
I thought you were gonna say
something different.

814
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,436
Well,

815
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,872
first things first.

816
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:21,959
* When things go wrong

817
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:26,297
* As they sometimes will

818
00:54:26,331 --> 00:54:31,402
* When the road
you're trudging
seems all uphill

819
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:37,908
* When the funds are low

820
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:42,613
* And the debts are high

821
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:47,518
* And you want to smile,
but you have to sigh

822
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:54,091
* When care

823
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:58,796
* Is pressing you down a bit

824
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,799
* Rest if you must

825
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,772
* But don't you quit

826
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:12,309
* Oh, no

827
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,347
* Don't you quit

828
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,750
* Oh, no

829
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:39,570
* But you never can tell

830
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:43,841
* How close you are

831
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:49,514
* It may be near
when it seems so far

832
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,382
* Ooh

833
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,755
Aah!

834
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:33,090
Ow.

835
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,558
Officer Don!

836
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,760
Oh! You scared
the crap out of me.

837
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:12,162
I thought it
was the custodian.

838
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,465
Jim,
what are you doing in there?

839
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:16,200
I work here now.

840
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:23,574
You wanna let me in?

841
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:26,711
I'd love to let you in.
I don't have the keys.

842
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,546
I'm locked in
here till 7:00 a.m.

843
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,615
What's going on?

844
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,783
Have you seen Josie McClellan?

845
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,587
Of course, uh...

846
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,925
Dark hair,
green eyes, beautiful.

847
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,259
Oh, yeah. Of course.

848
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,661
You seen her recently?

849
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,530
Oh!

850
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,933
Ah, matter of fact,
I just saw her yesterday,
yeah.

851
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,135
We had a cup of java together.

852
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,504
She come into the store?

853
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:55,940
Oh, I don't know.
I only work nights.

854
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,908
Why?
Well,

855
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,511
she's missing.

856
00:58:00,545 --> 00:58:04,682
Now, I was looking around
this side of town for
her and I come past.

857
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,618
I seen that
the outside sign's on.

858
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:09,920
The outside sign's never on.

859
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,222
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

860
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:14,024
Did you try the library?

861
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:16,527
Because, you know,
maybe she fell asleep reading.

862
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:19,129
No.

863
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,733
She's probably
just screwing somebody
the old man don't approve of.

864
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:29,940
Would you know...

865
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:34,244
If the custodian comes by
to check up on people?

866
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:37,114
Oh, no, I wouldn't
think he'd do that, Jimmy.

867
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,184
I feel pretty good now.

868
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,028
I'm sorry, sir.

869
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,263
I had to practice
a little therapy.

870
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,766
Boy's in his own world.

871
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:49,213
Aah!

872
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,354
Why don't we get
underneath the bench?

873
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,425
Do you want to get on top?

874
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:46,103
You check the office.
I'll scope the dressing rooms.

875
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,471
Right.

876
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:57,481
You're on top.

877
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,218
Did you want to be on top?

878
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,120
Oh, no.

879
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,823
No,
no, uh, I'm fine where I am.

880
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,357
Sure.

881
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:44,228
Ow, ow, ow.

882
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,898
I think he went to the back.

883
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,245
Evening.

884
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,417
Nice.

885
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,286
Excellent.

886
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:12,522
Hey, you got a tattoo?

887
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,226
No, sir.

888
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,862
Not you, asshole!

889
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:19,930
I'm a missing person.

890
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,432
The whole town
is looking for me.

891
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,402
What, are you hidin' out?
Yes.

892
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:27,905
And I would appreciate
it if you'd let us sit up.

893
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,806
What about the tattoo?

894
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,542
I don't have one.

895
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,011
You owe me a buck.

896
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:35,179
Actually, it's up to two.

897
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,248
I borrowed that one
off you at Burger King.

898
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,917
Excuse me.

899
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,888
Are you planning to shoot us
in the back of the head?

900
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,456
We haven't
decided yet, have we?

901
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:49,493
Who are you?

902
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,296
Uh, you don't want to know.

903
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,865
He wouldn't have asked
if he didn't want
to know, butthead.

904
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:56,633
He's a little crazy.
He's my brother.

905
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,468
He's not quite right.
That's not true.

906
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,570
She doesn't even know me.

907
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:02,239
Somebody better start
talking straight here.

908
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:03,607
That's the truth.

909
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,976
Okay.

910
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,846
You want to know?

911
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:12,616
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, good.

912
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:14,985
But, uh...

913
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,155
Come on over here.

914
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,491
What?
- Come on over.

915
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,460
Come on over here! Over here.

916
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,980
Come on down here.

917
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,551
That's right.
Down here. Down here.

918
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,453
Uh-huh?

919
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:51,989
Okay.

920
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,993
You dumb sons of bitches.

921
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,064
Do you realize that
you have just walked

922
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:03,500
straight into a $60-million
drug transaction?

923
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,337
So, you're running this

924
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:11,141
multi-zillion-dollar
drug transaction by yourself?

925
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:13,010
Little Target boy.

926
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:15,112
No.

927
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:17,647
No,
I'm not doing it by myself.

928
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,349
Oh, no, no.

929
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,086
As a matter of fact,

930
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,522
in about 10 minutes,

931
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:28,692
this place is gonna be
alive with the meanest,

932
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:32,362
ugliest,
most impatient animals
you guys have ever seen.

933
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:35,665
So I'll tell you what,
I'll give you
five minutes to take

934
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,435
whatever you want
in the whole store.
Anything you want and just go.

935
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:41,405
I won't tell. Just go.
Just take your guns and go.
Scoot.

936
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,974
Okay, then, who's the girl?

937
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,477
I'm his hostage.

938
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,578
Yes, yes.

939
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:52,682
Is that true? Hmm?

940
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:55,185
Yes! Yes, it's true.

941
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,354
And, um...

942
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,526
If the deal doesn't go down,

943
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,561
she becomes pig feed.

944
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:05,695
Bullshit.

945
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,597
Oh, really?

946
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:11,768
Well, blow her away.

947
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,038
Come on, that's bullshit!

948
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:16,640
Okay.

949
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:21,511
Then give me your guns
and I'll do it for you.

950
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:23,747
It's bullshit, right?

951
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:27,017
We'll see.

952
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:31,221
Roll over.

953
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:32,622
Come on, you heard him.
What?

954
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,658
Roll over!
That's right. You too, honey.

955
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:37,161
You heard me.
Roll over. Come on, do it!

956
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:40,730
Come on, come on!
Roll! Roll. That's it.
Very good.

957
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:44,201
Mmm! Yeah.

958
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:47,171
Um, give me the guns.

959
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:48,738
Ah!

960
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,374
No way, man. Uh-uh.

961
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,176
Fine. Fine.

962
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,244
You do it. I don't
need her anymore, anyway.

963
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:57,314
I only needed her to
get through customs.

964
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,049
I don't like this.

965
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,584
This sucks. It's not worth it.

966
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:02,219
Come on, we don't
have much time. Do it!

967
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:03,553
All right.

968
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,226
It's nothing personal.

969
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:10,727
Jim!
Too late. They're here!

970
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,364
It's too late. They're here.

971
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:15,532
Men, hold your fire.
Hold the fire.

972
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,602
Ned in housewares,
hold your fire.

973
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,437
Tommy in sporting goods,
hold your fire.

974
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,505
Ned, hold your fire.

975
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,208
There are infrared scopes
trained on your heads.

976
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,642
We didn't want this!

977
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,211
It's the girl
you want, not us!

978
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:29,646
Just relax, okay.
Ned, we got a WD-40.

979
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:31,248
That's right.
A full-scale PMS.

980
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,816
Okay, everybody, just relax!

981
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:35,719
Now,
now, everybody just relax.

982
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:37,521
Okay, the whole
place is gonna blow.

983
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,655
Everybody just relax.

984
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:40,524
Now, put down your guns.
Put the guns down.

985
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,159
Ned, they're
putting down the guns.

986
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:43,727
Are you putting them down?
They are putting them down.

987
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,263
Now, get down, 'cause
lives are at stake here.

988
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:49,566
Let go. Let go, let go.
Now, get back, get back.

989
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:54,504
Spread 'em. Spread the legs.
Put down the dogs.

990
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:57,141
Okay, put the dogs down.
Put the dogs down.

991
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:59,476
Both of 'em!
Put the dogs down! Down!

992
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,180
That was great!

993
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,781
I got a big
surprise for you guys.

994
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,617
We have a bit of
a surprise for you, too.

995
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:10,754
Them guns aren't loaded.

996
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:23,200
I got an idea.

997
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,169
How about a truce?

998
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:28,172
I'm full of shit.
You're full of shit.

999
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:30,774
I think everybody at
one time in their life
is full of shit.

1000
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,442
I'll throw on
a couple of corn dogs

1001
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:34,544
and we'll all get
to know each other.

1002
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:36,780
I'd like to know what
goes on inside your heads.

1003
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:39,216
Okay, you had
the big one, you had the...

1004
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:40,750
No.

1005
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,419
Sorry. I could've
sworn you had the big one.

1006
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:45,489
Ha!

1007
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:48,792
I lied.

1008
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:55,665
These are the men that
killed that guy in Saltburg.

1009
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,269
I'm fairly sure
that we're gonna die.

1010
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:00,904
I just want to tell
you how disappointed I am

1011
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,739
that we're not going
to California together.

1012
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,508
We're not dead yet.

1013
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,345
Pretty darn close.
No.

1014
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:10,847
If I can get them
to take me with them,

1015
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,350
maybe I can get away
and come back for you.

1016
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:15,919
Don't forget we need a car
and they obviously have one.

1017
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,389
Just...

1018
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:20,724
Go along with
whatever I do, okay?

1019
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,192
Okay.

1020
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:36,540
So,
what's the word on you two?

1021
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:40,310
Are you married?
Obviously, you're...

1022
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:43,513
Hack crooks if you can't pull
off a discount store job.

1023
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:48,285
What were you
planning to steal?
A little hair spray?

1024
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:53,757
Sorry.

1025
01:09:57,961 --> 01:09:59,296
Lady, you got a job?

1026
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:02,799
No.

1027
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:04,301
Well, then don't knock ours.

1028
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,404
Crime isn't a job.
It's a sickness.

1029
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:13,677
Whoops.

1030
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:15,812
Anyone have some change?

1031
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:30,694
You look like a lady
in need of a quarter.

1032
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,962
I might need more
than just a quarter.

1033
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,468
You know...
No.

1034
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:40,370
You and I could
make a lot of money.

1035
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:43,307
Honey,
me and Nestor are partners.

1036
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,409
Okay? We don't need a third.

1037
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,811
You don't know what you need,
so why don't you shut up?

1038
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:53,350
Hop on.

1039
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,034
Now.

1040
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:13,537
Let's go now.

1041
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,306
Know what you are?

1042
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,206
Yeah.

1043
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,310
You are one
good-looking ball of trouble.

1044
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:24,648
Good.

1045
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,387
What do you think,
for the car?

1046
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,854
This one?

1047
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:08,057
No, the whole thing.
We'll just lay it
down in the back.

1048
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:10,126
We got
multi-cassette capabilities.

1049
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,695
Think of the sound.

1050
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:42,091
Let me just tell you.
I'm not helping
you load your car.

1051
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,593
Think again, boy.

1052
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:47,831
You're not going to take
the stolen merchandise
out of the store. No.

1053
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:48,965
I'm not gonna let you.

1054
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,567
Get out.

1055
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,701
It's stolen. All of it!

1056
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:52,836
- Give me that!
- No!

1057
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,838
It's mine!
Give it to me!

1058
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,105
It's mine.

1059
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,879
But where... Wait a minute.

1060
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:07,717
You're not going with them?

1061
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:08,918
Yeah.

1062
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:11,755
You'll be an accessory.

1063
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,592
So?

1064
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,594
So? You don't know
anything about them.

1065
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:19,596
You certainly don't
know anything about him.

1066
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:20,997
These are
hardened criminals here!

1067
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,099
Okay, come here.
That's enough.
That's enough!

1068
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,133
Gil.

1069
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:29,205
Don't waste your time.
You could get a hernia.

1070
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,541
You know,
if my foot could talk,

1071
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,544
it would say,
"May I please go
up this geek's ass?"

1072
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:35,712
Forget him!
Forget him.

1073
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,013
Come on! All right.

1074
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:40,016
He's no use to us.
After all, the guy's
built like an oyster.

1075
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,651
Listen, little mister.

1076
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,922
If you tell on us,

1077
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,190
I'll kill you.

1078
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:54,598
Fine.

1079
01:13:59,703 --> 01:14:01,538
Jim.

1080
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,648
Don't be an ass.

1081
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:16,820
Okay, Jimbo?

1082
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,757
Let's go, shall we?

1083
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,719
Ahem.

1084
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,055
Come on, come on, come on!

1085
01:15:10,774 --> 01:15:13,142
I got 'em.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

1086
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:39,295
That
wasn't a store robbery.

1087
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,765
That was an assassination.

1088
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:43,800
That wasn't a clerk.
That was a wise guy.

1089
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,770
How do I know?

1090
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:50,039
I spent a little time with
the FBI's
organized crime unit.

1091
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:52,008
I guess you could say
that I'm
intimately knowledgeable

1092
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,910
with the seedy and rancorous
workings of the mob

1093
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,713
in the Midwest
section of this country.

1094
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:59,415
Let me just say,
I know a gangland slaying
when I see one,

1095
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,117
and that's exactly
what this baby is.

1096
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:06,890
I'd look into
myself personally,
but I got a date tonight.

1097
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:17,333
Attention Target shoppers.

1098
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,682
Jim!

1099
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:04,107
He is so cool.

1100
01:19:05,305 --> 01:20:05,838

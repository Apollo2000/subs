December 1933

3
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:54,556
<i>People always described me
as being so distracted.</i>

4
00:00:58,852 --> 00:00:59,978
Hey!

5
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,522
Where are you heading to?

6
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:08,153
I'm delivering seaweed to Futaba
in Nakajima Honmachi.

7
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:14,701
This is usually my brother's
job, but he has a cold so...

8
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,536
I must fu... fulfill...

9
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,873
It's okay.
You don't have to be so formal.

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,084
Don't mind the gravel
on the floor.

11
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,753
After I'm done,

12
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:28,131
I'm buying treats for
my brother and sister.

13
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,092
I see.

14
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,524
Look. We're almost there.

15
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:51,071
Hey, stop gazing off into space!

16
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,675
<i>"Year's End Market"</i>

17

<i>Chocolate, 10 sen.</i>

19

<i>Yo-yo, 10 sen.</i>

21
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,901
I want the red one.

22
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:32,779
Business is still busy.

23
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:37,742
Thank you for coming. Take care.

24
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:42,789
The sky's brilliance

25
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:48,962
Flows into my heart

26
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,843
Today again, I gaze far away

27
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:01,391
And tears trickle down

28
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:18,700
White clouds keep drifting past

29
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:24,455
While dreams entangle about

30
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:30,253
Wavering, fleeting

31
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:36,593
Sadness enveloping

32
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,764
It pains me to ponder

33
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:48,438
This emptiness evermore

34
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:54,611
Will salvation ever come?

35
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:02,202
In This Corner of the World

36
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,257
Then I got lost,

37
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,093
and I met an old man.

38
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,639
Suzu,

39
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,432
what is that?

40
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,850
A monster.

41
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,186
At least that's what he said.

42
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:32,565
He lent me his telescope
and told me to find my way.

43
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:37,362
Wow! I can see really well!

44
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:43,284
Then I fell into his basket
and met an older boy.

45
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:47,288
He's a kidnapper and
we're being kidnapped.

46
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,541
What? Oh, no...

47
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,879
I have to feed the chicken
before it gets dark.

48
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:58,258
I have to ride the train
back home with my dad.

49
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,343
Me too, me too.

50
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,305
I have to go home
before night fall or else...

51
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,474
Or else what happens?

52
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,309
You'll see soon enough.

53
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,276
- Hey mister.
- Oh! Ouch!

54
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,445
What is that? Take a look!

55
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,740
Let me see.

56
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,748
He falls asleep when it gets dark.

57
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,419
Too bad he'll miss supper.

58
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,506
Thanks, Suzu Urano!

59
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,551
How do you know my name?

60
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,471
"Thanks, Suzu Urano!"

61
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,016
Hey! Keep it down!

62
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,436
I'm so distracted at times.

63
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:56,858
<i>I'm sure I was daydreaming again</i>

64
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,488
August 1935

65
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,241
<i>The sea was just here last night,</i>

66
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,203
<i>but now it's all gone
with the spring tide.</i>

67
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:15,126
Crossing the sea all on our own!
First time ever! This is fun!

68
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:19,964
I'll greet our uncle, aunt
and grandma in Kusatsu first.

69
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:23,092
I'll say "Our parents will join us later."

70
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,719
"Please have this watermelon".

71
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,555
I wanna hold the watermelon!

72
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,140
Quiet!

73
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,310
Hey!
There's no time to play around!

74
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,897
My brother was quite
the stern type.

75
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,443
Good morning...

76
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,237
Our parents will...

77
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,282
Please...

78
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,451
Please have this... watermelon.

79
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,037
Thanks, our ancestors will appreciate it.

80
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,290
You look so pretty.

81
00:06:54,624 --> 00:07:00,004
<i>Our grandma sews us
a new kimono every year.</i>

82
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,256
<i>Our parents joined us
after shopping</i>

83
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,550
<i>and we visited our family grave.</i>

84
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,887
How's business?

85
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,390
It's tough.

86
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,851
Is that so?

87
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,026
<i>There are ups and downs,</i>

88
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,156
but it's not all bad,
being young.

89
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,159
I think it lets me see
different things.

90
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,556
H... hello.

91
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,312
Excuse me...

92
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,316
Would you like some more?

93
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,572
Grandma.

94
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,452
Wake up.
The tide is pulling out.

95
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,246
Get ready.

96
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,207
Sumi, you too.

97
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,501
Come on.

98
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:26,090
Leave it there, she will have it later.

99
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,551
So if I leave my kimono there,

100
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:31,888
Will she wear it, too?

101
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,476
You're so kind, Suzu.

102
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:40,062
"Must've been a zashiki-warashi,
a house spirit.

103
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,148
Teacher told me about them."

104
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,609
My brother explained
to me later.

105
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:48,362
That dusk, everything looked
hazy but gentle.

106
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:54,535
You left your kimono in Kusatsu?
Swim back and get it right now!

107
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,245

February 1938

111
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:10,968
Suzu, put it lower.
The wind could blow it away.

112
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:16,557
Mom, can you give me 2 sen?
I lost my pencil.

113
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,226
Wait for your allowance.

114
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,647
You need to stop doodling.

115
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:28,152
- Sumi, let's trade pencils.
- No.

116
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:32,240
Suzu, is Tetsu Mizuhara
going to school every day?

117
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,283
Um, I think so.

118
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,827
What a cold day.

119
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,249
Oh, you're cold!

120
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,394
Oh.

121
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,063
It's so short!

122
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,108
I hope it'll last the week.

Nice job, Urano.

132
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,460
Very impressive.

133
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,130
I wish I could draw like you.

00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,509
I'm home.

I'll gather some pine
needles for kindling.

I don't want to go home.

My parents drink all day instead
of working with seaweed.

141

I hate the ocean.

142

I won't draw it.

Take it.

00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,435
But I can't.

146
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,605
It's my brother's,
I have plenty more.

147

The rabbits are
hopping about today.

148
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:33,778
The sea was like this when a
ship capsized at New Year's.

149
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,615
If you want to draw,
then draw this stupid ocean

150
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,580
Mizuhara, what did you
mean earlier?

151
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,127
Oh, the white waves
look like rabbits hopping.

152
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,547
Hey, Mizuhara,
can I give my brother to you?

153
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:54,882
No way.

154
00:11:55,383 --> 00:12:00,221
All the guys run when they see him coming.

155
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:09,188
But still better than the idiot
who joined the Navy and drowned.

156
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,607
You're right,

157
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,026
they look like white rabbits.

158
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,363
I'm done.

159
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:18,906

Oh, thanks...

161
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,203
You shouldn't have bothered.

162
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,041
Now I have to go home.
And with a drawing like this,

163
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,044
I can't hate the ocean anymore.

December 1941

168
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,265
Hurray! Hurray!

169
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:48,269
April 1943

170
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,438
Pick the seaweeds over here.

171
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,897
December 1943

172
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,940
Yes.

173
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,484
Oh,

174
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,654
Lovely decisive
combat battledress.

175
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,617
That's cold!

176
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,759
You've gotten quite good. We'll
have lunch when you're ready.

177
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,260
Okay!

178
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:23,262
That's far!

179
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:27,641
You're going far away
to get married.

180
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:28,976
I am?

181
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,936
Sumi, you're staying near.

182
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:36,400
They say girls who hold their
chopsticks up top wed far away.

183
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,235
Really?

184
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,404
Where did you come from, Grandma?

185
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:44,116
I came from Furue.

186
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,911
That's just one village over.

187
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,831
Women who end up in Manchuria
must be using tongs.

188
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,877
Says Sumi, as she shifts
her grip on her chopsticks.

189
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:58,255
But marrying close to home
isn't very exciting.

190
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,346
Suzu, run back home!
I just got a call...

191
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,599
A boy all the way
from Kure is here

192
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:11,685
asking for your hand
in marriage.

193
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,686
Kure?

194
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,190
Suzu, how old are you?

195
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:20,778
I'm about 19...
Well actually, 18.

196
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:24,865
You can always turn him down,
but at least go and meet him.

197
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:27,743
Suzu, come here a bit.

198
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:34,792
I want you to have this.
I made it for the day you wed.

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,462
I hope it'll work out for you.

200
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,882
Thank you.

201
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:47,012
The wedding will be in their
house in Kure.

202
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,974
On your wedding night,

203
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,644
he'll ask,
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

204
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:59,608
You'll answer,
"I brought a brand new one."

205
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,070
Then he will ask,
"Can I open it?"

206
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,698
You must say "Yes", okay?

207
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,241
But why?

208
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,576
Because you have to.

209
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,412
<i>I guess I'm becoming an adult.</i>

210
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,539
Kure...

211
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:18,711
There's a naval port there, and
it's full of sailors, I think...

212
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,426
Eh? Mizuhara?

213
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,679
It's been a while.

214
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,347
Hurry home.

215
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:36,270
Your mom made such a fuss,
everybody already knows.

216
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,732
Oh, gosh!

217
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,859
I thought you were the suitor!

218
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,527
Don't be silly!

219
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,365
I just came home for my
brother's memorial.

220
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,037
You don't know who
your suitor is?

221
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,872
No idea.

222
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,000
Maybe he has me
confused with Sumi.

223
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,003
Sumi is prettier than me.

224
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,173
I don't think so.

225
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:09,929
My son took a shine to your
daughter on his way to school.

226
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:14,058
It wasn't easy to
find your house.

227
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,810
We lost the seaweed business

228
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,397
to land reclamation
three years ago.

229
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,026
She should be home any minute.

230
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,613
I can't tell if marrying
would be good.

231
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:33,327
I wonder, why did I
taste caramel in my mouth...

232
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,745
It's so cold...

233
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,498
What should I do?

234
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,292
They say I could turn him down,

235
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,963
but I don't
even know if I like him or not.

236
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,798
Excuse me.

237
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,091
Yes?

238
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,053
We lost our way.

239
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,222
Where is the train station?

240
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,599
- This way.
- Thank you.

241
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,520
A nice sailor showed us the way,
but...

242
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:03,315
Oh, him? He's an odd one,
you see.

243
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,821
They said an odd woman in the
woods showed them the way.

244
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:13,993
February 1944

245
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,745
Am I so distracted that I lose
track of what's going on?

246
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,081
How did this all
happen so quickly?

247
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,207
<i>"Hiroshima"</i>

Someone left a window open...

254
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,366
<i>Next stop, Kure.</i>

255
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,330
The Naval battery must
be doing drills.

256
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,222
Sorry.

257
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,978
The wood gas bus couldn't get up
the hill, could it?

258
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,939
Hello, Mrs. Kobayashi.

259
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,318
Thank you for having us.

260
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,321
I'm glad the weather is nice.

261
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,993
While I am lacking in my ways, I
am honored to join your family.

262
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,040
I'm Kobayashi, Shusaku's aunt.
I'll be your matchmaker today.

263
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,834
You do know your husband-to-be's
last name, right?

264
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,420
Definitely lacking in many ways.

265
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,723
We've climbed so high!

266
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,309

270
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,650
My apologies for such a
simple wedding.

271
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,402
Simple suits our girl just fine.

272
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,029
Oh no!

273
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,990
My beautiful kimono is
all covered up.

274
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,077
Suzu!

275
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,162
What on earth are you doing!

276
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,921
What a feast.

277
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,924
I'm sorry her brother
couldn't come.

278
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,260
This is impressive.

279
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,554
Well, you provided us with
the ingredients.

280
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,099
This includes supper as well
so make sure to eat up.

281
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,810
This stew is delicious.

282
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,273
He seems very reserved.
You're lucky.

283
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,567
No one would be noisy
at a wedding.

284
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,319
Except for you.

285
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,489
See you when you come
home to visit!

286
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,908
See you then!

287
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,078
I'll see you around.

288
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:11,170
<i>Wait... who was that, again?</i>

289
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,629
Now that she's here,

290
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,592
you can rest and have
her take over.

291
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,010
I will.

292
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:23,515
Mom, Dad, it's an honor to be
part of your family.

293
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,601
The honor is ours.

294
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,937
I have a bad leg so,

295
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,857
I'm counting on you, Suzu.

296
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:32,691
Of course.

297
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,194
Thank you.

298
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,946
Keiko always burns the pot.

299
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,242
Right! She's the daughter
who got married.

300
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,222
Naval ships are doing
search light drills.

301
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,185
Where have I ended up?

302
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,111
Thank you for setting out the futons.

303
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,321
Sure.

304
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,244
Oh, Suzu?

305
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,620
Yes?

306
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,873
Did you bring an umbrella?

307
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,963
Yes, I have.

308
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,215
It's brand new.

309
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,801
Can I borrow it?

310
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,934
Here.

311
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,521
You must be hungry.

312
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,777
Were the dried
persimmons too bitter?

313
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,864
You didn't eat at the wedding.

314
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:06,785
I'm glad you can eat
with your mouth.

315
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,290
Yes, don't worry. I even swallowed
the seed.

316
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,542
With my mouth.

317

We have. Don't you remember?

319
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,261
I'm sorry.

320
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,639
I tend to be distracted and

00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,400
We're off.

332
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,402
Have a nice day.

333
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,990
<i>Everyone around here seems
to work for the Navy.</i>

334
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,585
Mrs. Houjo?

335
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,756
Mrs. Houjo?

336
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,258
Ah, yes!

337
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,759
"Rationing duty"?

338
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,472
Remember, these two are
always at it.

339
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,266
Nice to meet you.

340
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,518
- I'm Chita.
- I'm Kariya.

341
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,774
There you go again!

342
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,776
I'm measuring properly

343
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,987
You're eyeballing it!

344
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,989
- No I'm not.
- It's unfair!

345
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,365
It is not!

346
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,617
- Unbelievable.
- What is?

347
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,203
You and your ways.

348
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,872
What ways?

349
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,790
Haha, I'm young, don't worry!

350
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,750
It's gonna fall!

351
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,296
Oops!

352
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,382
Ouch...

353
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:08,717
I'm so sorry.

354
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:13,388
That possibility cannot
be ruled out.

355
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,432
If incendiary bombs come down,

356
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,685
first you must timely counter
and neutralize...

357
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,608
Come closer!
It's so chilly in here.

358
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,655
<i>This has become my daily life.</i>

359
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:36,536
March 1944

360
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,420
That's Keiko's dress from
when she was younger.

361
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,589
It goes in the storage.

362
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:52,219
She wore that on dates with her husband.

363
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:57,432
They'd go to the cinema,
fancy restaurants, and exhibits.

364
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,729
She was quite the modern lady.

365
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:06,399
Those were the days.

366
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,735
When Shusaku was in the
fourth grade,

367
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,654
the "disarmament for peace"

368
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,323
treaty shut down
warship production.

369
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:20,247
My husband and neighbors lost
their jobs. It was a hard blow.

370
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:26,711
But Keiko found a job and
a husband all on her own.

371
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:31,299
Well! I'll work just as hard!

372
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,721
We thought those
times were tough.

373
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:41,059
How I miss those days now.

374
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,112
Hello.

375
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,863
I'm home.

376
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,075
Welcome back.

377
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,037
Humdrum...

378
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,960
Humdrum? How? Rice is
such a luxury now!

379
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,628
I'm talking about you!

380
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,924
I expected a sophisticated
city girl from Hiroshima.

381
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,510
What's that rag you're wearing?

382
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,138
Are you roasting beans?

383
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,765
Hello Harumi.

384
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,935
Mommy is mad about
everything lately.

385
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,854
So I stay quiet.

386
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:29,065
I'm sorry, it's all I've got...

387
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,192
Then make one right now.

388
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,576
Also, that rice isn't a gift,
it's for me and Harumi.

389
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,704
Keiko...

390
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,539
But, Mom!

391
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,709
Oh, dear. What should I do?

392
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,587
Ouch!

393
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,881
Not again, not like that!

394
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,468
No one will marry you
if you don't do it right.

395
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,637
That's fine. Then I won't marry.

396
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,938
What's it like at the waist...?

397
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,900
<i>I see.</i>

398
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:34,255
I undo the seams and cut.
Put them together and sew.

399
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:38,968
Put in a waistband and I'm done!

400
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,723
I'm Harumi Kuromura.

401
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,309
I'm Suzu Houjo.

402
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,479
Can I have some string?

403
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,940
Will this do?

404
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,748
Oops.

405
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,084
Are you going shopping?

406
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,128
Yes, to get rations.

407
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:17,424
I'll go. Hand me your
ration coupon and wallet.

408
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,843
Are you sure? Thank you.

409
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,358
Welcome home.

410
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:43,074
Stop. I'll do it.

411
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,960
Hey, Mom!

412
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,965
I'm coming. What is it, dear?

413
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,301
What should we do for soup?

414
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:23,323
Just the two of you?

415
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,949
Welcome home, Dad.

416
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,285
Make yourself at home, Keiko.

417
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:33,792
What a surprise.
My big sis didn't burn the rice.

418
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,668
Shusaku!

419
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,754
Excuse me.

420
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:41,716
Thank you,
I was able to fix my kimono.

421
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,844
My pleasure.

422
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,263
Our mother has a bad leg,

423
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:51,726
and we brought someone like
you to a place you don't know.

424
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,522
If only I could've stayed.

425
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:00,318
Suzu. Why don't you
go home to Hiroshima?

426
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,403
What?

427
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,113
That's a good idea.

428
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,245
"Hiroshima Castle, Suzu Urano"

429
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,371
I'm home.

430
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,705
I'm so tired.

431
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,374
Welcome home.

432
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,835
It's eight already.

433
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,337
That's quite a pile.

434
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,714
These are all
thousand-person-stitch sashes?

435
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,717
Yes. Sumi, make sure to
stitch each one.

436
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:25,885
Okay.

437
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,221
Suzu! Enough sleeping! Get up!

438
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,431
Y... yes!

439
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,435
It's time for dinner.

440
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:40,567
Oh gosh. I dreamt I
married a man in Kure.

441
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,528
Are you awake now?

442
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,613
My sister-in-law said

443
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:49,033
I should think about going
back to Hiroshima.

444
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,869
I was puzzled at first.

445
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,496
Oh, to visit my family!

446
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,249
Then my in-laws apologized

447
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:59,502
for not letting me come
visit sooner.

448
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:04,924
They told me to relax
for a couple of days.

449
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,887
Uh, if that's what you want,
isn't that nice?

450
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,765
Did you write to Yoichi?

451
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,559
I did.

452
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,186
I haven't heard from him,
though.

453
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,064
- You too?
- Nothing.

454
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,067
He's stationed far away.

455
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,612
And he doesn't write much.

456
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:29,198
Suzu might've written
the wrong address, too.

457
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,951
Bath time!

458
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,912
How's the volunteer corps?

459
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,916
I'm getting used to it.
Don't I smell like machine oil?

460
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,336
It must be a dangerous job.

461
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,922
It's not as cold as harvesting
seaweed.

462
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,132
There are good
things about it.

463
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:50,803
A handsome high-ranking officer
slips me his meal tickets.

464
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,096
Oh my!

465
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,141
I think I just accidentally
learned some Army secret!

466
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:58,728
How about you? Do you like Kure?

467
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:02,899
I don't know yet.
There's so much to learn.

468
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:11,199
Maybe I did just tell you a
Navy secret!

469
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,576
- What?
- Good night!

470
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,704
Suzu?

471
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:17,914
Yeah?

472
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,917
You're getting a bald spot.

473
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:26,756
Bye Suzu! I'm off to work.

474
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:29,842
Emergency policies
start next month.

475
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,971
Even short travels will
be restricted.

476
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,305
Take care.

477
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:35,556
I will.

478
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,601
Time for me to go
to the women's association.

479
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,521
What? You're leaving, too?

480
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,153
<i>"Railroads fight too"</i>

481
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,664
<i>Dad gave me an allowance.</i>

482
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,864
<i>Goodbye.</i>

483
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,242
<i>Goodbye, Hiroshima.</i>

484
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,914
<i>"Tickets Sold Out"</i>

485
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,041
What?

486
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,959
That's why you came back?

487
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:48,379
I feel bad for the Houjo family.

488
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,722
I'm home.

489
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,893
April 1944

490
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,228
<i>Keiko stayed all along.</i>

491
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:09,108
Mommy, can I borrow the ink?

492
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,194
What for?

493
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,362
I wanna use it.

494
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:14,739
Suzu?

495
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,450
What did you tell Harumi?

496
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:22,121
Can I take care of the
community notices?

497
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,623
Sure.

498
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,084
I'll go now, then.

499
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:30,296
She's been a bit off since
coming back from Hiroshima.

500
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,423
Let her be. She's still a child.

501
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:35,259
Thank you for your time.

502
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:38,638
- Please!
- I said no!

503
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,139
Lend me the ink brush.

504
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:43,017
You don't need it.

505
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,793
Welcome home.

506
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,296
Picking herbs?

507
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:15,883
Yes. For tonight's supper.

508
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,760
I see.

509
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,013
Dandelions here are white.

510
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,890
Are they different in Eba?

511
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,060
Here's a yellow one.

512
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,145
What?

513
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:31,065
It might've traveled far.

514
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:37,697
You seem sad. Are you homesick?

515
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,282
No, I'm not.

516
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,123
Look, over there.

517
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:51,294
They're aircraft carriers. Maybe
it's the Hiyo and the Junyo.

518
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:53,129
They're so big.

519
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,716
Those little ones are
destroyers.

520
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,093
There's a U-boat from Germany.

521
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,847
That ship is a submarine tender.

522
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:10,146
Look, there's a white-eye.

523
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,648
Over there.

524
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,066
I can see.

525
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,572
Shusaku, what is that?

526
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,365
Is that a ship?

527
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,159
That's the Yamato,

528
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,077
the world's greatest warship,

529
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,330
born from the Orient's
greatest shipyard.

530
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,125
There's people on it, too?

531
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,543
Yes.

532
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,423
About 2,700 people.

533
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,260
Two thousand...

534
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,054
and seven hundred?

535
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:47,391
That's right.
Let's welcome them to Kure.

536
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,856
They cook for 2,700 people
on that boat every day?

537
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,525
- And do laundry?
- Hey, Suzu.

538
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,658
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

539
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:04,909
Yes.

540
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:06,994
Are you hurt?

541
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:20,925
Suzu, stress will only
make you lose more hair.

542
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,094
So you knew...

543
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:28,182
Can I borrow the ink brush?
I want to paint Suzu's head.

544
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,600
I said no!

545
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,812
You'll stain everything black.

546
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:37,733
Soon, Keiko left and went back
to her late husband's family,

547
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:38,609
so I thought--

548
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,487
All right! now it's my
turn to cook!

549
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:44,782
But by then, rationing
became much worse.

550
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:45,783
May 1944 "Sold Out: Next
Delivery Unknown"

551
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:50,663
<i>Four dried sardines for three
meals for a family of four.</i>

552
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:54,250
It's still better then just
being given vegetable leafs,

553
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,087
and maybe I can buy
some soy pulp.

554
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,631
I see.

555
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,591
<i>Violets,</i>

556
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,344
<i>stellaria, field horsetail.</i>

557
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:10,016
Dandelions, dried sardines,
and soy pulp.

558
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:14,312
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, flour
and pickled plum pits.

559
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:19,650
<i>Cut and steam a sweet potato.</i>

560
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:23,070
<i>Boil and chop some
field horsetails.</i>

561
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:27,408
<i>Mix them with flour
and form a flat disk.</i>

562
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:28,993
<i>And lunch is ready!</i>

563
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,454
It's so quiet without Keiko.

564
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,498
Dry the leftovers for
another day.

565
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,335
Moving on...

566
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:40,963
Use extra water for thin
rice porridge.

567
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:45,426
<i>Add potatoes and let it simmer
for ten minutes.</i>

568
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,471
<i>Then add chopped stellaria.</i>

569
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:54,602
<i>Cook daikon rinds and dandelion
roots with soy sauce and sugar.</i>

570
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:59,398
Add dandelion leaves and soy
pulp then let it simmer.

571
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,155
<i>Finely slice and salt daikon,
then add yellow wood sorrel.</i>

572
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:10,910
Boil pickled plum pits in water.

573
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,914
<i>Add the dried sardines
and stew while basting.</i>

574
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,583
<i>Finish it off with salt.</i>

575
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,212
Mrs. Kariya taught
you this recipe?

576
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,424
Rice rations were halved
so I made sweet potato porridge.

577
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,801
Good job.

578
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:29,011
I'll do better tomorrow.

579
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,681
The loyal samurai Kusunoki
devised

580
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,352
the "food increase
recipe" during a siege.

581
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,689
<i>First, toast and
brown some rice.</i>

582
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:45,444
<i>Add triple the amount of water
and gently simmer the rice.</i>

583
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,699
Saving rice and energy
must go hand in hand.

584
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:56,205
<i>Leave it to the fireless stove
of the Great Empire of Japan!</i>

585
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,541
<i>Let it sit overnight.</i>

586
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:06,632
<i>Add miso and violets to
yesterday's sardine stew.</i>

587
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,761
<i>Reheat rice on the stove.</i>

588
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:16,016
<i>Samurai Kusunoki's special,
"Nanko Meshi" is served!</i>

589
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,437
<i>This one is for Father-in-law.</i>

590
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,651
We have lots of rice today.
The grains are so puffy.

591
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,070
I've never seen rice
cooked this way.

592
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,073
- Yes.
- Let's eat.

593
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,668
- We're off.
- I'm so sorry.

594
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:47,131
Lord Kusunoki must have been
quite bold and remarkable

595
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,508
to enjoy meals like that.

596
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,302
Yes, I agree.

597
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,138
June 1944

598
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:56,724
Air raid warning!

599
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:01,812
Air raid alert!

600
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:12,698
There's nothing on the radio.
Is Shusaku off to work already?

601
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:13,824
Yes.

602
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:16,243
Estimates of the enemy's range

603
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:19,413
puts only Kyushu in
danger for now.

604
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:22,791
No need to run to the
mountains yet.

605
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,711
It's only a blackout.

606
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,841
Don't fall now.

607
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:33,469
They are removing buildings.

608
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,472
They need firebreaks.

609
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,681
I see.

610
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:41,018
Not around here, but
in the city.

611
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:45,606
That's terrible. I hope they can
find a place to live.

612
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,025
Thank you.

613
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,528
You're welcome.

614
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:56,492
I have plenty of firewood.
My house was torn down.

615
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:57,743
Oh no.

616
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:01,330
The family will move
to Shimonoseki.

617
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:03,666
So I left my husband's family.

618
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,626
What?

619
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:09,296
Don't worry. I'll find
a job and work.

620
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,883
There will be more of us now.

621
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:14,927
Like this?

622
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,262
Yes!

623
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:20,849
July 1944

624
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,727
I heard them over Mt. Haigamine.

625
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,605
Big guns even up there?

626
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:28,691
Things are getting
more precarious.

627
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,443
Thank you for helping us.

628
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:35,739
What a fine bomb shelter.

629
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:36,824
It is.

630
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:39,743
So admirable of him to build
this shelter

631
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:41,245
even with
all that overtime.

632
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:47,209
The pillars and tatami mats from
Keiko's house were a godsend.

633
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,715
Shusaku. Did you
place this here?

634
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:55,342
It's nothing.

635
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,887
Let's clean up out here.

636
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,936
Can I have some of this
dirt for our field?

637
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:09,648
Sure, take it. Just be careful.

638
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:12,985
So this is where you've been.

639
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,571
Yes. I'm looking at ships.

640
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,367
There's a lot of ships today.

641
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:22,119
I see two Yamato ships.

642
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,705
One of them is Musashi.

643
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:28,667
I see lots of warships,
but no aircraft carriers.

644
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:30,461
I see.

645
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:34,131
That's the Tone. She has
no rear turrets.

646
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,300
She's an aircraft cruiser.

647
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:37,676
Really?

648
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,721
That's amazing. You know so much.

649
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:44,391
Yeah, he taught me.

650
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:47,645
I see. I also learned a
thing or two.

651
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,356
That's a destroyer.

652
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:52,232
I see small ones.

653
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:54,818
That's a motor launch.

654
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:58,822
I'll teach you something too.

655
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,492
Look at that big cloud.

656
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,036
It's an anvil cloud.

657
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:07,206
It causes heavy rain.

658
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:11,877
Shusaku!

659
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:15,005
Take everything into
the shelter.

660
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,516
Thanks.

661
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,608
No, I can do it.

662
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,736
So you like warships?

663
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,239
Did you teach Harumi
about warships?

664
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,577
I didn't teach Harumi.
Hi-bo taught her.

665
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:46,787
He?

666
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,332
Yeah, Hi-bo loves battleships.

667
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,459
You'll meet him one day.

668
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:57,047
Is his name Hisao, as
etched here?

669
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:58,340
Yes.

670
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:12,563
<i>I can't believe I'm here,
doing this with him.</i>

671
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,026
Good.

672
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:22,531
Let's go while it's
only a drizzle.

673
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:23,699
Father...

674
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:28,287
You're a married couple.
It's nice that you get along.

675
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,791
Isn't that nice. Two couples
getting along so well.

676
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,334
Keiko...

677
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:42,426
They used to measure their
heights together as a family.

678
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:47,931
Wait, did Keiko's husband...

679
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:54,313
He was too frail to be drafted.
I guess he was way too skinny...

680
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:59,401
When my father was rehired
by the Navy Arsenal,

681
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:04,531
Keiko went to buy a watch for
him, that's where they met.

682
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,325
<i>"Kuromura Watchmaker"</i>

683
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:11,163
They got married and
they renewed the store.

684
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:14,416
But Keiko, with her temper,

685
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:18,086
didn't get along
with his family.

686
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:20,964
When her husband died,

687
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:25,427
they fought over the business.
But in the end...

688
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:29,640
The building removal
took everything away.

689
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,686
Hisao is the heir
of the Kuromura family.

690
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,815
Her son was taken to
Shimonoseki.

691
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:40,943
Even for Keiko,
that was hard on her.

692
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:45,739
I wish we could all
live happily.

693
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,908
Me too...

694
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,293
I need to check on the garden.

695
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:16,895
<i>It took several months for me
to find that out about her.</i>

696
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:19,231
That's how
distracted I can be...

697
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:25,529
That's Yamato.

698
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,448
That's Tone.

699
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:35,122
Sir. I was... just...

700
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:37,791
<i>"Military Police"</i>

701
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,795
I just wanted to send
a drawing to my nephew...

702
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:43,505
Does this girl live here?

703
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,757
The military police?

704
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:49,303
She was sketching
shorelines and ships.

705
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:50,554
That's espionage!

706
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,514
She may look innocent,

707
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:56,768
but who knows what nefarious
plots she is scheming!

708
00:48:57,853 --> 00:49:00,188
Her husband is a two-bit clerk

709
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:03,150
at the navy
court-martial office.

710
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:06,862
Has she attempted
to access military secrets?

711
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,490
Has she sent coded
transmissions?

712
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:13,535
Does she have a random
number table?

713
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:17,497
Is there anything suspicious
regarding her background? Well?

714
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:23,962
We will not arrest her today,
but keep a close eye on her.

715
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,340
After all, a daughter-in-law
was a stranger before!

716
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,937
I'm home.

717
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,690
The laundry is still outside.

718
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:45,859
Shusaku...

719
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,320
The military police
investigated Suzu and...

720
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:53,742
Suzu, come with me.

721
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:04,586
It's so small, you won't be able
to draw the shoreline.

722
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:12,719
Suzu, since you love to draw,
can you draw me sometime?

723
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:17,557
I don't know if I can
draw you well...

724
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:22,104
Suzu involved in espionage...?

725
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,983
Shusaku, you were lucky...

726
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:29,152
We couldn't be rude
to the MPs...

727
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:31,571
We had to hold back
our laughter.

728
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,032
Which only made it funnier.

729
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:42,708
This girl forgets everything
when she's focused on something.

730
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:47,170
Acting humble made her look
cunning and what not.

731
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:51,675
She's so clueless, she thought I
work as a store clerk.

732
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:55,429
Suzu a spy? Those Army
MPs are idiots!

733
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,599
I don't understand,
but it sounds funny!

734
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:06,106
<i>I wish we could all
live happily.</i>

735
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:07,733
Me too...

736
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,276
I'm home.

737
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:12,446
Dad's home! Let's tell him, too!

738
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,241
<i>Am I the only one who
doesn't find it funny?</i>

739
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,332
August 1944

740
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:27,961
<i>Even in war,
cicadas cry and butterflies fly.</i>

741
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:31,256
<i>"Sugar rations end in August"</i>

742
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:33,175
No more sugar?

743
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,720
We thought the war
would hit home soon

744
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,681
when all the air raids
happened in June...

745
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:43,435
<i>Wonder where it is now?</i>

746
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,856
Ouch.

747
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,816
I'm sorry, Harumi.

748
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:53,445
I'm okay. I was
looking at the ants.

749
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:58,158
I wonder where they're going...

750
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,139
Sugar is precious right now!

751
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:32,109
We need to hide it
from the ants.

752
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:35,904
But where?

753
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:41,952
What's wrong?

754
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,954
We thought putting it

755
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:47,624
in the water would keep
the ants from it.

756
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,970
Here, buy some at the
black market.

757
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:06,059
Roads I usually don't travel.

758
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,063
Eat up!

759
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,696
We're supposed to be low on
everything.

760
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,990
What are all these
people doing here?

761
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:24,536
What?

762
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:28,748
This is a fine rice from Taiwan.

763
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:32,919
I could get some Japanese rice,
too.

764
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:37,674
I thought we were not supposed
to grow watermelons now.

765
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,428
They have everything here.

766
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:48,560
<i>It's like summer breaks
before the war.</i>

767
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:51,354
Sugar is 20 yen.

768
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,941
That's fifty times the
ration price!

769
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:57,944
The price will only go up now.

770
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,573
<i>With mother's money and this
month's budget,</i>

771
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,366
<i>I only have 25 yen.</i>

772
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:04,492
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:41,196
Wait, that's Nagasako.

782
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:43,031
Isn't it over there?

783
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,199
It's that way.

784
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,258

785
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,554
It's okay.

00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:08,556

Yes.

788

789
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:12,269
Yes.

00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:13,436
You're lost?

Yes.

792
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,773
Even though you're a grown-up?

793
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,775
Where did you come from?

794
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,527
<i>Naganoki.</i>

795
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:24,072
Miss, no one will give me
directions

796
00:55:24,281 --> 00:55:26,908
and everyone
smells very nice.

797
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,869
Am I in a fairy tale palace?

798
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:31,162
For Naganoki,

799
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:36,042
you turn that corner and go down
to the post office...

800
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,044
Wait here.

801
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,840
Madam, I have a question.

802
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:53,310
Go straight and turn right
when you pass the post office.

803
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:55,687
Thank you so much.

804
00:55:56,521 --> 00:56:00,066
People around here are not
well informed.

805
00:56:00,317 --> 00:56:04,404
Most of us aren't locals and
we stay within these gates.

806
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:09,159
Are you also from South
Hiroshima? Near the ocean?

807
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:11,578
I am. But how did you...?

808
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:12,787
Your accent...

809
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:14,956
Are you from Eba?

810
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:16,958
From Kusatsu.

811
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,710
Kusatsu!

812
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:22,630
I had watermelon at my grandma's
every summer.

813
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:27,677
We were poor, so I always ate
the rinds people left behind.

814
00:56:28,345 --> 00:56:30,638
I met a kind person once though,

815
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,600
so I finally could have the red flesh.

816
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,728
It was a long time ago.

817
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,898
You draw very well.

818
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:43,360
Looking at them... can you...

819
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:48,114
Sure! I'll draw
whatever you want.

820
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:50,575
Mint candy and bracken dumpling!

821
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,369
Mint candy.

822
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:56,664
And ice cream with
wafers on top.

823
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:57,874
Wafer?

824
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,668
What? You've never
been to a cafe?

825
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:01,669
Rin!

826
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,255
Stop playing around so much.

827
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:07,050
Sorry, I have to go.

828
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:09,719
I'll come back another time
with more drawings.

829
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:13,139
Don't.

830
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,600
You shouldn't come back here.

831
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,564
You'll get lost again.

832
00:57:42,419 --> 00:57:44,587
What took you so long?

833
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,549
Did you get lost or something?

834
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,848
Keiko, what is an ice cream with
wafers in a cafe?

835
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,433
You don't know?

836
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:00,019
Well. It's sweet and cold.

837
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,398
You eat it with a
crispy cracker.

838
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:06,359
Ah, wonderful...

839
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:07,735
Wait...

840
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:15,952
Thinking about desserts
makes water taste sweet.

841
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:23,209
September 1944

842
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,044
<i>It's still very hot.</i>

843
00:58:26,296 --> 00:58:27,422
Mrs. Houjo,

844
00:58:28,298 --> 00:58:30,425
you got a phone call.

845
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:34,012
Yes? A phone call for me?

846
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:38,766
Ah, this is what he wants.

847
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:41,436
The heat is not letting up.

848
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:44,564
You'll embarrass Shusaku
dressed like that!

849
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:57,243
Still some time,
let's take a walk.

850
00:58:57,452 --> 00:59:00,580
How goes it with the GKF?

851
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:02,165
Things are quite laid back.

852
00:59:02,332 --> 00:59:05,752
Good! Let's have a cold beer, then.

853
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,173
<i>"Kure Navy Court-Martial Office"</i>

854
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:25,063
Shusaku, I've brought
your notebook.

855
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,023
What?

856
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:34,572
Suzu? You're very pale,
are you okay?

857
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:37,242
I guess I look funny, right?

858
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:40,328
No. I'm happy if you're okay.

859
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,247
Let's go then.

860
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:44,832
Go? What about work?

861
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,125
I used the excuse that

862
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:48,461
you needed to bring me
that notebook.

863
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:52,632
You had fun shopping in
the city, right?

864
00:59:55,885 --> 00:59:58,972
What's the matter? Are you ill?

865
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:01,599
I don't want you seeing me
smiling ear to ear!

866
01:00:07,397 --> 01:00:09,691
I wanted to take you to
the cinema, but...

867
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:14,612
I guess a big ship is
back in port.

868
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:18,283
Sailors need their break.

869
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,828
We'll go another time.

870
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:26,040
Suzu?

871
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:29,711
A classmate of mine from
elementary school

872
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,254
became a sailor.

873
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,215
What if I bump into him?

874
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:36,759
Then you just say hi.

875
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:44,183
I might wake from this dream
if I met someone from my past.

876
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:45,893
Dream?

877
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:49,272
Changing my name and
moving was hard for me,

878
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:55,194
but you're so kind to me.
And I've made friends.

879
01:00:56,821 --> 01:01:02,327
I don't want to wake up because
I'm happy to be who I am today.

880
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:03,911
I see.

881
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:08,958
The past and the paths we did
not choose,

882
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,127
they're like a dream.

883
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,339
Suzu, choosing to marry you,

884
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:17,300
was the best
decision of my life.

885
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:22,096
I'm worried that
you've lost weight.

886
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:26,517
I suppose I've lost my
appetite lately.

887
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,526
Here. Eat for two people!

888
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:39,947
<i>"Clinic"</i>

889
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:46,704
You had a lot for breakfast.
This should be enough.

890
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:50,541
<i>Eating for only one after all.</i>

891
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:53,920
Ready port entry. Slow ahead.
Reduce 2 knots.

892
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,254
December 1944

893
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:57,006
Aye, sir. Slow ahead.
Reduce 2 knots.

894
01:01:57,006 --> 01:01:58,341
Aye-aye, sir.

895
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:03,638
I'll go ask for you.

896
01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:05,431
Thanks.

897
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:07,266
Hello?

898
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,936
A real sailor!

899
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:14,857
We bumped into each
other at the well.

900
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:18,403
I'm Tetsu Mizuhara, an
Aoba crewmember.

901
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:21,614
Isn't Aoba a Class A cruiser?

902
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:23,574
Stop, Harumi.

903
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:29,497
You're tanned even in winter.

904
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:33,251
So you're here to take a bath?

905
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:36,421
"Bath shore leave"
means free time,

906
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:38,715
and I had nowhere to go.

907
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,884
So I thought of Suzu,
a friend from back home.

908
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:45,263
Thank you for taking
care of Suzu.

909
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:49,809
Suzu was only good at drawing
and making seaweed.

910
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:52,186
She must be quite useless here.

911
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,733
I'll take her off your
hands anytime!

912
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:05,616
Stop being so cocky!
And don't call me by my first name!

913
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:10,288
What? I can't call you
Urano anymore.

914
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:11,706
What?

915
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:14,459
Suzu, you can't hit a sailor.

916
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:25,928
What's so funny?

917
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:29,348
You. You're so normal.

918
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:31,684
This is delicious!

919
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,311
It's nothing special.

920
01:03:33,603 --> 01:03:36,314
This is heaven.

921
01:03:36,606 --> 01:03:37,857
Suzu, come join me!

922
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,484
Are you crazy?

923
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,819
Suzu, where's the lamp?

924
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:44,822
I think it's in the shelter.

925
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:46,157
Right...

926
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:50,161
I'm gonna be a sailor
when I grow up.

927
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:52,371
That's great.

928
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:54,624
Thank you.

929
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:55,917
What do you say?

930
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:57,710
Good night.

931
01:03:58,586 --> 01:03:59,962
Good night.

932
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,716
There's nothing like
being on dry land.

933
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:06,052
I'm going to bed.

934
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:09,055
How is Aoba?

935
01:04:09,222 --> 01:04:12,099
We came back from
Manila with the wounded.

936
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:14,101
It's a great ship,

937
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,605
but it's without victory
or defeat, again.

938
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,691
Feeling left behind, alive,

939
01:04:20,942 --> 01:04:22,652
while others have
already died...

940
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:25,321
Makes me feel anxious...

941
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,909
Mr. Mizuhara, with my father
away on duty,

942
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,078
I'm the head of this family.

943
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:36,290
I'm sorry, but I can't let you
sleep in this house.

944
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:41,629
What?

945
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:44,215
I asked him to sleep in
the storeroom.

946
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:45,925
That was quite a sight.

947
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:49,387
I can't remember ever seeing you
being so assertive.

948
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:54,100
I readied the bed warmer.
Take it to him.

949
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:57,937
Talk to him. It may be the
last time you see him.

950
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,788
I'm sorry about the room.

951
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,876
It's heaven compared
to a hammock.

952
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:23,212
We have lots to
talk about. Come.

953
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:24,422
Okay.

954
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:30,678
Here. This is for you.

955
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:31,721
Really?

956
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:36,642
Are you making a pen?

957
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:39,437
There...

958
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,363
It works.

959
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:54,702
It looked like a heron,
but I saw it in the South.

960
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:57,288
I didn't know they migrated.

961
01:05:57,538 --> 01:05:58,664
Me neither.

962
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:02,668
Back in Eba,
they just stood in the river.

963
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:06,422
There were lots in Eba.

964
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:10,718
No, I can't draw it very well.

965
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,554
That's hard to believe.

966
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:17,934
Wait. You haven't
drawn in a while?

967
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:19,518
Well...

968
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,732
That drawing of white
rabbit waves...

969
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:26,859
Yes, I remember.

970
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:30,029
It caused a lot of trouble.

971
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,657
Really?

972
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:34,992
You forgot?

973
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:38,996
Our teacher entered it
into a contest.

974
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:43,960
Everyone loved that drawing,
and I didn't know what to do.

975
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:49,548
They all thought I drew it,
when actually the real artist...

976
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,592
Was you.

977
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:02,561
Suzu, you are so warm,

978
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:04,897
Suzu, you are so soft,

979
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:06,399
and sweet.

980
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:11,612
Mizuhara...

981
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:16,283
I've been waiting for
this moment forever.

982
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:19,620
You coming for me...

983
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:24,500
You finally being here...
But I...

984
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:30,214
I'm so angry at him! It
boils my blood!

985
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:33,968
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

986
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:36,178
I understand.

987
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,347
You love him.

988
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:39,765
I do.

989
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:44,270
You're surprisingly normal.

990
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,396
I'm sorry.

991
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:50,276
You still get angry and
apologize for ordinary things.

992
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:52,570
You want to stay?

993
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,657
I thought you were forced to get
married and needed help.

994
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:58,034
No...

995
01:07:58,451 --> 01:07:59,910
Then it's all good.

996
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:04,206
Is he four years older?

997
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:05,916
Shusaku?

998
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,461
He's the same age as my brother.

999
01:08:09,712 --> 01:08:14,884
Our family was poor, so he chose
a tuition-free naval academy.

1000
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:18,387
But when my brother died,
I signed up to join the Navy.

1001
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:21,098
They were ordinary choices,

1002
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:25,644
but somewhere along the way,
I derailed from the ordinary.

1003
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:27,813
That's why...

1004
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,817
I'm relieved to see that
you haven't changed.

1005
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:34,987
So don't revere me
when I'm gone.

1006
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:38,866
Smile when you think of me.

1007
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:44,288
I want you to stay ordinary and
sane in this world

1008
01:08:44,497 --> 01:08:45,831
until the end.

1009
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:47,500
Suzu.

1010
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,418
You're beautiful.

1011
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,462
You idiot!

1012
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:54,840
Since childhood,

1013
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:58,010
I've never been able to tell you
how I really feel.

1014
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:02,014
<i>"Tetsu, thank you for
staying alive."</i>

1015
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:06,393
"Army Private First
Class Yoichi Urano"

1016
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:09,522
February 1945

1017
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:13,734
Welcome home.

1018
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,405
They sent us a single rock
instead of his bones.

1019
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:20,449
This perplexed Sumi, so...

1020
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,244
Is this Yoichi's brain?

1021
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:25,955
Was her guess.

1022
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:27,790
What was he like?

1023
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:31,710
They called us up in the
cold for this?

1024
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:34,338
There's no way Yoichi is dead.

1025
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,341
People are gone just like that.

1026
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:43,264
Our voices can't reach
those no longer with us.

1027
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:46,225
Shusaku.

1028
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:51,063
I wanted to thank you.

1029
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:55,818
For giving me the time
to <i>talk</i> to Mizuhara.

1030
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:58,028
It's nothing.

1031
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:01,740
But doesn't marriage
mean more to you?

1032
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:07,454
I forced you to marry me.

1033
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:13,085
And yet you've never shown
your angry face to me.

1034
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:16,505
I'm showing it to you now.

1035
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:19,842
Oh, so now you're mad?

1036
01:10:20,509 --> 01:10:22,845
You need to pay attention!

1037
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:24,346
Oh yeah?

1038
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:29,393
Why did you have to wear
socks with holes today?

1039
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:32,897
The one you sewed
last night were too tight.

1040
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:34,481
Wear something else!

1041
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:38,402
Could you sort out
that argument at home?

1042
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,323
You're going the
wrong way again.

1043
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:44,074
I know.

1044
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:47,494
Our house is toward Mt.
Haigamine.

1045
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,246
I said, I know!

1046
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:55,920
<i>It snowed a lot that winter.</i>

1047
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:58,839
<i>I couldn't wait for
spring to come.</i>

1048
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:01,967
<i>More vivid than indigo</i>

1049
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,220
March 19th, 1945

1050
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:07,723
The big blue sky

1051
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:11,685
Opens right up

1052
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:16,065
With white roses
adorning everywhere

1053
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:22,905
Like wallpaper,
going on forever.

1054
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,199
Don't worry.

1055
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:29,787
No teacher will scold a
well-behaved child like you.

1056
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:33,290
Really? School isn't scary?

1057
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:36,085
It's not. You'll make friends,
too.

1058
01:11:36,252 --> 01:11:39,630
I didn't know anyone here at
first,

1059
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:42,841
but now everyone
is my friend.

1060
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:45,052
My mommy, too?

1061
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:47,805
Well...

1062
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:51,934
What?

1063
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:38,230
Watch your head!

1064
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,691
Harumi!

1065
01:13:03,756 --> 01:13:06,884
If only I had paint and
paper with me...

1066
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:11,430
Damn it, what am I thinking!

1067
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:13,515
Hey!

1068
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,225
What are you doing?

1069
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:17,811
Stand back! Take cover!

1070
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:20,397
Welcome home!

1071
01:13:22,316 --> 01:13:28,489
That air raid alert is way too
late. Watch out for shrapnel.

1072
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,463
Ouch!

1073
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,802
Can you hear that?

1074
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:54,264
Our 2,000 horsepower engines
sound wonderful.

1075
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:58,185
That's why we work day and night
at the factory,

1076
01:13:58,394 --> 01:14:00,479
to improve their efficiency.

1077
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:07,403
We've come a long way from the
Type 91500 horsepower engines.

1078
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:14,618
<i>We strive to improve our skills,</i>

1079
01:14:15,786 --> 01:14:20,082
<i>a light of hope for world peace.</i>

1080
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:26,130
<i>A unified
determination and goal...</i>

1081
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,715
What about their engines?

1082
01:14:30,676 --> 01:14:32,886
What's their horsepower?

1083
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:35,055
Mr. Houjo?

1084
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:43,605
Air raid all clear!

1085
01:14:47,151 --> 01:14:49,695
I know you worked all night,

1086
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:53,949
but how could you fall
asleep during an air raid?

1087
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:55,325
There, there.

1088
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:57,327
I was so scared.

1089
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:00,080
<i>We caught many fish in
Kure that day.</i>

1090
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,915
It's tiny.

1091
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:05,461
It'll be big if you
draw it bigger.

1092
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,966
04:50 hours, March 29th, 1945

1093
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:14,052
Air raid alert! Ready
air raid gear!

1094
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,763
Put out all fires! Remove
sliding doors!

1095
01:15:17,014 --> 01:15:20,934
Grab survival kits and
head to bomb shelters!

1096
01:15:22,144 --> 01:15:25,939
Air raid alarm all clear.

1097
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:29,860
It's still raw...

1098
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:31,904
Poor Mrs. Kariya,

1099
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:33,030
March 31st, 1945

1100
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,324
She lost her husband in the war.

1101
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:38,410
Now her 17-year-old is
being drafted.

1102
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,621
Congratulations...

1103
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,125
22:10 hours, April 1st

1104
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:49,338
Ready air raid gear!
Remove sliding doors!

1105
01:15:49,338 --> 01:15:50,964
Survival kits...

1106
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:54,134
I can't see anything.

1107
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:57,262
Oops! Sorry!

1108
01:15:57,513 --> 01:15:59,473
Whose cat is that?

1109
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:05,062
23:45 hours, April 5th

1110
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,606
I'm tired of sirens.

1111
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:23,497
<i>Never seen that before...</i>

1112
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:34,258
April 6th, 1945

1113
01:16:34,925 --> 01:16:36,009
<i>17 large enemy aircraft</i>

1114
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,469
<i>currently above Mt. Tsuburayama.</i>

1115
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:40,764
May 5th, 1945

1116
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:46,311
Engagement ongoing. 30 aircraft
approaching from southeast.

1117
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:48,689
<i>Heading towards Kure.</i>

1118
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:54,111
Air raid alarm all clear.

1119
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:59,783
May 5th morning -- Air raid. 125
large enemy aircraft attacked.

1120
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:00,951
Damage to Hiro Naval Arsenal

1121
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,828
and Air Arsenal No. 11
was very limited.

1122
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,705
I'm home.

1123
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,708
Good. You're safe, Shusaku.

1124
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:08,959
Where's Father?

1125
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:12,254
- Not home... yet.
- I see.

1126
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,885
Suzu, it's boiling over.

1127
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:30,647
You're so small.

1128
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:35,944
You're small even
when you stand.

1129
01:17:36,987 --> 01:17:38,322
What is it?

1130
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:42,159
Nothing, You're small.
That's all.

1131
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:57,883
Your father will come
home safely.

1132
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,301
My military uniform arrived.

1133
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:00,302
What?

1134
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:02,596
It's wrapped up there.

1135
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:07,392
From the 15th,
I'll be a Chief Petty Officer.

1136
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:13,148
I'll go to Navy training and
won't be back for 3 months.

1137
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,235
Will you come back
after training?

1138
01:18:17,402 --> 01:18:18,654
I think so.

1139
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,823
But you'll be okay, Suzu.

1140
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:24,409
You're small,

1141
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:28,914
but you can protect this house
all on your own.

1142
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:33,210
I can't! That's impossible.

1143
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:41,385
I'm sorry. I lied.

1144
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:44,346
I'm so fond of you.

1145
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:49,267
But I might forget your face
after 3 months without you.

1146
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:51,061
Suzu...

1147
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:54,481
That's why I'll wait
for you here.

1148
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:58,110
Because I don't know
if I could find you otherwise.

1149
01:18:59,528 --> 01:19:02,406
Sunday, May 6th

1150
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:04,991
Tuesday, May 8th

1151
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:06,910
May 10th: One air-raid alert.

1152
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:08,537
May 11th: Two alerts.

1153
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:10,080
May 12th: No warnings.

1154
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:11,331
May 13th: Three air raid
warnings only.

1155
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:17,337
May 14th

1156
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:19,506
Will you not forget me if you draw me?

1157
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:21,967
It was a figure of speech.

1158
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:25,011
With you, it's possible.

1159
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:27,431
Let me see. Am I handsome?

1160
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:31,393
I can't show you.
It's top secret!

1161
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:40,527
May 15th

1162
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,159
I'm off.

1163
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:50,287
Take care.

1164
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,832
I'll walk you half way.

1165
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,041
Thanks.

1166
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,085
Military uniforms are so handsome!

1167
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:03,508
The house suddenly feels larger.

1168
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:08,597
June 21st

1169
01:20:08,597 --> 01:20:09,681
For the Houjo's.

1170
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:21,443
I thought he would've been
admitted to a hospital nearby.

1171
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:23,820
No wonder we couldn't find him.

1172
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:28,867
He's hurt but he'll be
discharged soon.

1173
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:33,580
Dad asked me to
repair his watch.

1174
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:40,337
It's a good chance to visit
the Kuromura family tomorrow.

1175
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:43,215
Where my brother is?

1176
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:44,883
I'll get ready.

1177
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,176
Can I come?

1178
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:50,263
- What about school?
- Don't worry.

1179
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:53,433
All you do is dig stuff
and physical training.

1180
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:58,522
<i>The hands of girls</i>

1181
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:02,776
<i>can also work for our country.</i>

1182
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:05,028
<i>We are all...</i>

1183
01:21:05,946 --> 01:21:07,739
This will take forever.

1184
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:12,994
I'll get the tickets.
Can you take Harumi to Dad?

1185
01:21:13,662 --> 01:21:16,373
All right. Let's go.

1186
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,625
Can we visit the Navy?

1187
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:19,918
Sure.

1188
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,047
Don't worry.

1189
01:21:24,256 --> 01:21:27,008
Push comes to shove,
use your bamboo spear!

1190
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:30,554
You idiot! I'm not scared
of ex-in-laws!

1191
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,306
You seemed worried so...

1192
01:21:33,515 --> 01:21:35,684
Bamboo spears won't be
useful anyhow.

1193
01:21:36,184 --> 01:21:38,186
Is Shimonoseki far?

1194
01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:39,521
Yes.

1195
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:41,189
Farther than Hiroshima?

1196
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:42,357
Way farther.

1197
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:43,525
Over there?

1198
01:21:43,692 --> 01:21:46,236
You have to stay quiet okay?

1199
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:53,201
Is this enemy's music?

1200
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,495
I'm sorry I got you worried.

1201
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:59,457
I've been unconscious.
I hear it's June already.

1202
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,543
I'm glad you're alive.

1203
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:05,130
We're gonna ride the train
and see my brother.

1204
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,924
Is that so? The
sooner the better.

1205
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:11,011
What ship were you in?

1206
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:13,263
Auxiliary minesweeper No.16.

1207
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:19,019
I've heard many things here.

1208
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:20,979
Hiro Arsenal closed down

1209
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:25,400
and there are rumors that we'll
be merged with the Army.

1210
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:28,695
Did you know that Yamato sunk?

1211
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,071
Yamato?

1212
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:35,285
Backed into a corner, she went
out with her guns blazing.

1213
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:40,248
The Seto Inland Sea is
no longer ours.

1214
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,919
Which means the white
rabbit are...

1215
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:45,921
- What?
- Nothing.

1216
01:22:45,921 --> 01:22:48,465
That's why I suggested,

1217
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:54,930
that Harumi should go live
with the Kuromuras. It's safer.

1218
01:22:56,932 --> 01:22:58,600
So that's why Keiko was...

1219
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,645
Suzu, can we go over there?

1220
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:05,273
I want to tell my brother
which ships I saw here.

1221
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:07,484
Not sure if we can see
them from there.

1222
01:23:07,776 --> 01:23:10,111
Just a peek!

1223
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:11,821
We can't see anything.

1224
01:23:14,074 --> 01:23:17,285
What should we do?
Can't go home...

1225
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:20,372
Need to find a public
bomb shelter.

1226
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:22,958
Are they really coming?

1227
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,919
We've had series of
false alarms.

1228
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:31,424
0923 hours, enemy aircraft
sighted southeast of Tokuyama.

1229
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:35,053
<i>About 20 large aircraft
heading to Kure</i>

1230
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:38,473
They're coming,

1231
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:40,642
Can you let us in?

1232
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:41,977
Come quickly.

1233
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,980
Evacuate! Run!

1234
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,443
I'm scared.

1235
01:23:50,694 --> 01:23:53,363
We'll be okay. Look.

1236
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:57,492
That's Mommy.

1237
01:23:57,951 --> 01:23:59,536
And who's this?

1238
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:01,037
Me...

1239
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:03,623
Your mommy is always with you.

1240
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,084
You're not from around here,
right?

1241
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:09,045
We're visiting from Naganoki.

1242
01:24:09,254 --> 01:24:11,506
Bad luck, huh?

1243
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:13,299
Cover your ears! Open your
mouth!

1244
01:24:13,508 --> 01:24:15,010
Or else your
eyes will pop out!

1245
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,179
It's so hot...

1246
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:19,848
Hang on...

1247
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:56,676
Excuse me. Can we
have some water?

1248
01:25:02,474 --> 01:25:04,434
Thank you very much.

1249
01:25:04,893 --> 01:25:08,438
Did we miss the train?

1250
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:11,816
Maybe the train is
waiting for people.

1251
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:13,568
Okay.

1252
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:22,327
I can't see.

1253
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:26,623
Are you all right?

1254
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,041
We're fine!

1255
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:32,462
Dud bombs may actually
have delayed fuses.

1256
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:33,671
Evacuate now!

1257
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:38,468
Yes! Thank you for
your hard work!

1258
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:40,178
Hey Suzu?

1259
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:43,556
Will you draw my
brother some time?

1260
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:46,351
Craters of unexploded
bombs are small...

1261
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:52,690
According to latest reports,
the enemy uses these bombs...

1262
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:55,568
Watch out, Harumi!

1263
01:26:32,188 --> 01:26:34,858
<i>Not again, not like that!</i>

1264
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:38,736
<i>No one will marry you
if you don't do it right.</i>

1265
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:45,285
<i>She warned me many times,
but somehow I did marry...</i>

1266
01:26:46,828 --> 01:26:48,288
<i>Watermelon.</i>

1267
01:26:49,164 --> 01:26:50,748
Bracken-dumplings.

1268
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:53,126
<i>Mint candy.</i>

1269
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:58,715
<i>I wish there had been a ditch
to jump into.</i>

1270
01:26:59,549 --> 01:27:02,385
I held my bag with my left hand.

1271
01:27:02,594 --> 01:27:05,680
I held Harumi with
my right hand.

1272
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:09,559
If only I had it the
other way around.

1273
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:14,647
<i>If I had at least run barefoot,</i>

1274
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:19,903
<i>We may have made it over the
hill... What was there anyway?</i>

1275
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:23,907
<i>That's the Tone and that's the Hyuga.</i>

1276
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:27,452
<i>Look, Mommy. It's the Yamato.</i>

1277
01:27:30,705 --> 01:27:31,831
<i>She...</i>

1278
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:37,545
<i>She looks so much like Shusaku.</i>

1279
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:41,007
You were there with her.

1280
01:27:42,008 --> 01:27:44,344
How could you let this happen?

1281
01:27:45,053 --> 01:27:48,348
I'm so sorry, Harumi.

1282
01:27:48,348 --> 01:27:49,807
I'm so sorry, Keiko.

1283
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,893
Murderer.

1284
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,062
You killed her!

1285
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:56,439
- Give her back.
- Stop, Keiko!

1286
01:27:56,648 --> 01:27:58,566
It's time for the tofu rations.

1287
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:05,156
She's not herself right now.
She didn't mean what she said.

1288
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:10,536
We're glad at least
you survived.

1289
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,497
<i>Really?</i>

1290
01:28:13,248 --> 01:28:17,543
<i>You can't lose your place
in this world so easily.</i>

1291
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,087
<i>Rin?</i>

1292
01:28:19,963 --> 01:28:24,092
<i>Where was my place in
that moment?</i>

1293
01:28:24,926 --> 01:28:29,055
<i>Those fences should've
had some gaps.</i>

1294
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:32,141
<i>If we had jumped through...</i>

1295
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,979
<i>To the other side, to
the other side...</i>

1296
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:38,815
June 28th

1297
01:28:38,815 --> 01:28:40,817
Not again.

1298
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:43,861
Ignore the siren.
They won't come.

1299
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:47,907
This house survived just fine?

1300
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:51,411
Yes. Don't worry.

1301
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:53,079
I'm glad.

1302
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:54,622
I lied.

1303
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:56,624
<i>I wonder...</i>

1304
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:03,840
Was it easier for her to leave?
With her house all destroyed.

1305
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:07,427
Don't strain yourself.

1306
01:29:07,427 --> 01:29:08,636
July 1st

1307
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:12,640
I'll take a break at
work if necessary.

1308
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,058
Be safe.

1309
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:19,480
The sun is out.

1310
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,899
I'll hang the bandages to dry.

1311
01:29:25,987 --> 01:29:29,282
<i>23:50. Chugoku air raid

<i>Enemy aircraft in Hiroshima Bay.</i>

1313
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:34,370
Can you get up?

1314
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:37,749
Yes.

<i>23:58 hours. Enemy aircraft
circling Kure and Hiroshima.</i>

1317
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:55,850
There's so many of them,
but can't see anything.

1318
01:29:59,771 --> 01:30:01,773
Are those parachute flares?

1319
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:07,278
Hurry, Suzu!

1320
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:28,716
Eighth squad, move!

1321
01:30:38,935 --> 01:30:42,647
Suzu, what are you doing? Hurry!

1322
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:51,155
Suzu? Suzu?

1323
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,960
One dropped here?

1324
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:07,505
Water! We need more water!

1325
01:31:08,798 --> 01:31:09,799
Okay.

1326
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:11,926
Ready...

1327
01:31:14,846 --> 01:31:16,055
Be careful.

1328
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:19,058
A formation is northbound
via Hiroshima Bay.

1329
01:31:19,058 --> 01:31:21,811
Another northbound via
Bungo Channel.

1330
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:26,149
Three are confirmed
in the seas south of Ashizuri.

1331

1332

<i>Hang on, people of Kure!</i>

1333
01:31:34,282 --> 01:31:36,701
Persevere, people of Kure!

1334
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,873
Anyone suffering hardship...

1335
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:47,253
Please grab rice balls
delivered from Hiroshima!

1336
01:31:47,545 --> 01:31:50,756
<i>Come get them at Nikou Park.</i>

1337
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:53,342
Where can I file a
damage report?

1338
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:54,969
Is City Hall still standing?

1339
01:31:55,136 --> 01:31:56,512
My house burned down.

1340
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,723
Avoiding the shelter saved us.

1341
01:31:59,056 --> 01:32:00,683
May I?

1342
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,643
Yes. Go ahead.

1343
01:32:04,896 --> 01:32:07,106
Eat one while it's still warm.

1344
01:32:07,315 --> 01:32:10,276
It cooked well as my house
burned down.

1345
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:13,446
Thank you.

1346
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,281
Keiko...?

1347
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:20,119
I've had enough of this heat.

1348
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,789
Is there anyone from Shinonome?

1349
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:28,836
The red-light district
burned to the ground.

1350
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:30,296
I see.

1351
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:34,175
Suzu!

1352
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:36,636
You're hurt.

1353
01:32:36,886 --> 01:32:38,763
- Your training?
- Cancelled.

1354
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:42,433
I'm glad that you're alive.

1355
01:32:43,309 --> 01:32:45,269
<i>As I faded away...</i>

1356
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:46,562
Suzu!

1357
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:52,860
<i>I heard myself say, "Find Rin."</i>

1358
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:56,864
I'm glad, anyhow...

1359
01:32:57,114 --> 01:32:59,492
I'm glad you're feeling better.

1360
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:02,328
I'm glad it was a dud.

1361
01:33:02,537 --> 01:33:04,288
I'm glad it was put out.

1362
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:07,124
I'm glad you're getting better.

1363
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,334
<i>I'm glad.</i>

1364
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:11,254
<i>I'm glad... I'm glad...</i>

1365
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:16,425
<i>I don't know what
I should be glad about.</i>

1366
01:33:17,802 --> 01:33:21,472
<i>My right hand that held

1375

<i>My right hand that drew

1376
01:33:57,425 --> 01:33:59,927
<i>My hand that loved to cook...</i>

1377
01:34:00,845 --> 01:34:05,641
<i>My right hand that drew

1378
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,228
Your sister is here!

1379
01:34:09,395 --> 01:34:12,023
What a disaster, Suzu.

1380
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:16,152
Sumi, thanks for coming.

1381
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,365
The army officer gave me
a lift on the relief truck.

1382
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:23,909
What is that?

1383
01:34:24,493 --> 01:34:27,163
It's not new, but it's
pure cotton.

1384
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:28,748
Not rayon?

1385
01:34:28,748 --> 01:34:30,416
No, so it's strong.

1386
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:46,223
Thank you.

1387
01:34:50,436 --> 01:34:54,899
These are loquats from Mt. Eba.

1388
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:56,734
Are you sure?

1389
01:34:56,901 --> 01:35:00,488
I need to exercise.
Let me walk you half-way.

1390
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:03,866
I'm meeting him at the
fire station.

1391
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:06,827
It's near the scaffold
by the river,

1392
01:35:07,078 --> 01:35:09,246
or did that burn down, too?

1393
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:14,502
It's still there. The army
officer showed it to me.

1394
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:17,296
He's young but very kind.

1395
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:20,591
He's been giving me his meal
tickets and other things.

1396
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,805
He remembered that I have
a sister who moved to Kure.

1397
01:35:26,013 --> 01:35:27,223
You like him?

1398
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:30,309
Oh please, Suzu.

1399
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,311
Ouch.

1400
01:35:35,606 --> 01:35:37,650
This is horrible.

1401
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:52,081
It's so sad that Kure
keeps being targeted.

1402
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:58,504
You must find it hard to be here
not being able to do housework.

1403
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:05,636
Suzu, why don't you
come home to Hiroshima?

1404
01:36:06,846 --> 01:36:08,931
The bombings aren't as bad.

1405
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:13,769
With our brother gone,
no one will pick on you.

1406
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:18,023
I suppose...

1407
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:22,653
I know. I'll come back if your
officer friend is handsome.

1408
01:36:22,862 --> 01:36:25,072
Why, that's so improper!

1409
01:36:25,364 --> 01:36:27,575
I'm kidding! See you again!

1410
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:28,659

1411

01:36:31,871 --> 01:36:36,834
Come home for the
festival next month.

1413
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:39,170

Yes! Fly away as far as you can,

over the mountain, to Hiroshima!

1429

Do you want to die?

1430
01:38:48,382 --> 01:38:52,678
I'm sorry. I saw a white heron flying.

1431
01:38:54,263 --> 01:38:56,307
Oh, it fled from the beach.

1432

Shusaku, I'm going home

01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:25,669
Tell me why, then!

1440
01:39:26,921 --> 01:39:32,176
Suzu, I really enjoyed these
18 months we've spent together.

1441
01:39:32,176 --> 01:39:34,303
I loved coming home to you,

I loved walking with you

1461
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:15,863
About 10 o'clock.

1462
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,201
You need to change.

1463
01:41:22,494 --> 01:41:23,495
Here.

1464
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:35,090
Excuse me...

1465
01:41:36,008 --> 01:41:38,969
I guess we won't need
to wash this.

1466
01:41:40,429 --> 01:41:44,183
Isn't your hometown's
festival today?

1467
01:41:44,975 --> 01:41:48,771
Yes. I was going to
go home last weekend,

1468
01:41:48,771 --> 01:41:52,191
but I couldn't get
an appointment until today.

1469
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:56,987
Don't look!

1470
01:41:57,196 --> 01:41:58,572
I'm sorry.

1471
01:41:59,656 --> 01:42:04,536
You'll never make it today.
Doctors are busy too, you know.

1472
01:42:05,079 --> 01:42:09,291
You'll need a referral as well.

1473
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:12,669
Train tickets are usually sold
out anyway.

1474
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:19,426
Here, I've fixed your
sister's kimono.

1475
01:42:20,052 --> 01:42:22,930
I added rubber straps so you can
wear it easily.

1476
01:42:23,138 --> 01:42:25,182
They're all I
could scrap together.

1477
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,685
Thank you very much...

1478
01:42:32,356 --> 01:42:36,902
I'm sorry I blamed you
for Harumi's death.

1479
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,946
It's okay.

1480
01:42:38,946 --> 01:42:40,823
<i>"Kuromura Clockwork"</i>

1481
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:43,617
The man I loved died young.

1482
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:46,495
My shop was destroyed.

1483
01:42:47,246 --> 01:42:49,331
I can't see my children anymore.

1484
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:53,460
But my own choices led me here.

1485
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:59,675
You had no choice, though.
You were brought here.

1486
01:42:59,675 --> 01:43:01,760
You did what you were told.

1487
01:43:03,178 --> 01:43:06,181
What a boring life this
must've been.

1488
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:14,815
You're welcome to stay here
or go anywhere you choose.

1489
01:43:15,149 --> 01:43:18,318
Stop worrying and
choose for yourself.

1490
01:43:29,746 --> 01:43:32,499
Keiko. Did you see that flash?

1491
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,001
I did!

1492
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,629
Could it be lightning
in this weather?

1493
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:40,215
I... changed my mind...

1494
01:43:40,424 --> 01:43:42,426
Can you wash this, please?

1495
01:43:43,552 --> 01:43:48,599
And please, would you
let me stay?

1496
01:43:48,849 --> 01:43:52,769
Yes, now let me go. It's
too hot for that!

1497
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,906
What was that?

1498
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:09,203
The JOFK isn't coming in.

1499
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:10,662
The other stations?

1500
01:44:10,662 --> 01:44:11,747
Hey!

1501
01:44:12,748 --> 01:44:14,583
Come over here and look.

1502
01:44:18,503 --> 01:44:21,340
What is that cloud?

1503
01:44:22,424 --> 01:44:23,467
Cloud?

1504
01:44:24,301 --> 01:44:27,763
Look at that big cloud.
It's an anvil cloud.

1505
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:33,644
<i>This is Okayama Broadcasting.
Hiroshima, do you read me?</i>

1506
01:44:35,687 --> 01:44:40,859
I found a flyer from all the way
from Hiroshima on the street.

1507
01:44:48,242 --> 01:44:51,954
Anyone available, please come to
the settlement house.

1508
01:44:53,455 --> 01:44:55,749
Chita, aren't you a nurse?

1509
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:59,419
Yes, but I've never
made sandals.

1510
01:44:59,586 --> 01:45:01,713
No one around here has.

1511
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:03,715
Is this okay?

1512
01:45:04,549 --> 01:45:07,803
It's frustrating with one hand.

1513
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,346
Now you're just gloating...

1514
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,224
What are these sandals for?

1515
01:45:12,432 --> 01:45:14,184
They're for Hiroshima.

1516
01:45:14,393 --> 01:45:18,563
That flash melted the roads so
shoes are no good.

1517
01:45:19,398 --> 01:45:20,857
Can I come too?

1518
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:22,359
The wounded must stay.

1519
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:25,779
My son is a soldier
in Hiroshima.

1520
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:28,240
You can join us tomorrow.

1521
01:45:28,448 --> 01:45:33,370
Hiroshima helped us before,
now it's our turn to help them.

1522
01:45:36,373 --> 01:45:39,835
My hair won't get in the way
now. Take me, please.

1523
01:45:40,085 --> 01:45:41,128
I said no!

1524
01:45:41,878 --> 01:45:45,424
Silly girl. I'll trim your hair
when we get home.

1525
01:45:45,632 --> 01:45:49,511
My husband is going to
Hiroshima soon.

1526
01:45:49,678 --> 01:45:52,347
I hear it was a new
type of bomb.

1527
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:54,016
Oh no.

1528
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:55,809
Suzu, your family...

1529
01:45:56,018 --> 01:45:57,102
Mum!

1530
01:45:58,145 --> 01:46:02,065
The navy base sent a
relief party.

1531
01:46:12,117 --> 01:46:14,786
<i>You came from Hiroshima, too?</i>

1532
01:46:29,843 --> 01:46:31,636
He died sitting here.

1533
01:46:32,512 --> 01:46:35,432
He walked all the way
from Hiroshima.

1534
01:46:35,766 --> 01:46:38,226
But we couldn't tell
who he was...

1535
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:40,187
Because his face and
clothes had melted...

1536
01:46:40,437 --> 01:46:42,564
Let's not tell Mrs. Houjo.

1537
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:46,735
I can't face her. I feel so bad.

1538
01:46:49,071 --> 01:46:53,867
I picked eucalyptus leaves
to keep mosquitoes away.

1539
01:46:54,701 --> 01:46:58,288
Thank you. Stay strong, okay?

1540
01:46:58,497 --> 01:47:03,627
I will. Their names are, Juro,
Kiseno and Sumi Urano.

1541
01:47:03,877 --> 01:47:04,878
Understood.

1542
01:47:05,087 --> 01:47:08,590
And also Ito, Marina and Chizuko
Morita.

1543
01:47:10,509 --> 01:47:14,513
<i>I want to stay strong.
Kind but strong.</i>

1544
01:47:15,305 --> 01:47:17,349
<i>Like the people of Kure.</i>

1545
01:47:17,933 --> 01:47:19,684
Ah, this rubbish again...

1546
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:22,479
We'll never surrender
to violence.

1547
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:24,314
August 9th

1548
01:47:24,314 --> 01:47:25,690
Please let me stay.

1549
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:27,067
Forever.

1550
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:31,822
You had me worried. You dummy.

1551
01:47:31,988 --> 01:47:34,991
Dummy, dummy...

1552
01:47:34,991 --> 01:47:36,493
I'm sorry.

1553
01:47:38,078 --> 01:47:43,166
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1554
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:44,960
I missed all of them.

1555
01:47:45,168 --> 01:47:48,505
I'd never hear the end of it
if the Navy knew...

1556
01:47:49,506 --> 01:47:51,967
Suzu, this is US propaganda.

1557
01:47:52,217 --> 01:47:55,846
It should be handed to
the authorities.

1558
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:58,723
They'll burn it anyway.

1559
01:47:58,932 --> 01:48:03,061
So I gather them
to use them as toilet paper.

1560
01:48:03,228 --> 01:48:07,399
I see, then we can't let people
use our toilet for a while.

1561
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:11,528
Our battle is to survive
with whatever we have.

1562
01:48:11,778 --> 01:48:12,821
I suppose.

1563
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,656
Please, come in.

1564
01:48:14,656 --> 01:48:15,782
August 15th

1565
01:48:15,782 --> 01:48:17,159
Hello.

1566
01:48:18,702 --> 01:48:23,039
<i>We are keenly aware of the
innermost feelings of all of you,</i>

1567
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:28,086
<i>Our subjects. However, it is
according to the dictates of</i>

1568
01:48:28,086 --> 01:48:29,171
time and fate that

1569
01:48:29,379 --> 01:48:32,466
<i>We have resolved to pave the
way for a grand peace</i>

1570
01:48:32,674 --> 01:48:38,138
<i>for all the generations to come
by enduring the unendurable and</i>

1571
01:48:38,346 --> 01:48:42,434
<i>suffering what is insufferable.</i>

1572
01:48:42,684 --> 01:48:46,313
Thus ends the His Majesty the
Emperor's honorable broadcast.

1573
01:48:46,563 --> 01:48:47,981
Oh well. It's finally over.

1574
01:48:47,981 --> 01:48:49,024
So, this means...

1575
01:48:49,191 --> 01:48:51,651
We lost the war?

1576
01:48:52,194 --> 01:48:53,320
Why?

1577
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:56,615
They dropped those new bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1578
01:48:56,615 --> 01:49:00,410
The Soviets have declared war.
We couldn't possibly win.

1579
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:04,456
They knew what we were getting
into, didn't they?

1580
01:49:04,456 --> 01:49:07,167
They said we would
fight to the end!

1581
01:49:07,626 --> 01:49:10,003
There's five of us still here!

1582
01:49:10,003 --> 01:49:13,548
I still have my left arm
and both legs.

1583
01:49:21,264 --> 01:49:22,849
Harumi.

1584
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,435
Harumi...

1585
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:36,279
<i>Everything we've
done slips away.</i>

1586
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:39,366
<i>Everything we've come
to terms with.</i>

1587
01:49:40,033 --> 01:49:42,702
<i>The reasons why we've
endured it all.</i>

1588
01:49:45,539 --> 01:49:52,546
<i>Rice and soybeans grown overseas,
that's what my body is made of.</i>

1589
01:49:53,672 --> 01:49:57,092
<i>So we surrender to violence?</i>

1590
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:04,683
If only I could stay distracted
and oblivious until I die.

1591
01:50:17,529 --> 01:50:21,825
I stocked this for
our last meal.

1592
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:26,246
So let's enjoy white
rice tonight.

1593
01:50:26,663 --> 01:50:28,206
But not all of it.

1594
01:50:28,456 --> 01:50:32,168
There's still a tomorrow
and the day after that.

1595
01:50:38,008 --> 01:50:41,344
<i>August 15th and 16th...</i>

1596
01:50:43,471 --> 01:50:44,764
<i>and 17th.</i>

1597
01:50:46,516 --> 01:50:47,851
<i>September.</i>

1598
01:50:48,893 --> 01:50:52,939
<i>October, November and next year.</i>

1599
01:50:53,815 --> 01:50:56,234
<i>A year later, 10 years later.</i>

1600
01:50:57,652 --> 01:50:59,946
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

1601
01:51:09,748 --> 01:51:13,668
Look, it's a glorious white!

1602
01:51:13,877 --> 01:51:15,670
We only have rice.

1603
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,423
Not to worry. Where's Shusaku?

1604
01:51:18,673 --> 01:51:19,841
Not home, yet.

1605
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:22,218
I suppose it's the
legal office's job

1606
01:51:22,427 --> 01:51:24,429
to keep order in
times like this.

1607
01:51:25,096 --> 01:51:26,765
Let's start eating.

1608
01:51:29,017 --> 01:51:31,936
No more bombs, so no more
floating fish.

1609
01:51:32,187 --> 01:51:34,481
I remember that time, yes.

1610
01:51:45,617 --> 01:51:49,621
What are we doing? I can't see
my beautiful white rice.

1611
01:52:01,049 --> 01:52:02,384
October 6th

1612
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:06,888
They'll be landing soon.
I'll be stationed in Ootake.

1613
01:52:07,347 --> 01:52:14,062
As long as our navy stands, it's
our obligation to keep order.

1614
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:16,648
<i>In times like this...</i>

1615
01:52:17,315 --> 01:52:23,363
<i>I wish I had both hands, so I
could hold his to comfort him.</i>

1616
01:52:24,781 --> 01:52:25,907
It's so quiet.

1617
01:52:26,116 --> 01:52:27,784
Everything's ready.

1618
01:52:28,326 --> 01:52:31,121
Thank you. Here is fine.

1619
01:52:32,455 --> 01:52:35,083
Go back home quickly.

1620
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:36,501
Goodbye.

1621
01:52:39,462 --> 01:52:43,425
I'll be back! I'll
come home to you!

1622
01:52:44,342 --> 01:52:45,343
Yes!

1623
01:52:46,594 --> 01:52:47,721
"Rice rations postponed"

1624
01:52:47,721 --> 01:52:50,557
<i>We haven't had salt or
soy sauce for quite a while.</i>

1625
01:52:50,557 --> 01:52:54,853
November 1945

1626
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:57,188
Keiko!

1627
01:52:57,397 --> 01:53:00,525
Hi Suzu, do you know
what this queue is for?

1628
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:03,403
No idea, but I'll take
anything gladly.

1629
01:53:03,611 --> 01:53:05,321
We're short on everything.

1630
01:53:05,697 --> 01:53:07,073
Well, that's true.

1631
01:53:08,366 --> 01:53:11,161
The city has changed.

1632
01:53:13,163 --> 01:53:15,874
I wonder if Hisao begs for chocolate too.

1633
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:18,251
Would Harumi have done the same?

1634
01:53:18,418 --> 01:53:22,213
It's leftovers of the
occupation army.

1635
01:53:24,674 --> 01:53:26,384
Paper waste?

1636
01:53:37,145 --> 01:53:39,272
So... delicious!

1637
01:53:41,858 --> 01:53:44,444
This one's flavorless.

1638
01:53:45,653 --> 01:53:50,408
I gave the Americans directions
and they gave me chocolate.

1639
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:54,579
With that hair style,
they thought you were a child.

1640
01:54:00,835 --> 01:54:04,047
You exchanged so many clothes.

1641
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:05,924
It's all right.

1642
01:54:06,633 --> 01:54:08,051
Didn't you hear?

1643
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:13,264
The dead soldier found next to
the settlement house was my son.

1644
01:54:14,265 --> 01:54:17,393
I couldn't recognize my own son.

1645
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:21,523
You lost Harumi in
front of your eyes.

1646
01:54:22,732 --> 01:54:25,693
Yes. It was awful.

1647
01:54:29,113 --> 01:54:30,323
<i>Suzu.</i>

1648
01:54:32,116 --> 01:54:33,243
<i>Suzu.</i>

1649
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:38,248
<i>Smile, when you think of me.</i>

1650
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:44,546
<i>I want you to stay
ordinary and sane.</i>

1651
01:54:46,047 --> 01:54:47,173
<i>Suzu.</i>

1652
01:54:47,465 --> 01:54:52,053
<i>Harumi. I can see the ship now.</i>

1653
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:55,348
<i>It's the Aoba.</i>

1654
01:54:58,142 --> 01:55:02,480
<i>Tetsu, I just saw it in
your smile...</i>

1655
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:08,820
<i>The sea with white rabbits,
the sky with white herons...</i>

1656
01:55:13,074 --> 01:55:18,955
Harumi always laughed, so I'll
laugh whenever I think of her.

1657
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:23,376
From now on, this body will
be here to smile.

1658
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:27,338
That's right. It'd be a waste
to cry all the time.

1659
01:55:27,839 --> 01:55:30,133
It's a waste of salt.

1660
01:55:30,592 --> 01:55:34,304
Thank heavens for
the salty seas!

1661
01:55:34,554 --> 01:55:37,015
Grandma! Auntie! Chizuko!

1662
01:55:37,015 --> 01:55:39,559
January 1946

1663
01:55:39,559 --> 01:55:40,810
Suzu!

1664
01:55:42,896 --> 01:55:44,188
Sumi?

1665
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:48,318
Suzu! You cut your hair.

1666
01:55:48,526 --> 01:55:52,113
Don't get up. Are you ill?

1667
01:55:52,322 --> 01:55:54,324
I'm a little dizzy.

1668
01:55:55,283 --> 01:55:57,702
What a shame big sister.

1669
01:55:57,952 --> 01:56:02,498
I can't help with work outside
on this cold bitter day.

1670
01:56:04,292 --> 01:56:07,837
I suppose you must rest
easy for now.

1671
01:56:11,716 --> 01:56:13,426
If only I had my hand,

1672
01:56:13,635 --> 01:56:17,764
I'd draw "Yoichi's Adventures
in the South Seas."

1673
01:56:18,014 --> 01:56:20,725
What would the story be about?

1674
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:24,896
Yoichi's troop transport
gets shipwrecked.

1675
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:29,692
So he builds a house
with palm leaves on an island.

1676
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:33,988
He grows a beard and
marries a crocodile.

1677
01:56:34,155 --> 01:56:36,991
A crocodile for a bride.

1678
01:56:38,076 --> 01:56:41,079
I wish Yoichi could
come back to Eba.

1679
01:56:41,329 --> 01:56:42,664
And Mom, too.

1680
01:56:42,664 --> 01:56:43,665
What?

1681
01:56:44,248 --> 01:56:49,754
On the morning of the festival,
Mom went shopping in the city.

1682
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:55,718
Dad and I looked everywhere,
but couldn't find her.

1683
01:56:56,052 --> 01:56:59,889
Dad fell ill in October
and died soon after.

1684
01:57:00,056 --> 01:57:02,934
He was cremated along with
others at school.

1685
01:57:03,142 --> 01:57:05,144
I should have told you sooner.

1686
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:06,437
I'm sorry.

1687
01:57:07,772 --> 01:57:10,608
I'm sorry I couldn't
come sooner.

1688
01:57:10,942 --> 01:57:13,361
I'm glad you didn't.

1689
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:17,323
Suzu, look at me.

1690
01:57:17,615 --> 01:57:19,826
Will I get better?

1691
01:57:20,034 --> 01:57:22,662
Yes, of course you will!

1692
01:57:29,335 --> 01:57:31,421
Sachiko!

1693
01:57:32,672 --> 01:57:33,965
Sorry.

1694
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:39,679
Kiyoko! Aren't you Kiyoko?

1695
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:45,852
<i>Everyone lost someone,
and they're still looking.</i>

1696
01:57:46,019 --> 01:57:50,690
<i>I think I saw Rin a few times,
too.</i>

1697
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:53,276
Suzu.

1698
01:57:56,404 --> 01:57:57,947
You're back.

1699
01:57:58,573 --> 01:58:01,409
The Navy was disbanded
at the end of November.

1700
01:58:01,659 --> 01:58:02,618
I've been let go.

1701
01:58:03,703 --> 01:58:10,168
Suzu, this is the bridge
where I first met you.

1702
01:58:11,294 --> 01:58:13,588
We can't go back in time.

1703
01:58:14,005 --> 01:58:17,425
We'll keep changing,
this city and us.

1704
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:19,719
But I will always
tell you apart.

1705
01:58:20,511 --> 01:58:23,473
I'll find this beauty
mark right away.

1706
01:58:24,557 --> 01:58:30,855
Thank you, for finding me
in this Corner of the World.

1707
01:58:30,855 --> 01:58:35,610
Please never leave, and
always be by my side.

1708
01:58:36,277 --> 01:58:38,154
Huh?

1709
01:59:47,932 --> 01:59:49,267
- Oh...
- Let it be.

1710
01:59:49,517 --> 01:59:52,436
I'm glad I found a job
in Hiroshima.

1711
01:59:53,104 --> 01:59:54,147
Me, too.

1712
01:59:57,066 --> 02:00:00,194
The commute will be difficult.

1713
02:00:00,403 --> 02:00:02,572
I... what?

1714
02:00:05,992 --> 02:00:09,453
Thank you. But you can have it.

1715
02:00:09,912 --> 02:00:13,207
We could leave Kure
and start over here.

1716
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:16,294
For your family's sake.

1717
02:00:16,752 --> 02:00:20,840
No, I can commute.

1718
02:00:21,007 --> 02:00:23,176
I'm worried about Hiroshima

1719
02:00:23,384 --> 02:00:26,596
but Kure is the town I
chose to live in.

1720
02:00:28,055 --> 02:00:29,140
Oh?

1721
02:00:36,856 --> 02:00:37,940
It's okay.

1722
02:00:46,949 --> 02:00:48,868
<i>Next stop, Kure.</i>

1723
02:00:50,453 --> 02:00:51,537
Kure?

1724
02:00:51,787 --> 02:00:54,415
That's right. This is Kure.

1725
02:00:54,749 --> 02:00:59,503
"Kure" means we are
protected by nine mountains.

1726
02:00:59,879 --> 02:01:05,218
On your right is Mt. Yasumi,
to the left is Mt. Hachimaki.

1727
02:01:06,135 --> 02:01:09,931
And in the center is Mt.
Haigamine.

1728
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:16,270
That's where our home is.

1729
02:01:24,987 --> 02:01:26,572
This child...

1730
02:01:28,407 --> 02:01:30,534
She's covered in lice!

1731
02:01:31,202 --> 02:01:35,164
Hurry, we have to boil all
of our clothes!

1732
02:01:35,331 --> 02:01:37,541
We should start with a bath.

1733
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:40,294
She should go in last.

1734
02:01:40,503 --> 02:01:42,380
I'll start the fire.

1735
02:01:43,506 --> 02:01:46,884
I wonder if Harumi's clothes
would be too small.

1735
02:01:47,305 --> 02:02:47,349

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,877
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,110
Oh, I like this.

4
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,846
Maybe this time
we get lucky

5
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,683
- and make a baby?
- Let's just have some fun.

6
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,116
Oh, I like fun.

7
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,919
Just shut up and kiss me.

8
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,526
- Ow!
- Sorry.

9
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,193
Hold on.

10
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,864
It's this damn watch.

11
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,769
Come on. Mm-hm.

12
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,576
What's wrong?

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,047
You feel that?

14
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,985
No...

15
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,454
Huh. It stopped.

16
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,590
That's weird,
I didn't feel anything.

17
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,059
Hold on!

18
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,728
Babe, are you okay?

19
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,597
Yeah. Okay.

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
Okay, what the hell was that?

21
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,635
Oh, my God.

22
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:18,470
Look out there.

23
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,207
What is that?

24
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,643
<i>There he is.</i>

25
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,845
<i>How's our little guy
this morning?</i>

26
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:29,147
<i>Hello, how are you?</i>

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,183
<i>Look at you!
Look, you're all sitting up!</i>

28
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,820
<i>Oh, oh! Kick it!</i>

29
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,063
<i>Look at that big smile!</i>

30
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,731
<i>So happy!</i>

31
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,005
<i>You're
crawling, look Kyle!</i>

32
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,306
<i>Look at him crawl!</i>

33
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,009
<i>Look at these overalls,</i>

34
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>he's like a mini you.</i>

35
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,849
<i>Look at you, putting your
little butt in the air.</i>

36
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,686
<i>Yeah, you're gonna work
on the farm like Daddy?</i>

37
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,556
<i>Yes, just like a Breyer!</i>

38
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,096
<i>Okay, I'm gonna turn this off,</i>

39
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,196
- <i>say "bye."</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

40
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,516
Brandon?

41
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,526
It's time to get ready
for school.

42
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,365
Got ya!

43
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:08,015
Not even close.

44
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,350
I'm gonna find you.

45
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,756
Better not be in that barn!

46
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,547
You totally got me!

47
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:17,084
You are getting
too big for this.

48
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,622
You'll always be
my baby boy.

49
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:25,291
- Okay, let's go.
- Took you long enough

50
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,292
to find me.

51
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,831
- Uh-oh.
- Morning guys.

52
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,799
What're ya doing in there?

53
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,433
I was just hiding.

54
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,636
You know the rules of
the barn, right?

55
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,972
- Yeah, I mean...
- All the boards and nails

56
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:42,508
and shit, don't want
you breaking your neck.

57
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,677
He was only in there
for, like, two minutes.

58
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,979
Uh-huh.
Did you eat breakfast?

59
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,848
- Not yet.
- Want some waffles?

60
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,850
- Sounds good.
- You're making waffles?

61
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,751
- Yeah.
- What about some bacon?

62
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,690
And that is what we call

63
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,357
a hive.

64
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,460
Wasps and bees,

65
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,630
members of the same
insect family,

66
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,464
both with two pairs
of wings,

67
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,967
both with stingers.

68
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,272
Can anyone tell me any
differences between them?

69
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,012
Mr. Breyer?

70
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,815
Uh, well, um,
bees are pollinators,

71
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,415
and wasps
are predators.

72
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,052
Good, good. Anybody else?

73
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,855
And wasps are more aggressive,
more dangerous.

74
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,057
One species,
the Polistes sulcifer,

75
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,026
is what's called
a brood parasite,

76
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,262
they've lost the ability
to make nests,

77
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:37,763
so they use brute force

78
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,332
to make other wasp species
raise their young.

79
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,868
And they make them feed
their babies things

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,670
like beetle larvae
and maggots.

81
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,339
Bro, why are you always
talking about maggots?

82
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,842
You must be one.

83
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,243
Okay, alright.

84
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,645
Don't worry,

85
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,615
smart guys end up
ruling the planet.

It's mom. Mom. Look at me.

You're all right. Shh, shh, shh.
You're all right.

104
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,274
You were sleepwalking.
I think.

105
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:20,112
Yeah... it was...
these voices or something.

106

I know,
it'll be okay now.

121

sleepwalking,
I guess?

122
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:21,008
Where?

123
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,843
Nowhere. He was
just downstairs.

124
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:25,946
He's fine.

125
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,081
We should
go to bed, yeah?

126

It's getting so late.

Keep it stiff.

128
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,526
All right, I think
that's gonna hold it.

129
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,163
- Want one of these?
- Sure.

130
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,534
First couple of years
after we adopted you,

131
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,236
I had no clue
how to be a dad.

132
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,038
Your mom, she was
out one day,

133
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
and you were
bawling your eyes out.

134
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,775
But I had
a secret weapon.

135
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,579
So you gave me
a piece of candy?

136
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:01,482
Yep.

137
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,817
- Did it work?
- I guess.

138
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,654
You didn't turn
out that bad, did you?

139
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:08,956
Huh?

140
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,058
All right. Think you'll
be able to get the lawn?

141
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,028
- I gotta get to the seed store.
- No worries. I'll handle it.

142
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,134
Dang it.

143
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,935
Come on.

144
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,042
Stupid thing!

145
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:34,439
You're not beating me.
I love it!

146
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,441
You can't go
that close.

147
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,645
What about this brown one?
I feel he's easy to pick up.

148
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:42,815
You were right in front of it.

149
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,617
- This has to be it.
- Oh! Come on!

So Brandon, I hear
you're killing it in school.

159
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,753
- Tested in the top one percent.
- No, he tested in the top

160
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,320
one tenth of one percent.

161
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,824
The whole faculty
is talking about him.

162
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,893
He's our little super genius.

00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:28,694

00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,108
I shot my first buck
with that very same model.

168
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,745
Whoa, no, no, no.
No guns.

169
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,847
- We talked about this, Tori.
- I know...

170
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,715
Come on, he's still
just a kid.

171
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:51,049
I'm 12 years old.

172
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,153
I know, exactly,
you're still a child.

173
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,755
Give it to me.

174
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,089
I'm sorry, what did
you just say to me?

175
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,528
I said, "give it to me."

176
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:02,762
Brandon.

177
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,396
Okay, we're done here.

178
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:07,600
We're not having ice cream.
Thank you. Let's go.

179
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,502
Brandon, let's go.
Brandon!

180
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,236
Up now.

181
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,971
Brandon...

182
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,308
Listen to your father.

183
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,109
We are leaving,
let's go.

184
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,379
So fun, thank you so much.

185
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,315
Okay... sorry.

186
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,217
- Don't worry about.
- So sorry.

187
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,452
Nope. Yep, bye.

188
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,923
I love you guys!

189
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,625
Babe, I told you.

190
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,292
You sure you want kids?

191
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,127
I just don't get
that kid.

192
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,898
Turns 12, all of sudden
he gets a mouth on him.

193
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,667
So strange,
it was so unlike him.

194
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,971
I worry about him.

195
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:47,305
Getting older,
changing.

196
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,610
We were so much worse
when we were his age.

197
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:54,312
You remember all the running
around we did, sneaking out.

198
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,148
Fooling around in
my parents' basement.

199
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,685
My parents knew
exactly what we were doing.

200
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,855
They didn't give a shit,
they'd already written me off.

201
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,055
Oh, babe.

202
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:08,561
We can never
do that to Brandon.

203
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:11,831
He needs to know
we give a shit.

204
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,701
He will.

205
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:18,538
Why don't we go
camping this weekend?

206
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,206
Just the three of us,
go up to Drywood.

207
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,375
- We haven't done that in so long.
- Mm-hm.

208
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,679
You know what else we
haven't done in a while?

209
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,515
- I know what you're thinking,
- A little bit more...

210
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:32,885
gone to church. We have
not gone to church in a while.

211
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:36,354
That's not all
I was thinking about.

212
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,390
We need to clean out
the closet,

213
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,860
- that's what you were thinking.
- Nope, no.

214
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,228
Okay,
but you gotta be quiet.

215
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,864
I will be,
I'm always quiet.

216
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,799
- He's not asleep yet.
- Shh.

217
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:51,571
Here.

218
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,706
What's that,
three or four?

219
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,440
We got three,
we're good.

220
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,076
I'm good.
Go get the flashlight.

221
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,213
This needs batteries.

222
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,950
Brandon, it's gonna be cold.

223
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,286
You're gonna need
your warm jacket, okay?

224
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,361
Hey, did you hear
your mother, bud?

225
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:20,802
Hey.

226
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,908
Brandon.

227
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,700
Hey, hon, um...

228
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,468
Look what I found.

229
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,006
What is that?

230
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,807
Is that the kid's
idea of porn?

231
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,475
- I think so.
- Wow.

232
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,077
Bra ads.

233
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,947
Guess we knew
this day was coming.

234
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,281
The hell is that?

235
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,450
Is this like a guy thing?

236
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,587
No, that's not
a guy thing I know.

237
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,856
Ew.

238
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,961
Maybe we should
have the talk with him.

239
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,605
Hey, Brandon.

240
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,641
You know, you just
had your birthday.

241
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:40,079
Which means that you
are becoming a young man.

242
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,847
Your body's changing.

243
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,616
Okay.

244
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:47,252
Well, you're going to
start developing, you know...

245
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,988
feelings about women,

246
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,990
women's bodies,

247
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,826
I was just like you
when I was your age.

248
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:58,064
And I also thought about
girls all the time, heh.

249
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:01,399
You know, nobody was
around to tell me that...

250
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,136
it was okay to, uh...

251
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:06,908
touch it
or play with it.

252
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:09,877
With what?

253
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:14,015
Uh, you know,
with, uh...

254
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,718
Your penis.

255
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,088
- Okay.
- Look, the thing about...

256
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,557
you know, sex,
it's not...

257
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,760
it's not about organs
or body parts,

258
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:31,731
I mean, it is that too, but...

259
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,365
You know, it's about finding
the right person

260
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,870
and falling in love.

261
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,638
Look, all I'm saying is

262
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,907
you're a guy, you know,

263
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,143
and you're gonna have
certain urges,

264
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,846
you know, about girls
you see in films,

265
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:49,582
or girls in class
or whatever.

266
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,817
I'm just saying that it's okay

267
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,587
to give in to them
now and again.

268
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,387
Like, now?

269
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,793
What?

270
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,662
Like now?

271
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,964
No, no, no.
Not...

272
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,068
not right now, no.

273
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,469
Good talk.

274
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,828
Brandon?

Mom?

289
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,493
What's wrong?

290
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:16,595
What's wrong?

291
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:18,366
Someone's there,
by the curtain.

292
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,022
Honey, there's no one here.

293
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:46,091
You have to believe me,
he was right there.

294
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,394
Who was?

295
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:50,896
Brandon Breyer.

296
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,768
Brandon?

297
00:23:58,739 --> 00:23:59,974
Brandon?

298
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,776
Brandon,
where are you, baby?

299
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,577
Can you hear me?

300
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,279
Brandon!

301
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,916
Brandon.

302
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,319
Oh, my God.

303
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,054
Oh, my God, Brandon.

304
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,089
Your father and I
were freaked out.

305
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:20,326
I didn't mean to,
I was just taking a pee.

306
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:31,670
So you don't think I need
to take him to someone,

307
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:34,940
- like a specialist...
- For what?

308
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:37,475
For talking back to his dad
and keeping

309
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,112
weird jerk-off material
under his mattress?

310
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,414
It's more than that, Mer.
I don't know,

311
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,950
he's always been
my little sweet guy,

312
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:46,585
and now...

313
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,123
- he's so different.
- It's called puberty.

314
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,091
I'm overreacting.

315
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:54,393
- A little bit.
- Obviously, I am.

316
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:56,095
- I love you.
- Thank you.

317
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:58,532
- I'll call you.
- Okay, call me later.

318
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,308
What's that?

319
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,611
What? I wasn't snooping
or anything.

320
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,880
It was nice line work.

321
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:16,150
It was good shading.

322
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:48,614
Fucking wolf.

323
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:01,727
Brandon.

324
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,328
Hey, what are
you doing, buddy?

325
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,909
Buddy, it's 10:30
at night.

326
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:20,549
Are you all right,
buddy?

327
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,589
Think so.

328
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:33,961
Come on, man,
let's get inside.

329
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:05,124
Oh, my God.

330
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:07,459
Tori. Tori!

331
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,728
- Tori, hey, wake up.
- What is it?

332
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,763
I need you
to come outside.

333
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:14,168
- You see? Right?
- Oh, shit.

334
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:20,973
- So the wolf is back.
- No, no, baby, I...

335
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,908
This isn't a wolf,
I mean...

336
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,643
This isn't
an animal. I think,

337
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,279
I think this might
be Brandon.

338
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,414
He was out here
earlier tonight,

339
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,483
just staring at them.
The chickens...

340
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,354
They were all
fucking going crazy.

341
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,656
Babe, a wolf can't do this!

342
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:40,325
It can't rip a door off
and break a lock.

343
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:43,028
But our 12-year-old son can?

344
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,832
So you can't explain
it, either?

345
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,967
Kyle, stop.
It was the wolf.

346
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,470
I'm going to bed.

347
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:55,642
This game is called
willows in the wind.

348
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,342
It's about working
together,

349
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,478
and building trust.
Lean back,

350
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,014
and depend on your classmates.

351
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:05,186
Whoa, come on now, focus!

352
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,589
All right, very good guys.

353
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:10,989
When we trust
each other,

354
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:12,691
good things happen.

355
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,661
All right, you're up next,
big guy.

356
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:16,295
- Let's hear it for Brandon.
- Loser.

357
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:17,863
Nothing to be afraid of,

358
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,767
your classmates
have your back.

359
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,407
Good job.

360
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:29,875
Ew!

361
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,877
Oh, shit.

362
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,580
Way to trust the floor.

363
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:34,980
Hey, hey.
Knock it off.

364
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:36,381
You okay, bud?

365
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,385
Damn, Caitlyn,
give him a hand up.

366
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:42,655
Hey, hold on,
we all on the same team here.

367
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:44,823
He's a pervert.

368
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:45,991
You lie.

369
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:47,660
- Idiot.
- Caitlyn, help him up.

370
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,330
or you fail this class.

371
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:01,139
What are you doing?

372
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,508
Brandon!

373
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,176
Let go. Stop it!

374
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,410
Brandon stop!

375
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:10,382
Erika, he said he's sorry.

376
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,585
It was an accident,
they're just kids.

377
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:15,020
Did you see
my daughter's hand?

378
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,155
He's a goddamn animal,
is what he is.

379
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:19,191
Can we just calm down
here, please?

380
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:20,627
I want him in handcuffs,

381
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,761
- I want him gone.
- We're taking action.

382
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,397
- He's going to be suspended for...
- Suspended?

383
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,735
- Do you job, arrest him.
- Sorry ma'am, not your call.

384
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:31,303
After the suspension,
he'll be in sessions

385
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:33,539
with our school counselor
Ms. Merilee.

386
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,742
His aunt. Jesus fucking Christ.

387
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:38,944
- Right now, she's the only...
- Know what? Her son

388
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:42,447
was inside my daughter's
bedroom last Saturday night.

389
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,585
He was camping
with us 30 miles away.

390
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:52,357
Do you even know
who his real mother is?

391
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,893
- I'm his real mother.
- I meant whatever inbred

392
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:57,129
- psycho gave birth to him.
- Hey.

393
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,864
I know exactly
what you meant.

394
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,233
But if trash talking
a 12-year-old child,

395
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,468
lets you sleep better
at night, Erika,

396
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,472
maybe you're the one
who needs help.

397
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,876
Sorry about your daughter.

398
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:14,683
Get up,
let's go.

399
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,598
Shit like that,
breaking a girl's hand?

400
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,266
Goddamn it.

401
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,935
Dad would've
whooped my ass.

402
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:40,872
Yeah, well, this isn't something
we can ass-whoop away.

403
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:42,274
I just...

404
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,377
I need to tell
you something.

405
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,212
The other night when
I found him

406
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:49,782
sleepwalking,
he wasn't downstairs,

407
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:51,653
He was in the barn.

408
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,254
Did he find it?

409
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,825
No... No.

410
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,360
But he was tugging
at the trap door.

411
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:03,629
How'd he even know
it's in there?

412
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,464
I don't think he does.

413
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,767
- It was like he was drawn to it.
- Babe.

414
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,469
He may look like us,
and sound like us,

415
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:12,104
but he's never bled,

416
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,773
not once in his
whole life,

417
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,374
he's never been cut,

418
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:17,376
or broken a bone,
or had a bruise.

419
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,046
And now he's
hurting people.

420
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:46,373
Take. Take.

421
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:51,711
<i>"Yychhagaro"</i> means "take".

422
00:32:58,312 --> 00:32:59,814
Brandon!

423
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:04,752
Oh, God.

424
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,497
Take <i>larum...</i>

425
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,733
Take <i>larum...</i>

426
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:22,969
Take the...

427
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,837
Oh, God, oh, God.

428
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,471
Brandon!

429
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,440
Take the...

430
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:29,709
Take the...

431
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,678
Take the...

432
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:36,849
Brandon!

433
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,987
Oh, God.

434
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,224
Oh, Brandon.

435
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,264
Baby, it's okay.

436
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:57,939
Baby...

437
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,310
It cut me.

438
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:05,945
Oh.

439
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:09,216
Oh, uh, okay.

440
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:14,654
You'll be okay.

441
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,622
It'll be okay,
it'll be okay.

442
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:18,290
It'll be okay.

443
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,527
You're okay.

444
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,329
Who am I?

445
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:34,107
You're our son.

446
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,410
What is this?

447
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:39,881
Where did I come from?

448
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,381
Listen, baby, I...

449
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:45,785
I know it's been
difficult for you lately,

450
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:48,623
that you feel different
from other kids.

451
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,223
You are different.

452
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:55,226
After you dad and I
got married, we prayed

453
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:58,363
and prayed for
a baby for so long,

454
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:02,902
to God, to the universe,
to anyone that would listen.

455
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:07,205
One night,
one perfect night,

456
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,744
someone listened.

457
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:15,347
We did not adopt you.

458
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,950
from an agency.

459
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,919
You came here...

460
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:22,922
arrived here,

461
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:23,891
in that.

462
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,461
We found you in the woods.

463
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:33,164
You were just a little guy,
all alone.

464
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,433
You could barely breathe,
and so we...

465
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,435
We took you in.

466
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:40,740
And you have been
a gift,

467
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:42,808
my baby boy.

468
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,646
I... I can't even imagine
how overwhelmed

469
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:48,413
you must feel
right now.

470
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:52,150
But you have to know,
your dad and I believe

471
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,620
that you came here
for a reason.

472
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,321
That you are special.

473
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,658
And that you're
going to do incredible...

474
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,158
You lied to me!

475
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,193
We just wanted to take
care of you.

476
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:05,564
- And we always planned to tell...
- You lied to me! You lied!

477
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,900
Wait.

478
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:09,835
I hate you,

479
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,303
you lied to me. You're liars!
You lied.

480
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,573
I hate you! I hate this place.

481
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,776
What is going on
in here?

482
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,111
He... He found it.

483
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,149
He found it.

484
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,454
Take the <i>ghhol.</i>

485
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:31,857
Take the <i>ghhol.</i>

486
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,458
<i>Ghhol.</i>

487
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,695
<i>Ghhol. Ghhol.</i>

488
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:38,265
Take the world.

489
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,103
Take the world.

490
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,390
Don't scream.

491
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,392
What are you doing here?

492
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,831
I brought you flowers.

493
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,965
You can't be here.

494
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:16,401
Don't be scared.

495
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,039
I wanna talk to you.

496
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,577
I want to tell you
what I learned tonight.

497
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,978
I learned that

498
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,180
I'm very

499
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:29,851
special.

500
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,486
You're one of the only
people in the world

501
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,255
that knows how
special I am.

502
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,625
But someday...

503
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:41,629
they will all know.

504
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,868
My mom told
me not to talk to you.

505
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,604
I'm gonna take care of that.

506
00:38:06,788 --> 00:38:08,888
Have good one, Gary.

507
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:06,679
Hey, who's messing
with me?

508
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:11,786
Is that you, Gary?

509
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:30,930
Get out of here!

510
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:39,439
Leave me alone!

511
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,260
Is he awake?

512
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,129
I called up two times
already,

513
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,731
I heard him
walking around.

514
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,100
Should somebody go
get him, I mean...

515
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:43,102
Morning.

516
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:44,903
Hey, bud.

517
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:47,673
Uh, you know you're
going to be late for school.

518
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:51,810
Yeah, I know, I was just
up in my room... thinking.

519
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,381
Thinking about what?

520
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:57,182
Just about everything.

521
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,154
And, uh,
it's totally cool.

522
00:42:02,556 --> 00:42:04,957
I feel good.

523
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,460
I'm glad you
feel that way, buddy.

524
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:09,628
Me too.

525
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,497
Why don't you grab
a seat?

526
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:13,632
Ten minutes late never
killed anyone.

527
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:23,275
You say she hasn't responded
to any calls or texts?

528
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:25,277
That's correct.

529
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:27,379
This was the last place
she was seen.

530
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,551
Doesn't look like
a robbery.

531
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:43,898
Good, God.

532
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:48,133
Have you talked
to her daughter?

533
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:50,602
She's a mess right now.

534
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,771
Scared shitless.

535
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,642
I barely got two words
out of her.

536
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,546
What is that?

537
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:14,359
So I know this
is kind of strange,

538
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,929
I'm your aunt,
and I'm also your counselor,

539
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:19,264
but I'm the only one
the district's got,

540
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,768
so you are stuck with me.

541
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:23,735
So Brandon,
your mom tells me

542
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:26,171
that you've been having
some issues lately

543
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:27,775
about being adopted.

544
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,909
Nothing bad,

545
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,244
- only good ones.
- Really?

546
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,613
How so?

547
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,849
I've realized I'm special.

548
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:40,619
Because my real parents aren't
from a stupid place like here.

549
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:44,189
You don't think of you mom
and dad as your real parents?

550
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,925
I do, but I just know
I'm something else.

551
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,597
Something superior.

552
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,233
Brandon,

553
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:55,968
do you feel bad

554
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,839
about what you did to Caitlyn?

555
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,075
You know,

556
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,743
sometimes

557
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,778
when bad things
happen to people,

558
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,517
it's for a good reason.

559
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:14,319
Brandon,
part of my job

560
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,888
is to update the school,

561
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,190
and to update your mom
on your progress,

562
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:20,692
and to let them know
if you are showing any

563
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:22,461
growth or remorse,
and I...

564
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:27,268
I can't take it easy on you
because you're my family.

565
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,604
I'm giving you an opportunity
to talk to me,

566
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:34,139
I'm supposed to update
the sheriff tomorrow,

567
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,275
and I have to be
honest with him.

568
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:50,523
Yeah, my buddy said
the diner was just...

569
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:53,692
Was just wrecked.
And the waitress Erika

570
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,360
was gone.
It's been 24 hours.

571
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,197
Wow, Kyle, you think
your son could have done it?

572
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,500
- Dude!
- What?

573
00:45:00,502 --> 00:45:02,301
He crushed
her daughter's hand.

574
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:04,369
That's not funny
right now, okay?

575
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,506
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- So, uh...

576
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:08,307
What's gonna happen
with all that?

577
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,543
I don't know.
He got suspended for a few days,

578
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:13,011
and I'm sure I'm gonna get
a call from some lawyer

579
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:14,980
telling me my son's
a monster, which...

580
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,649
I don't even know anymore.
Maybe he is.

581
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:18,750
They're all monsters.
I'm going home.

582
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:20,553
Come on. One more.

583
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:22,754
- One more. Come on.
- No, no. I gotta get home,

584
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,489
- or Merilee's gonna kill me.
- I'll drive you.

585
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:26,225
It's just a few miles
down the road.

586
00:45:26,227 --> 00:45:28,862
- No, hang. I'll drive.
- Mommy, I'm okay.

587
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:32,366
Brandon!

588
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,539
I'm home.
I got us sesame chicken.

589
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:42,076
Brandon?

590
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:12,306
What?

591
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,995
<i>Alert. Motion, backyard.</i>

592
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:37,666
What?

593
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:00,954
Who the hell?

594
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:20,305
- Hey.
- Brandon, Jesus.

595
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,207
What are you doing here?

596
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:24,109
I need to talk to you.

597
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:27,212
I know it's late,
but I promise I won't take long.

598
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:28,847
Okay. Fine.

599
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,016
Back in your office,
you mentioned something about

600
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:33,018
talking to
the sheriff tomorrow?

601
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,853
Mm-hmm.
That's right.

602
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:37,155
Yeah, the thing is...

603
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:40,325
that can't happen, ever.

604
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:43,195
It's just not good for anyone.

605
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:46,431
Not for me,
not for my parents,

606
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:50,302
and it's really,
really not good for you.

607
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:51,905
At all.

608
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,276
Brandon,
listen to me, okay?

609
00:47:58,278 --> 00:47:59,878
I have to do my job.

610
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,715
And to be honest, you showing up
at my house this late

611
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:04,349
is very inappropriate.

612
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,453
I'm gonna need you
to go home now, okay?

613
00:48:07,856 --> 00:48:09,254
Okay.

614
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:10,692
I'll walk back.

615
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:14,863
Okay, sweetie.
Be safe.

616
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:17,030
You too.

617

622
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:45,758
This is so annoying.

625
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,537
The whole freaking house
is falling apart.

626
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,150
Oh, shit.

627
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:03,996
Brandon? What the fuck
are you doing?

628
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:06,197
Aunt Merilee was helping me
with my homework.

629
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,567
No, what the fuck
are you doing in my closet

630
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,401
- wearing this creepy mask?
- It's not creepy.

631
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:11,773
You scared the shit out of me,
weirdo! I'm taking you home.

00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,208
- This is fucking insane, man.
- I didn't do anything.

633
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,678
Are you gonna
tell my parents?

634
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,247
You're lucky
if that's all I do!

635
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:24,249
Get in the truck.

636
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,820
You shouldn't tell my parents.

637
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,894
Brandon, get in the truck!

638
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,278
Shit.

639
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:03,825
What the fuck!

640
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:22,710
Holy sh...

Ah, man!

646
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:38,356

00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:49,602

00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:02,950
Okay, it's time to go.
Come on!

656
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,452
Nope. Mm-mmm.

657
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,822
No, no, no.

658
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:11,691
Come on!

659
00:53:11,693 --> 00:53:13,893
Get out of here!
Gotta go!

660
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:16,164
Let's go! Come on!

661
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,137
Uh...

662
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,371
Okay.

663
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,339
Um... uh...

664
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,511
This is, uh, really bad.

665
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:38,751
What the... What the fuck!
No, stop, stop!

666
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:40,820
Come on, put me down!
Hey, man, stop!

667
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:44,058
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck.
No, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck!

668
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:48,359
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

669
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:49,829
Goddamn it!

670
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,666
God! Fuck!

671
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,150
Hi, Merilee. I know
I'm leaving a lot of messages.

672
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:20,853
It's after 10 now, and we still
haven't seen him, so...

673
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,755
Did she say anything
to him at school?

674
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:24,990
Maybe he said something
to you at school or...

675
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,593
- Like he got a ride home or...
- Shut up!

676
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:29,494
...where he
to go after school.

677
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:32,665
I'm rambling
because I'm freaking out,

678
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,366
so just please call me back.
Thank you, honey.

679
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:38,506
- Would you please stop?
- I didn't say anything.

680
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:42,043
Oh, my God, baby!

681
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:45,376
Where have you been?

682
00:55:45,378 --> 00:55:48,113
Where were you?
What happened to your shirt?

683
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,648
I was playing soccer.

684
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,851
You've been playing soccer
this whole time?

685
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:53,819
Well, after school,

686
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:56,655
Royce and them asked me
if I wanted to play.

687
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:59,457
And as soon as
the game started, they were...

688
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:02,328
They were tripping me
and pushing me to the ground,

689
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,598
and, you know,
they were all laughing

690
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,499
because my shirt got ripped.

691
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,435
I just decided I'd walk
all the way home.

692
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:12,805
I know I should have called.

693
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:14,640
- Yes.
- Actually, I'm...

694
00:56:14,642 --> 00:56:16,775
I'm just really tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

695
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,443
Okay, well,
let me take this...

696
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:20,281
No. No.

697
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:23,349
Don't worry about it.

698
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:24,518
It's fine.

699
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:32,260
I'll come up
in a couple minutes.

700
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,096
- He's lying.
- Yeah, obviously.

701
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:39,598
If we don't do something,
this is gonna get worse.

702
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,933
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know.

703
00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:42,601
Maybe we need
to talk to somebody.

704
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:44,169
- He needs a specialist.
- What?

705
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,871
- And say what to them?
- I don't know.

706
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,339
"Hello, this is our son.

707
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:49,241
We found him in a fucking
spaceship in the woods.

708
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:50,709
Now what?"
No, we should have

709
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,014
done something a long
time ago. This is on us.

710
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:04,792
<i>Maybe this time,
we get lucky and make a baby?</i>

711
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:21,206
<i>Just shut up and kiss me.</i>

712
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:37,389
<i>There's, like,
a light in the woods.</i>

713
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:38,359
What the...?

714
00:57:41,629 --> 00:57:42,964
Tori?

715
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:46,634
Tori?

716
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:01,949
Tori?

717
00:58:10,057 --> 00:58:11,325
Tori?

718
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:17,765
Hey, baby.

719
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,034
What are you doing?

720
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:29,010
It's a boy.

721
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:42,857
Oh, we've tried for so long
to have a baby, and he's here.

722
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:49,597
He's here. A gift.

723
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:13,285
Hello?

724
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:15,089
- Oh, God.
- Hey, hey. Huh?

725
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:20,061
Mer.

726
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:27,566
You all right?

727
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,835
No. They won't let me see him
because his...

728
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:33,540
They said that his face
is too mangled.

729
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:35,841
Do they know what happened?

730
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:38,444
They were...
They found him on Route 18.

731
00:59:38,446 --> 00:59:41,447
They think that he swerved
to not hit a deer, and...

732
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:43,516
They're doing
the toxicology

733
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,350
to make sure
that he wasn't drinking.

734
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:46,852
Was he drinking?

735
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:49,922
No, he just had
like two or three drinks of...

736
00:59:49,924 --> 00:59:51,325
I mean,
I wasn't counting.

737
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:55,360
How's Brandon?

738
00:59:55,362 --> 00:59:57,296
He's okay.
We didn't tell him anything.

739
00:59:57,298 --> 00:59:59,031
No, but did
he get home okay?

740
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,766
- Yes, he did.
- Okay.

741
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:02,234
Thank God. Thank God.

742
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:05,337
He came over and I didn't
remember when he left,

743
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,141
so I'm just glad
that he's okay.

744
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:09,877
He left you?

745
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:24,225
Morning, baby.

746
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:30,229
Um...

747
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:34,333
There's something that
we need to discuss with you,

748
01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:37,539
and it's probably
gonna be hard to hear.

749
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:41,640
Last night,
your Uncle Noah...

750
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,281
He died last night.

751
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:50,818
Okay.

752
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,688
Brandon,
do you understand?

753
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,294
Your Uncle Noah passed away.
He's gone.

754
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:06,566
I feel like you want me to cry
or something.

755
01:01:06,568 --> 01:01:09,168
Do you wanna cry?

756
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,641
Brandon, we know you were
at Aunt Merilee's last night.

757
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,244
Honey, I'm your mom.

758
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:21,280
I will always defend you.

759
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:24,483
But if you know something
about what happened to Noah,

760
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:25,853
you need to tell us.

761
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:34,993
I don't know
what happened to him.

762
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:37,530
But I would never
hurt Uncle Noah.

763
01:01:37,532 --> 01:01:38,899
I love him.

764
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:42,734
That is bullshit.
He is fucking lying!

765
01:01:42,736 --> 01:01:43,835
Kyle.

766
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:45,370
Look, we know you were there.

767
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,005
What else are you
lying to us about?

768
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:48,707
Can you calm down?

769
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:50,643
- Were you in Caitlyn's bedroom?
- He was camping with us.

770
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:52,878
Where were you Wednesday
when Caitlyn's mom went missing?

771
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,247
- This is not helping!
- He is lying to our faces!

772
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:57,684
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
- You're what...

773
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,818
No, you're not.
You are not going anywhere

774
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,220
until we get all this
on the table.

775
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:02,955
- Kyle, I will handle it!
- No, no, no.

776
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:04,289
Did you hurt Noah?

777
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,490
What did you do to him!

778
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:07,025
He was my friend,
and you just...

779
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:08,160
Leave me alone!

780
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:16,036
Brandon.

781
01:02:19,574 --> 01:02:21,541
You need to go to your room.

782
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:23,141
Just go to your room.

783
01:02:23,143 --> 01:02:24,512
Are you all right?

784
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:29,047
Honey?

785
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:31,183
He's hiding that shirt
for some reason.

786
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:32,751
Honey.

787
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:12,326
Shit.

788
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:19,266
Dad?

789
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:22,604
Hey, bud.

790
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,240
I wanted to apologize.

791
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,078
We've been going through
a lot lately, and...

792
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:35,015
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you.

793
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,284
Okay.

794
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,954
- Come here, get in here.
- What? What?

795
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:45,824
- It's right there.
- That could be anything.

796
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:48,460
No. That is why he was hiding
this from us last night.

797
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:51,129
- That is Noah's blood.
- How?

798
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,633
How could Brandon
have killed Noah

799
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:55,334
and then made it look
like a car accident?

800
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:56,935
Who knows what kind
of weird shit he could do?

801
01:03:56,937 --> 01:04:00,272
Noah was drunk
and wrecked the car

802
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:02,709
- because you let him drive.
- No, that is not what...

803
01:04:02,711 --> 01:04:05,277
And now you are trying
to take out your guilt

804
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:07,346
- on our 12-year-old son.
- Babe...

805
01:04:07,348 --> 01:04:12,284
You are making
a hard situation impossible.

806
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:14,086
Babe, we've got
to do something.

807
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:16,321
If we don't, more people
are gonna get hurt.

808
01:04:16,323 --> 01:04:19,257
More people will die.
You gotta be with me on this.

809
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:21,694
I will never
turn against our son.

810
01:04:21,696 --> 01:04:23,195
He's not our son!

811
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,631
He is some thing
we found in the woods.

812
01:04:25,633 --> 01:04:28,166
How fucking dare
you say that to me.

813
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,802
- How dare you.
- Babe!

814
01:04:29,804 --> 01:04:31,169
How can you
fucking say that to me?

815
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:33,438
Babe. Come on,
he's killing us.

816
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,808
<i>We now turn to
more somber news tonight</i>

817
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:38,811
<i>as authorities are reaching out
to the public for information</i>

818
01:04:38,813 --> 01:04:41,980
<i>in their search for missing
Darbo's waitress, Erika Connor,</i>

819
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:46,418
<i>who was last seen at the iconic
Route 74 diner Wednesday.</i>

820
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,688
<i>Anyone with information
about her whereabouts</i>

821
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,056
<i>is strongly urged
to contact police officials...</i>

822
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:05,667
You okay?

823
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,575
I think I'm gonna take him...

824
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:18,210
I'm gonna take him away
this weekend.

825
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:20,880
Just the two of us.

826
01:06:20,882 --> 01:06:23,783
Take him out to Drywood.

827
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:25,787
Be his dad.

828
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,824
Let him know I love him.

829
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,175
Here, don't forget these.

830
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:53,111
- Just wear them for me.
- Okay.

831
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:54,549
Come here.

832
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:03,825
You'll always be
my baby boy.

833
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,664
Even though
you're getting so tall.

834
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:12,667
Go have fun
with your dad, okay?

835
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,336
All right.

836
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:20,508
- Seat belt.
- Right.

837
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:25,680
See you Sunday.

838
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,175
Afternoon, Tori.

839
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:31,144
Hey.

840
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:34,916
Your boy around,
by chance?

841
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:38,183
Brandon went hunting
with his dad.

842
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:40,086
- Hmm.
- Is something wrong?

843
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:42,557
Maybe you can answer
a question for me.

844
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,893
This look familiar to you?

845
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,829
Some kind of signature
left at the spots

846
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:53,065
where both Erika
went missing and Noah died.

847
01:08:53,067 --> 01:08:54,102
No. Mm-mm.

848
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:59,505
Doesn't that look
like a "BB," maybe,

849
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:01,676
as in "Brandon Breyer"?

850
01:09:03,077 --> 01:09:04,177
I don't see it.

851
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,815
Do you mind if I come in,
take a look around?

852
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:12,352
I do mind. I think,
actually, you should go.

853
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:14,789
All right.

854
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:17,859
But you know I'll be back.

855
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:38,680
These are deer tracks.

856
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:57,165
Looks like there's more
than one set of tracks.

857
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:07,338
No.

858
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:29,030
Oh, God.

859
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:12,607
Brandon?

860
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,408
Oh, man.

861
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:42,804
Oh, God.

862
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:47,773
No. Please stop.

863
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:49,110
Please. Please.

864
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:52,013
God... Ah!

865
01:11:55,683 --> 01:11:57,650
Brandon, please, stop, stop.

866
01:11:57,652 --> 01:12:00,351
Don't hurt me, okay?
Brandon, please, please.

867
01:12:00,353 --> 01:12:02,021
Please. Brandon, don't.
Don't.

868
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:03,255
I'm sorry.

869
01:12:19,273 --> 01:12:20,340
Pick up, pick up.

870
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,843
Kyle.

871
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:25,578
Kyle, I'm sorry.
You were right.

872
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,847
Baby, you were right.
He killed Noah.

873
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:29,748
He... Brandon...

874
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,984
Brandon...
He killed Noah.

875
01:12:31,986 --> 01:12:33,353
And...

876
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:36,691
Kyle?

No.

884
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:05,851
No, I don't.
I don't know where.

885
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:08,089
Where are you?

886
01:13:09,257 --> 01:13:11,225
I'm home, Mom.

887
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:27,440
Brandon?

888
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:09,248
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

889

Yeah.

Tori!

I still believe

944

you were a blessing

When we found you,

you were so tiny and fragile.

948
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:41,233
And all we could do
was keep you safe.

in the small town

960

Details are still coming in,

among the 268 passengers
onboard.

Investigators
are not yet sure

964
01:24:15,023 --> 01:24:17,590
what caused the plane
to drop suddenly from the sky

965
01:24:17,592 --> 01:24:20,191
and crash into
this small family farm.

966
01:24:20,193 --> 01:24:23,228
Among the reported dead are
the residents of the farmhouse,

Kyle and Tori Breyer.

968

2
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,534
Hello?

3
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,412
What do you look like?

4
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,246
Talk louder!

5
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:57,187
I can't hear you!

6
00:03:57,257 --> 00:03:58,918
Hey, hello!

7
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:01,587
Hello! I can't hear you!

8
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,818
Five.

9
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,394
I don't know.

10
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,632
I don't know.

11
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,300
Get her in focus! Here I come!

12
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,645
Open up! Shit!

13
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:08,899
Jesus H. Christ!
What are you...?

14
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:14,431
What happened?

15
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,885
Now he's got pressure.
He has a receiver!

16
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:28,848
When it's time to relax

17
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,487
One beer stands clear

18
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,065
Oh, damn it!

19
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,911
Tweety?

20
00:07:56,795 --> 00:08:00,425
Oh, shit, Tweety! Couldn't you
have waited for a school day?

21
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:09,341
Won't you please

22
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,004
Please won't you be

23
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,275
Who the hell is this guy?

24
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,648
What the hell's going on?

25
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,757
Freeling, what's goin' on here?

26
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:23,886
I apologize!
My neighbor's on the same remote!

27
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:29,466
I bet my life on this game!
Are you kiddin' me?

28
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:34,404
Hi, Ben. We got a good
football game goin' on here.

29
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:37,139
My kids wanna watch
"Mr. Rogers."

30
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:40,775
I don't care what you're watchin'!
Just show some mercy with that thing!

31
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,918
Come on, Steve!

32
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,219
Move your set.

33
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,191
- Move yours, Ben.
- There it is. Don't move.

34
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,915
Tweety doesn't like that smell.

35
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:02,818
Sweetheart,
Tweety can't smell a thing.

36
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,584
Put a flower with him.

37
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:06,592
A flower?

38
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,639
For when he's hungry.

39
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:25,116
For when he's lonely.

40
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,886
For when it's nighttime.

41
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:39,426
Oh, it's okay.

42
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:18,579
Now I lay me down to sleep...

43
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:21,747
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

44
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,756
- Oh, brother.
- Stifle it.

45
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:27,260
If I should die before I wake...

46
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:28,762
It did.

47
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,459
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

48
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:34,129
That was lovely.
Lovely, honey.

49
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:37,106
Mom, when it rots,
can we dig up the bones?

50
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:41,010
Robbie! Will you come
on down out of the tree?

51
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,012
E. Buzz!

52
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,710
Can I have a goldfish now?

53
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,825
Come and get it.

54
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,194
Come and get it.

55
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,592
You're overfeeding them.

56
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:53,603
Tweety Two and Tweety Three
want seconds.

57
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:56,436
You know what happens
when you overfeed goldfish?

58
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,577
They grow up to be... sharks!

59
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,389
Good night.

60
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:16,590
Mom, there's a big storm
headed this way.

61
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:19,330
You'll be asleep by the time
it gets here if you hurry.

62
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,873
Come on. In you go.

63
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,647
Good night, sweetie.

64
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,152
Okay, lights out.

65
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,279
Closet light!

66
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,290
My fault.

67
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,792
Turn it on, Mommy!

68
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,437
That enough?

69
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,639
- Okay?
- Good night, Mom.

70
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,269
Night, Mommy.

71
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,484
Good night.

72
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,365
Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.

73
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,838
You're not crazy, Pete.

74
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:17,107
You mean I'm dead?

75
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,772
I'm...

76
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,444
You mean...
You mean this is for good?

77
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,218
Sleepwalking.

78
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:31,023
Nocturnal somnambulism.
You know what?

79
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,260
I will bet you anything
it's genetic.

80
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:39,669
I mean, Carol Anne last night
and all last week.

81
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:42,972
And me when I was ten.

82
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:48,450
- Would you deal with this?
- Sure.

83
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,549
You know...

84
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,854
once I slept-walked four blocks...

85
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,995
and I fell asleep
in the back of this guy's car.

86
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,276
He drove all the way to work
before discovering me.

87
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:12,178
God, I woke up,
I started screaming.

88
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:15,218
People came running, called the cops.

89
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:18,722
The cops took
this poor dude downtown.

90
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,759
- My father, Ed...
- Big.

91
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:28,063
Big Ed has me examined
for bruises and hickeys.

92
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,400
God, I was so embarrassed!

93
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,344
Oh, shit, Steve.

94
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,905
What if we dig the pool,
you know...

95
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:43,580
and Carol Anne sleepwalks and falls
into it before there's any water?

96
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,782
Oh, honey, no.

97
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:49,692
Have you ever dove off
a three-meter board, sweetheart?

98
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:53,255
- What's three meters?
- It's about ten feet.

99
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,998
Let's dig the pool closer to the house
and let the kids jump off the roof.

100
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,633
No, honey, honey, honey.

101
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,544
A three-meter board is like
an air pocket, sweetheart.

102
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:08,312
When you dive off,
it's like free-falling, okay?

103
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:12,517
You gotta get your feet in position.
Three meters.

104
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:15,060
Honey, your diving days are over.

105
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:18,223
We're talkin' Olympics,
Diane, okay?

106
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,693
Let me see your tuck position.

107
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:26,367
We can jackknife into the swan.

108
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:30,343
Twist, turn...

109
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:32,906
and splash!

110
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,351
Honey, it's right to
the Nautilus machine.

111
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:41,588
Look at this, honey.
Before, after.

112
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:43,926
Before, after.
Before, after.

113
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,085
- Don't.
- I love you.

114
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:11,101
Oh, God, I love it
when you talk dirty!

115
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:16,406
Storm is coming closer.

116
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,552
Hey, partner.

117
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,986
Hi, honey.

118
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:24,490
Is everything okay?

119
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,031
It's thundering.

120
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,933
Come on. Hop up.

121
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:39,737
I'm the wind and you're the feather.
Say good night to Mom.

122
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,144
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.

123
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,784
Here we go.

124
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,196
I don't like the tree, Dad.

125
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,829
That's an old tree.
It's been around here a long time.

126
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,536
It was here before my company
built the neighborhood.

127
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,546
I don't like its arms.

128
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,711
- It knows I live here, doesn't it?
- It knows everything about us.

129
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,949
That's why I built the house next to it,
so it could protect us.

130
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:18,255
You and Carol Anne
and Dana and your mom and me.

131
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:21,491
It's a very wise old tree.

132
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:25,127
It looks at me.
It knows I live here.

133
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,301
I think the storm's gonna pass us.

134
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,935
How do you know?

135
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:35,004
'Cause I can count.

136
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,312
You know what you do?

137
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,616
When you see the lightning...

138
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:43,090
you count 'til you hear the thunder.

139
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,721
If you can count higher each time,
that means the storm's movin' away.

140
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:50,298
Wanna try it?

141
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,193
We need some lightning.

142
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,975
Wait. It's comin'.

143
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:06,220
Okay, count.
One, two, three.

144
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:13,122
Next time, you'll be able to count
to at least four or five. Bet you.

145
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:14,960
Daddy, it's for you.

146
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:17,263
Tell them to take
a message, sweet pea.

147
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,167
My dad wants to take a message.

148
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:25,411
Night.

149
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,717
It's too hot.

150
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:33,880
Okay. Night, angel.

151
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:36,949
- Happy dreams, okay?
- Night, Daddy.

152
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,828
One...

153
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,458
two...

154
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,127
three...

155
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:56,141
I did not. Come on!

156
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:59,921
- Good night, Dana.
- Good night, Dad.

157
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,921
- Get off the phone, Dana.
- Okay, Dad.

158
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,604
One...

159
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,731
two...

160
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,834
Three...

161
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:17,900
four...

162
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,072
Five...

163
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:31,890
They're here.

164
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:48,309
Listen to me, Jeff.
No, I'm not kidding.

165
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:52,441
I know. How could anybody
sleep through a 6.5?

166
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:56,513
There was damage. Yeah, the bedroom.
There's stuff in pieces all over.

167
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:02,957
We're listening to the radio.
There's nothing on the radio at all.

168
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:10,698
You are so obnoxious!
You drive me nuts!

169
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,736
Force field.

170
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,714
- You are so obnoxious.
- Got my nose.

171
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,778
This means war, and I mean it!

172
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,383
- Hey, watch out.
- Honey, chew your food ten times.

173
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:28,521
You're a big barf bag.

174
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:30,793
You're a doggie bag.

175
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:34,570
- I won't eat it.
- There you go.

176
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,038
Sweetheart, last night
when you said, "They're here"...

177
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:41,342
Can I take my goldfish to school?

178
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:45,579
Maybe the fault line runs directly under
our house. Wouldn't that be a scream?

179
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:48,019
The ceiling got crumbs
all over my bed.

180
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,992
Remember last night when you woke up
and said, "They're here"?

181
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:56,055
Who did you mean?
Who's here?

182
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:58,033
The TV people.

183
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:01,371
- She's stoned.
- What do you know?

184
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:04,034
More than you! Ask Dad!

185
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,806
- "Ask Dad!"
- "Ask Dad!"

186
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,609
"Ask Dad!"

187
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,878
It's not my mess!

188
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,981
Thanks a lot, jerko.
I've got class in 20 minutes.

189
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,557
Give me this
before you cut yourself.

190
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,792
Did the earth move for you?

191
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:26,030
It wasn't quite the same
thing for us, Jeff. Huh?

192
00:26:26,104 --> 00:26:29,472
Okay. Yeah, right. Okay.

193
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:35,010
- Give me that before you cut yourself.
- It's not my fault.

194
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:37,380
Bye, sweet pea.
I'm outta here.

195
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,819
- Bye, honey.
- I'm outta here.

196
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:42,220
- You I can handle.
- I got school.

197
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,955
- Well, breakfast first.
- All right. I'll just flunk.

198
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:13,391
It happens on every job.

199
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,364
Look at this!

200
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,898
I love that swing.

201
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,972
I love you. I love you.

202
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:29,773
I love it.

203
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,920
E. Buzz, no, no!
Get down.

204
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:46,200
Carol Anne, I've told you guys
to push your chairs in when you're done.

205
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,945
Honey, you're gonna ruin your eyes.
This is not good for you.

206
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,275
What's the matter?

207
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:20,004
What are you doing?

208
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:57,361
- How is it?
- Great, Mrs. Freeling.

209
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:00,729
- Okay, Bluto, give me my cup.
- You sure make good coffee.

210
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:21,017
Oh, Jesus!
Don't do that, honey.

211
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:25,223
You wanna see Mommy lying in a cigar box
covered with licorice?

212
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,024
Did you do this?

213
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,632
You guys.

214
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:36,371
I asked you
not to pull the chairs out.

215
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,668
The TV people?

216
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:12,248
Do you see them?

217
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,469
Do you?

218
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,558
I think you're really
gonna enjoy this kitchen.

219
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:44,496
This is our latest development.
We call this phase four.

220
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:46,500
Where do you live, Mr. Freeling?

221
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:50,767
We were the first family to set up house
in the Cuesta Verde Estates.

222
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,364
Oh, phase one.

223
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:55,173
We had to pass through
my neighborhood to get here.

224
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:58,114
Oh, that area with
the lived-in look.

225
00:30:58,183 --> 00:31:01,517
It has that, but in a couple of months
you won't be able to distinguish...

226
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:05,490
phase one from phase three to phase...

227
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,392
We have a saying around here.

228
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:11,193
"The grass grows greener
on every side."

229
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:16,700
- That's the way I feel about it.
- I can't tell one house from the other.

230
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:18,798
I think you're right.

231
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:22,710
But I think our construction standards
are really very liberal.

232
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,217
I have this neighbor, and he built
his Jacuzzi in his bedroom...

233
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,778
and it has a running aqueduct
connected to a wading pool outside.

234
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:32,451
It's built half in
and half out of his living room.

235
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:35,462
It was featured in last month's
issue of "Town and Country."

236
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,794
I'll show you the den.

237
00:31:57,158 --> 00:31:59,149
Honey, come here, quick!

238
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:02,493
- Hurry, before it stops again!
- But the cans...

239
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:07,034
- Easy.
- All right.

240
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:13,773
Just stand right here, okay?

241
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:18,306
I've kept Dana and Robbie out of this,
but Carol Anne was here so she knows.

242
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:21,479
Dana would blab, and Robbie
would be up for three weeks.

243
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:24,423
I think you should sit down.

244
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,189
Now just stand, okay?

245
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:30,825
Now just be calm.

246
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:34,360
Now reach back into our past
when you used to have an open mind.

247
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:36,201
Remember that?

248
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:40,143
Just try to use that
for the next couple of minutes.

249
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:41,908
- Okay?
- Okay.

250
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:44,314
Mother didn't cook any dinner.

251
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:47,149
We'll go to Pizza Hut, okay?

252
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:49,349
Now just look.

253
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,893
Just look. Just watch.

254
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,840
Come here, sweetheart.

255
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,673
Honey, could you move
the chair out of the way...

256
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:35,978
and just stay down there?

257
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,143
- Let's show Daddy.
- I'm hungry.

258
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:40,313
Now don't argue with Mommy.

259
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:42,653
Let's just do this once.

260
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,019
Okay, here we go.

261
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,691
I want pepperoni pizza.

262
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:55,507
Mommy, that burns.

263
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,670
The floor needs more wax.
Steven, you do it.

264
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,736
Honey, try.

265
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:04,008
It's like there's this tickling...

266
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,078
right in here,
and it starts to pull you.

267
00:34:07,156 --> 00:34:09,887
It pulls you, and suddenly
it's like there's no air...

268
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,829
except that you can breathe,
and you're getting pulled along...

269
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,061
- Hi, Ben.
- Mr. Tuthill, hi.

270
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:20,800
My TV's not on, so if you're
havin' problems with your set...

271
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:24,675
It's nothing like that.
Diane and I were just wondering...

272
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:28,273
- This will sound strange coming from me.
- I doubt that.

273
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:33,714
The mosquitoes are awful.

274
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,725
They're chowin' down.

275
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:38,023
I've never been bothered by 'em.

276
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:41,259
I don't think I've ever
been bitten by one of 'em.

277
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:46,067
As far as I know, nobody in my family's
ever been affected by 'em.

278
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,073
Mosquito ever suck on you, son?

279
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,804
- I don't know, Dad.
- He don't know.

280
00:34:55,517 --> 00:34:57,110
Look.

281
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,594
I'm sorry.

282
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:07,257
Uh, Mr. Tuthill, look.

283
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:10,769
We were just...
What we were wondering...

284
00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:14,137
Diane, my wife,
and I were wondering, Ben...

285
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,508
somethin' funny's
goin' on here next door.

286
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,445
Somethin', uh...

287
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:23,111
We were wondering if maybe you had
experienced any disturbances lately.

288
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,052
What kind of disturbances?

289
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,356
Um, oh, you know, like...

290
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:34,059
dishes or furniture
moving around by themselves.

291
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:40,472
Don't scratch.
You're gonna infect 'em.

292
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:42,942
Just let me put this on.

293
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:45,981
- Don't.
- Boy, did I feel like a fool.

294
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,746
I'm sorry, but I had to say something.
We were losing blood.

295
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,415
- We'll keep this thing in the family.
- Don't scratch.

296
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,481
Tomorrow I'll call somebody.

297
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,052
Who, for instance?
I already looked in the Yellow Pages.

298
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,328
Furniture movers we got.
Strange phenomena, there's no listing.

299
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:06,269
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

300
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,037
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand...

301
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:11,774
five, one thousand...

302
00:36:11,848 --> 00:36:13,873
Honey, look.

303
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,944
I lived with this freaky thing all day
and nothing bad happened.

304
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:22,893
It's like another side of nature, a side
that we're not qualified to understand.

305
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:27,297
When you overreact, it makes
what happened much too important.

306
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:30,360
No one's goin' in the kitchen
'til I know what's happening.

307
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:35,072
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

308
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:37,409
three, one thousand,
four, one thousand...

309
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:47,417
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three...

310
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,626
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

311
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:09,576
Help me!

312
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:40,289
Help me!

313
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:46,025
- Help me, Dad!
- Be careful!

314
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,898
Dad, come on!

315
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:18,736
Help me!

316
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:25,042
He's coming!

317
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:26,744
It's taking me in!

318
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,378
- He's coming!
- It's hurting me!

319
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:31,584
- Steven, hurry!
- Dad, help me!

320
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,684
- Hold on!
- Hold on to him!

321
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:56,656
Hold me, Dad!

322
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:03,056
- I got him!
- My leg!

323
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,328
Dad, my leg!

324
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:08,034
Help me, Dad!

325
00:39:15,348 --> 00:39:18,944
Look, Mom, Dad!
It's a tornado!

326
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,786
It must've just skimmed us.
There wouldn't be a house left if...

327
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,223
I left her upstairs!

328
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:34,337
Baby, we're coming!

329
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,049
- I'll go check the kitchen.
- No! I'll do it!

330
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,108
You check your room.

331
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:31,275
Baby?

332
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,525
Sweetheart?

333
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:50,963
Baby?

334
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,941
Did you find her?

335
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,648
I've looked everywhere.
This is crazy.

336
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,017
Oh, my... My God.

337
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:14,726
The swimming pool.

338
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,034
Be careful, honey!

339
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,056
Mommy!

340
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:47,640
Nothing!

341
00:41:54,483 --> 00:41:56,383
Thank God.

342
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,319
What?

343
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,623
Oh, Carol Anne, thank God! Baby!

344
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,563
Baby, where are you?

345
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:18,473
- Mommy, come over here!
- What is it?

346
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:20,515
What, baby?

347
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:28,555
I can't hear you, Mommy.

348
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,561
Where are you?

349
00:42:36,736 --> 00:42:40,798
I can't hear you, Mommy!

350
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,810
Where are you?

351
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:54,887
What members of the household
are involved...

352
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:57,053
and what are their ages?

353
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:00,622
There's Diane, my wife.
She's 31.

354
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:03,431
Uh, 32. I'm sorry.

355
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:07,737
My oldest daughter, Dana.
She's 16.

356
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,802
My son, Robert, is eight.

357
00:43:14,752 --> 00:43:16,185
Five.

358
00:43:18,255 --> 00:43:20,884
Has there been any publicity
about these events?

359
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,894
Absolutely nothing.

360
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,361
Can you be reasonably sure...

361
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:29,061
of not letting any get started?

362
00:43:29,136 --> 00:43:31,298
That's the last thing we want.

363
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:34,069
We haven't even gone to the police.

364
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:38,204
Would your family welcome...

365
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:42,582
a serious investigation
of these disturbances...

366
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:46,146
by someone who can make
firsthand observations?

367
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:49,923
Look, Dr. Lesh,
we don't care about the disturbances...

368
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:54,062
the pounding and the flashing...

369
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:57,230
the screaming, the music.

370
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:02,106
We just want you
to find our little girl.

371
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,356
I guess I should warn you that...

372
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:19,695
we keep the room locked off
from the rest of the house.

373
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,243
Robbie's sleeping with us now, and Dana
spends a lot of time with friends.

374
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:32,044
How many disturbances
have you recorded in the room?

375
00:44:32,117 --> 00:44:34,745
We don't go in the room anymore.

376
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,990
Mr. Freeling, we'll record
any psychotronic energy or event.

377
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:46,022
Yes, Ryan photographed an extraordinary
episode on a case in Redlands.

378
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,732
That's right. It was a child's toy,
a very small Matchbox vehicle.

379
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:53,867
It rolled seven feet
across a linoleum surface.

380
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:56,436
The duration of the event
was seven hours.

381
00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:58,449
Seven hours for what?

382
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:01,077
For the vehicle
to complete the distance.

383
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:05,056
Of course, this would never
register on the naked eye...

384
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:07,616
but I have it recorded
on time-lapse camera.

385
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:10,887
It's fantastic.

386
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:51,009
We've been trying to
hold ourselves together as a family.

387
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:53,450
Of course,
no one's been sleeping much.

388
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,750
Steven has missed so much work.

389
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:58,951
But he's been wonderful.
Really wonderful.

390
00:46:00,295 --> 00:46:02,856
How long have you been
investigating haunted houses?

391
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:04,594
- Mrs. Freeling...
- Diane.

392
00:46:06,336 --> 00:46:10,933
The determination as to whether
your home is haunted is not very easy.

393
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,508
What I meant to say was...

394
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:17,777
it might very well be
a poltergeist intrusion...

395
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,581
instead of a classic haunting.

396
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:24,315
There's a difference?

397
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:26,361
Did you see that?

398
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:29,023
There'll be two more.
They travel in pairs.

399
00:46:29,098 --> 00:46:30,896
Dr. Casey.

400
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:36,768
Gotta be quicker than that.

401
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:41,377
It's electrical.
You can smell the charge.

402
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:43,177
What about poltergeists?

403
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:48,587
Poltergeists are usually
associated with an individual.

404
00:46:48,657 --> 00:46:51,558
Hauntings seem to be connected...

405
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:54,926
with an area,
a house, usually.

406
00:46:54,998 --> 00:46:58,162
Poltergeist disturbances
have a fairly short duration.

407
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:00,363
Perhaps a couple of months.

408
00:47:00,438 --> 00:47:02,429
Hauntings can go on for years.

409
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:08,708
Are you telling me that all of this
could just suddenly end at any time?

410
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:11,115
Yes, it could.

411
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,312
Unless it's a haunting.

412
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:16,119
But hauntings don't usually
revolve around living people.

413
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:20,788
Then we don't have much time, because
my daughter is alive in this house.

414
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:24,260
While trying to escape
from an unknown assailant.

415
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:28,033
Marshall is listed as critical
and under intensive care.

416
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:31,440
This is probably
gonna seem a little strange.

417
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,148
We hear better on this channel.

418
00:47:40,222 --> 00:47:42,213
Don't ask me why.

419
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:45,320
Well...

420
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,435
I guess I'll call her.

421
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:01,204
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

422
00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:04,047
We wanna talk to you.

423
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:13,927
Please answer me, baby.

424
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:16,934
Please answer me.

425
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:19,937
Please talk to me, bunny.

426
00:48:26,214 --> 00:48:27,738
Look at the dog.

427
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,554
Are you with us now?

428
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:40,662
Can you say hello to Daddy?

429
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,577
Hello, Daddy.

430
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,517
Hello, sweet pea.

431
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:03,958
It's Mommy, sweetheart.

432
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:06,292
Hello, Mommy.

433
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:08,162
Hello, baby.

434
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:13,800
Can you see me?

435
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,973
Can you see Mommy?

436
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:24,181
Mommy, where are you?
Where are you?

437
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:27,520
We're home, baby.
We're home.

438
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:31,927
- Can you find a way home to us, baby?
- Mommy, where are you?

439
00:49:31,997 --> 00:49:34,432
I can't find you!
I can't!

440
00:49:36,002 --> 00:49:38,528
I'm afraid of the light, Mommy!

441
00:49:38,606 --> 00:49:40,699
I'm afraid of the light!

442
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:42,368
Tell her to stay away
from the light!

443
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:46,472
- Maybe it's a way out.
- It is, but not for her.

444
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:50,145
Tell her quickly.

445
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:53,089
- Stay away from the light!
- Tell her, Diane.

446
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:54,989
Stay away from the light!

447
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,495
The light is dangerous!
Don't go near it!

448
00:49:57,563 --> 00:50:00,931
- Don't even look at the light!
- I don't believe it.

449
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,663
The voice could be coming
from a CB transmitter.

450
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:05,672
This isn't a hoax!

451
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:23,528
What the hell is this?

452
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:25,359
Anything?

453
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:29,494
- Nothing's registered.
- Mommy, there's somebody here.

454
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:37,237
Mommy, is that you?

455
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:40,181
No, it's not Mommy.
Who is it, Dr. Lesh?

456
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,049
- Who's with you, baby?
- Who's with you?

457
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:45,955
Somebody's coming!
Help me, please!

458
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,155
My God! My baby!

459
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:54,968
You bastards!
She's just a baby!

460
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:58,905
Help her!
Can't you hear what's happening?

461
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:00,966
Listen!

462
00:51:01,044 --> 00:51:03,946
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

463
00:51:04,014 --> 00:51:07,507
Mommy, help me!

464
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:27,775
She just moved through me.

465
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:29,870
My God!

466
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:32,040
I felt her.

467
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:37,386
I can smell her!

468
00:51:37,457 --> 00:51:40,950
It's her!

469
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:43,759
Smell my clothes.
She's all over me.

470
00:51:43,832 --> 00:51:45,424
- It's her.
- My God.

471
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,163
It's her. I felt her.

472
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:51,634
It is. It's her.

473
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,073
It is.

474
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:56,204
It's my baby.

475
00:51:57,749 --> 00:52:00,344
She went through my soul.

476
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:31,284
I can't hear her anymore.
Honey?

477
00:52:34,462 --> 00:52:37,432
Where exactly do you suppose
Carol Anne was playing...

478
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:40,333
when she vanished from sight?

479
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:46,103
Where was Carol Anne playing
when she disappeared?

480
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,672
Her bedroom closet.

481
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,444
Let's go up there.

482
00:52:51,517 --> 00:52:53,679
They won't let you in.

483
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:56,416
We'll just see about that.

484
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:00,154
Whatever happened to you?

485
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:03,687
I was just about to check out
the kid's bedroom when... I don't know.

486
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,701
Something took a bite outta me.

487
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,134
You got bit?

488
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:11,642
- That or the world's worst muscle spasm.
- Let's have a look.

489
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,317
- Think we'll spend the night downstairs.
- No. Wrong.

490
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:22,719
Honey, you take Dana and Robbie
and go and spend tonight in town.

491
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,316
I am not leaving here
without Carol Anne.

492
00:53:25,393 --> 00:53:28,227
Mom, Dad, I can't stay here anymore.

493
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:30,630
You go, baby, go.

494
00:53:30,701 --> 00:53:33,670
I'm not gonna leave
anybody in this house alone.

495
00:53:50,592 --> 00:53:52,686
Can we talk to you?

496
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,354
Let's go.

497
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:01,168
- Any movement from those things?
- There's been some ionization flux.

498
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,767
I'd like to make sure they're not caused
by humidity from structure leakage...

499
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:07,439
but I'm not goin' up there
to find out.

500
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:10,780
We have got much more than the
paranormal episode taking place here.

501
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:13,616
There is a measurable
physical science in this house...

502
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:17,648
that goes far beyond the creaking doors
or cold spots I've experienced.

503
00:54:17,726 --> 00:54:20,787
The voice on television.
Where is it coming from?

504
00:54:20,864 --> 00:54:24,824
The absence of a signal on a channel
that is not receiving a broadcast...

505
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:29,341
means that it can receive a lot of noise
from many things, like short waves.

506
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:32,037
Solar disturbances,
car ignition sparkings.

507
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:35,775
Outer space.
Or inner space.

508
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:41,451
What if these people have an area
of bilocation in their own living room?

509
00:54:41,524 --> 00:54:42,957
What do you mean?

510
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:45,119
If that is the way out...

511
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:49,562
then maybe somewhere in this house
there's a way in.

512
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:01,147
No, please.
Leave it on.

513
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:06,320
Thanks.

514
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:11,092
You know,
when it's quiet like now...

515
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:14,723
I can imagine how all of this
must look from your side.

516
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,268
I'm really embarrassed.

517
00:55:17,336 --> 00:55:19,133
Nonsense.

518
00:55:19,205 --> 00:55:22,642
I'm the one who should be embarrassed
being here with you nice people.

519
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:26,680
Parapsychology isn't something
you master in.

520
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:29,240
There are no
certificates of graduation...

521
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:32,584
no licenses to practice.

522
00:55:32,656 --> 00:55:35,386
I am a professional psychologist.

523
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:39,726
I spend most of my time
engaged in this ghostly hobby.

524
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:44,099
Which makes me the most irresponsible
woman of my age that I know.

525
00:55:47,174 --> 00:55:49,870
Would you like a glass for that?

526
00:55:49,943 --> 00:55:51,468
No, thank you.

527
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,420
You know, you were very funny.

528
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,048
Your hands were shaking
about a mile a minute.

529
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,488
This isn't over.

530
00:56:06,565 --> 00:56:08,966
I'm absolutely terrified.

531
00:56:13,974 --> 00:56:17,035
It's all the things
that we don't understand.

532
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:22,979
I feel like the protohuman,
coming out of the forest primeval...

533
00:56:23,052 --> 00:56:26,386
and seeing the moon for the first time
and throwing rocks at it.

534
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:29,859
If I got killed,
would I come back...

535
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,864
and get stuck in the house
like my sister?

536
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,696
Your sister isn't dead, Robbie.

537
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:36,702
If I got killed...

538
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,865
could I visit her
and show her how to get back here?

539
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,775
You could tie a rope around me
and hold it tight...

540
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:47,374
then somebody could come and get us,
and we could live somewhere else.

541
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:51,881
Some people believe...

542
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:54,858
that when you die,
your soul goes to heaven.

543
00:56:54,926 --> 00:56:56,918
When Grandpa was dead...

544
00:56:56,996 --> 00:57:00,626
I looked at him in the hospital bed
and I was watching...

545
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:03,295
but I didn't see anything
go up out of him.

546
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:06,499
His soul is invisible, Robbie.
You couldn't see it.

547
00:57:06,574 --> 00:57:09,510
But how come Grandpa isn't
on television with Carol Anne?

548
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:13,614
Some people believe
that when people die...

549
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:17,119
there's a wonderful light...

550
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:19,316
as bright as the sun...

551
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:22,418
but it doesn't hurt
to look into it.

552
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:26,091
All the answers to all the questions
that you ever want to know...

553
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,692
are inside that light.

554
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:32,866
And when you walk to it,
you become a part of it forever.

555
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,735
And then, some people die...

556
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:39,305
but they don't know
that they've gone.

557
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:43,082
They think they're still alive?

558
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:48,723
Maybe they didn't want to die.

559
00:57:48,795 --> 00:57:51,059
Maybe they weren't ready.

560
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:53,066
Maybe they hadn't
lived fully yet...

561
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:57,162
or they'd lived a long time,
but they still wanted more life.

562
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:00,573
They resist going into that light...

563
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,977
however hard the light wants them.

564
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:07,018
They just hang around...

565
00:58:07,085 --> 00:58:11,318
watch TV,
watch their friends grow up...

566
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:14,883
feeling unhappy and jealous.

567
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:17,796
Those feelings are bad.

568
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:19,595
They hurt.

569
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:23,733
And then...

570
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:26,139
some people...

571
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:29,976
just get lost
on the way to the light...

572
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:33,779
and they need someone
to guide them to it.

573
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:36,413
So some people get angry...

574
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:39,151
and throw things around,
like in my bedroom?

575
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:44,164
Just like in school.

576
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:46,826
Like, some kids are nice to you...

577
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,837
some kids are mean.

578
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:51,602
I got beat up once
by three kids.

579
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:53,609
They took my lunch money.

580
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:57,011
Maybe they got hit by a truck,
and they're upstairs right now.

581
00:58:57,081 --> 00:59:01,018
Listen, partner, maybe we oughta
get some shut-eye, okay?

582
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:03,678
You know what?

583
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,885
When we called Grandma tonight...

584
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,861
she got really excited that
you're comin' to stay with her...

585
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:12,959
and she's plannin' all these
neat things for you guys to do.

586
00:59:13,036 --> 00:59:15,266
Can I take E. Buzz with me
when we go?

587
00:59:15,338 --> 00:59:17,671
Sure you can.

588
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:20,107
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetie.

589
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:21,839
Night, lady.

590
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,383
Night, Dad.

591
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:27,845
Night, Rob.

592
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:30,785
I love you.

593
00:59:32,393 --> 00:59:34,486
Good night, Carol Anne.

594
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,396
I'm gonna go
get something to eat.

595
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:04,485
What is it?

596
01:06:21,513 --> 01:06:22,912
Roll it back.

597
01:06:28,222 --> 01:06:30,486
I think we got one.
I think it recorded.

598
01:06:36,899 --> 01:06:39,061
Yes. It recorded.

599
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:59,258
Look at all of them.

600
01:06:59,327 --> 01:07:01,296
Is that our house?

601
01:07:05,002 --> 01:07:06,936
Who are all those people?

602
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:11,034
They're so alone. So alone.

603
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,417
Where are they coming from?

604
01:07:20,087 --> 01:07:21,520
I don't know.

605
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,129
Call me, okay?

606
01:08:03,408 --> 01:08:05,673
This cameo is over
a hundred years old.

607
01:08:06,779 --> 01:08:08,247
Yeah, some haul, huh?

608
01:08:08,315 --> 01:08:11,808
And this watch is only
a few years old, and it's not yours.

609
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,284
Well, I'm off.

610
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,293
I'm taking these back to the lab
along with the tapes.

611
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:22,495
I'm going to have to
display these, you know.

612
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,559
- Please, not on "60 Minutes."
- Or "That's Incredible!"

613
01:08:25,637 --> 01:08:28,573
I'll get it. Excuse me.

614
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:50,097
I'm leaving Ryan here with you.

615
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:53,262
Marty won't be coming back.

616
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:00,808
I am coming back.

617
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:07,948
And I'll bring some help.

618
01:09:08,024 --> 01:09:09,958
Try not to worry.

619
01:09:13,965 --> 01:09:15,694
Thank you.

620
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:17,759
We've missed you
down at the office.

621
01:09:17,837 --> 01:09:22,571
The boys have gotten worried,
so I took it upon myself to...

622
01:09:22,643 --> 01:09:25,875
Jesus, Steve, you look like shit.
Aren't you feeling any better?

623
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:29,440
I'm still weak, Mr. Teague.
I've got the flu, I can't get up...

624
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:32,079
Looks like you got
some cable problems here.

625
01:09:32,155 --> 01:09:35,249
Yeah. The cable's been off
for a couple of weeks.

626
01:09:35,325 --> 01:09:38,318
We'll have to look into that.
The rest of the block dark too?

627
01:09:38,396 --> 01:09:41,798
No, just us.

628
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:45,065
You got some electrical problems
as well here.

629
01:09:45,138 --> 01:09:48,700
What have you got screwed in there,
a 300-watt bulb?

630
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:50,745
You afraid of burglars,
or are you trying to attract...

631
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,746
every insect in Cuesta Verde?

632
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:57,309
- Steve, are you happy here?
- Yes, I am, sir.

633
01:09:57,386 --> 01:09:59,514
Forgive me for asking
all these questions...

634
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:02,424
but we don't want to lose
the best rep we've ever had...

635
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:05,692
to the flu
or other opportunities.

636
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:08,325
Seeing all that software
in your living room...

637
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,928
makes me wonder, maybe you've
got something going on the side.

638
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:14,531
No, I just read "Popular Mechanics."
I got hobbies.

639
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:16,601
Feel like going
for a little ride?

640
01:10:16,678 --> 01:10:18,612
I'd like to show you something.

641
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:10,912
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

642
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:16,610
One of your children
was born in your house, huh?

643
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,960
I understand that she's
missed a lot of school.

644
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,797
One of Trask's daughters
is in the same nursery class.

645
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:30,031
She got the flu as well, huh?

646
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:32,073
Yeah, we've all got
the same thing.

647
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,300
I'm sorry.

648
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:37,745
- I didn't see her.
- She's around.

649
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:41,616
I wonder if you'd mind
if I asked you a question.

650
01:11:41,686 --> 01:11:44,052
Are you thinking about
leaving Cuesta Verde?

651
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:49,022
How could anyone in the world
have a problem...

652
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,030
on a day like this?

653
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:55,965
How's that spot
for a bay window?

654
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,901
It's pretty nice if you're
living up here, but...

655
01:12:02,012 --> 01:12:03,947
not so great
down in the valley...

656
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:06,142
Iooking at homes
cutting into the hillside.

657
01:12:06,217 --> 01:12:08,550
You don't have to live
in the valley anymore.

658
01:12:10,222 --> 01:12:11,850
What are you saying?

659
01:12:11,925 --> 01:12:14,520
We're starting phase five
right here where we're standing.

660
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:17,530
All of this can be
your master bedroom suite.

661
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:20,227
That can be your view.
Interested?

662
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,973
Well, Mr. Teague,
that's a generous offer.

663
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:29,909
- I'm just not a developer.
- You're responsible for 42% of sales.

664
01:12:29,981 --> 01:12:32,347
That's almost half
of everything down there.

665
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:35,876
Almost $70 million worth
of dwelling and properties.

666
01:12:35,955 --> 01:12:38,390
That's a whole generation
of security...

667
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,689
that nobody
can put a price tag on.

668
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:45,165
I know we should have made you
a full partner three years ago.

669
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:47,167
I don't want to lose you now.

670
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:56,736
Not much room
for a pool, is there?

671
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:59,046
We own all the land.

672
01:12:59,118 --> 01:13:02,179
We've already made arrangements
for relocating the cemetery.

673
01:13:04,057 --> 01:13:05,388
You're kidding me.

674
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:09,191
- That's sacrilegious, isn't it?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

675
01:13:09,263 --> 01:13:12,893
After all, it's not ancient
tribal burial ground.

676
01:13:12,968 --> 01:13:15,267
It's just... people.

677
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:18,565
Besides, we've done it before.

678
01:13:19,977 --> 01:13:21,138
When?

679
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:24,148
In '76. Right down there.

680
01:13:29,957 --> 01:13:31,390
Cuesta Verde?

681
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,326
All 300 acres.
It was quite a deal.

682
01:13:34,396 --> 01:13:36,456
But I never heard
anything about it.

683
01:13:36,532 --> 01:13:39,058
It's not something
one advertises on a billboard...

684
01:13:39,136 --> 01:13:41,070
or on the side of a bus.

685
01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:44,336
Don't worry. Friends and relatives
can visit their loved ones...

686
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:46,343
in Broxton Memorial Park.

687
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:48,403
It's only five minutes further.

688
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,211
Oh, yeah. Five minutes.
That's no great hardship.

689
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:55,288
I suppose that would be okay.

690
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,820
Okay with whom?

691
01:13:59,694 --> 01:14:01,219
Whomever might complain.

692
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:04,700
Nobody's complained until now.

693
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,688
We've had two experiences
in the kitchen. This is the den.

694
01:14:39,645 --> 01:14:41,613
Y'all mind hangin' back?

695
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:43,616
You're jammin' my frequencies.

696
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:36,841
So... what side of the rainbow
are we working tonight, Dr. Lesh?

697
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:42,955
- This your Knott's Berry Farm solution?
- I know what you're thinking.

698
01:15:43,026 --> 01:15:47,259
But you must take my word for it.
She's cleaned many houses.

699
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:49,266
Her gifts have been documented...

700
01:15:49,334 --> 01:15:51,632
We haven't heard Carol Anne
since last night.

701
01:15:51,703 --> 01:15:53,831
Why is this door locked,
Mr. Freeling?

702
01:15:58,412 --> 01:16:00,540
- Answer her, Steven.
- I am.

703
01:16:03,118 --> 01:16:05,586
I am addressing the living.

704
01:16:06,322 --> 01:16:08,291
I'm sorry.

705
01:16:08,358 --> 01:16:10,793
That's the room
my son and daughter used to occupy.

706
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:12,829
We believe it's the heart
of the house.

707
01:16:12,897 --> 01:16:15,264
This house has many hearts.

708
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:19,696
- What is the matter?
- What's the matter?

709
01:16:22,376 --> 01:16:25,073
I was trying to answer her
with my mind...

710
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:27,171
and she couldn't hear me.

711
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,276
I thought you said this Tangina Barrons
was an extraordinary clairvoyant.

712
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:31,684
I am.

713
01:16:33,657 --> 01:16:36,593
I just don't like trick answers.

714
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,830
Come here, honey...

715
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:49,776
and give me your hand.

716
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:53,147
I'm not gonna bite you.

717
01:17:04,029 --> 01:17:07,966
Come on down here. You'll give me
a whiplash lookin' up at you.

718
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:16,875
Your daughter is alive
and in this house.

719
01:17:29,294 --> 01:17:32,230
Where was the last incident
of bilocation?

720
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:41,832
I get my strongest feelin'...

721
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:46,281
the point of origin is in
the child's closet upstairs.

722
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:50,382
Yes. I believe that too.

723
01:17:50,455 --> 01:17:55,393
Honey, you're gonna be strong for me
and for your daughter.

724
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:59,159
I can do absolutely nothing
without your faith in this world...

725
01:17:59,232 --> 01:18:01,292
and your love for the children.

726
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:03,860
I will.
Believe me, I will.

727
01:18:03,938 --> 01:18:07,670
And will you do anything I ask,
even if it comes contrary...

728
01:18:07,743 --> 01:18:10,872
to your beliefs as a human being
and a Christian?

729
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:13,473
Yes, I promise. Please!

730
01:18:20,559 --> 01:18:22,493
Would you all come on in?

731
01:18:23,363 --> 01:18:24,625
Gather 'round.

732
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,339
There is no death.

733
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:37,979
It is only a transition to
a different sphere of consciousness.

734
01:18:38,048 --> 01:18:42,281
Carol Anne is not like those
she's with.

735
01:18:43,688 --> 01:18:46,351
She is a living presence...

736
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:49,828
in their spiritual earthbound plane.

737
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:53,766
They are attracted
to the one thing about her...

738
01:18:53,835 --> 01:18:58,967
that is different from themselves...
her life force.

739
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,602
It is very strong.

740
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:05,080
It gives off
its own illumination.

741
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:08,642
It is a light that implies life...

742
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,121
and memory of love and home...

743
01:19:12,559 --> 01:19:14,494
and earthly pleasures...

744
01:19:15,763 --> 01:19:18,562
something they
desperately desire...

745
01:19:19,634 --> 01:19:21,693
but can't have anymore.

746
01:19:23,306 --> 01:19:26,640
Right now, she's the closest thing
to that...

747
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:31,712
and that is
a terrible distraction...

748
01:19:31,783 --> 01:19:35,811
from the real light
that has finally come for them.

749
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:39,149
Do you understand me?

750
01:19:42,396 --> 01:19:47,961
These souls, who for
whatever reason are not at rest...

751
01:19:48,037 --> 01:19:51,439
are also not aware
that they have passed on.

752
01:19:52,676 --> 01:19:56,477
They're not part of consciousness
as we know it.

753
01:19:56,548 --> 01:19:59,848
They linger in
a perpetual dream state...

754
01:20:00,987 --> 01:20:04,082
a nightmare from which
they cannot awake.

755
01:20:05,225 --> 01:20:10,221
Inside the spectral light
is salvation...

756
01:20:11,467 --> 01:20:14,335
a window to the next plane.

757
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:16,565
They must pass through
this membrane...

758
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,874
where friends are waiting
to guide them to new destinies.

759
01:20:22,514 --> 01:20:25,814
Carol Anne must help them
cross over...

760
01:20:25,885 --> 01:20:30,755
and she will only hear
her mother's voice.

761
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,455
Now...

762
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:38,796
hold on to yourselves.

763
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:45,009
There's one more thing.

764
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:49,776
A terrible presence
is in there with her.

765
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:55,154
So much rage.
So much betrayal.

766
01:20:55,222 --> 01:20:58,386
I've never sensed
anything like it.

767
01:20:59,695 --> 01:21:02,824
I don't know
what hovers over this house...

768
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:06,666
but it was strong enough to punch
a hole into this world...

769
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,706
and take your daughter
away from you.

770
01:21:10,675 --> 01:21:14,578
It keeps Carol Anne
very close to it...

771
01:21:14,647 --> 01:21:16,980
and away from the spectral light.

772
01:21:17,884 --> 01:21:20,445
It lies to her.

773
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,720
It says things
only a child can understand.

774
01:21:24,793 --> 01:21:28,252
It has been usin' her
to restrain the others.

775
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:35,299
To her, it simply is
another child.

776
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:41,478
To us, it is the beast.

777
01:21:56,533 --> 01:21:58,593
Now let's go get your daughter.

778
01:22:03,342 --> 01:22:07,541
Red ribbons,
handkerchiefs, tennis balls.

779
01:22:07,614 --> 01:22:09,549
Okay, rope's ready.

780
01:22:09,617 --> 01:22:12,485
- Bathwater?
- I shut it off. It's ready too.

781
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:15,524
All right. Call to her.

782
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,735
Carol Anne, it's Mommy.
Can you hear me?

783
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:34,674
Carol Anne,
please tell Mommy hello.

784
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:38,753
Try again.

785
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:42,548
Can you say hello to Daddy?

786
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:46,126
Daddy and I miss you so much.

787
01:22:47,364 --> 01:22:50,198
So much. We love you so much.

788
01:22:50,268 --> 01:22:52,430
Please, just say hello.

789
01:22:52,505 --> 01:22:55,201
- She's under restraint.
- What?

790
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:58,142
- Who's restraining her?
- There are many arms about her.

791
01:22:58,212 --> 01:23:02,912
She thinks it's safe. Who is she more
threatened by, you or your husband?

792
01:23:02,985 --> 01:23:05,886
Neither. Steve decides
the punishment the children...

793
01:23:05,955 --> 01:23:07,890
That's not fair.
I've never laid a hand...

794
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:11,190
Fight about it later.
Steven, make Carol Anne answer you.

795
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:16,467
Be cross with her.

796
01:23:16,535 --> 01:23:18,231
It's Daddy.

797
01:23:18,304 --> 01:23:20,898
Be angry with her,
or you'll never see her again.

798
01:23:20,974 --> 01:23:23,569
Carol Anne, I want you
to answer me.

799
01:23:23,644 --> 01:23:26,739
Tell her if she doesn't answer you,
she'll get a spankin'.

800
01:23:26,815 --> 01:23:29,785
- I've never spanked the children.
- Honey, please. Just tell her.

801
01:23:32,823 --> 01:23:35,383
Carol Anne,
you answer your parents...

802
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:37,928
or you're gonna get
a real spanking from the both of us!

803
01:23:37,996 --> 01:23:40,090
Mommy! Help me!

804
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,237
- She's away from him.
- From whom? Is she all right?

805
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:47,240
Diane, ask about the light.

806
01:23:50,178 --> 01:23:52,170
Mommy, help me, please!

807
01:23:54,249 --> 01:23:57,219
- Honey, do you see a light?
- Help me, please!

808
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:59,222
Mommy! Help me!

809
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,055
Tell her to go to the light.

810
01:24:03,762 --> 01:24:06,493
They'll follow her. They've been
followin' her for weeks.

811
01:24:06,566 --> 01:24:09,536
- You must do what I say!
- Tell her, Diane.

812
01:24:09,603 --> 01:24:12,572
Mommy, I can't find you!

813
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,609
Run to the light!
Run as fast as you can!

814
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,612
- I am in the light!
- No, honey.

815
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,773
- Tell her you are.
- No, it's a lie!

816
01:24:19,849 --> 01:24:23,445
You can't choose between life and death
when dealin' with what is in between.

817
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,455
Tell her before it's too late.

818
01:24:26,257 --> 01:24:28,726
Run to the light, baby.

819
01:24:28,794 --> 01:24:31,388
- Mommy is in the light.
- Tell her you're waiting for her.

820
01:24:31,464 --> 01:24:34,661
Mommy is waiting for you in the light.
I hate you for this.

821
01:24:35,903 --> 01:24:39,203
Now clear your minds.
It knows what scares you.

822
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,606
It has from the very beginning.

823
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:44,271
Don't give it any help.
It knows too much already.

824
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:47,807
Now, open the door.

825
01:25:23,597 --> 01:25:28,365
Ryan, get downstairs
and wait by the target!

826
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:35,701
Give me the tennis ball
marked number 1!

827
01:26:11,725 --> 01:26:15,822
Dr. Lesh! It's my handwriting!
It came right out of thin air!

828
01:26:16,998 --> 01:26:19,866
The ball came back.
It's his handwriting!

829
01:26:27,745 --> 01:26:29,407
Kiss my ass!

830
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:31,176
Number 2!

831
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,646
Give me your hand!

832
01:26:57,649 --> 01:27:00,551
She's at the mouth
of the corridor!

833
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:05,285
Tell her to stop!
Tell her not to go into the light!

834
01:27:07,562 --> 01:27:12,500
Listen to me.
Do not go into the light.

835
01:27:12,568 --> 01:27:15,595
Stop where you are.
Turn away from it.

836
01:27:15,672 --> 01:27:17,470
Don't even look at it.

837
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:20,067
Hurry with the rope!

838
01:27:23,849 --> 01:27:26,341
Throw it into the light!

839
01:27:34,396 --> 01:27:36,331
Fantastic.

840
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,594
I got it!

841
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:43,838
Tell him
to take up the slack gently.

842
01:27:43,908 --> 01:27:45,307
Take up the slack!

843
01:27:46,211 --> 01:27:48,146
Take up the slack!

844
01:28:14,046 --> 01:28:16,675
Help me tie this around my waist!

845
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,183
What are you doing?

846
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:21,381
I'm goin' in after her!

847
01:28:21,456 --> 01:28:24,187
She won't come to you!
Let me go!

848
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,990
You've never done this before!

849
01:28:27,062 --> 01:28:28,655
Neither have you!

850
01:28:29,733 --> 01:28:31,725
You're right. You go.

851
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:34,068
No! Let me!

852
01:28:34,138 --> 01:28:37,267
You can't! Who's strong enough
to stay here and hold the rope?

853
01:29:03,842 --> 01:29:05,811
I love you!

854
01:29:05,879 --> 01:29:10,817
No! Go downstairs
and wait by Ryan...

855
01:29:10,885 --> 01:29:13,548
and pull only when I say so!

856
01:29:13,622 --> 01:29:15,557
Only when I say.

857
01:29:52,605 --> 01:29:54,539
Don't let go!

858
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:56,374
Never!

859
01:30:06,522 --> 01:30:07,785
It's coming.

860
01:30:07,858 --> 01:30:10,190
How will we know she's got her?

861
01:30:11,262 --> 01:30:13,230
When will we know?

862
01:30:27,549 --> 01:30:30,110
Cross over, children.

863
01:30:30,186 --> 01:30:32,450
All are welcome.

864
01:30:32,522 --> 01:30:34,957
All welcome.

865
01:30:35,025 --> 01:30:37,085
Go into the light.

866
01:30:38,263 --> 01:30:39,560
You said, "No"!

867
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:44,263
There is peace and serenity
in the light.

868
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,272
You said don't go into the light!

869
01:30:55,985 --> 01:30:58,112
Steven, not yet!

870
01:31:16,344 --> 01:31:18,506
- They're here!
- They're back!

871
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:22,815
Diane! No, please, no!

872
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:24,616
Get 'em into the water!

873
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:27,385
- Oh, God!
- No, I'm helping you!

874
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:28,391
Don't worry.

875
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:37,235
Get 'em in the water.
She's gonna be all right.

876
01:31:43,413 --> 01:31:46,007
Come on. Breathe now.

877
01:31:46,082 --> 01:31:50,020
Just take a breath.
Breathe.

878
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,988
Breathe. Damn it, breathe!

879
01:31:54,693 --> 01:31:56,183
Breathe!

880
01:31:56,262 --> 01:31:59,130
That's it. Come on.

881
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,101
Come on. Breathe. Yeah.
That's it. Breathe.

882
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:14,215
Baby.

883
01:32:17,889 --> 01:32:19,322
Sweetheart.

884
01:32:21,027 --> 01:32:24,191
Sweet pea, it's Daddy.
Come on, honey.

885
01:32:24,264 --> 01:32:26,198
Come on, pumpkin.

886
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,702
Hi, Daddy.

887
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:55,192
This house is clean.

888
01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:15,027
Be careful.

889
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:22,471
Mom, I'm going to dinner
with Janice and Brian.

890
01:33:22,539 --> 01:33:25,440
- Is your room packed up?
- Everything but the bed.

891
01:33:25,508 --> 01:33:29,468
- Are we gonna sleep here tonight?
- I guess not.

892
01:33:29,548 --> 01:33:33,781
So you better get Brian
to bring you home right after dinner.

893
01:33:33,853 --> 01:33:37,312
Dad wants us to stay
at the Holiday Inn on I-74.

894
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:39,791
Oh, yeah.
I remember that place.

895
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,919
You what?

896
01:33:41,996 --> 01:33:43,987
Are you gonna do anything
about this?

897
01:33:44,065 --> 01:33:46,534
- About what?
- Your new gray?

898
01:33:46,602 --> 01:33:49,572
Oh. You don't like it?

899
01:33:49,639 --> 01:33:52,108
You don't think
it's kind of punk?

900
01:33:52,176 --> 01:33:53,803
Bye, Mom.

901
01:33:57,115 --> 01:33:58,548
Honey, I don't know.

902
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:02,521
Okay, Rob.
That thing almost killed me.

903
01:34:06,327 --> 01:34:08,262
You okay?
Don't hurt your back.

904
01:34:10,031 --> 01:34:11,966
How you feelin'?

905
01:34:12,034 --> 01:34:13,661
Oh, I'm good.

906
01:34:13,736 --> 01:34:16,262
I feel a little hungover,
like I've been asleep for a few days...

907
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:19,504
but... I feel good, Steven,
I really do.

908
01:34:25,185 --> 01:34:27,153
She doesn't seem
to remember any of it.

909
01:34:30,758 --> 01:34:32,750
Oh, what a day.

910
01:34:33,829 --> 01:34:35,262
Smell that mimosa.

911
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:38,562
You better cut a bouquet and
take it with you. We're not stayin'.

912
01:34:38,635 --> 01:34:40,729
I know.

913
01:34:43,073 --> 01:34:45,065
We worked so hard for this.

914
01:34:46,277 --> 01:34:48,246
A thousand beautiful memories.

915
01:34:48,314 --> 01:34:51,876
I gotta go to the office, pick up
some stuff, clean up a few things.

916
01:34:52,052 --> 01:34:53,576
I'll be back early.

917
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,520
We're leaving tonight for sure?

918
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:57,581
Yeah, we are.

919
01:34:57,659 --> 01:35:00,720
If the kids get sleepy,
let 'em sleep 'til I get home.

920
01:35:01,497 --> 01:35:02,988
How's Teague taking it?

921
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:05,729
You know Teague. He won't take
"Go to hell" for an answer.

922
01:35:05,803 --> 01:35:07,896
- What will you tell him?
- I'll give him directions.

923
01:35:39,077 --> 01:35:42,639
"...colored mixture generously
directly from applicator to hair.

924
01:35:42,715 --> 01:35:44,650
- Gently work it through..."
- Let me have that.

925
01:35:44,718 --> 01:35:47,381
I want my truck back. Stop!

926
01:35:49,157 --> 01:35:50,420
That's my truck!

927
01:35:50,492 --> 01:35:52,016
Gimme it.

928
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:58,096
"Gently work it through with fingers
to saturate every strand.

929
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,933
Then comb through
with a brush and a comb...

930
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,770
to be sure entire width
of every hair is wet.

931
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:05,367
Do not lather."

932
01:36:36,116 --> 01:36:39,518
- Get out of the solar system.
- Gimme it.

933
01:36:39,588 --> 01:36:41,715
- It's getting late, guys.
- Gimme it.

934
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:43,759
- Give it back to me.
- Give it.

935
01:36:43,826 --> 01:36:46,819
- Stop it.
- I'm gonna be in the bathtub.

936
01:36:46,897 --> 01:36:49,058
Could you answer the phone...

937
01:36:49,634 --> 01:36:52,159
Could you answer the phone
for me, please?

938
01:36:52,237 --> 01:36:54,263
And can you
tuck yourselves in, please?

939
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,430
Yes, we will.

940
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:58,944
Thank you.
Good night, sweetheart.

941
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:00,776
- See what you get?
- Good night.

942
01:37:14,598 --> 01:37:17,534
- Good night, Robbie.
- Good night, Carol Anne.

943
01:40:13,259 --> 01:40:14,692
You're not real!

944
01:40:19,099 --> 01:40:20,590
Oh! Help!

945
01:40:20,668 --> 01:40:23,035
Help me!

946
01:40:36,255 --> 01:40:39,987
You're not real!

947
01:40:41,294 --> 01:40:44,025
Let me go!

948
01:40:48,971 --> 01:40:50,836
I hate you!

949
01:40:50,907 --> 01:40:52,671
You're done! I hate you!

950
01:40:52,743 --> 01:40:54,472
I hate you!

951
01:40:54,545 --> 01:40:56,480
I hate you!

952
01:41:00,986 --> 01:41:02,920
Carol Anne, Robbie, run!

953
01:41:37,766 --> 01:41:40,200
Open the door!

954
01:41:40,269 --> 01:41:42,204
Carol Anne, Robbie, run!

955
01:41:43,907 --> 01:41:46,968
Don't touch my babies!

956
01:41:58,525 --> 01:42:01,757
You...
Help me, somebody!

957
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,904
No more.

958
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:21,483
Mr. Tuthill!

959
01:42:21,555 --> 01:42:26,152
Ben! Help!
Please help me!

960
01:42:26,228 --> 01:42:29,198
Somebody help me! Please!

961
01:43:59,613 --> 01:44:03,106
Listen!
What sort of sound is that?

962
01:44:03,184 --> 01:44:04,880
I've got to get them!
Come on!

963
01:44:04,953 --> 01:44:08,253
- What's going on?
- Don't go!

964
01:44:08,324 --> 01:44:11,122
- Please, Ben! Help me!
- No, don't go!

965
01:44:11,194 --> 01:44:13,163
Help me!

966
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:18,997
Get away from my babies!
Get away!

967
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:42,997
Help!

968
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:07,699
Give me your hand!

969
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:13,238
Give me your hand!

970
01:45:17,211 --> 01:45:19,043
I can't reach you!

971
01:45:27,091 --> 01:45:30,255
- Now grab your sister!
- Take my hand!

972
01:45:30,328 --> 01:45:31,659
Come on!

973
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,596
Hold on!

974
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:40,232
God, help me!

975
01:46:17,655 --> 01:46:19,145
Help us!

976
01:46:40,985 --> 01:46:45,013
You moved the cemetery,
but you left the bodies, didn't you?

977
01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:49,425
You son of a bitch! You left the bodies
and you only moved the headstones!

978
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:51,691
You only moved the headstones!

979
01:46:51,765 --> 01:46:54,633
Why?

980
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:15,250
Hurry, Dad, hurry!

981
01:47:16,563 --> 01:47:18,656
- Dad, hurry!
- Come on.

982
01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:20,826
Hurry.

983
01:47:25,408 --> 01:47:29,311
- Hurry, Dad!
- Come on. Damn it, Steven, hurry!

984
01:47:45,299 --> 01:47:47,598
What's happening?

985
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:49,831
What's happening?

986
01:47:49,906 --> 01:47:51,737
What's happening?

987
01:47:52,442 --> 01:47:54,536
- Get in the car!
- What is it?

988
01:47:54,611 --> 01:47:56,842
Drive away! Daddy, drive away!

989
01:47:59,584 --> 01:48:01,109
Steven, hurry!

990
01:48:02,455 --> 01:48:04,219
The house is coming!

991
01:48:05,592 --> 01:48:07,754
- Faster!
- Don't look back!

992
01:48:08,305 --> 01:49:08,793

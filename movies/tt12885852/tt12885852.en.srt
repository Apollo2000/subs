A good student,

And then, Rip.

177
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:00,414
A decorated war hero,

178
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,082
now looking for peace.

179
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,717
He's very dedicated.

180
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:10,357
Also, he makes
an excellent bowl of chili.

181

You said six.

Oh, yes. [chuckles] Yes.

- That. The door.

197

This road is not an easy one.

198
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:17,391
It often leads to ruin
for those unfit to walk it.

199

You can still leave.

200

No, Sensei. I can't.

201

Always to the point.

You might be surprised.

205

Someone has The Gate.

206
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:51,492
So, you came here?

[Richard]
That's too bad.

218

You and I both know the skills we've
acquired don't fade that easily.

219

Besides, aren't you

Why the hell do you need me?

My employers

Use it to their benefit.

224
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:37,571
I can't do this alone.
I need someone I can trust.

225
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,506
Someone to see it through
to the end.

226
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:41,175
And you, Bruce,

227
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:43,844

driven man I've ever known.

Whatever this is,

00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:23,784
it's not as important
as The Gate.

239

All right. Let's hear it.

Terrorist group
got their hands on The Gate.

A week later,
the terrorists were all dead.

But, it is just a thing.

Physical in nature.

But, you...

you are much more
than the physical.

Everyday, you will
hit the stone.

It will hurt,
but pain strengthens us.

It will burn,

Now, you want to stop that

But, evil is as eternal
as this rock.

Even if you break the rock,

- <i>Good.</i>

337
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:37,485
<i>And, Schlangenfaust...</i>

338
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:41,154
<i>make sure the Axe Gang
knows my displeasure.</i>

339
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:42,857
It's already taken care of.

340
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:44,157
[straining]

341
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:00,374
[hesitatingly] So, uh,
what was that back there?

342
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:03,544
They've obviously been sent
to stop you from interfering.

343
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:04,779
Not that.

344
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:07,214
The mask. The costume?

345
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:10,116
Well?

346
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:12,553
It's a way
to keep my lives separate.

347
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:14,322
Safe.

348
00:27:15,256 --> 00:27:16,791
It's more than that, Bruce.

349
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:18,158
Those guys were scared shi--

350
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:20,328
Let's concentrate on
the task at hand.

351
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:23,196
We need to get to the sword
before anyone else does.

352
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:26,166
So... we need Shiva.

353
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:29,236
We need Shiva.

354
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,653
[O-Sensei] This...
is Soul Breaker,

355
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,089
one of two swords
made centuries ago

356
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:52,527
by the master swordsmith,
Muramasa.

357
00:27:52,593 --> 00:27:56,129
The metal has been folded
too many times to count,

358
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:59,567
making it as flexible as a reed

359
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,168
and as strong as stone.

360
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:10,344
It is said, the blade
was made with dark magic,

361
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:12,413
making it more than a sword.

362
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,216
It is a key to life and death.

363
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:21,289
So, it must be guarded
by one... who chooses life.

364
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:27,728
Shiva. Come forward.

365
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:37,170
Because of your focus,

366
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,540
strength, and integrity,

367
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,409
I bestow upon you

368
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:44,946
the responsibility
of safe-guarding this blade,

369
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:46,514
Soul Breaker.

370
00:28:53,754 --> 00:28:55,155
[scoffs]

371
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:58,459
Jade, is there something
you'd like to say?

372
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:02,630
No, O-Sensei.

373
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:06,701
Please. We are family here.

374
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,302
There are no secrets.

375
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:11,405
What troubles you?

376
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:14,742
Shiva is, as you say,
a woman of integrity.

377
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,078
But, she is soft.

378
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:19,280
She lacks the killer instinct.

379
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:20,781
She doesn't deserve the sword.

380
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,952
Oh? And who does?

381
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,988
Anyone else. Rip, maybe?

382
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:29,824
He's been here longer than any of
us, besides Richard.

383
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:32,225
And you feel that tenure

384
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:34,829
is more important
than my judgement?

385
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:39,400
Very well.

386
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:45,473
Rip Jagger, stand.

387
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:51,412
Would you like to be
the caretaker of the blade?

388
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,015
Yes, O-Sensei.

389
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:56,484
Then, defeat Shiva,

390
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,887
and the responsibility
will be yours.

391
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:03,324
Yes, O-Sensei.

392
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:12,333
Oh, Shiva, one more thing.

393
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,169
You may use only
one finger in defense.

394
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:17,638
Say, what?

395
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,474
Yes, O-Sensei.

396
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:30,985

Shiva isn't
the woman you remember.

She's changed.

Yeah. So it would seem.

[Bruce] She's the head of organized
crime in Gotham's Chinatown.

Known for
her ruthlessness and temper.

mask and tried to stop her yet?

00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,153
It takes a lot
to look this good.

505
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:36,123
Oh, no, you didn't.

506
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:38,426
There better be some rice left
in that bowl, chump,

507
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:40,994
or you and I
are gonna have to talk.

508
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:43,130
Sorry, I got the last of it.

509
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:44,798
I'd be happy to share.

[bowl clangs]

I don't need
your charity, fool!

512
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:52,906
What I need is for you
to know your place.

513
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,276
And where's that?

514
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:56,444
Behind me.

515
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:58,780
You think we're supposed
to give you a break

516
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:02,249
- because Mommy and Daddy got killed in front of you?

No, they need this.

Plus, my TV is on the fritz.

You know what's strange?

- I can't do it.

00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:29,162
I'm not strong enough.

560

Who says?

561
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,303
- No one. I just--
- That's right.

562
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,271
No one.

563
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,575
When I was a kid,

564
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:43,109
I didn't think I was
strong enough either.

565
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:45,279
I thought,
if I trained hard enough,

566
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:47,448
acted tough,

567
00:43:47,515 --> 00:43:49,317
that was gonna be all it took.

568
00:43:50,016 --> 00:43:52,420
But it's not.

569
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:57,157
Martial arts is not about
mastering a punch, or a kick.

570
00:43:57,224 --> 00:43:59,427
It's about mastering
what's in here,

571
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:01,295
and here.

572
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:04,465
So that when things are hard,

573
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:07,301
when you don't know
if you're strong enough,

574
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:10,237
you can reach inside
and remember the truth.

575
00:44:10,771 --> 00:44:12,072
What's that?

576
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:13,641
The only thing stopping you...

577
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:15,443
is you.

582
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:38,766
that you're not here to enroll?

583
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:41,302
They found The Gate.

584
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:42,637
And they have the sword.

585
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:44,605
They?

586
00:44:53,848 --> 00:44:54,815

[Jade] I don't know

589
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:04,525
why he can't ever
just give me a straight answer?

590
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:07,862
He always has to be so cryptic
and mysterious.

[Richard] Come on, you should
be used to it by now.

00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:16,102
he hides his most secret
techniques behind that door.

[Shiva] Or riches.

Ancient jewels and gold,
hoarded over time.

00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:23,511
I bet it's something powerful.

597
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:25,379
Something he's too
afraid to use.

[Ben] You're all wrong.

599
00:45:31,786 --> 00:45:33,621
It's probably a Whirlpool.

Got any ideas?

Yeah, it's obvious.

Really? Do tell.

606
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:50,504
It's a distraction.

Good night.

608
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,881
[Ben] I'm still betting
on that Whirlpool.

What have you done?

619
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:52,366
[Rip] What you have been
too afraid to do, old man.

620
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:55,235
Why do you think I came here
so many years ago?

621
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:56,570
For your teaching?

622
00:46:57,405 --> 00:46:59,106
I came for The Gate.

623
00:46:59,172 --> 00:47:00,808
The Gate?
What's he talking about?

624
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,779
What O-Sensei
is too afraid to tell you,

625
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:07,782
is that there is a god
on the other side of this Gate.

626
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:09,784
One that will make
the world right again.

627
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:12,420
He calls to me.

628
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,355
And I...

629
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:17,658
I will be the vessel
of his divine power.

630
00:47:17,725 --> 00:47:20,193
There is no god
on the other side, Rip.

631
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:21,595
Only a demon.

632
00:47:22,195 --> 00:47:23,631
You have to stop.

633
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,033
Stop before
it's too late, my son.

634
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,768
It's already too late.

635
00:47:27,835 --> 00:47:30,705
The Gate requires
a sacrifice to open,

636
00:47:30,771 --> 00:47:31,906
a soul.

637
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:33,407
And the sword...

638
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:36,242
is the conduit, the key.

639
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,779
Stop! Stop, you fool.

There is a vertical cave that
drops a few hundred feet down.

Good... Good.

Your master
has taught you well.

1013
01:10:40,428 --> 01:10:42,363
But it won't be enough.

- Bruce.
- [Shiva groans]

1026
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,612
O-Sensei has shown me

1027
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:33,180
you are the least skilled
of them all,

1028
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,816
though he admires
your determination. [chuckles]

1029
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:38,286
Your private battle
to save Gotham.

1030
01:11:38,353 --> 01:11:41,589
Uh, but... the truth is,

1031
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:43,924
you are just a sad little boy

1032
01:11:43,991 --> 01:11:47,194
trying to quiet
the ghosts of the past.

1033
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,130
You should have heeded
your master's words.

1034
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:53,167
Evil is eternal.

1035
01:11:54,735 --> 01:11:57,104
I'm coming for your world.

1036
01:11:57,171 --> 01:12:00,174
And you are powerless
to stop me.

- [beeping]

What do you have
that your comrades don't?

1043
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:22,062
[Batman] A cape.

You don't deserve
to look like him.

01:13:06,773 --> 01:13:08,476
- Don't worry.
- [choking]

1054
01:13:08,543 --> 01:13:10,645
This form is just temporary.

1055
01:13:10,712 --> 01:13:15,483
I can only exist in your world
with a proper shell.

1056
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,319
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1057
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:22,155
That to stay in this world,
I need an avatar.

[groans, gasps]

1059
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:29,196
Someone strong enough
to hold my spirit.

1060
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:33,468
Your O-Sensei was a clever one.

1061
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,937
Hiding him in plain sight.

1062
01:13:37,004 --> 01:13:40,107
A young boy,
trained in the ways of war.

1063
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:44,177
His true destiny
hidden from him.

1064
01:13:44,244 --> 01:13:46,681
The one who can
hold the great serpent.

1065
01:13:46,748 --> 01:13:48,849
The one they call... Dragon.

1066
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,153
And here you are...

1067
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,290
right in front of me.

1068
01:13:56,923 --> 01:13:58,925
It is your destiny.

1069
01:13:58,992 --> 01:14:02,497
I can give you power
beyond your imagining.

1070
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,197
Purpose.

1071
01:14:04,265 --> 01:14:07,067
Isn't that what
you always desired?

1072
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:11,472
[Richard] No.

1073
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:16,744
You have such power
in you, Richard.

1074

[groaning]

1075
01:14:20,348 --> 01:14:21,716
O-Sensei knew it.

1076
01:14:21,783 --> 01:14:24,951
You are the only one strong
enough to contain my spirit.

[pants]

1080

If I'm the only one
strong enough to hold you,

1081
01:14:36,364 --> 01:14:39,132
then I'm the only one
strong enough to defeat you.

1082
01:14:48,643 --> 01:14:49,943
[grunting]

1083
01:14:52,245 --> 01:14:55,148
Heh! You cannot defeat me.

1084
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:59,454
Yeah, I think I can.

1085
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,759
This is my destiny.

1086
01:15:04,826 --> 01:15:06,794
To be the best fighter
there is.

1087
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,161
And no one...

1088
01:15:08,228 --> 01:15:10,665
Not even some
second-rate demon god

1089
01:15:10,732 --> 01:15:12,400
is going to stop that.

[O-Sensei] You can't

You are more than I...

I could ever hope for.

1116

No.

1124
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,060
We have to close The Gate.

Yeah. About that.

1126
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:32,900
It needs a sacrifice to close,
and well...

I have a lot to atone for.

No, I should go.

It is the honorable thing
to do.

We're in this together, Bruce.

Just like we've always been.

Like we're supposed to be.

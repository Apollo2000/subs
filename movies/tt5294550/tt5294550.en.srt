00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,687
<i>Ciao, bella!</i>

3
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,374
Come here.

4
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,128
Skinny.

5
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,248
We can cook for you. Pasta.

6
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,124
Mmm?

7
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,344
We'd look after you.

8
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,390
You should give me a discount,
on account of my age.

9
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,570
What's your name?

10
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,073
Paolo.

11
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,621
The street is no place
for a boy like you.

12
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,128
Don't make your
poor mama worry.

13
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,507
Go home.

14
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,916
I can take
care of myself.

15
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,004
<i>Ciao.</i>

16
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,477
<i>Sì.</i>

17
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,858
Get off!

18
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,089
Hey, get the fuck off me!

19
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,478
Hey! Hey!

20
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,163
Mr. Getty.

21
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,252
Mr. Getty.

22
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,255
Sorry, I should
have knocked before coming in.

23
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,715
To the point, Nancy.
The market's open.

24
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,336
He's been
kidnapped. Paul.

25
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,508
Little Paul,
your grandson, in Rome.

26
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,473
They need to speak
with you right now.

27
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,260
The Italian police, the boy's
mother, they're on the phone.

28
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,098
Well, I'm not available.

29
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,646
Excuse me, Mr. Getty?

30
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,016
The door, Nancy.

31
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,651
<i>To be a Getty
is an extraordinary thing.</i>

32
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,615
<i>I know that because
my grandpa told me so.</i>

33
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,088
What do you want?

34
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,717
<i>You see, my grandpa wash't just
the richest man in the world.</i>

35
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,509
<i>He was the richest man
in the history of the world.</i>

36
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,294
Welcome.

37
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,355
<i>My grandpa
was the one who brought the oil</i>

38
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,769
<i>out of the Saudi desert.</i>

39
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,688
<i>Everybody knew it was there.</i>

40
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,811
<i>They just thought
it couldn't be done.</i>

41
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,067
<i>But Grandpa found a way.</i>

42
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,196
<i>He made a deal
with the Bedouin tribes.</i>

43
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,901
<i>But there was so much oil,</i>

44
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,325
<i>there was no ship
big enough to carry it all.</i>

45
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,165
<i>So, my grandfather
invented one.</i>

46
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,788
<i>He called it
"The supertanker."</i>

47
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,509
It's been reported
that you are the first man in history

48
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,061
with a fortune in excess
of a billion dollars.

49
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,730
I have no idea.

50
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,267
But if you can count
your money, you're not a billionaire.

51
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,817
Yeah.

52
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,072
<i>I'm telling you
this so you can understand</i>

53
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,660
<i>the things
you're about to see.</i>

54
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,704
<i>And maybe you
can forgive us.</i>

55
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,575
<i>It's like we're
from another planet,</i>

56
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,831
<i>where the force
of gravity is so strong</i>

57
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,249
<i>it bends the light.</i>

58
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,713
<i>We look like you.</i>

59
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,129
<i>But we're not like you.</i>

60
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,881
<i>But we were, once.</i>

61
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,633
Okay. Okay.

62
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,141
Okay?

63
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,863
Make yourself comfortable, huh?

64
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,984
Okay, now you can
take the bag off.

65
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,481
The bag?

66
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,465
Hey.

67
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,306
We'll make friends.

68
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,941
I'll tell you
things about me,

69
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,148
and you tell me
things about you.

70
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,236
I don't want to know
anything about you.

71
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,193
Smart boy.

72
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,449
We talk about you, then.

73
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,626
Yes? <i>Si?</i>

74
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
<i>Signora,</i>

75
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,176
we have your son.

76
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,472
God.

77
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,723
Thank you.

78
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,511
Is he all right?

79
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,843
<i>No, signora,</i>

80
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,398
we are <i>rapitori,</i>
kidnappers,

81
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,815
and have him captive.

82
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,241
Is this some kind of joke?

83
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,613
<i>No, no.
Is no joke,</i> signora.

84
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,699
<i>He's okay. He's not harmed.</i>

85
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,156
<i>We will send proof
in the coming days.</i>

86
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,456
Who are you?

87
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,166
I am...

88
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,872
Cinquanta.

89
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,087
Paul is safe.

90
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,422
But it will require

91
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,339
<i>$17 million to release him.</i>

92
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,595
<i>Go to the police if you like.</i>

93
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,097
<i>It makes no difference.</i>

94
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,019
I don't have any money.

95
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,139
<i>Get it
from your father-in-law.</i>

96
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,186
<i>He has all the money
in the world.</i>

97
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,782
Okay.

98
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,277
One, two, three.

99
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,157
- Mom!
- Dad! Mom!

100
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,290
Mom, Dad!

101
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,374
- Wake up!
- No. Stop.

102
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,769
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on, Mom!

103
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,793
- Too early.
- Let's go!

104
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,878
We want pancakes.

105
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,460
Back to bed, you little
monsters.

106
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,670
Get out of bed!

107
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,330
Okay.

108
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,795
- Aileen, you want juice?
- What?

109
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,346
There.

110
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,223
Okay. I have work
to do this morning.

111
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,440
You'll have to amuse
yourselves quietly.

112
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,318
And then we're going
Christmas shopping.

113
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,756
- Mark, stop playing with it.
- Love you.

114
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,300
- Yup.
- If it's too hot, just blow on it.

115
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,780
Here you go.

116
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,441
Morning, Dad!

117
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,118
Hair of the dog
might help.

118
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,121
"Hair of the dog"?

119
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,541
What's that, Dad?

120
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,578
Hey, Mom,
where to next?

121
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,920
Dad's Christmas present.

122
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,925
Macy's.

123
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,545
Scarf, hat, hair tonic.

124
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,259
Must
be 80 stories at least.

125
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,175
How many stories is it, Mom?

126
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,593
I don't know, darling.

127
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,011
It's an awful lot of stories.

128
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,229
Whose is it?

129
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,387
Your grandfather's.

130
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,231
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. No!

131
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Yes!

132
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,895
- We're still gonna beat you.
- But he's your dad.

133
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,529
I've hardly ever
met the guy.

134
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,903
How is that possible?

135
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,904
- As a kid, at least.
- My father had

136
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,448
no interest in me
whatsoever.

137
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,867
No visits at Christmas,
no birthday phone calls.

138
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,699
Why don't you write
him a letter?

139
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,213
Tell him you've been
looking for a job.

140
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,967
I don't want to be
an oilman. What?

141
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,049
Well, I don't want you
to be one, either, but...

142
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,138
You were never gonna be poor,
Gail, I know that.

143
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,138
We're not poor. We're broke.
There's a difference.

144
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,689
<i>"Dear Dad."</i>

145
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,068
- "Father."
- "Father."

146
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,273
"Dear Father."

147
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,693
"For years,
I struggled to understand

148
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,278
"why you kept your distance.

149
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,613
"Now I realize that
you were giving me

150
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,239
"the chance
to prove myself,

151
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,295
"away from the shadow
of your immense achievements."

152
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,130
Is this how
rich people talk?

153
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,790
Yes, like in Henry James.

154
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,337
Fine, do it your way.

155
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,343
But be sincere.

156
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,132
You don't want that.

157
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,675
Hey, turn off the television.
It's time for dinner.

158
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,597
Come on.

159
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,723
Come on!

160
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,465
- Hi, darling.
- Go back through there.

161
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,843
Your mom and I will carry
it through when it's ready, all right?

162
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,052
- Go take a seat.
- Go sit down.

163
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,716
- It's almost ready.
- Go take your seats.

164
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,416
God, your hands are cold.

165
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,203
Stop.

166
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,330
I'm serious.
The kids are...

167
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,547
Oh, shit.

168
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,628
That'll be
Ms. Canzanelli again,

169
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,165
telling us she's
calling the police.

170
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,010
Who sends
telegrams anymore?

171
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,481
Oh, my God.
Somebody died.

172
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,064
No, baby.
We've been sent for.

173
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,614
Let's go,
let's go. Come on.

174
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,870
Dad, is that
just for us?

175
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,133
Look at that.

176
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,927
Mom, wake up.

177
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,512
Mom, look at that.

178
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,678
Dad, wake up.
It's the Colosseum!

179
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,224
Mom!

180
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,093
Mom, it's the Colosseum.

181
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,392
- Dad.
- Dad?

182
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,310
- Please wake up.
- All right, all right.

183
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,535
Thank you, sir.

184
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,450
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

185
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,957
Welcome.

186
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,736
- Come, darling. It's okay.
- Aileen, this is amazing.

187
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,296
Mama loves you.
It's okay.

188
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,295
It's a lot bigger
than our house.

189
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,512
Wow.

190
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,880
- Mr. Getty.
- Oh, darling.

191
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,594
Mr. Getty, your
visitors are here.

192
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,433
Could you take
the young ones?

193
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,158
Darling. Don't touch that.
Don't touch that.

194
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,471
Please, please.
It's very old.

195
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,439
It's possibly priceless.
Put it down.

196
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,935
"Priceless"?
I deplore that word.

197
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,315
Sorry?

198
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,237
"Dirty and old"
I have no problem with.

199
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,956
In fact, I have
an affection for them,

200
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,204
as they are the words
most frequently used to describe me.

201
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,169
Along with "rich,"
of course.

202
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,712
But "priceless,"
that's something else altogether, yeah.

203
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,423
People say "priceless"
when what they really mean

204
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,800
is that something
is invaluable.

205
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,805
That Minotaur that
you're holding, for instance.

206
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,021
Some experts have told me
that this dates

207
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,604
from 460 BC.

208
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,024
I'm sure those
fuckers at the Met

209
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,842
- would kill to get
- Mom, he just said...

210
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,535
their greasy paws on it.

211
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,741
Go, go.

212
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,367
Would you care to guess
how much I paid for it'?

213
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,083
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

214
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,041
$11.23.

215
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,461
I picked it up
at the black market in Heraklion.

216
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,307
Some old cripple
wanted to ask $19 for it.

217
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,770
It took me one hour to bring
him down to his bottom line.

218
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,057
Yes, today, at auction,

219
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,608
I hazard it could
bring $1.2 million.

220
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,280
You see?

221
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,614
Everything has a price.

222
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,909
The great struggle in life

223
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,623
is coming to grips
with what that price is.

224
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,036
I want you to have it.

225
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,502
We couldn't.

226
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,871
You like it, Paul?

227
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,417
That's okay.
I don't need it.

228
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,840
No, I insist.

229
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,095
It's far too extravagant
for a little boy.

230
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,966
Well, for some little
boys, it might be.

231
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,308
Not for a Getty.

232
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,231
"Thank you."

233
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,022
Thank you.

234
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,815
Thanks are for strangers.

235
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,565
You're family.
My family.

236
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,951
Come on.

237
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,070
Come here, come here.

238
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,579
Let me look at you.

239
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,155
Son.

240
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,866
My son.

241
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,454
My grandson.
My daughter.

242
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,046
Well, daughter-in-law,
I'm afraid.

243
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,252
No, you're not some district
judge's daughter anymore.

244
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,502
You're one of us now.

245
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,889
I had to focus
on my mission, you understand?

246
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,932
On my business. And...

247
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,062
I couldn't be weighed down
mentally with a family.

248
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,985
You understand that,
don't you, Paul?

249
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,362
Pardon the laundry.

250
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,407
I just see no
point in paying $10

251
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,407
for room service to come up
and launder my undershorts

252
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,377
when I could do the same thing
for just a few lira.

253
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,792
And it's tax-deductible.

254
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,541
Almost everything is
if you know how to play it.

255
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,472
What the hell are we doing
standing in a hotel room?

256
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,349
We should
be celebrating.

257
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,344
That's what families do.

258
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,595
Right?

259
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,889
"Dear Mr. Getty,

260
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,768
"I'm writing to you because
we're in desperate straits.

261
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,442
"My husband suffers
from a tumor that has caused

262
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,363
"his groin area to swell
to uncontrollable dimensions.

263
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,406
"The doctors say,
without immediate surgery,

264
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,863
"normal movement
will soon become impossible.

265
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,370
"God bless you.
You are a great American.

266
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,789
"Elvira Broadus, Mound City,
Arkansas."

267
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,541
Dear Mrs. Broadus,

268
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,922
if I were to respond

269
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,053
to every request
for money I receive,

270
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:47,183
I would soon be
as destitute as yourself.

271
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,392
Now...

272
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,188
Next.

273
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,401
"Dear Mr. Getty..."

274
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,646
Surely you can find someone
else to answer your mail.

275
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,148
- I like it, Dad.
- He likes it, son.

276
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,900
The boy wants
to be useful.

277
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,072
I find that admirable.

278
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,328
It's a family business.

279
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,452
Everyone has a role to play.

280
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,122
Which reminds me,
I'm firing Howard Larkin.

281
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,336
And I'm making you executive
vice president of Getty Oil

282
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,835
in charge of European
operations.

283
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,426
What?

284
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,471
All I know about oil
is regular or premium.

285
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,094
You wanted a job.
I'm giving it to you.

286
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,683
Sink or swim.

287
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,941
Yours, J.P. Getty.

288
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,527
Next.

289
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,578
You're a Getty, Paul.

290
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,577
A Getty is special.

291
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,372
A Getty is nobody's fool.

292
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,791
I want to show
you something.

293
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,965
What is it?

294
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,967
It's home.

295
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,507
This is where I slept
with my wife, Sabina.

296
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,134
This is where I ate roast
wild boar with my generals.

297
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,098
And this is where
I made love to my concubines.

298
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,226
You used
to live here?

299
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,601
Yes, in the second century,

300
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,737
when I
was the Emperor Hadrian.

301
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:33,490
I knew it the very
first moment I visited this place.

302
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,084
I remember every stone

303
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:41,047
as clearly as if I'd
just come from the store

304
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,295
with a packet of smokes.

305
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,008
I have never felt at home
anywhere on Earth

306
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,131
till I came here.

307
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,887
Well, maybe
they'd let you stay.

308
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,886
Overnight, like.
Get a tent.

309
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,854
Sleeping bag.

310
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,143
I've tried.

311
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,567
I've tried, believe me.

312
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,733
I made them an offer,
a very generous offer.

313
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,272
"Them"?

314
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,407
Them. The Romans.

315
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,694
But then they hear
the name Getty,

316
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,573
and they all get dollar signs
in their eyes, you know.

317
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,085
Yeah, they said
it wasn't for sale.

318
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,087
- Figures.
- Exactly.

319
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,872
That old tactic.

320
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,713
That's what I'm
talking about, Paul.

321
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,138
The blood of emperors
runs through you

322
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,515
as it does through me.

323
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,431
You're a Getty, Paul.

324
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,899
You have a destiny.

325
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,816
<i>My grandfather
wanted our family to become a dynasty.</i>

326
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,902
<i>But Dad could never
control his drinking.</i>

327
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,613
<i>And the first time
he tried drugs at a party,</i>

328
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,110
<i>he was lost.</i>

329
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,231
Dad?

330
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,624
Dad?

331
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,592
Dad?

332
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,243
Mrs. Getty, they're
ready for you now.

333
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,514
Of course,
we expect Ms. Getty

334
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,930
will be seeking a generous
financial settlement,

335
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,145
as is typical
in high-profile divorce cases.

336
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,232
And there's
the custody of the children.

337
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,103
The father is a drug addict
who cannot tie his own shoes.

338
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,032
You would leave the boy
alone in Morocco with a rich degenerate?

339
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,324
The court will take a close interest
in her fitness as a mother.

340
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,787
Ms. Harris suffers

341
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,413
from a common affliction
among the intelligent women,

342
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,705
which is fall in love
with <i>imbroglioni.</i>

343
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,422
Losers.

344
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:11,882
Bums.

345
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,677
Aside from this,
she's an excellent mother.

346
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,967
You know this
as well as I do.

347
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,430
You are simply stalling,
using the children as a bargaining chip.

348
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,930
We have all
the time in the world.

349
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,224
A deal.

350
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,318
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

351
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,570
The offer I'm about to make
expires at the end

352
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,099
- of business today.
- Gail, please.

353
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
- What is your offer, Ms. Harris?
- Nothing.

354
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,162
You pay nothing.

355
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,871
No alimony,
no settlement,

356
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,081
no community
property, nothing.

357
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,534
I don't want any
money for myself,

358
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,126
just child support
for the kids.

359
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,586
I don't get it.

360
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,423
And I want my son on a plane
back from Morocco to me,

361
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,258
tonight, and full custody.

362
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,048
- What's your game?
- I don't want your money.

363
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,467
Everybody wants my money.

364
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,473
You want your money,
I want Paul.

365
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,762
We can both have
what we want.

366
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,805
I sense I'm being taken.

367
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,679
I... I just don't know how.

368
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,765
Can't help yourself.

369
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,983
You didn't get
where you are

370
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,398
without a healthy regard
for the value of a dollar.

371
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,941
You know a bargain
when you see one.

372
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,391
You know how
to seize the initiative

373
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,933
when your opponent
is at his weakest.

374
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,529
What I'm offering you
is the greatest bargain you'll ever get.

375
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,071
But free never lasts.

376
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,791
6:00. Come.

377
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,484
I wanted to stay.

378
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,731
Let's just go
home, okay?

379
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,068
I was happy
with Dad and Talitha.

380
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,449
Why'd you
have to ruin it?

381
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,756
Mr. Getty.

382
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,094
They're here.

383
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,641
I'm sorry, Ms. Getty,
Mr. Getty is unavailable at the moment.

384
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,608
Tell him it's regarding
his grandson's kidnapping in Rome.

385
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,735
I'll wait.

386
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,273
Gail, look at this.

387
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,613
<i>Mr. Getty,
we've received reports</i>

388
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,083
<i>that a note has arrived
written in your grandson's handwriting</i>

389
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,077
<i>demanding 17 million
US dollars.</i>

390
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,669
<i>$17 million?</i>

391
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,006
<i>That's an awful lot of money
for such a young boy.</i>

392
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,802
<i>Mr. Getty, what steps will you be
taking to secure your grandson's safety?</i>

393
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,262
<i>None.</i>

394
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,553
<i>I'm afraid we
didn't get that, sir.</i>

395
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,884
<i>I have
14 grandchildren.</i>

396
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,103
If I start paying ransoms,

397
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,598
I'll have 14 kidnapped
grandchildren.

398
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,102
Yeah, but you're a famously
ruthless negotiator, Mr. Getty.

399
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,103
Yes, but there's
very little in life

400
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,526
worth paying full price for,
don't you think?

401
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,274
How much would you pay
for your grandson,

402
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,866
if not $17 million?

403
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,619
Nothing.

404
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,908
Ms. Getty,
are you still there?

405
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,252
<i>- Ms. Getty...</i>
- Yes, I'm still here.

406
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,305
<i>Would you like me
to give Mr. Getty a message?</i>

407
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,417
Tell him I'm coming.

408
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,138
Mr. Getty.

409
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,732
A message
from Mrs. Getty.

410
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,316
Get me Flatchet Chase.

411
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,408
The younger generation
has become weak and lazy.

412
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,626
Our children care
about nothing

413
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,586
but Lamborghinis
and discotheques.

414
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,170
Well, perhaps,
then, you would

415
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,040
do well to accept our
competitor's offer.

416
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,801
- How so, Mr. Chase?
- Maybe Standard Oil

417
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,795
will find ways to siphon
all that money away

418
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,137
with their accounting tricks

419
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,507
and bring your wayward
children closer to God.

420
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,928
Kidding aside,
Your Highness,

421
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,226
my employer
has made you rich.

422
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,232
Not as rich as him.

423
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,271
If you renew your
land-use agreement with Getty,

424
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,894
he'll make you
twice as rich.

425
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,395
Can Standard Oil say that?

426
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,148
Can Standard Oil say that?

427
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,676
We don't need
the Americans anymore.

428
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:11,386
Our cartel, OPEC,
will control inventory now.

429
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,103
OPEC will set
the oil price.

430
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,314
Let me just
be very clear, okay?

431
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,683
Nothing would
make Mr. Getty

432
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,605
happier than to see
the price of oil higher.

433
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,979
In fact, he'd
be happy to help.

434
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,409
Fletcher!

435
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,245
The old man's
on the phone for you!

436
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,413
Gentlemen, excuse me
for a moment, please.

437
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,226
Shit.

438
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,191
I'm afraid Mr. Getty
is unavailable.

439
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,116
You wouldn't have me
thrown out, would you?

440
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,326
I would never turn you away
from my home, ma'am,

441
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,696
or little Paul,
but this is not my home.

442
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,199
- To the right, ma'am.
- Thank you.

443
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,469
Sir.

444
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,703
This is new.

445
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,417
How much would you say
this painting's worth?

446
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,954
A great deal, I'm sure.

447
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,189
It's awfully
small for a Vermeer.

448
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,713
Vermeers
are small.

449
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,221
You don't say.

450
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,391
I've learned
to appreciate

451
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,182
the finer things
from Mr. Getty.

452
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,600
Not in that league.

453
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,140
If I took it off the wall, do
you think anyone would notice?

454
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,517
An alarm would go off.
Dogs would get to you

455
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,564
before you made
it to the fence.

456
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,396
A face as pretty
as that, I wouldn't.

457
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,283
You seem very
knowledgeable.

458
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,239
About paintings, no.

459
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,949
About other things, some.

460
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,455
Mr. Chace.

461
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,165
He's a tough old goat
to get an audience with.

462
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,376
Apparently not.

463
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,807
Pull.

464
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,973
And pull.

465
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,443
Great shot.

466
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,932
I think I'm getting
better at this.

467
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,096
- Morning, Fletch.
- Morning, Mr. Chace.

468
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,155
Morning.

469
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,574
Help yourself.

470
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,617
- You call.
- Pull.

471
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,537
- Get Mr. Chace a gun.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,342
Morning, sir.

473
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,461
Morning.

474
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Pull.

475
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,184
I need to phone my
attorney to find out

476
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,519
if there's been any contact
from the men who took Paul.

477
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,397
Of course, ma'am.

478
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,193
Mr. Getty had it installed
specially for his guests' convenience,

479
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,187
in case they wanted
to make telephone calls.

480
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,694
I understand,
but Rome is long distance.

481
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,735
I am able
to provide change.

482
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,240
Remind me again, Chace,
your family situation.

483
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,335
Well, I was married
three times.

484
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,417
First one left me
for my brother,

485
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,128
second was a fashion model,

486
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,710
and then the third,
I just finalized.

487
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,426
I always say,
"You never really know anyone

488
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,470
"until you've been
through a divorce."

489
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,266
I wish you would've told
me that three marriages ago.

490
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,750
You know, they say
money can't buy love,

491
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,502
it turns out you just have
to wait till the end

492
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,188
- for the check to come, right?
- Children?

493
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,311
No, I was never
home much.

494
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,233
Yeah, same here.

495
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,195
There was something
my father always used to say,

496
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:44,079
"A man who has children
gives hostages to fortune."

497
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,540
Well, your father
was a wise man.

498
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,286
Yeah. He told me
I would never be worth a damn.

499
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,251
So, I made him
look like a pauper.

500
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,878
You certainly
did that, sir.

501
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,675
I love my grandson,
Chace.

502
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,132
I'm sure you do.

503
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,722
Well, I love all my
grandchildren, of course,

504
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,177
but Paul,

505
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,222
Paul is special.

506
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,978
I don't know what I would do if anything
happened to that boy.

507
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,692
Now, I want you
to go to Rome.

508
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,483
I want you
to bring him back

509
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,327
as quickly
and as inexpensively as possible.

510
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,809
I'm gonna need some kind
of resources to work with

511
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,074
- if you want him back alive.
- Well, of course.

512
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,168
I just didn't want you
giving my money away, see?

513
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,540
Now, you find
the boy, Chace.

514
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,215
And find out
who took him.

515
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,089
Oh, and one more thing.

516
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,965
The boy's mother.

517
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,466
A hostage negotiation
is no business for a woman.

518
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,389
So, you take
care of her,

519
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,104
but keep her
out of the details.

520
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,566
- Understand?
- Yeah, I know how to handle her.

521
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,435
Giovanni,
can you hear me?

522
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,734
Can you hear me?

523
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,575
Giovanni?

524
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,780
Giovanni, have I lost you?

525
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,282
- Shit.
- Ma'am?

526
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,456
I apologize for not
introducing myself earlier.

527
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,545
My name is Fletcher Chace.

528
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,665
I'm gonna help
you find your son.

529
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,969
I'm sure you're very good
at what you do, Mr. Chace.

530
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,138
My former father-in-law
only buys the best.

531
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,261
But I don't need
an ex-secret agent

532
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,278
to solve the mystery
of what happened to my son,

533
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,182
because there
is no mystery.

534
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,562
I need one thing only,
and that is $17 million.

535
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,739
Paying the ransom
doesn't guarantee you get your son back.

536
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,778
Not paying the ransom
nearly guarantees I don't.

537
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,031
Well, I'd say your son's
chances are better than that.

538
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,114
Why don't you
explain the odds to me.

539
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,574
Is it a coin toss?

540
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,082
Heads he lives, tails he dies.
I can see how that's

541
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,672
a chance worth taking when
there's real money at stake.

542
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
All right, let me
rephrase that, please.

543
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,920
$1 billion earns $17 million a month
sitting in a bank vault.

544
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,547
He could buy a Matisse every
day and never spend it all.

545
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,813
I don't think this
is about money for Mr. Getty.

546
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,056
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
this was your first day on the job.

547
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,934
Look, I've had to bargain
with a lot of people.

548
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,602
Sheikhs, sultans.

549
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,688
The one thing I've learned is that money
is never just money.

550
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,461
All right?
It always stands for something.

551
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,592
Usually it stands
for the one thing they've never had.

552
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,198
And until you know
what that thing is,

553
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,246
you're just beating your
head against the bricks.

554
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,407
Look, I don't blame
you, all right?

555
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,904
You came here
for $17 million...

556
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,747
- Nope.
- and instead you got me.

557
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,034
I'm the one who
has the old man's ear,

558
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,501
and I'm offering
to help you.

559
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,879
I'm not leaving here
until I speak to him.

560
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,750
- Face-to-face.
- I'm afraid Mr. Getty

561
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,752
has already
departed the estate.

562
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,213
He's away on business,
and it's uncertain when he will return.

563
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,577
I'm sure
you'll want to be getting

564
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,001
back to Rome
on the next flight out.

565
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,388
I'm headed there myself.

566
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,471
I can offer you
a ride to the airport.

567
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,236
Out of the way, fellas!
Out of the way!

568
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,946
Hey!

569
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,795
- Go ahead.
- My son Paul

570
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,339
must be very frightened
right now.

571
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,549
I know I'm
frightened for him.

572
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,294
So, to the people
who took him,

573
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,181
I don't care
why you did this,

574
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,516
but I ask,
as a mother, that you

575
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,387
think of your own children
or of the child that you once were

576
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,184
and set my boy
free. Thank you.

577
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,514
Your son has disappeared.

578
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,233
A mother should
cry for her son.

579
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,602
All right, enough.
Let the lady through. Let's go! Move!

580
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,677
Ms. Getty,
I am Magistrate Corvo.

581
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,782
I'm the lead investigator.

582
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,152
- Would you please follow us?
- Come with me. Come.

583
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,135
Ms. Getty,
come on, tell us more.

584
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,326
You said you have the money.

585
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,671
You okay?

586
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,790
They want me to cry?

587
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,876
Is that it?

588
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,321
All these letters
are addressed to me.

589
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:35,946
You've been
opening my mail?

590
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,583
Well, this may be your
mail, Ms. Getty, but it is our evidence.

591
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,955
You see, all these letters,
they come from people

592
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,172
who claim to have
kidnapped your son.

593
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,213
They come from all
over the world, too.

594
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,840
Germany, California...

595
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,259
Faster than we
can investigate.

596
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,597
Well, $17 million

597
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,012
sure brings out a crowd.

598
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,039
- You're telling me you have nothing?
- No.

599
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,849
I'm telling you
we have too much.

600
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,018
Too many kidnappers,
too many reporters.

601
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,143
You want some free advice?
Put it in the papers.

602
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,729
When the kidnappers find out
that every lowlife in Rome

603
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,481
is trying to scoop
up their ransom,

604
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,428
they'll have to come out
into the open to claim it.

605
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,692
It's the communists.

606
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,614
It's the Red Brigades,
the Brigate Rosse.

607
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,159
- Possibly.
- To kidnap

608
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,957
the child of the richest
capitalist in the world,

609
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,450
it's a dream come
true for them.

610
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,482
Well, I may be able
to initiate some back channels

611
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,463
- with the Red Brigades.
- Back channels?

612
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,507
Mr. Chace,
these are terrorists.

613
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,089
You're not gonna find them
listed in a telephone book.

614
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,258
I still have some
contacts in those areas.

615
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,345
I advise you
to leave this to us.

616
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,222
For your own safety.

617
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,678
And you, Ms. Getty,
they will take you, too,

618
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,814
if they get a chance.

619
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,023
Which is why I put you
under police protection.

620
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,059
You will find my
officers in your home.

621
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,560
I don't need anyone's
protection.

622
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,905
I'm not a real Getty.
I never was.

623
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,910
I'm an ordinary person.

624
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,450
No. You're not
a person anymore.

625
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,747
You're a symbol.

626
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,575
I will see you
at your apartment.

627
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,988
- Madam.
- Marina.

628
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,332
<i>- Carabinieri</i> are in the kitchen.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

629
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,936
Is there anywhere else you can put that
so we can have a place to cook?

630
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,597
Your child
is kidnapped.

631
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,047
How can you
think about eating?

632
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,514
Hi there.

633
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,893
Hi.

634
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,060
- Darling. Come.
- I can't sleep.

635
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,354
All these strange
men in your house.

636
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,980
Can I sleep
in your bed?

637
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,190
Of course you can.

638
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:32,046
Have you found anything,
Secret Agent man?

639
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,587
Did Paul do any drugs?

640
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,467
Hashish?

641
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,800
He's a teenage boy.

642
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,549
He has teenage boy problems.

643
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,427
Makes teenage
boy mistakes.

644
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,844
I'm just trying to find it
before that guy out there does.

645
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,822
He'd gotten into trouble
at school, am I right?

646
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,025
A boy needs a father,

647
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,734
and his was strung out
in Marrakech with Mick Jagger.

648
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,233
It was all I could do to
get him to come home at night.

649
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,413
I better keep this.

650
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,380
You carry a gun,
Mr. Chace?

651
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,294
You said you
used to be a spy.

652
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,214
Well, it's not howl put it
on my tax returns, but, yeah.

653
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,053
Spies carry guns.

654
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,881
I never bothered.

655
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,428
Ruins the line
of your suit.

656
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,976
And guns are for people
who don't have money.

657
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,346
All that spooky
paperback stuff,

658
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,723
chasing around, blowing
poison darts at the KGB

659
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,567
In the Arab Quarter, it's not
what I did for a living.

660
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:36,690
What do you do?

661
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,777
I made deals.
I bought people.

662
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,370
Keep it.

663
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,321
Forgive me, Ms. Getty.

664
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,911
Just one last question

665
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,826
regarding your
testimony earlier.

666
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,457
Why did you think
the kidnapping was a joke?

667
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,298
It's a figure of speech.

668
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,839
The whole situation

669
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,461
was unbelievable.
It still is.

670
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,636
Well, tragic,
yes, but not unbelievable.

671
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,174
It's not tragic yet.

672
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,806
Maybe you ought to work
on keeping it that way.

673
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,064
Okay, write another letter
to your mother

674
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,649
and tell her,
if she doesn't pay,

675
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,860
we'll mail her
your finger.

676
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,200
Why doesn't your
family love you?

677
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,452
I think they love me.

678
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,708
I hope so.

679
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,117
What's wrong with you?

680
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,340
Are you a bad boy? Hmm?

681
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,003
- You a bad boy?
- No.

682
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,217
You're a bad boy.

683
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,931
Don't lie.

684
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,017
What did you do?

685
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,347
I set fire to my school once
and got kicked out.

686
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,437
Well,

687
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,152
boys play with fire.

688
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,651
I did.

689
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,368
You want to try it?

690
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,536
If my son
was kidnapped,

691
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,326
bad, good,

692
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,997
I would pay any
money to get him back.

693
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,879
I would borrow it. Steal.

694
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:25,299
Okay, I steal anyway,
but I would steal more.

695
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,090
Could I have
another light?

696
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,438
Americans.

697
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:37,982
I don't understand you.

698
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,394
For us,
family is everything.

699
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,980
We are <i>obbligati.</i>

700
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,866
I was born
into my family,

701
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,989
and that decides
my whole life.

702
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,828
My whole life.

703
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,282
I'm <i>obbligato,</i> too.

704
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,629
As much as you.

705
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,006
What are you
doing? Write!

706
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,845
Convince her to pay
us our money,

707
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,844
or <i>Madonna mia,</i> I...

708
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,022
I'll kill you myself.

709
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,945
You saw.

710
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:16,875
What?

711
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,745
Fuck, you've seen me.

712
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,504
If I tell Piccolino,

713
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,467
he'll have your
eyes pulled out

714
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,975
so you can never
identify us.

715
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,938
Even blind, your family
will pay for you.

716
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,654
You don't have
to tell him.

717
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,241
Please.

718
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,285
Look at me. I want
to see your eyes.

719
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,870
Look at me,
look at me.

720
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,328
I don't tell on you

721
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,757
and you don't tell on me.

722
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,173
Okay.

723
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,121
Look at the...

724
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,466
Fucking communists.

725
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:17,908
You don't look
like communists.

726
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,388
Let's talk about
the money.

727
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,174
First you prove to me

728
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,829
that you have the boy
and he's in good health,

729
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,094
and then we negotiate
the terms. But first the proof.

730
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,975
First the money,
then the boy.

731
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,273
I don't think
you have the kid.

732
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,692
Why are we
negotiating with him?

733
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,862
We should try him
and put him to death.

734
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,783
For what?

735
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,533
For crimes
against the proletariat.

736
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,615
Now I know you
don't have the kid.

737
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,244
We had an agreement.

738
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:47,919
With Paul.

739
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,504
Excuse me?

740
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,088
Paul used to talk about
having himself kidnapped.

741
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,715
With friends,
out on the street.

742
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,256
A game. No one gets hurt.

743
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,057
A way to make a little money
from his grandfather.

744
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,185
$2 million, perhaps.

745
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,930
That's what we do.

746
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,973
Did Paul know
who you were?

747
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,603
Well, we made friends
with him, and we told him we could help.

748
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,986
Then he disappeared.

749
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,947
We believe he
found someone else.

750
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,739
And now you
want what?

751
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,032
Finder's fee?
Consolation prize?

752
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,073
Here I thought you all
were supposed to be above money.

753
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,705
No one is above money.

754
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,667
Problem is that
it's in the wrong hands.

755
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,372
We intend to get
what's our due.

756
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,047
Did Paul ever talk
to you about having himself kidnapped?

757
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,981
You've got to remember
who the Gettys are.

758
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,685
Every time someone stays
in the bathroom for too long,

759
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,313
someone makes a joke
about being held for ransom.

760
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,448
Paul might have cracked a joke
once or twice among friends...

761
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,201
There's that word again.

762
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,165
What word?

763
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,576
A ''joke.''

764
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:11,282
You said you thought
it was a joke when it first happened.

765
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,039
Now you sound like
that policeman.

766
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,669
Whose side are you
on, Mr. Chace?

767
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,460
I'm on my own side. Always.
And if this is a joke,

768
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,379
I'd like to make sure
that I'm in on it.

769
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,973
Where's the old man?

770
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,270
Come here!

771
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,277
Hey, good girl. Hey, hey.

772
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,575
I can't say
I'm surprised.

773
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,462
Are you all right,
Mr. Getty?

774
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,590
Hmm. When I wrote my book,
<i>How to Be Rich,</i>

775
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,635
the publishers wanted
to change the title.

776
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,553
They wanted to call it
"How to Get Rich."

777
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,849
Well, I told them,
"Getting rich is easy."

778
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,846
I mean, any fool
can get rich.

779
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,024
And any number
of fools do.

780
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,442
I've noticed that.

781
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,437
But being rich,

782
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,736
that's something else.

783
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,576
When a man becomes wealthy,

784
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,956
he has to deal
with the problems of freedom.

785
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,709
All the choices he could
possibly want.

786
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,878
An abyss opens up.

787
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,715
Well, I've watched
that abyss.

788
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:46,050
I've watched it ruin
men, marriages.

789
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,130
But most of all,

790
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,971
it ruins the children.

791
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,850
I thought I could
trust my own blood.

792
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,148
He's a kid.

793
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,609
Kids do stupid things.

794
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,590
He's probably lying
on a beach somewhere,

795
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,883
and when he gets bored
or runs out of money,

796
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,867
he'll come home and he'll
have learned his lesson.

797
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,721
You know, if he hadn't,
I could always teach him one,

798
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,827
if need be, at your
discretion, of course.

799
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,904
I wanted to give
him everything,

800
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,997
everything I've
learned, all of...

801
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,451
My knowledge,
all that I've built.

802
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,377
And he just wanted to...

803
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,005
Pick my pocket
like his father,

804
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,042
like all the parasites

805
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,716
that have swarmed
around me all my life.

806
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,309
That's why I like things.

807
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,437
You see?

808
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,352
Things, objects, artifacts,
paintings, and...

809
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,570
They are exactly what
they appear to be.

810
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,238
They never change.

811
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,027
They never disappoint.

812
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,779
There's a purity
to beautiful things

813
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,704
that I've never been
able to find in another human being.

814
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,160
Neither have I.

815
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,255
Look, Mr. Getty,

816
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,656
you were right
not to pay the ransom.

817
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,299
You were right
to follow your gut.

818
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,179
You performed well.

819
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,591
It will be reflected
in your year-end bonus.

820
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,681
Well, thank you, sir.

821
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,433
Go back to Rome.

822
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,187
Wait for Paul to return.

823
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,231
Hurry up.

824
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,328
Okay, I'm all done.

825
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,742
<i>Finito.</i>

826
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,054
What the fuck
are you looking at?

827
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,003
Fuck.

828
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,345
You saw my face.

829
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,174
I didn't see anything.

830
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,851
You saw my face!
Don't lie!

831
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,845
Look, man, I won't tell
anybody, I swear.

832
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,433
You can trust me.

833
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,259
- He saw my face.
- Look, I won't tell anybody, okay?

834
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,637
Look, you guys
can still get your money.

835
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,447
Please, please, please.
No, no, no, no, no.

836
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,991
No, no, no,
I won't tell anybody! Please!

837
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,551
This is Chace.

838
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,012
<i>Mr. Chace, it's Corvo.</i>

839
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,266
<i>I've just sent a car
to pick up you and Ms. Getty.</i>

840
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,010
For what?

841
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,928
<i>To come
and identify the body.</i>

842
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,313
- "The body"?
<i>- It's Paul.</i>

843
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,767
It's Paul Getty's body.

844
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,445
I am sorry.

845
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,364
Paul?

846
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,407
<i>Yes, it's the kid.</i>

847
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,151
Look,
mistakes were made, obviously.

848
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,402
Somehow, I...

849
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,327
I'm on my way
to identify my son's body.

850
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,290
I don't feel
like talking.

851
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,522
- Gail...
- I've got nothing to say to you!

852
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,503
Gail, my investigation
and the police's

853
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,962
led us
to the conclusion that

854
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,652
- there was no physical danger.
- You bastards!

855
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,007
You did nothing!
All of you!

856
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,837
You couldn't find Paul,
so you came up with a story

857
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,467
to cover your tracks.

858
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,327
You made Paul
into the criminal. You gave up.

859
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,638
Whatever the old man is,
you're worse. You're lazy!

860
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,102
"Lazy"? No. No.

861
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,471
Stupid? Maybe.

862
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,688
Lazy? I...

863
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,733
No one did
enough. No one.

864
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,193
None of us
cared enough.

865
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,157
I must warn you

866
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,872
the corpse has been

867
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,206
burned

868
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,159
and disposed
of in seawater

869
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,037
to make identification
more difficult.

870
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,789
Show me.

871
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,146
It's very sticky.

872
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,520
Would you like
to help me, please?

873
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,134
It's not him.
It's not Paul.

874
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,933
'Course it's not him.
It's a grown man.

875
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,393
How could you
not see that?

876
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,889
That guy was headed
for a midlife crisis when they shot him.

877
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,775
A sailor saw that body get
thrown out of the same VW van

878
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:16,860
that was in the vicinity
when they took the boy.

879
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,177
Step
outside, please.

880
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,201
Thank you.

881
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,493
Come on.

882
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,364
Come on. Come on.

883
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,670
The body belongs
to Ettore "ll Tamia" Pazzano.

884
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,844
Age 33.

885
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,967
Purse-snatching, vandalism,
public indecency.

886
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,177
Known associates,

887
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,884
Alberto Laganadi.

888
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:52,558
Dino Bova.

889
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,315
And Dante Agnana.

890
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,396
Alias, Cinquanta.

891
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,945
All from Fiumara, Calabria.

892
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,846
How fast can we
get to Fiumara?

893
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:05,985
Six hours.

894
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,735
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You got way too many men out here.

895
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,507
All right, we're not
invading another country.

896
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,571
Just tell them to lay low.

897
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:25,981
We wait all night
if we have to.

898
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,404
One of your guys gets
trigger-happy,

899
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,181
that boy could get caught
in the crossfire.

900
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,242
Don't look at me
like that. It happens.

901
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,959
What the fuck
is he looking at?

902
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,965
Francesca! Francesca!

903
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,891
Francesca!

904
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,240
They haven't found anyone.

905
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,396
Paul.

906
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:25,827
Paul.

907
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,337
We got a live one.

908
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,029
They sold him.

909
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,075
Hey! Hey! Hey!

910
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,564
- Sir, do you have a newspaper?
- Yeah.

911
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,816
Thank you.

912
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,478
Petrol
rationing soon, guv.

913
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:43,744
It's a good day.

914
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,739
I'm glad to hear
that, Mr. Getty.

915
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,533
It'll make this
much easier.

916
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,490
We need to pay
the ransom.

917
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,458
I thought you said
this was a hoax.

918
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:54,829
Your grandson was kidnapped
by members of the Calabrese' Ndrangheta.

919
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,547
Two of the original kidnappers
are dead, and one is missing.

920
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,753
That sounds
like progress to me.

921
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,092
I'm afraid not,
all right?

922
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,836
They got nervous
waiting for the ransom.

923
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,838
They sold the boy
to an investor.

924
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,173
"An investor"?

925
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,433
Who invests
in kidnapped children?

926
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,642
You'd be surprised.

927
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,091
There's nothing people can't
find a way to turn into money.

928
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:16,312
You told me that Paul and his
mother had cooked this up to soak me.

929
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,213
And I was wrong, all right?
Paul may have talked

930
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,757
about being kidnapped
with his friends.

931
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,279
He put it out there.
He's not behind this.

932
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,991
How do I know
that you're not wrong now?

933
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,736
These people are not
the old-world <i>Malavita</i> anymore.

934
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,704
Their only code
is profit and loss.

935
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,993
They will do things to Paul

936
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,366
that cannot be undone
for any amount of money.

937
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:34,789
We have to pay.

938
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,398
Well, this simply isn't possible.

939
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,164
My financial position
has changed.

940
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,129
Really? I mean, 30 seconds ago,
you said it was a good day.

941
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,501
I mean, I'm not
all that bright,

942
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,874
but I can multiply
as well as you.

943
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,986
With oil up as much
as it was this morning,

944
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,338
you have amassed
another fortune.

945
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:52,557
Well, what if the embargo
is lifted and oil were to crash?

946
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,929
I'd be exposed.

947
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:58,650
I have never been
more vulnerable financially

948
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,602
- than I am right now.
- Mr. Getty,

949
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,989
with all due respect,
nobody has ever been richer

950
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,403
than you are
at this moment.

951
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,822
I have no money to spare.

952
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,158
What would it take?

953
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,032
I mean, what would it take
for you to feel secure?

954
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,451
More.

955
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:22,670
<i>Signora.</i>

956
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:24,709
Where is my son?

957
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,503
I'm with him.

958
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,264
He's still in good
health. Don't worry.

959
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,011
It's because of you
I worry.

960
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,219
I want to talk to him.

961
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,973
I'm afraid this
I cannot do.

962
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,062
I'm not
in charge anymore.

963
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,231
This is Fletcher Chace.

964
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,408
Mr. Getty's authorized me
to negotiate on his behalf.

965
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,579
We'll cover
all your expenses up to $200,000.

966
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,039
Anything under this figure
is not considered extortion

967
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,377
under Italian law, so you
can walk away free and clear.

968
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,710
<i>Come on.</i>

969
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:06,502
These people are not stupid,
<i>Signor</i> Chace.

970
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,437
<i>The boy
is worth nothing to anybody.</i>

971
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,367
Okay? We're just trying
to settle this without causing

972
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,177
any more embarrassment
to the family.

973
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,747
He's a juvenile delinquent,
his grandfather has disowned him.

974
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,451
It's a tough break.
You took the wrong kid,

975
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,812
but you're getting
off easy now.

976
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,062
You arrogant bastard.

977
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,297
Your uncle Piccolino
died in custody last night, by the way.

978
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,561
You better take this deal
before the same happens to you.

979
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,700
Cinquanta, don't hang up.
This is Gail.

980
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,784
Oh, shit. Shit.

981
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,040
<i>Scusi.</i>

982
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,336
- Gail...
- You're done. You're fired!

983
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,376
- I don't work for you, Gail.
- Get out!

984
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:47,029
- Look, if you'll let me explain...
- Get out, get out, get out!

985
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,670
Gail, I lied. All right?

986
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:53,049
I said I was authorized
to pay them $200,000.

987
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:55,801
You know how much I'm really
authorized to pay? Nothing.

988
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,040
All right, if they accept,
I won't be able to deliver,

989
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,771
but I had to buy some time.

990
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:02,190
You wanted to know
what I used to do.

991
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,980
This is what I used to do,
what I still do for Getty.

992
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,945
You make deals.

993
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,859
You buy people.

994
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,178
That's right. Whether
it's an oil well in the desert

995
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,738
or a human life,
it's all the same.

996
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,861
We have to show
we are willing to walk away.

997
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,246
I can't walk away.
You can walk away,

998
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,852
because you have nothing
else in your life.

999
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,083
Because there's no one
in your life but yourself.

1000
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,662
Fair enough.
$17 million and zero dollars,

1001
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,288
that's how far
apart we are.

1002
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,880
Those numbers
have got to move.

1003
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:37,971
<i>Signora.</i>

1004
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,598
<i>Signora! Signora!</i>

1005
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,793
Seven million dollars.

1006
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,737
Otto.

1007
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,484
Mr. Getty, Mr. Lam.

1008
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,237
Good morning,
Mr. Getty.

1009
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,364
Nothing good
about it.

1010
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,788
Let's get down
to business, shall we?

1011
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,621
Are you serious about
making payment?

1012
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,127
I wouldn't be here
if I weren't.

1013
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,879
Because there can't
be any more games.

1014
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,386
You know our price,

1015
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,097
and it's not subject
to negotiation any longer.

1016
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:01,726
Payment must be made
in cash today.

1017
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,265
I want the proof first.

1018
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,600
After you.

1019
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,059
Daniel.

1020
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,050
There you are.

1021
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,517
Beautiful child.

1022
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,105
Because of the painting's
disputed provenance,

1023
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,400
it can never be publicly
displayed.

1024
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:55,613
Careful.

1025
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,243
I'm a bit disappointed.

1026
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,075
It's not in the condition
I expected.

1027
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:13,002
I'm not sure it's worth
the 1.5 million you're asking.

1028
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:17,544
True masterpieces
rarely go on sale, Mr. Getty.

1029
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,305
If you're not willing to pay,
you will never own one.

1030
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,311
Pay the man.

1031
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,900
Hey, Paolo.

1032
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,452
Paolo. Look.

1033
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,414
I brought you something
to warm you.

1034
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:35,084
Something special
for being a good boy.

1035
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,126
Can I just have
some crackers instead?

1036
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:41,711
<i>E che</i> crackers?

1037
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,133
What you
want that for?

1038
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,677
I brought you
this good <i>bistecca.</i>

1039
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,391
Come on.

1040
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:49,062
Why?

1041
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,220
You bring me steak now.

1042
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,847
- Why?
- No questions.

1043
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,270
You need to be strong.

1044
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,312
Hey, <i>forte.</i> Come on.

1045
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,985
Paolo.

1046
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,320
Hey.

1047
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,563
- Smile.
- Okay, okay.

1048
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,320
I'll eat it. Just leave me
alone, and I'll eat it, okay?

1049
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:38,893
Hey, hey, hey!

1050
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,913
Hey, hey, hey.

1051
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,481
Hey. Hey.

1052
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,268
Hey.

1053
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:24,652
Hey. Hey.

1054
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,142
Hey.

1055
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,856
Hey, hey, hey. hey.

1056
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,835
Hey!

1057
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,505
Hey.

1058
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,364
Okay.

1059
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,779
Follow me. Follow me.

1060
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,049
<i>Grazie.</i>

1061
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,994
<i>Signora,</i> telephone.

1062
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:58,883
Hello?

1063
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,060
Hello?

1064
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,473
<i>- Mom.</i>
- Paul?

1065
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,137
<i>Mom, is that you?</i>

1066
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:11,854
Paul?

1067
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:14,482
<i>It's okay. I'm safe now.</i>

1068
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,231
<i>I'm at the police station.</i>

1069
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:17,481
<i>I'm all right.</i>

1070
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,484
<i>But I need you
to come and get me.</i>

1071
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,486
What police station
are you at?

1072
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,575
They came so close.

1073
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,782
I just want to go home, Mom.

1074
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,083
<i>Please come get me.</i>

1075
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,744
- <i>Please.</i>
- Okay.

1076
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,495
I'm coming to get you.

1077
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:33,839
What police station
are you at?

1078
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,837
Hold on. Let me ask.

1079
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,637
Excuse me...

1080
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:46,979
Paul?

1081
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,953
Now, you go first.

1082
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:53,623
No, you moved it.

1083
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:07,659
All right,
go ahead. Your move.

1084
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,288
Watch the kids.
I'll be back in a while.

1085
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,958
What? What am I
supposed to feed them?

1086
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,630
You'll figure it out.

1087
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,892
Mrs. Getty.

1088
01:25:58,195 --> 01:26:03,190
My situation is urgent.

1089
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,028
Please, if you
could give me

1090
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,449
- any idea as to the...
- Let me help you. Follow me.

1091
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:22,671
This piece came from my

1092
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,883
former father-in-law's
personal collection.

1093
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:29,219
By his own estimate,
it would bring

1094
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:32,972
1.2 million at auction,
and that was years ago.

1095
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:35,854
Ms. Getty,
this is <i>un gingillo,</i>

1096
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,149
a trinket of the type
sold to tourists.

1097
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,366
J. Paul Getty is the foremost
collector in the world.

1098
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,702
Do you really believe that
you know better than he does?

1099
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,071
No, <i>signora,</i> I do not.

1100
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,199
But I do know
what my eyes see.

1101
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:58,789
Thank you for your time.

1102
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:03,132
Mrs. Getty, you might start
at the Capitoline Museum.

1103
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,835
Ask for this person.

1104
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,089
Paul? Paul.

1105
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,255
Come on.

1106
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:30,632
Drink.

1107
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,259
Fast as you can swallow.

1108
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,552
Come on, drink.

1109
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,137
- Drink.
- Why?

1110
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:37,517
We take turns. Look.

1111
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:39,855
Okay.

1112
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:42,848
It tastes like piss.

1113
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,600
Okay, drink,
drink, drink.

1114
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,068
You drink enough,
you can't feel a thing, okay?

1115
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:49,188
Who the fuck
is that?

1116
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,361
He's...
He's a good doctor.

1117
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,137
- He's a good doctor.
- What?

1118
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,027
You don't even feel it.
This, I promise.

1119
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,074
What are you
talking about?

1120
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,850
What do you mean,
I'm not gonna feel it?

1121
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,916
What's he gonna do?

1122
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,535
Paolo.

1123
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,879
These men are going
to take a part of you.

1124
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,380
The ear.

1125
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,093
Let them have it, and live.

1126
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,175
No, they're not gonna take
my fucking ear.

1127
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:16,931
No, no, tell
them don't do it.

1128
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,346
Paolo, he's a good doctor.

1129
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,219
No. No.

1130
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,016
- Don't do it. No.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1131
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:24,480
No, get
the fuck off me. No.

1132
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,623
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Get the fuck off me!

1133
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,149
Get off of me!

1134
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,238
- Get off of me!
- Hey, look at me!

1135
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,194
- Get off! Off me!
- Paolo, look at me!

1136
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,408
- No matter what happens, look at me!
- Get off!

1137
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:36,572
Look at me!

1138
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,038
Okay. New breath.

1139
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,534
Look at me! Paolo,
okay, okay.

1140
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,377
Good boy.
Strong boy. Bravo.

1141
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:46,585
Okay.

1142
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:53,942
It's okay. Paolo.

1143
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,594
My eyes. Look at my eyes.

1144
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,824
It's okay, it's okay.
Soon, it's over.

1145
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,368
My eyes. My eyes.

1146
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:10,837
Look at me. It's okay.

1147
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:36,842
Almost over.

1148
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,110
That's him.

1149
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,360
No, no. The evidence.

1150
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:04,696
He's alive.

1151
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,196
<i>We would
like to publish it,</i>

1152
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:09,744
Ms. Getty.

1153
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,167
The photograph of the ear.

1154
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,246
It's news,

1155
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,332
and we are a newspaper.

1156
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,963
It's my son's ear.

1157
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:26,006
It's his.

1158
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:27,976
It's ours.

1159
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,304
And that's why we want
to offer some compensation.

1160
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:35,979
I don't want to sell you
pictures of my son's ear.

1161
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,769
Ms. Getty, your son
is being held for ransom.

1162
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:40,524
You claim not
to have any money.

1163
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:42,481
Yeah.

1164
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:44,984
Yes, I remember
it was your paper

1165
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,040
that reported I was
two months behind in my rent.

1166
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,118
- It was news.
- How much money are you offering?

1167
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,249
Fifty thousand
American dollars.

1168
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,590
We'll leave
you alone now.

1169
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:04,378
Enjoy your coffee.

1170
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,555
Pay me in newspapers.

1171
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:10,435
I don't want any money.

1172
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,262
I want a thousand copies
of your paper.

1173
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:18,438
And where would you like these
thousand copies sent, Ms. Getty?

1174
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:28,698
What is it?

1175
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:31,075
Open it up.
Let me see.

1176
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,767
<i>Paul is weak.</i>

1177
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:58,686
<i>He's lost so much blood.</i>

1178
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,894
<i>They wanted to take the foot,</i>

1179
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04,772
<i>and I convinced
them to take the ear.</i>

1180
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:07,070
<i>But the foot is coming next.</i>

1181
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,033
I hear them talking.

1182
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:12,408
I beg you,
get the money.

1183
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,869
Tell us where you are.

1184
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:19,253
We'll make a deal with you in exchange
for your cooperation.

1185
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,251
We'll get you out of Italy.

1186
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,262
No, no, no. You
don't understand.

1187
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,802
I can never talk
to the police.

1188
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,134
It's <i>onore.</i>

1189
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:37,015
It is forbidden.

1190
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,774
Even if this was my
own child.

1191
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,528
There must be something
that you can do.

1192
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:46,363
<i>And what
about you,</i> signora?

1193
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:49,449
I've risked my throat
for your son.

1194
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,944
And you, what have
you given for him?

1195
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,760
And don't tell me
you don't have the money.

1196
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:54,873
What have you done?

1197
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:01,460
You...

1198
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,477
Yes.

1199
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,302
<i>Ms. Getty, this
is Oswald Hinge in London.</i>

1200
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,638
<i>I'm sure you
don't remember me.</i>

1201
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:20,518
Mr. Hinge.

1202
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,102
I haven't forgotten a thing.

1203
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,446
I'm calling
on behalf of Mr. Getty.

1204
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:30,156
Not your former husband.

1205
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,992
The old one with the money.

1206
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,236
<i>That's the one.</i>

1207
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,530
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

1208
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:39,958
Mr. Getty has decided
to pay Paul's ransom.

1209
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,380
Thank you, Mr. Hinge.

1210
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:52,800
<i>You thank him.
I am but a messenger.</i>

1211
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,760
Well, I would if he'd let me.

1212
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:56,758
Well, you'll get your chance.

1213
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:01,063
We'll need you to come
to London for some discussions.

1214
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,430
What is there to discuss?

1215
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,023
Thank you very much.

1216
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,232
He's going to pay.

1217
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:25,399
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1218
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:26,525
Are you finished
with that, madam?

1219
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:27,549
<i>This is the captain.</i>

1220
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,920
<i>We're on our final approach
into London Heathrow.</i>

1221
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:32,169
<i>Scheduled to land
in around 10 to 15 minutes.</i>

1222
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:33,420
May I take that, sir?

1223
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,422
<i>Slightly cooler
today, 16 degrees Celsius.</i>

1224
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,202
- Are you finished with that?
<i>- On behalf of all the crew,</i>

1225
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,906
<i>we wish you a very pleasant
onward journey.</i>

1226
01:37:47,028 --> 01:37:49,315
Gentlemen, Ms. Abigail Getty.

1227
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:53,989
Mr. Chace.

1228
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,998
Well, you'll
be happy to learn

1229
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:12,546
that there are some
new developments,

1230
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:17,264
which will enable us
to finally help our little Paul.

1231
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:18,803
So glad to hear it.

1232
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,435
My tax attorneys
have discovered that

1233
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:26,265
while ransom payments are not
deductible under the tax code.

1234
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:27,857
I could write off the interest

1235
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:32,233
if I loan the ransom
money to my son.

1236
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:39,410
You've discovered you can

1237
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:42,372
take my son's kidnapping
as a tax deduction.

1238
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,335
I'm happy it works out
financially for you.

1239
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,171
I think we can all agree
the most important thing

1240
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,960
is getting Paul home safely.

1241
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:53,799
- And soon.
- Yes, soon.

1242
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:56,757
Soon as possible, please.

1243
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,345
Well, the loan
documents are ready,

1244
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:01,717
and the funds are ready
to be transferred.

1245
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,146
Paul will be so grateful
to his grandpa when he gets home.

1246
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:07,514
He loves you.

1247
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:09,807
More than you know.

1248
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:11,859
And I love him.

1249
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:15,355
There's just the matter
of the side letter.

1250
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,741
If I may, the, uh...

1251
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,744
In exchange for Mr. Getty
making the loan,

1252
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:25,741
you agree to sign over full
custody of all your children,

1253
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:28,209
including Paul,
to your ex-husband.

1254
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,418
"Sign over"?

1255
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:37,669
Yes, all parental rights
reside with Mr. Getty.

1256
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:39,804
Just here.

1257
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,011
Are you part of this?

1258
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,188
They can't do this, can they?

1259
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,982
My legal team
is the best there is.

1260
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:58,232
If it wouldn't stand up in court,
they wouldn't have written it.

1261
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:00,825
Now, you just take it easy.

1262
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:06,414
Sleep on it and have your
attorney read it over.

1263
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:08,203
I don't have time
to sleep on it.

1264
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,418
My child is being
held prisoner.

1265
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:12,287
Well, there is that.

1266
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:15,840
I let you have
the money back then.

1267
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,504
I didn't ask
for anything but my kids.

1268
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:19,997
You just can't bear
to leave anything on the table, can you?

1269
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:33,693
Thank you.

1270
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:40,110
We have a problem.

1271
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,494
Getty has agreed
to loan his son the ransom,

1272
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:46,283
up to the amount
that is tax-deductible.

1273
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:47,415
So?

1274
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:48,823
So, I investigate.

1275
01:40:49,335 --> 01:40:52,873
Under US tax code,
only the first million is deductible.

1276
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,291
That's all they wired to us.

1277
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:56,915
What is the ransom
down to?

1278
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,917
Four. Down from 17.

1279
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,801
We don't have four.
We have one.

1280
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,852
Meno male,
<i>it's almost over.</i>

1281
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,278
<i>What is Paul's condition?</i>

1282
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:21,068
<i>He's not so good,</i>

1283
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:24,158
<i>but we can keep him
alive a few days.</i>

1284
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,449
<i>Long enough
to make the exchange.</i>

1285
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,117
We may not
have all of it.

1286
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,410
<i>All of What?</i>

1287
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:31,824
We only
have one million.

1288
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:33,581
<i>The number is four.</i>

1289
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,254
One
is the new number.

1290
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:37,588
<i>One</i>

1291
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,257
is one quarter of the ransom.

1292
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:43,545
For this, they'll send
one quarter of your son.

1293
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,797
<i>Tell me, which quarter
do you want?</i>

1294
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:48,342
Did you hold the kid down
so they could cut off his ear?

1295
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,268
You greedy animals.

1296
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:52,137
You're the worst
criminals of all.

1297
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:53,273
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1298
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:56,391
<i>I don't have any money
to make from this anymore.</i>

1299
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:59,982
But I don't
want Paul to die.

1300
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:03,531
You have to go back
and get Getty to pay.

1301
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,697
You have to get me
some time here.

1302
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:08,285
I'm fighting an empire.

1303
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,705
You think you're
the only one?

1304
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:22,917
I need to speak to him.

1305
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:26,630
<i>Mr. Getty is unable
to receive guests at this hour, ma'am.</i>

1306
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:33,516
We can't stay here.
They'll call the police.

1307
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:34,808
Let them.

1308
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:38,357
Look, we have the million.

1309
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,564
For a million,
they'll kill him.

1310
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,508
They won't believe me when I say I don't
have the rest of the money.

1311
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:44,647
Nobody believes me.

1312
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:46,817
There was never any
guarantees, Gail.

1313
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:50,319
The money would
give us a chance,

1314
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:52,288
maybe a window
of opportunity to grab him.

1315
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,437
- Maybe not even that.
- The money, the money,

1316
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:56,605
the money,
the money, the money.

1317
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:58,495
I can't bear to hear
about the money.

1318
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,088
Everybody thinks
I have the money.

1319
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:04,084
The newspapers, kidnappers,
they all think I'm rich.

1320
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:05,548
You know what
they call that?

1321
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:07,507
Credit.

1322
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:18,356
We announce I have the ransom
money, all four million.

1323
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,316
We make the exchange.
You get your window.

1324
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,137
And what happens when they find out
the money's not all there?

1325
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,470
By that time,
we either have Paul or...

1326
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,330
Now you're
thinking like Getty.

1327
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:38,128
Excuse me, please.

1328
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,272
Excuse us,
please. Excuse me.

1329
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:40,732
- All right, stand by.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

1330
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:41,791
Thank you.

1331
01:43:44,093 --> 01:43:45,254
Good morning, everybody.

1332
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:48,006
Mrs. Abigail Getty.

1333
01:43:55,688 --> 01:43:57,144
Following a long

1334
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:03,059
and difficult negotiation
with my son's kidnappers,

1335
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:07,655
<i>I have decided to meet their demands
and pay the ransom in full.</i>

1336
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:11,030
<i>I cannot begin to describe
the impact</i>

1337
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:13,153
<i>this event has
had on our family.</i>

1338
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:16,284
<i>For anyone to be abducted
is bad enough...</i>

1339
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,353
- Bullimore.
<i>- ...let alone a child who should be safe</i>

1340
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:19,980
<i>with his family
is another matter entirely.</i>

1341
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:21,995
- Sir.
- Get me Chace.

1342
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:23,963
<i>Abigail Getty,
mother of the kidnapped</i>

1343
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:25,707
<i>John Paul Getty III.</i>

1344
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:27,366
<i>It was at 3:00 a.m.
on the morning...</i>

1345
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:31,841
Morning, Chace.

1346
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:37,435
Will you help
me with this?

1347
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:49,359
I'm building a house
in California.

1348
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:55,328
An exact replica of my
imperial villa in Rome,

1349
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:56,988
down to the very
last detail.

1350
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,074
But with flush toilets.

1351
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,040
Yes. The mountain may not
have come to Muhammad,

1352
01:45:03,172 --> 01:45:05,413
but it sure
as hell came to me.

1353
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,006
Mr. Getty.

1354
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:09,300
The West Texas Intermediate,
sir.

1355
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,928
What's it feel like,
reading that slip of paper?

1356
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:17,725
Well, for a moment,

1357
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:23,982
money loses all meaning
and becomes as plentiful as air.

1358
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:25,649
Like flight.

1359
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,690
And then it passes.

1360
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:34,780
What's all this
I see on TV

1361
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:38,325
with Gail paying
the ransom in full?

1362
01:45:38,624 --> 01:45:40,240
We both know
she doesn't have it.

1363
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,040
The lady's made other
arrangements.

1364
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,525
But she
doesn't have the money.

1365
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:48,088
So, what's going on?

1366
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:51,209
Come on. Where
did she get it?

1367
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,636
Is she fucking somebody?

1368
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:59,308
You know, I think I'm finally beginning
to understand what makes you tick.

1369
01:45:59,436 --> 01:46:00,722
No, no, you
couldn't begin to.

1370
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:04,105
So, spill it.

1371
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,561
What's going on?
What's her game?

1372
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:10,270
Don't forget, Chace,
I have a contract.

1373
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:11,942
And I'll enforce it.

1374
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:14,490
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh? Why not?

1375
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,154
Can you hear me?

1376
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:18,990
I want to make sure
that I am very clear.

1377
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:22,039
Because whatever personal
security you presently enjoy

1378
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:23,202
comes from me.

1379
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,794
All right? Those Alsatians
limping around the pool?

1380
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,541
My people trained them.

1381
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:29,797
Your security system?
My people installed it.

1382
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,462
The bodyguards? That's right,
you rapacious old fuck,

1383
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:34,461
you are protected
from every threat imaginable,

1384
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:36,258
unless that threat
happens to be me.

1385
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:39,508
I suppose this is your
way of submitting your resignation.

1386
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:40,804
Hey!

1387
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:43,268
"Men of risk"?

1388
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,683
Isn't that what
you called us?

1389
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,973
"I risk my money.
You risk your life."

1390
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:48,725
You're so full of shit.

1391
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:51,569
You and me? We never risked
a thing in our lives.

1392
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:53,608
We never took the chances
ordinary people take.

1393
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:55,649
That's why we are
where we are now.

1394
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:56,868
You're just cheap, Paul.

1395
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,597
You could have
all the money in the world,

1396
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:00,307
and you are still a no-good
miserable son of a bitch,

1397
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:01,571
and don't you forget it.

1398
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:05,126
Goodbye, Mr. Getty.

1399
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:09,916
Those children
are my blood, Chace!

1400
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,013
They're mine.

1401
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:24,938
She took them.

1402
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:48,330
The money came through.

1403
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:50,207
It was the full ransom.

1404
01:47:50,923 --> 01:47:52,755
$3.3 million.

1405
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:56,968
At today's exchange rate,
1.6 billion lira.

1406
01:47:57,346 --> 01:48:00,714
They wired this along
with the money.

1407
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:04,763
Getty caved.

1408
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:06,852
What did you say to him?

1409
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:08,976
I couldn't even tell you.

1410
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:13,605
<i>I'll make
the exchange on my own.</i>

1411
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,987
<i>La Signora</i> Getty only.

1412
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:17,968
<i>She'd be in a car
with millions of dollars, okay?</i>

1413
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:19,469
<i>The whole world knows
what she looks like.</i>

1414
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:20,853
<i>She could be robbed
on the highway.</i>

1415
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:23,285
That's your problem.

1416
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:25,663
<i>Then we both go.</i>

1417
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:26,989
<i>Non-negotiable.</i>

1418
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:07,613
Because of the fuel crisis
and rationing measures,

1419
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:10,617
no cars will be allowed
on the roads on Sunday.

1420
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:13,336
<i>This way, all the roads
will be empty,</i>

1421
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:16,081
<i>and so, they can see
if Gail is followed.</i>

1422
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,487
<i>Drive a Fiat 125</i>

1423
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,481
<i>with two suitcases
tied to the roof.</i>

1424
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:47,365
<i>Exit the autostrada
tollgate at 9:00 a.m.</i>

1425
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:51,492
<i>and drive south at exactly
80 kilometers an hour.</i>

1426
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:15,230
<i>Do not stop
for food, toilet, nothing.</i>

1427
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:18,271
<i>Remember, they're watching.</i>

1428
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:31,281
<i>A small stone
will strike your windshield.</i>

1429
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:35,868
<i>This will be their
sign to stop.</i>

1430
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:42,084
Obey these rules, or they
will take his other ear.

1431
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,131
His eye.

1432
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:46,174
A hand.

1433
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:55,857
That's it.

1434
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:22,717
Come on.

1435
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:04,751
Okay, come on.

1436
01:54:05,756 --> 01:54:06,871
Okay.

1437
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:08,588
You look good.

1438
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,667
You can't go home
to your mother looking like a <i>sciattone.</i>

1439
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:19,467
Stay there and don't move,
or we kill you.

1440
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:23,731
Okay.

1441
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:32,817
Hey, Paolo.

1442
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:34,277
Don't wait. Run.

1443
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:35,740
And get out of Italy.

1444
01:54:44,503 --> 01:54:45,503
You, too.

1445
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:56,971
<i>Three kilometers
down the road is a work site.</i>

1446
01:54:57,557 --> 01:54:58,763
<i>Paul waits there for you.</i>

1447
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:14,915
Footprints.

1448
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:17,421
They made the drop.

1449
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:25,644
He ran.

1450
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:32,103
Who's there?

1451
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,208
Bullimore!

1452
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,147
- I can't get involved.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1453
01:57:58,822 --> 01:57:59,822
No!

1454
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,435
Bullimore?

1455
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:38,525
Bul...

1456
01:59:35,377 --> 01:59:36,538
No, no, no, no.

1457
02:00:40,608 --> 02:00:41,608
Paul?

1458
02:00:42,277 --> 02:00:43,312
Hey, Paul!

1459
02:00:48,992 --> 02:00:50,107
Paul!

1460
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,206
Stop. Enough.

1461
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:01,456
What are you looking at?

1462
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:03,207
Cinquanta.

1463
02:01:04,924 --> 02:01:06,710
Get him out of Italy. Now!

1464
02:01:08,344 --> 02:01:10,711
- What are you waiting for? Go!
- Come on.

1465
02:01:17,228 --> 02:01:18,468
Paul.

1466
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:29,521
Fuck!

1467
02:01:57,977 --> 02:01:59,012
Beautiful

1468
02:02:00,939 --> 02:02:02,020
child.

1469
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:18,872
Come here.

1470
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:24,284
You're all right.

1471
02:02:25,088 --> 02:02:26,374
You're all right.

1472
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,532
It's okay, it's okay.

1473
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:08,291
There.

1474
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:11,127
Mr. Hinge,
Ms. Getty is here.

1475
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:17,800
Ms. Getty.

1476
02:03:17,932 --> 02:03:19,093
Tea?

1477
02:03:19,434 --> 02:03:20,924
No, thank you.

1478
02:03:23,062 --> 02:03:27,647
Ms. Getty, we offer you
our sincerest condolences.

1479
02:03:29,277 --> 02:03:30,688
Well, you're very thoughtful.

1480
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:32,144
Please, sit.

1481
02:03:33,197 --> 02:03:36,406
Mr. Getty's death has created
a bit of a crisis here.

1482
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:39,158
You see, the estate
was structured

1483
02:03:39,287 --> 02:03:41,779
as a charitable
family trust.

1484
02:03:42,373 --> 02:03:44,159
Did he ever give any
money to charity?

1485
02:03:44,584 --> 02:03:45,870
No. No.

1486
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:47,667
The trust enabled
Mr. Getty

1487
02:03:47,795 --> 02:03:50,253
to build his fortune
without paying taxes.

1488
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:57,169
There was just
one catch.

1489
02:03:57,597 --> 02:03:59,179
Under the rules
of the trust,

1490
02:03:59,307 --> 02:04:01,264
he couldn't actually
spend the money.

1491
02:04:01,476 --> 02:04:04,764
What's the point of making
all that money if you can't spend it?

1492
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:07,021
Well, he couldn't spend it,
but he could invest it.

1493
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:09,098
So, he invested
it in things.

1494
02:04:09,859 --> 02:04:11,395
Art. Antiques.

1495
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:14,732
Soon, he had a...
A staggering amount of things.

1496
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:16,775
And a staggering
amount of money.

1497
02:04:16,908 --> 02:04:19,900
Now someone has to decide
what to do with it all.

1498
02:04:20,036 --> 02:04:21,526
What do you
want with me?

1499
02:04:23,373 --> 02:04:24,704
How do I put this...

1500
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:27,491
The king is dead.

1501
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:31,043
The throne is vacant.

1502
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:34,581
Your children are his heirs.

1503
02:04:35,093 --> 02:04:36,458
Until they come of age,

1504
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:39,006
someone has to make
the decisions.

1505
02:04:39,806 --> 02:04:41,012
Which means, of course,

1506
02:04:41,849 --> 02:04:43,840
someone has
to take his place.

1507
02:04:57,115 --> 02:05:00,528
They're still finding
masterpieces stashed under staircases.

1508
02:05:02,328 --> 02:05:04,911
Most of it's going
to his villa in Malibu.

1509
02:05:05,915 --> 02:05:07,622
Nowhere else
could fit it all.

1510
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:09,787
- Careful.
- Yes, ma'am.

1511
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:17,627
Paul?

1512
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:20,919
Come say hello
to Mr. Chace.

1513
02:05:21,889 --> 02:05:24,927
Or goodbye.
I'm not sure which.

1514
02:05:29,897 --> 02:05:31,387
He's gonna be trouble
with the ladies.

1515
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:34,562
I already am.

1516
02:05:36,988 --> 02:05:38,478
I do hope you'll
stay on with us.

1517
02:05:38,614 --> 02:05:40,571
I know you had other
ambitions, but...

1518
02:05:41,284 --> 02:05:42,524
Guys like me
don't get rich.

1519
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:44,743
We get sidetracked
too easily.

1520
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:47,324
Shame.

1521
02:05:48,624 --> 02:05:49,659
Not really.

1522
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:52,826
I think of you
as family.

1523
02:05:54,922 --> 02:05:56,162
Kind of you
to say so, ma'am.

1524
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:03,476
Was a couple things around the grounds
that I've been meaning to see to.

1525
02:06:03,765 --> 02:06:05,426
Yes, of course.
Don't let me keep you.

1526
02:06:06,476 --> 02:06:07,591
Coming?

1527
02:06:11,773 --> 02:06:14,014
- Let's go see the dogs.
- Okay.

1528
02:06:32,085 --> 02:06:33,166
Ms. Getty?

1529
02:06:33,878 --> 02:06:35,398
Is there anything we
can help you with?

1530
02:06:36,089 --> 02:06:37,671
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1531
02:06:38,216 --> 02:06:39,377
I have everything I need.

1531
02:06:40,305 --> 02:07:40,867

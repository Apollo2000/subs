2
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,673
- Yoko.
- <i>What is wrong?</i>

3
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,675
I'm just leaving
the Williams' house now.

4
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,610
Jennifer's out
and Emma's asleep.

5
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,979
I'll leave the keys with Alex
at the care center

6
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,446
before I head to the airport.

7
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:20,915
- <i>Did something happen?</i>
- No, I...

8
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,585
- <i>What is wrong?</i>
- I need to go home.

9
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,820
I know I made
a longer commitment,

10
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:28,288
but I need to get back
to my family.

11
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,558
I can't explain it.
It's like something...

12
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,062
I just need to get back
to the States.

13
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,564
<i>You were
supposed to stay for a few...</i>

14
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:38,465
Yoko? Yoko?

15
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,536
Yoko.

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,153
Where...?

17
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,756
- Oh, hey.
- Mommy!

18
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,791
- You guys, I'm home.
- Welcome back.

19
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,459
- You made it. Heh, heh.
- Oh, my love.

20
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,995
Welcome home.

21
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,930
Oh, it's so good to be home.

22
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,768
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

23
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,078
Burke? Time to go!

24
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,278
Burke.

25
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,684
Burke?

26
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,053
Hey, what you doing, bud?
What's going on?

27
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:41,488
Come on, we gotta go now.
Stop playing with that.

28
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,658
Me and Daddy never finished it.

29
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,737
Come here.

30
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,110
I miss Daddy.

31
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,477
I miss him too.

32
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,347
So much.

33
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,187
And that's okay
because we're supposed to.

34
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,695
I think this move's gonna be
really good for us.

35
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,730
It's gonna be a new place.

36
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,165
And a new start.

37
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,970
Nothing bad's gonna
happen to me, okay?

38
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,839
Nothing bad's gonna happen
to you either.

39
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,075
I promise.
And it means more

40
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,144
because I'm a police officer.

41
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,647
Come on. I know
first days are hard,

42
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:42,083
but you gotta do it,
like ripping off a Band-Aid.

43
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,483
I'm scared.

44
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,090
I'm scared too.

45
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,227
What do we do
when we're scared?

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,197
Close your eyes
and count to five.

47
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,464
Right.

48
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:06,107
One, two, three...

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,942
four...

50
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,309
five.

51
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,246
Everything's okay.

52
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,782
Let's go to school.

53
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,118
Ready?

54
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:41,776
<i>"The lights are on,
but nobody's home."</i>

55
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,705
<i>I hear they stuck
you with the new chick.</i>

56
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,174
Don't call them
"chicks."

57
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,911
Buddy of mine in Vice said
her old man died of cancer.

58
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,081
Real brutal. Kid was
alone with him when he died.

59
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,849
It's only been three months.

60
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,393
Muldoon?

61
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,297
Yeah.

62
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,717
Smoke?

63
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,085
Nah, I quit.

64
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:01,488
Mind if I do?

65
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,757
Go ahead.

66
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,871
How are you
liking it around here?

67
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,909
Uh, we're still
getting settled in.

68
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,381
It's definitely different.

69
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,817
How does something
like this even happen?

70
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,585
Car's been here for months.

71
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,554
Doors were locked
when we found it.

72
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,456
Gruesome, huh?

73
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,324
I'll say.

74
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,859
Got an ID yet?

75
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:12,960
Sure do.

76
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,629
Got Lorna Moody, 65.

77
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:19,433
Why did it take so long
to find her?

78
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,268
Well, this here's
a service road.

79
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:24,305
They only just started
using it for the season.

80
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,041
Anyone come looking for her?

81
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,845
That's just it. The feds,
they're already looking for her.

82
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,514
Turns out she's one of those
assisted-suicide broads.

83
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,049
Find anything on her?

84
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,884
Usual stuff.

85
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,086
I got an address though.

86
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,689
Directions
in the glove box.

87
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,491
44 Reyburn Drive.

88
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,827
Same place
as the Landers case.

89
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,599
Looks like
we got another one.

90
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,933
Another what?

91
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,172
What was
the Landers case?

92
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,310
Anything else?

93
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:06,047
Forensics will be here soon.

94
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,982
The FBI is on its way too.

95
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,086
Sure looks like something
was in there with her.

96
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,557
You ever seen anything
like this one before?

97
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,059
Detective...

98
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,263
What's up with
the Landers house?

99
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,368
Worked a case there,
two years ago.

100
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,205
- Sort of stuck with me.
- Mm.

101
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,774
And it's...

102
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,477
just strange to see it
pop up again.

103
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,212
Maybe they're connected.

104
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,716
It's just a weird coincidence.

105
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,170
"Entire family murdered."

106
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:39,106
Hey! Put that shit away
before Goodman sees you.

107
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,442
- Why?
- He worked that case there.

108
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:45,312
He never set foot inside.
Never seen a cop do that before.

109
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,797
Hello?

110
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,035
Police department.

111
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,338
I just want to go.

112
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,924
Hello?

113
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,861
Police department.

114
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,014
I just want to go.
Will you take me?

115
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,815
- Hello?
- Take me home.

116
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,285
I don't want to be here.

117
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,142
Chicken for dinner.

118
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,979
Chicken for dinner.

119
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,648
We're gonna have...

120
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,921
Are you Mrs. Matheson?

121
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm Detective Muldoon.

122
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,372
Gonna talk to you
about a woman we found.

123
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,684
Will you feed me?

124
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,086
Excuse me?

125
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,056
William, my...

126
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,025
He always used to
feed me.

127
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,530
William was your husband?

128
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,576
Ma'am, are you alone
in the house right now?

129
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,546
Will you help me, please?

130
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,714
Help me.

131
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:42,316
Help me, help me.

132
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,084
Help me.

133
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,887
Please! No, please!
Don't leave!

134
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,923
- Stay there, I'm gonna get help.
- No, no, no! No!

135
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,626
Help me!

136
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,227
No!

137
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,962
Don't leave me!

138
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,631
No!

139
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,465
Don't leave me.

140
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,401
Do not leave me!

141
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,102
Please don't leave me.

142
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,303
Don't leave...

143
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,526
Car 646, we need an ambulance

144
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,460
to 44 Reyburn Drive.

145
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,339
What the fuck was that?

146
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,930
I heard you the first time!

147
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,406
What are you doing here?

148
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:22,510
I went to the house.

149
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:26,046
There's another body.

150
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,417
Come in.

151
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,356
<i>This is my body,
which is given...</i>

152
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,560
The Landers was just...

153
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,695
one of those cases.

154
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,697
Total mess.

155
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,867
Whole family murdered
at the house on Reyburn.

156
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,436
The neighbors too.
Fiona Landers...

157
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:51,873
She murdered
her 6-year-old daughter.

158
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,576
And then she killed
her husband.

159
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,209
And then herself.

160
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,984
You think the body
that we found was related?

161
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,988
I can't go down
the same road again.

162
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,632
Why did you never
go into the house?

163
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,503
Something never
felt right about it.

164
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,138
Just...

165
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,610
didn't feel right.

166
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,780
What do you mean?

167
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,882
My old partner, he was obsessed.

168
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:36,818
He said there was...

169
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,786
energy.

170
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,789
Mm, spirits.

171
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:43,625
Something like that.

172
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,927
You saying
the house is haunted?

173
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,461
People will think you're crazy

174
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,631
if you start
saying shit like that.

175
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,800
Yeah, well, I don't buy that.

176
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,938
I'm sorry, can I
get you anything?

177
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,940
No, I'm good.

178
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,708
Pie?

179
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,377
- Not that pie.
- Oh, fuck.

180
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,879
Heh, I'm good.

181
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,314
My mother...

182
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,218
she was into
all that ghostly shit.

183
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,721
The older I get,

184
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,657
the more I wanna believe it.

185
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,525
Mm-hm.

186
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,727
- She passed away, huh?
- Yeah.

187
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:23,998
I just don't have the heart
to get rid of all this.

188
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:27,001
I still think of this as...

189
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:28,368
her house.

190
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,805
Yeah, I understand
how that goes.

191
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,175
- How long for you?
- Three months.

192
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,944
It was cancer.

193
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:42,349
I've seen
how that plays out.

194
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,952
I don't wish that on anyone.

195
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:50,457
I get you're looking
for distractions right now.

196
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,026
Don't get lost
in this shit.

197
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,062
The case, the house...

198
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,603
I know what that looks like.

199
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,359
<i>Neonatal oncologist to OR 3.</i>

200
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,730
<i>Neonatal oncologist to OR 3.</i>

201
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:34,569
Don't worry. Amnios are
pretty routine for women your age.

202
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,172
Mm-hm. I'm... I'm ready, thanks.

203
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,339
Okay.

204
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,008
This is the poke.

205
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,046
Mm-hm.

206
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,381
That's the needle.
Does it hurt?

207
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,585
No. It's okay.

208
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:53,320
This is where
you're gonna feel a cramp.

209
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,722
<i>I have the results.</i>

210
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,225
The amnio confirmed

211
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,762
what we suspected
from the blood work.

212
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:05,099
The likelihood that your child
will be born with ALD is high.

213
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:11,072
I know that we've, uh,

214
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:14,842
previously discussed
various possibilities...

215
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:17,578
but if you have
any questions now,

216
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:21,115
I can put you in touch
with some other families.

217
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:25,186
Helps to hear from other parents
about the realities of this.

218
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,486
But, uh...

219
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,758
there's still a chance, right?

220
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,794
That our baby
will be born healthy?

221
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,625
Reyburn's coming up.
I wanna stop by

222
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,459
and get
the Landers' signature.

223
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:08,863
Wait, uh...? We have
to do that right now?

224
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,633
- I wanna get it done today.
- Okay.

225
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,042
Be right back.

226
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,124
Hello?

227
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,660
Peter Spencer.

228
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,624
Hello?

229
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,796
Anybody home?

230
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,067
Peter Spencer here.

231
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,806
Hello?

232
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,781
Peter Spencer.

233
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,229
Oh, my God.

234
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,132
Okay.

235
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,039
Unbelievable.

236
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,275
The car's still here.

237
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:03,711
But nobody's home.

238
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:06,580
I might have to come back again
tomorrow morning.

239
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:20,027
So we're not gonna
talk about it?

240
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,096
I don't know
what you want me to say.

241
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:26,767
I just want you to...

242
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:30,037
I want us to talk so we can
make this decision together.

243
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,278
Are you mad at me?

244
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,680
No. No.

245
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,353
I'm not mad at you.
I love you.

246
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,822
I love you, so I wanted
to have a family with you.

247
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:50,758
- I'm not mad at you.
- I know. I love you too.

248
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,360
- I'm sorry.
- No.

249
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,762
I just don't know
what to do.

250
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,430
We'll figure it out.

251
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,559
Will you turn off
the light?

252
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:32,493
That light's so bright.

253
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,153
Hi.

254
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,421
Hi.

255
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,627
- How you feeling?
- I don't know.

256
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,976
- We'll figure it out.
- Mm-hm.

257
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:26,480
Breakfast. I'm gonna
make you some breakfast.

258
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:27,848
You?

259
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,316
What was that?

260
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,485
You're gonna cook?

261
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,220
Yeah, I'm gonna cook.

262
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:34,655
I'm a good cook.

263
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,690
Wait, you're gonna
burn the place down?

264
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,529
I mean, that's how
we're gonna deal with this?

265
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,366
Yes. I'm gonna murder us
with deliciousness.

266
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,034
Okay.

267
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:57,945
<i>Windy today with
gusts up to 40 miles per hour.</i>

268
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:01,148
<i>The temperature dropping
from 59 to...</i>

269
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:49,863
Hello.

270
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:55,069
I'm actually
the real estate agent.

271
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,109
Oh, God.

272
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:04,679
You scared me.

273
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:08,749
You are...

274
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,620
Melinda, right?

275
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,188
You remember me?

276
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,225
I'm the guy on the sign.

277
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:23,732
Melinda, sweetheart,
are your parents home?

278
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:29,103
Oh, God.

279
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:30,605
Your nose is bleeding...

280
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:32,741
Sweetheart, let's get you
inside. Come on.

281
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,246
You doing okay?

282
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,417
I think
it's all stopped.

283
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,086
Yeah.

284
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,128
Where are your parents?
Do you know?

285
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,299
Let's try your dad again, huh?

286
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,338
Let's see
if he picks up this time.

287
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:12,479
<i>Sam Landers. Leave a message.</i>

288
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:15,349
Hi, Mr. Landers,
this is, uh...

289
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,686
This is Peter Spencer...

290
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,421
um, again.

291
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,691
I'm actually at your house
right now.

292
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:25,959
I just came by to get
those closing signatures.

293
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:30,130
Um, I will try you again later.

294
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:32,667
Um...

295
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:37,371
Your daughter is here.

296
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:40,474
Uh, she had a little bit
of a bloody nose,

297
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:42,510
but she's doing okay now.

298
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:45,312
Please give me a call
when you get this.

299
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:52,787
<i>Mommy's friend, Yoko,
taught me how to say,</i> "Moshi moshi."

300
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,222
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

301
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,158
<i>I can't wait to come home
and squeeze you.</i>

302
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,227
<i>I... Whoop, ha!</i>

303
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,063
<i>I already have so many things
to give you.</i>

304
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:05,866
<i>And you're going to love them.</i>

305
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,635
<i>Bye, angel.</i>

306
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:08,969
<i>Mama loves you.</i>

307
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,478
<i>My name is Lorna Moody.</i>

308
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:27,582
<i>I'm known as an exit guide.</i>

309
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:30,117
<i>I sit with people
who've made the decision</i>

310
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,120
<i>to end their lives
on their own terms.</i>

311
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:36,758
<i>I want to start
by answering</i>

312
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:39,159
<i>any questions
you might have for me.</i>

313
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,796
<i>How long will
it take her to die?</i>

314
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,533
<i>Our preferred method is a gas</i>

315
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,636
<i>that requires
the use of a hood.</i>

316
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,707
<i>Once she pulls the hood
down over her head,</i>

317
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:57,311
<i>she'll be unconscious
in five to 10 seconds.</i>

318
00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:59,112
<i>That's all she'll know.</i>

319
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:02,684
How many times
have you done this?

320
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:05,118
I've been
a compassionate presence

321
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,488
at the bedside of 44 people.

322
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:12,459
Tell me about your wife.

323
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:16,798
We found out
she was sick last year.

324
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:22,269
She was pretty far gone...

325
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:26,206
by the time we realized.

326
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:31,144
So we moved here...

327
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,848
so she could be closer
to her doctors.

328
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:38,151
But after the move,

329
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,220
she started getting worse.

330
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,356
I'm so sorry.

331
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,191
I'm glad you called.

332
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:47,896
Hopefully, I can help.

333
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:51,933
I hope so.

334
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:55,202
Mr. Matheson,
I need to warn you.

335
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:59,072
For anyone to do this,

336
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:02,209
they must be mentally competent

337
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:06,014
and physically able to
carry it through themselves.

338
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:10,150
Is that clear?
Do you understand?

339
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:12,587
Yeah. Mm-hm.

340
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:19,426
Shall we go see your wife? Hm?

341
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:26,034
Mrs. Matheson,
my name is Lorna Moody.

342
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,902
Do you know why I'm here?

343
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,876
Your husband told me
about your condition,

344
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:37,144
and I'm here to see
if I can help.

345
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,649
Mrs. Matheson,
are you all right?

346
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:45,620
Peekaboo!

347
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,625
Who are you playing with?

348
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,662
My friend.

349
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,499
And what's your friend's name?

350
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,270
Melinda.

351
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,473
Melinda?

352
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:10,078
Is she here with us now?

353
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,995
- Please, I haven't said...
- Mr. Matheson.

354
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,731
I was quite clear
on the requirements,

355
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,599
and I'm truly, deeply sorry,

356
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:35,435
but your wife is no longer
mentally competent.

357
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,605
Please.

358
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,207
You can't just leave.

359
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,976
I am deeply sorry

360
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,779
for everything you and
your wife have been through...

361
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,516
but you misrepresented
her condition.

362
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,120
What am I supposed to do?

363
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,656
I would still like
to stay a few days,

364
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:56,323
if that's all right with you.

365
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:59,694
I may not be able to help
in the way that you wanted,

366
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:03,230
but at least I could provide
some support, no matter what.

367
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,766
Is that okay with you?

368
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:07,935
So, what do you like to do
at the playground?

369
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,637
Because I like the swings.

370
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:13,373
We can swing, swing.

371
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:17,812
Thank you.

372
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,517
Thank you.

373
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,100
I made up
the guest room for you.

374
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:44,739
We don't get much company.

375
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,874
Oh, it's lovely.

376
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:51,079
All right, well, I have to run
to the store for some dinner.

377
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,182
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

378
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:56,084
Not much in the kitchen either.

379
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,187
Well, let me go.
It's the least I can do.

380
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:07,922
Oh!

381
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,559
Hello.

382
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:47,562
Excuse me.

383
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,398
Excuse me, sir.

384
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,976
Mr. Matheson.

385
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:05,546
There's a strange man
standing on your front lawn.

386
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,415
I think there's
something wrong with him.

387
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:22,296
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,199
He's here again.

389
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,834
- <i>My partner?</i>
- Yeah.

390
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,903
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.</i>

391
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,872
Yeah. Okay.

392
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,340
See you soon.

393
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:36,677
Who is he?

394
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:42,550
He's a cop.

395
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:43,784
What's he doing?

396
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:50,791
Who knows?
He worked a case here before we moved in.

397
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:53,060
Now he won't leave us alone.

398
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,863
A case?

399
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:59,100
I hope it wasn't a murder.

400
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,741
Oh, God. It was, wasn't it?

401
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:19,253
You gotta stop it
with this shit.

402
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:21,289
What's the matter with you?

403
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,591
Does your wife know
what's going on?

404
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,861
You're driving yourself crazy.

405
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,429
You need to leave
that family alone.

406
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,702
I'm sorry I've ever
said anything, man.

407
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,739
Just...

408
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:40,741
think about your family.

409
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:48,182
No! No, no, no! Why?

410
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,502
Frank.

411
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:15,810
Frank, stop.

412
00:41:35,763 --> 00:41:38,699
Hi. This is
Detective Muldoon, 45632.

413
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,602
I'm just trying to get a 20
on a Detective Wilson,

414
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:44,005
who also used to work
at the 51.

415
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,643
Yeah. Just one second.

416
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:54,382
All right, ahem.

417
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:57,018
Saint Gideon's.

418
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:59,553
Isn't that
the psychiatric hospital?

419
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,495
All right. Thank you.

420
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,808
Frank.

421
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:02,083
Hi. I'm here to see
Detective Wilson.

422
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:06,287
Down the hall, to the right.

423
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,122
Already restrained.

424
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:52,867
Detective Wilson?

425
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:57,338
I'm Detective Muldoon.

426
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:01,442
The doctor said that she told
you I was gonna come see you.

427
00:44:01,576 --> 00:44:03,545
Did you find my tapes?

428
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:06,046
Uh, your tapes, sir?

429
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,115
Mm.

430
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,561
I came to ask you
some questions

431
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:22,029
about a case that you worked
two years ago.

432
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:27,368
What can you tell me
about the Landers family?

433
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:29,303
It's happening again,
isn't it?

434
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:35,376
Once you step into the place
where they died,

435
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,012
it never lets you go.

436
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,214
This is never gonna end.

437
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,283
What will never end?

438
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,151
That house's grudge.

439
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:51,158
There she is.

440
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:57,731
You went into the Landers'
house, didn't you?

441
00:44:57,865 --> 00:45:02,369
If you haven't started seeing
them yet, don't worry.

442
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:04,772
You will.

443
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,742
Maybe we should
tear our eyes out

444
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:12,012
so that we can't
see them anymore.

445
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:15,015
No!

446
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:16,685
It's the house!

447
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,452
You gotta burn it down!

448
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:20,589
Ahh! Burn it to the ground!

449
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,389
Wait. Kill me.

450
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:24,725
Kill me! Kill me!

451
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:46,380
Guys, he's losing blood fast!

452
00:45:46,514 --> 00:45:49,618
I can still feel them
watching me!

453
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,953
I can still
feel them watching me!

454
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:15,744
<i>I can't stop
thinking about the Landers' murder.</i>

455
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:18,479
<i>What the hell happened
in that house?</i>

456
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:20,281
Who does that
to a 6-year-old girl?

457
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:23,984
Nobody does that to
a 6-year-old girl. A monster.

458
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,819
<i>Now, ever since I went
to that house,</i>

459
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,821
<i>I've been seeing shit.</i>

460
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:30,190
<i>I can't get it out of my head.</i>

461
00:46:30,324 --> 00:46:32,993
<i>There's a case I found
in Japan.</i>

462
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:34,729
<i>At least a dozen
unrelated people</i>

463
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:37,431
<i>killed in the same house
in Tokyo.</i>

464
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:40,769
<i>And I spoke to the detective
over there, this Nakagawa.</i>

465
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:42,637
<i>He thinks a murder
in that house</i>

466
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,838
<i>caused something</i>
<i>called a</i> Ju-On.

467
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:47,642
Something like a curse.

468
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:50,811
<i>Fiona Landers worked
at that same house in Tokyo,</i>

469
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:52,647
<i>and I know this sounds crazy.</i>

470
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:55,816
<i>I think Fiona Landers</i>

471
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:58,819
<i>brought this curse
back with her from Japan.</i>

472
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:00,821
<i>And it made her
kill her family.</i>

473
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:12,066
- Where is he?
- Where do you think?

474
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:28,415
All right, all right. Focus.
Just focus. Just focus.

475
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:32,953
That's what she said
when we started.

476
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:34,355
- Hey.
- When we first started,

477
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,290
it was at the beginning.
I know it was.

478
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:43,531
<i>The Landers, the real
estate agents, that thing in Japan,</i>

479
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:45,232
they're connected,
I'm telling you.

480
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:46,900
You gotta trust me.

481
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:51,506
When was the last time
you ate?

482
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,576
- You look like shit.
- It's the case.

483
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,544
The case is cold.

484
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:58,412
Don't give me that shit.

485
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:00,347
You know something
awful's going on.

486
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,182
I get it.

487
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:03,518
I do.

488
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:08,088
And I wish I knew
how to help you.

489
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:13,427
Just, you know,
take some time off.

490
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:16,564
Spend some time with
the girls.

491
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:18,932
And then maybe it'll stop.

492
00:48:20,502 --> 00:48:22,302
They're never gonna stop.

493
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,272
Never.

494
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,243
It's Fiona Landers.

495
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,746
She's the one
who's been doing this.

496
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:37,719
Let's get out of here.

497
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,895
Come on.

498
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,088
You good?

499
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:17,024
Yeah. Yeah.

500
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:22,129
- Ahh!
- What? Stop it.

501
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:24,965
- Oh, God! Ahh!
- What? Stop it!

502
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:27,702
- No! Stop it! Wilson! Wilson!
- Fucker! No! Stop her!

503
00:51:13,575 --> 00:51:15,743
Fuck.

504
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:16,564
- Oh, Jesus.
- The fuck are you doing?

505
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:18,099
Sam Landers is here.

506
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:20,535
- What are you talking about?
- He's in the building.

507
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:23,571
- Sam Landers is dead.
- Come on. He's on the tape.

508
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,411
Don't you have a kid?

509
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:07,949
Go home.

510
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:10,585
And get some sleep.

511
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,254
You're losing it.

512
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:57,899
Hi. The sitter
canceled on me, so, uh...

513
00:54:58,032 --> 00:55:00,467
I couldn't find anybody
at short notice.

514
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,170
Sit down.

515
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,972
Relax. You can read this.
It's kind of...

516
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:06,974
Oh, no, no, no. Right there.

517
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:16,316
Hey. It's okay. Relax.

518
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,653
The kid and I will find
something to do, okay?

519
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:24,225
- Come on, buddy. Come with me.
- Yeah? Yeah, you can go.

520
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:31,532
Okay.

521
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,167
What do we have here?

522
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,538
I think you can watch this.

523
00:56:32,425 --> 00:56:33,628
Hello?

524
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:41,035
Hello?

525
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:32,753
Hi.

526
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:35,022
Hi. Where are you?

527
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:36,456
I'm still at the house.

528
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,626
What time do you think
you'll be home?

529
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:41,195
Uh, I don't know.

530
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,797
I can't leave her by herself.

531
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,832
<i>Do you think
you should call the police?</i>

532
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:48,135
- What's the matter?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

533
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:49,303
The, uh...

534
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,274
The baby just moved.

535
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,409
How are you feeling
about everything?

536
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,946
<i>I'm sorry.
It's not a good time, I know.</i>

537
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,749
No, no, no, it's okay. Um...

538
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,418
I... I wanna talk about it.

539
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:09,824
Peter, I never wanted
to be a mother.

540
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:15,429
But I love this baby,

541
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:18,666
like, so much more
than I thought I did, and...

542
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,868
I don't know, I...

543
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:23,671
I'm gonna love this baby,
no matter what.

544
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:35,549
Peter, are you there?

545
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:39,220
Yeah, I'm still here.

546
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:45,359
I'm just really, really happy.

547
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:54,335
<i>Was that the doorbell?</i>

548
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:57,638
Uh, let me see who it is.
I'll call you right back, okay?

549
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:01,342
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

550
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:04,478
Yeah, I love you too.

551
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,226
Melinda?

552
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,437
Melinda?

553
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:12,113
Melinda?

554
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:43,043
Melinda, sweetheart,
is that you?

555
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:48,983
Melinda?

556
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:51,385
You okay?

557
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,814
Hi.

558
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:06,487
Hello?

559
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:12,159
Peter.

560
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:20,635
Peter.

561
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:36,283
Peter?

562
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,461
Peter.

563
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,803
Oh, Jesus Christ.

564
01:03:57,706 --> 01:03:59,139
You scared me.

565
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:02,409
The parents finally came home?

566
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:08,849
Hey, what's wrong?

567
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:13,688
What are you doing?

568
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,331
What is wrong with you?

569
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:03,470
Here. You look beautiful.

570
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:08,810
How about some pear?

571
01:05:08,942 --> 01:05:10,043
Hm?

572
01:05:10,177 --> 01:05:11,546
Pear?

573
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,582
Oh, yeah, we like pear,
don't we?

574
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:15,916
Mm.

575
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:18,352
Oh, yeah. This.

576
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,090
How long have you been married?

577
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,760
Fifty years, next month.

578
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:27,762
Oh.

579
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:29,631
Mm.

580
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:31,932
Fifty beautiful years.

581
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:57,491
You're such a good girl.

582
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,993
You're gonna be so happy.

583
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:41,268
Mrs. Matheson.

584
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,749
Mrs. Matheson?

585
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:01,221
Mrs. Matheson.

586
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:07,394
Mrs. Math...

587
01:07:10,999 --> 01:07:13,333
Hey, hey. What's wrong?

588
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,838
What happened?

589
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:18,338
What's the matter?

590
01:07:31,285 --> 01:07:36,824
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I believe...

591
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,660
your house...

592
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,562
is haunted.

593
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:46,233
I thought someone like you...

594
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:49,102
might understand our unique...

595
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:51,906
situation.

596
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:57,210
Wh...? You mean,
you've seen her too?

597
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:58,713
Mm-hm.

598
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:02,416
Seeing them...

599
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:08,288
it gives me hope that maybe
she might be around too.

600
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,390
After it's over.

601
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:17,230
You see, I think,

602
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:19,934
<i>with places like this,</i>

603
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:24,939
<i>it feels like the walls
between this world</i>

604
01:08:25,073 --> 01:08:28,442
<i>and the next
have been torn down.</i>

605
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:33,313
<i>Time acts differently here.</i>

606
01:08:36,183 --> 01:08:39,654
<i>Anyone who has entered here</i>

607
01:08:39,787 --> 01:08:43,791
<i>and anyone who will enter here,</i>

608
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:47,795
<i>we're all bound together.</i>

609
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:50,098
When Faith goes,

610
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,701
this place
will let us stay together.

611
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:57,105
It's the only hope
that we have.

612
01:09:22,096 --> 01:09:23,865
Mr. Matheson?

613
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,607
Mrs. Matheson?

614
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,342
I'm so happy to see you
on your feet.

615
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:39,614
Mrs. Matheson.

616
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,154
Mrs. Matheson.

617
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:53,161
What have you done?
What did you do?

618
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:00,001
He wanted to kill me.

619
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:24,585
How does something
like this even happen?

620
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:39,267
Hey.

621
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:41,401
Did you get any word
on that body we found?

622
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:45,006
- The feds took over last night.
- Wait.

623
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:48,976
What about interviewing
Mrs. Matheson?

624
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,344
There's nothing I could do.

625
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:53,781
What about the house,
did they follow up on that?

626
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:55,482
It doesn't seem like it.

627
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,051
Shit like this always happens

628
01:11:57,185 --> 01:11:58,886
when we turn it over
to the feds.

629
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,387
Don't worry about it.

630
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:02,690
I'm sure they'll send someone
by the next few days.

631
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:04,892
- Next few days?
- Yeah.

632
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:10,698
We found a fucking body
and another one in the house.

633
01:12:10,832 --> 01:12:12,332
How many more
do we have to find?

634
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:15,303
Ah! Jesus, just drop it.

635
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:19,472
It's not our case anymore.
Seriously.

636
01:12:41,262 --> 01:12:44,065
- Good morning, Mrs. Matheson.
- Morning.

637
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:46,334
How you doing,
Mrs. Matheson?

638
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:09,056
Thank you.

639
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:45,893
Oh, my God.
Someone get help!

640
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,295
Go. Go!

641
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:51,933
<i>Hi,
you've reached the Muldoons.</i>

642
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:53,801
<i>We can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

643
01:13:53,935 --> 01:13:57,038
<i>but you can leave us
a message after the beep.</i>

644
01:13:58,506 --> 01:14:00,975
Hey. It's me.

645
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:03,844
<i>I thought you should know
that the hospital called.</i>

646
01:14:03,978 --> 01:14:05,780
<i>Faith Matheson's dead.</i>

647
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:10,751
<i>Okay. Um, call me
when you get this.</i>

648
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:18,993
<i>It's the house!</i>

649
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:21,095
<i>You gotta burn it down!</i>

650
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:22,997
This is never gonna end.

651
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,497
What will never end?

652
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:26,801
That house's grudge.

653
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:29,637
<i>Burn it to the ground!</i>

654
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,826
Burke?

655
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:31,932
<i>Why did he kill them?
Did he say?</i>

656
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:34,468
<i>There's
someone not at rest here.</i>

657
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:36,670
<i>A little girl, I think.</i>

658
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:39,173
<i>I've spent my life
trying to communicate</i>

659
01:15:39,306 --> 01:15:40,875
<i>with people on the other side.</i>

660
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:43,477
<i>And I feel this spirit
so powerfully.</i>

661
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:46,080
<i>He claims it was
for the insurance money.</i>

662
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,094
<i>You will not.</i>

663
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,096
<i>The dead only want
one thing, Bobby.</i>

664
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,765
<i>I know.
To go into the light.</i>

665
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,194
Mom?

666
01:18:13,327 --> 01:18:15,362
Burke?

667
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:16,665
Burke?

668
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:20,467
What's going on?

669
01:18:21,835 --> 01:18:23,037
Baby, come here.

670
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:37,586
Mom?

671
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:41,656
What's wrong?

672
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:45,359
I'm sorry.

673
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:49,196
I'm so sorry.

674
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,206
What do we do
when we're scared?

675
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:08,717
We close our eyes,
and we count to five.

676
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:12,721
- One...
- One...

677
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:15,222
two...

678
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,291
three...

679
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:19,927
four...

680
01:19:21,028 --> 01:19:22,631
five.

681
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:27,602
See? Everything's fine.

682
01:19:35,476 --> 01:19:38,245
- Goodman.
- <i>It's Muldoon.</i>

683
01:19:38,379 --> 01:19:40,147
<i>Can you come over?</i>

684
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:41,849
<i>I need to talk.</i>

685
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:48,989
I didn't know
anyone else to call.

686
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:50,791
This is not
your case.

687
01:19:52,126 --> 01:19:54,328
You have no business
going into this.

688
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:55,697
But I did.

689
01:19:57,064 --> 01:19:59,701
Was this happening
at all...

690
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,503
before
you went to the house?

691
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:03,037
I don't know.

692
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,142
And, uh...

693
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:11,211
now, when I'm closing my eyes,
I can see them.

694
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,283
Whatever happened to Wilson
is happening to me.

695
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:21,989
And I'm scared.

696
01:20:23,424 --> 01:20:26,160
I can't end up like him.

697
01:20:26,293 --> 01:20:28,862
I'm afraid it's gonna
make me hurt my son.

698
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,285
Where are we going?

699
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:55,189
I have to try to stop this.
I need to keep you safe.

700
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,540
Whatever happens, do not
get out of this car, okay?

701
01:21:12,674 --> 01:21:14,542
Do not open this door.

702
01:21:14,676 --> 01:21:15,943
Do you understand?

703
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:17,444
Promise me?

704
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:18,680
I promise.

705
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:20,214
I love you so much.

706
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:38,566
I wanna show you something.

707
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,972
How could you do that?

708
01:22:06,628 --> 01:22:09,163
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

709
01:22:24,445 --> 01:22:25,914
<i>Melinda?</i>

710
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:27,948
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

711
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:56,678
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

712
01:23:22,504 --> 01:23:24,204
Mom?

713
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:25,907
What are you doing?

714
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:31,913
Burke,
I told you to stay in the car.

715
01:23:32,045 --> 01:23:33,882
Mommy, please don't do this.

716
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:35,717
Get back in the car now.

717
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:37,484
I don't
understand.

718
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:40,020
Why are you doing this?
I'm scared.

719
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:46,661
What do we do
when we're scared?

720
01:23:58,472 --> 01:24:01,174
What do we do
when we're scared, Burke?

721
01:24:08,415 --> 01:24:10,585
What do we do
when we're scared?

722
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:18,927
Close our eyes...

723
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,566
...and count to five.

724
01:24:25,633 --> 01:24:26,534
One...

725
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,074
two...

726
01:24:34,207 --> 01:24:35,944
What have you done?

727
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:38,546
- ...three...
- ...three...

728
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,016
I can still feel them
watching me!

729
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:43,183
- ...four...
- ...four...

730
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,563
five.

731
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:31,465
I love you so much.

732
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,791
Burke, bus is here!

733
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,032
Have a good day at school, bud.

734
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,399
Come here.

735
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:42,469
Mommy's gonna be okay.

736
01:26:42,603 --> 01:26:44,471
We're both gonna be okay.

737
01:26:46,507 --> 01:26:48,576
And I love you so much.

738
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:50,310
So much.

739
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,682
I'm going to school, Mom!

740
01:27:20,347 --> 01:27:25,347

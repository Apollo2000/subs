3
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,600
People have been
struggling to recover

4
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:17,637
from a record-breaking
heat wave,

5
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,438
and it just keeps getting worse.

6
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,373
Now, it's floods.

7
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:23,710
Entire towns have
been reduced to ashes.

8
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,311
These fires are now
the most destructive...

9
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:28,613
Deforestation is
rapidly accelerating.

10
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:31,718
Oxygen levels
plummet from deforestation.

11
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,319
Extinction revelers
lost the war today.

12
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:35,722
...as the last tree on Earth

13
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:37,422
was logged in the Amazon.

14
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,524
Large areas of
ocean algae are dying.

15
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,327
Revolution over Europe
now so widespread...

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,930
Fatal respiratory
illness...

17
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,430
Is the biggest
killer in more

18
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:47,466
than 100 countries
across the globe.

19
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,868
Plant life extinct,

20
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,636
food rations oversubscribed...

21
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,337
And supplies are
stretched beyond...

22
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,372
What the local
charities can support.

23
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,608
Overpopulation in
Africa and the Middle East

24
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:58,044
now catastrophic.

25
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,746
Reports of oxygen
content dropping.

26
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,346
Synthetic oxygen supplies

27
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,281
buckle under demand
as the UN disbands.

28
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,684
Thousands suffocate in...

29
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,418
And now,
Canada has gone dark.

30
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,687
We've lost India.

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,921
After losing
Belgium...

32
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:10,355
Germany is offline.

33
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:11,958
China now completely dark.

34
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,558
In all of the
Middle East since January...

35
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,961
O2 supplies
dangerously low as...

36
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:16,796
As survivors flood
to the last...

37
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,664
...the last city
not in darkness.

38
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:45,624
Emergency reroute required.

39
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,594
90 seconds until
nuclear core overload.

40
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:01,674
You down the hall tonight?

41
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:05,011
Why? You going to grace us
with your presence?

42
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:12,985
Fill up both.
See if she'll hold.

43
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,755
Danger.
Evacuate utility tunnel.

44
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:19,491
Yeah. She'll hold.
And hell no, I'm not going.

45
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:20,993
Oh, come on, man.

46
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:23,930
There'll be booze
and small talk.

47
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,731
Not for all the oxygen
in the world.

48
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,633
Hey.

49
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,936
Hanging around a bunch
of lowlife foggers.

50
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,972
Lowlife foggers
have feelings too.

51
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,674
Alright. Light it up.

52
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:41,147
30 seconds until overload.

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,115
Evacuation incomplete.

54
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:47,086
Utility tunnel locking down.

55
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,120
Sealed.

56
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:50,388
Depressurization imminent.

57
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,958
You know, you might even
find yourself a wife there

58
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,727
one of these nights.

59
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,561
Another mouth to feed,
great plan.

60
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:57,997
How the hell am I going to
have time for a wife

61
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,701
when I'm stuck down here
wiping your ass every day?

62
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,904
- Right here.
- ...5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

63
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:06,672
Light it up, baby.

64
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,708
Ah!

65
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,443
Power reroute complete.

66
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:12,979
System stabilized.

67
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:22,688
Workers, form an orderly line.

68
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:26,659
A reminder that oxygen credits
are not transferable.

69
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,460
ChroniCorp... Breathe easy.

70
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:29,962
Uh, I can't, uh,
do my shift tomorrow,

71
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,163
but it's not a problem.
Uh...

72
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:33,431
- I'll take it.
- I can make it up.

73
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,500
No. It's not my fault
you don't want to get paid.

74
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:39,038
- I'll take his shift.
- We're ahead, boss.

75
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,674
Fine. You're in. He's out.

76
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,508
Permanently.

77
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,745
What? No, no. Hey, hey.

78
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,079
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

79
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:48,814
It's more money in the pocket.

80
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,517
O2 is currently at 3.3%.

81
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,552
Come on. Let's go.

82
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,656
Where the hell is he?

83
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,057
Hey, man.

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,060
Georgie, I need the money
tomorrow.

85
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,495
He owes me money for that.

86
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,463
Hey, Jerry.
How you doing?

87
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:07,833
There's no fire without oxygen.
There's no fire without oxygen.

88
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,201
Yeah.
You got any smart ideas?

89
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:10,602
- Get out of here.
- There's no fire without oxygen.

90
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:12,138
- Get out of here.
- Hey.

91
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:13,806
- Why don't you just leave it?
- No. You listen to me.

92
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,908
- There's no fire without oxygen.
- It's always something.

93
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,953
...for generations to come.

94
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,754
Hey. No, listen.

95
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,791
We have to sacrifice it all
for the generations to...

96
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:37,697
Oxygen is not a privilege.

97
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,700
You're not listening,
and I will make you listen.

98
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,601
- Okay. Alright.
- I need my job.

99
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,972
- Get off me.
- My kids got the sickness too.

100
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,940
- I will make you listen.
- What do you want me to do?

101
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,042
- We all need to...
- Listen to me.

102
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:54,880
You know that oxygen
is not a privilege.

103
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,533
Another suicide protest today

104
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,602
marked the anniversary
of the death

105
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,840
of the last
living plant in captivity.

106
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:23,275
Since the believed extinction
of plant life,

107
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,178
deaths have continued
to spiral out of control

108
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:29,949
due to biophysical rejections
of the synthetic oxygen

109
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:33,119
that humanity
has come to rely on.

110
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,955
As the leading distributor
of synthetic O2,

111
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:38,590
ChroniCorp is still committed
to finding a solution

112
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:42,328
to this oxygen crisis that the
world has termed The Sickness.

113
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,931
However, citizens continue
to revolt amid fears

114
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,934
that this may be the end
for humankind.

115
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:51,670
ChroniCorp's quantum physicist
Dr. Richard Whyte

116
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:54,874
once radically posed that
in the unlikely event

117
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:57,043
that humanity
survives this crisis,

118
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,678
could we somehow find a solution

119
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,148
from our descendants
in the future?

120
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,581
Some suggest that his death

121
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:06,185
some 20 years ago
is linked to...

122
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,976
- Oh, my...
- Hi.

123
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,712
Hi.

124
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:36,715
Did I just hear your dad's name?

125
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,384
I got something for you.

126
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,685
Oh?

127
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,155
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

128
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,957
- Are they closed?
- Yes.

129
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,960
- Alright. Keep them closed.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,662
Keep them closed.

131
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,730
Okay. Okay.

132
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,299
Open.

133
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:56,869
What did you do this time?

134
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,972
See, um, the strap is loose
on the other one, and I...

135
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,108
I... I still have to seal it,
and, well,

136
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:04,176
this one is compatible
with the high-grade O2.

137
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,945
I don't need that.

138
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:08,914
Okay. It's fine.
I-I-I got a new shift.

139
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:40,079
But this is fashion.

140
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:41,280
It looks great.

141
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,415
Yeah, it does.

142
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:44,984
Really?

143
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:46,719
Oh. What?

144
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,053
Don't you want to look
pretty too?

145
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,722
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

146
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,857
Don't... Don't start this again.
Remember what they said.

147
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,225
- You need to calm down.
- Okay.

148
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,728
You need... you... you...
you need to relax.

149
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:58,297
Shit.

150
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,466
Are you okay?

151
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,002
- Sorry.
- J-Just give it to me.

152
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,905
It's fine.

153
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,007
- Please.
- It's fine.

154
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,709
Shit.

155
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,932
Citizen number 34465?

156
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,037
We've been instructed
to bring you upstairs.

157
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,005
We've got clearance
to be down here.

158
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:43,943
He doesn't like to be touched.

159
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:45,477
He'll go if I go.

160
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,248
Let's just see
what they've got to say.

161
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:50,482
Come on.

162
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:55,754
Greetings, citizen.

163
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:59,091
Welcome to the Applied Sciences
Division of ChroniCorp.

164
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:01,260
ChroniCorp is proud to be
the largest supplier

165
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,929
of breathable air
to the people of the world.

166
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,031
ChroniCorp... Breathe easy.

167
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,401
Greetings, citizen.

168
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:12,938
Welcome to the Applied Sciences
Division of ChroniCorp.

169
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,107
ChroniCorp is proud to be
the largest supplier

170
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,276
of breathable air
to the people of the world.

171
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,324
Even the fires
burn themselves out.

172
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,863
They can't breathe, either.

173
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,571
My name is Regina Jackson.

174
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,007
I'm the CTO of
Particle Research.

175
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:55,080
And you're Ethan Whyte.

176
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,049
Um, yes, ma'am.

177
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:03,022
How's your wife?
Our records show...

178
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:04,556
I'm looking after her.

179
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,896
We've all accepted
that things today

180
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,466
are even worse
than what scientists predicted.

181
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,170
The fact is
the O2 rejection epidemic

182
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:21,140
is going to wipe out the human
race within a handful of years.

183
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,875
I appreciate you bringing us
up here, but...

184
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:24,310
but what exactly
are you offering?

185
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:27,079
What if I told you that
you could save all of us?

186
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:35,554
I-I'd hate to seem like
I don't appreciate

187
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:37,089
this show-and-tell,
but I think we should go.

188
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,525
Your security
has been upgraded.

189
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:41,260
You'll be briefed at the lab.

190
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,206
Welcome to our Hail Mary.

191
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,974
Meet the Chronicle.

192
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:04,183
Billy Mitchell.

193
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:07,886
An absolute honor
to meet you, Ethan.

194
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,421
So you're the one.

195
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,225
Interesting.

196
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,502
Ethan, do you know
what your father did here?

197
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,280
Alright.

198
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,049
3 minutes, 10 seconds.

199
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:39,084
Calibration is within tolerance.

200
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:44,323
It's taken us 20 years.

201
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:48,961
If only your father
could see this.

202
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:52,398
My father's not here, is he?

203
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:56,201
Right. Of course. I'm sorry.

204
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,437
During our first trial,
we tested the Chronicle

205
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,407
with something that wouldn't
take as much power as matter...

206
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,143
radio waves to act
like a sort of ping

207
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,145
to see what was
on the other side.

208
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:08,380
The radio waves bounced back,

209
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:10,082
but they had been changed.

210
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,184
There was something
encoded inside.

211
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:15,087
Bounced back, what?
What do you mean, bounced back?

212
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,388
From where?

213
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:19,057
Not where, when.

214
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,228
We received a message
from the future.

215
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,397
From the future?

216
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,399
This is a fucking time machine?

217
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,637
407 years into the future.

218
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,006
400 years?

219
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,042
You're telling me people
are still alive then?

220
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,611
The message was simple, Ethan.

221
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:44,049
Red, decode
Chronicle file 170681.

222
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:45,584
Up here.

223
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:06,338
The people
who sent the message

224
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,106
must have found a cure
for the O2 sickness.

225
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,608
It's impossible.

226
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,376
There's no other way
they could still be alive

227
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,712
that far in the future.

228
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:15,347
We think they want to give
the cure to us

229
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,017
so that we could
save more people here.

230
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:20,687
Why ask for me?

231
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,656
We don't exactly know why,

232
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,759
but we may only get one shot
at sending someone.

233
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,596
One shot?

234
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,532
The Chronicle feeds off the
nuclear reactor under the city.

235
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:37,469
Just to fire a clock
a few minutes through time

236
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,239
knocks large sections
of the city off the grid.

237
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:42,775
To fire the mass
of a human that far?

238
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,344
Let's just say I hope we
don't have to try this twice.

239
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:49,381
Why do I get the feeling
that there's a catch?

240
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:55,722
Ethan, we don't know yet
how to bring you back.

241
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,594
You want to shoot me
into oblivion with...

242
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,263
with no way to get home?

243
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,298
You have to find
the people who sent the message.

244
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:08,567
They can help you get back.

245
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,738
You have got to find the cure.

246
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:14,373
You may be humanity's
only chance.

247
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,811
You may be your wife's
only chance.

248
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:29,154
Beautiful, crisp,
clean air, all you can breathe,

249
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,623
only $20 an hour.

250
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,730
Have you ever seen
anything like that shit before?

251
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:41,300
- Two more.
- It's all very impressive.

252
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,637
I'm not leaving Xanthe
as a favor to those ghouls.

253
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:52,311
Use it.

254
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:57,416
He's buying.

255
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:02,287
Ah. Alright. Alright.

256
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:08,661
What's the matter
with you?

257
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:10,596
What?

258
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,499
Do you... do you really believe
I'm going to save the world?

259
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,769
Very romantic.

260
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:20,272
You need to take this seriously.

261
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:21,573
Your old man believed them.

262
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,876
My old man was a fool
and a liar.

263
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,819
What if there's more
to his story, Ethan?

264
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:37,322
Story?

265
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,891
You want to hear more?

266
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:47,165
A father leaves a suicide note
for his 8-year-old son.

267
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,302
If he'd just been there instead
of chasing fucking rainbows,

268
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:53,605
my mother would
still be alive.

269
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,341
Very heroic,

270
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,610
and as if this wasn't enough
of a reminder of that,

271
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,379
you want me to do what?

272
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,850
Follow in his footsteps
to leave my sick wife to die?

273
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,895
I remember when I brought you
down in the tunnels

274
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,664
for the first time.

275
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,803
You were so scared
of just being left alone.

276
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,537
Remember what I told you?

277
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,308
"Without the darkness,
there's no light."

278
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,779
Stupid saying.

279
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:35,313
Fuck you.

280
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,349
Listen, shithead.

281
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,852
I've been through hell
and back in this life.

282
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:43,488
I've lost my family,
damn near lost my mind.

283
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,857
I've been working in
those fucking tunnels

284
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:46,291
for as long as I can remember,

285
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,628
and the only thing
I know that works

286
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:52,364
is when we fight for ourselves,
protect what's ours.

287
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,266
I can protect Xanthe.

288
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,270
I'm not just going
to abandon her.

289
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:00,539
And what are you going to do
when she gets worse?

290
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,479
This ain't about
saving the world, bro.

291
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:14,987
You want to prove
that you're not like him?

292
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:16,723
Save her.

293
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,001
He's been waiting for you
all day.

294
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,514
I made this for you,
Ethy,

295
00:19:15,547 --> 00:19:17,884
because I have it
on good authority

296
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:22,454
that you are going to grow up
to be someone very important.

297
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:25,057
A science man?

298
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,793
A science man.

299
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:37,036
Now, this is going to hurt
a little,

300
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:41,540
but it will help you become
who you are meant to be.

301
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:46,378
Now, one day you'll understand.

302
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:49,115
You will want to trust what you
can see with your own eyes,

303
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:54,352
but it won't be enough, and you
will need to make a choice

304
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,690
about whether you believe
in something bigger.

305
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,828
Believe in what?

306
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:06,732
Believe in people.

307
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:38,563
I'm sorry, Ethy.
You're done.

308
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:42,601
It won't come off.

309
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:44,402
What's wrong with you?

310
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:47,173
Papa...

311
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,574
Don't you dare
leave us again.

312
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,389
When?

313
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:10,730
I'm not leaving you to chase
some stupid fantasy.

314
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:13,766
You think a second chance
is a fantasy?

315
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,501
How could you say that?

316
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,004
Fucking scientists.

317
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:19,939
Do you think your tool kit
is important right now?

318
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,606
My tools need to be clean.

319
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,642
Look at me.

320
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,810
I have responsibilities here.

321
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:26,045
I need to meet my shifts.

322
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,545
We're... We're so close

323
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,115
to having enough for
the high-grade O2.

324
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:30,615
That could help you.

325
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,817
It could slow down the symptoms.

326
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:35,054
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

327
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,657
What?

328
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,092
You can say that you're afraid,

329
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,895
but don't you dare use me
as an excuse.

330
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:45,530
You're better than that, Ethan.

331
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:47,532
What?

332
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:49,534
What are you talking about?

333
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,870
You're everything to me.

334
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:53,906
I-I can look after you.
I can help you.

335
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,777
I-I can make more money.
I can make you okay.

336
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,577
Who's to say that time
is anything

337
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,579
we should mess with anyway?
What if I can't change anything?

338
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,915
Who's to say that we can't?

339
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:05,517
Okay. What if I could?

340
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,486
What if I mess with something,
and it makes everything worse?

341
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,928
I can't believe what I'm hearing
right now.

342
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:18,965
No. I'm not going to risk
losing you.

343
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:20,598
You can't lose me.

344
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,534
Of course I can.

345
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,772
You've got to have faith, Eth,

346
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:29,574
that you can be bigger.

347
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,213
Faith isn't going
to protect you.

348
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,685
Now is not the time to have
your tail between your legs.

349
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:44,023
We're a team.

350
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,958
Why aren't you on my side?

351
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:52,031
Last year, I had
20 kids in my class.

352
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:53,866
This year, I have 12.

353
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,005
I saw three of them suffocate
right in front of me.

354
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:04,944
You're the only one
I care about.

355
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:09,547
I wouldn't be with you
if I thought that was true.

356
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:18,057
I'm afraid too, Ethan.

357
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,327
I know that you'll come back
to me.

358
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,295
I believe in you.

359
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,273
Papa!

360
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:10,743
Fuck.

361
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:13,112
Papa...

362
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,756
Your father is not here.

363
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:42,101
I don't care if I can only find
one dose of this cure.

364
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:46,138
Xanthe gets the first one,
or I'm not going.

365
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:48,474
You need me.

366
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,476
Okay, Ethan.

367
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,211
We have a deal.

368
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:58,350
These aren't just
space suits, Ethan.

369
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:00,786
These are my babies.

370
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:03,189
Fenrir is not quite ready,

371
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:07,426
but, Tyr, she'll get you there.

372
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:09,061
She'll protect you.

373
00:26:09,094 --> 00:26:10,362
The Chronicle, at this time,

374
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:12,364
can't tether to itself
in the future.

375
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:15,334
There's something wrong
at the other end.

376
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,936
What the hell does that mean?

377
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:20,239
It means we're going to
have to throw you there.

378
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:21,840
Throw me there?

379
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,042
Without being tethered
at the other end,

380
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:25,878
there's a chance you could land

381
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:27,980
inside a mountain
or the ocean, so...

382
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:31,150
You've got to be kidding me.

383
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:33,185
We have to aim a little higher.

384
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,157
We'll land you as close
as we can

385
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,126
to the source
of the radio waves.

386
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,928
You just find the people.

387
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:46,365
Track them down and bring
the cure back home to us.

388
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,501
Sounds easy.

389
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:52,304
This may be humankind's
most critical journey.

390
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:56,742
I'm counting on you to find
a way back, Ethan.

391
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:04,917
Okay.

392
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,553
One more time, focus.

393
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,288
Who's this?

394
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:10,889
- Archie.
- Yeah.

395
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,458
What does Archie do?

396
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:17,029
Um, systems analysis,
navigation, communication.

397
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:18,130
Yeah. That's right.

398
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:20,032
Archie is your only friend,

399
00:27:20,065 --> 00:27:21,900
so treat her well.

400
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:25,170
The suit will feed your vitals
back to us from Archie,

401
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,072
so we're going
to know you're safe.

402
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:30,542
We'll be watching.

403
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,444
Hold your breath.

404
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:35,547
Look at me.

405
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,082
Do not let go.

406
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:46,325
Timing quantum forward.

407
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,137
Look after her.

408
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,872
Only till you get back.

409
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:14,320
See you soon, brother.

410
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,090
Go bring back the light.

411
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:33,872
Ignition in 20, 19, 18, 17,

412
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:40,245
16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11,

413
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,450
10, 9, 8, 7,

414
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:51,190
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

415
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:01,033
Ethan.

416
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:10,783
Hello.

417
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:19,524
Come on.

418
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:21,526
Ethan Whyte. Come in!

419
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,363
Ethan Whyte to base. Come in!

420
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:32,437
- Archie?
- Hello, Ethan.

421
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:34,807
Archie, where are we?

422
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:37,542
Let me find a satellite.

423
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,946
Satellite link failed.

424
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:43,448
Location unknown.

425
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,417
Searching. Searching.

426
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,619
Satellite link failed.

427
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:51,256
Archie,
geography magnetics, go.

428
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:58,765
I have detected a structure.

429
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:00,867
It's not far.

430
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,601
Follow me.

431
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,423
Fuck.

432
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,702
Am I going to die here?

433
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,728
Fuck you.

434
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,103
Archie?

435
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:52,872
I'm here, Ethan.

436
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:58,878
Why are there two of me
here at once?

437
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:01,914
I don't think this is
a second you, Ethan.

438
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:05,084
I think this is you.

439
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:10,555
So I'm dead and alive
at the same time?

440
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,759
Even I have trouble
with time travel, Ethan.

441
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:18,631
Very helpful, thanks.

442
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:20,365
My pleasure.

443
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,602
Archie?

444
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:32,171
Yes, Ethan?

445
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,009
Status.

446
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:40,713
Nuclear cell at 2%,
display offline.

447
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,050
Replay last recording.

448
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,719
Am I going to die here?

449
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:48,054
Maybe it's better this way.

450
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:49,789
No one is suffering anymore.

451
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:51,724
What did you have to sacrifice?

452
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:53,826
I am your family.

453
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:57,096
you.

454
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:02,068
Ah, please!

455
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,769
Please!

456
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,939
No, no!

457
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:11,877
Power failure.

458
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,746
Shutting down. Goodbye.

459
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:14,914
No, no, no, no!

460
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:17,216
Archie! Archie!

461
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,591
Diagnose.

462
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:01,027
Signal found.

463
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,962
It's an emergency beacon.

464
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:04,864
We should make contact.

465
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,332
Follow me.

466
00:40:51,377 --> 00:40:53,112
Hello?

467
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:08,227
Hello?

468
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,229
Rub the sticks together.

469
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,831
Friction makes fire.

470
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:15,000
Easy, peasy.

471
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:16,836
Rub. Rub.

472
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,104
Easy, peasy.

473
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:19,705
- Easy, peasy.
- Easy, peasy.

474
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:20,806
Easy, peasy.

475
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,043
Fire takes time, Ethan.

476
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:25,044
Come on.

477
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:27,213
Rub, rub, rub.

478
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:29,014
Even I have trouble with fire.

479
00:41:29,048 --> 00:41:31,350
Come on!

480
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:32,918
Keep at it!

481
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:34,420
- Easy, peasy.
- Ugh!

482
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,155
Rub, rub, rub!

483
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,256
- Ugh!
- Good.

484
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,791
Now blow.

485
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:40,893
Blow, blow, blow, blow.

486
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,841
Fire!

487
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,082
Easy, peasy.

488
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:24,303
Unidentified.

489
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,872
Gee, thanks.

490
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,956
Ugh.

491
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,462
Scanning.

492
00:42:50,496 --> 00:42:52,164
Scanning.

493
00:42:52,198 --> 00:42:54,500
Star formations synchronized.

494
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,803
Date... 2474 AD.

495
00:43:12,518 --> 00:43:14,286
Stars.

496
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:19,525
Stars.

497
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:21,994
Stars.

498
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,365
How are we like stars?

499
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,100
That's silly.

500
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:34,073
Okay.

501
00:43:34,106 --> 00:43:36,809
Try this.

502
00:43:40,512 --> 00:43:42,414
So you see, Ethy,

503
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:44,516
I will never
let anything happen to you.

504
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:12,978
Fuck you!

505
00:44:13,012 --> 00:44:14,980
Fuck you!

506
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:32,998
Ah!

507
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:18,210
No, wait. Ethan, please.

508
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:20,045
You're not real!
You're not real!

509
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,580
You're not real!

510
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:24,016
Ethan, you're hallucinating.

511
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:26,285
What the... What the hell?

512
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,455
You poisoned yourself

513
00:45:29,488 --> 00:45:32,157
because of the gallberries.

514
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:48,207
Jude?

515
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:54,446
You're going to be okay, kid,
as long as you do what I say.

516
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:59,385
Right away, we knew
something was wrong.

517
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:01,620
We could see your pulse
echoing back.

518
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:04,691
Then your blood-toxicity
level spiked.

519
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:06,693
Poison.

520
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:09,128
Your heart stopped.

521
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:11,029
You know, I watched you die,
Ethan.

522
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:17,436
I'm not dead.

523
00:46:20,472 --> 00:46:22,408
Am I?

524
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:24,143
I don't think so.

525
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:29,181
But Billy said he had
just enough power

526
00:46:29,214 --> 00:46:33,252
to fire the Chronicle
one last time.

527
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:36,121
I grabbed a second suit.

528
00:46:36,155 --> 00:46:38,991
Couldn't leave you down here
all by your lonesome.

529
00:46:39,024 --> 00:46:41,326
I told him I could
bring you back.

530
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:47,566
You came for me.

531
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:53,305
I hit the ground
like a ton of bricks.

532
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:57,009
Everything was destroyed...
my suit, everything.

533
00:46:57,042 --> 00:47:01,079
I'm just happy to be alive, man,
happy to see your ugly mug,

534
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:03,182
happy to be breathing
without a fucking mask.

535
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:04,950
Xanthe?

536
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,022
Man, she needs you.

537
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:15,260
There's a problem.

538
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:23,101
What the hell is this?

539
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:27,172
I thought you saved me,
but I'm still dead.

540
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:30,743
No.

541
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:35,347
No. This isn't right.
I mean, this isn't you.

542
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,685
I thought you said
I was poisoned.

543
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:41,487
You were.

544
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,255
I mean, we changed that.

545
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,192
Didn't we?

546
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,368
Something is very wrong.

547
00:47:56,401 --> 00:47:58,738
You think?

548
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:02,074
Listen, was there
anything else here?

549
00:48:02,107 --> 00:48:06,178
Like... like what?

550
00:48:06,211 --> 00:48:07,379
A gun?

551
00:48:10,582 --> 00:48:14,486
I'd say whoever left that hole
in my head took off with it.

552
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,289
Listen, this fucking
bag of bones is not you.

553
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,328
Been eating berries again, huh?

554
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:37,075
Well, whoever sent for me,
for them to survive

555
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:40,279
this long to regrow this place,

556
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:43,215
they must have found a cure.

557
00:48:43,248 --> 00:48:45,584
If I don't find them in time,
Xanthe's...

558
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:49,254
- Well, let's find them.
- Yeah.

559
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:51,691
We were sent here for a reason.

560
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,832
Now we follow the bread crumbs.

561
00:49:09,842 --> 00:49:14,346
Emergency beacon
saturation 98%.

562
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:16,049
We're close.

563
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:31,698
Ready?

564
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:34,734
Let's see if anyone's home.

565
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:36,636
I got your back.

566
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,766
Hello?

567
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:48,540
Careful.

568
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:50,275
Hello?

569
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:56,348
Ethan!

570
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:57,917
Hey, stick with me, Jude.

571
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,436
I can't see shit.

572
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:00,847
Activate what?

573
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,331
Ah!

574
00:52:19,364 --> 00:52:21,299
Shit!

575
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,638
Come out!

576
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:39,852
Access?

577
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,539
Not possible.

578
00:53:00,572 --> 00:53:02,474
Hello, GRID One.

579
00:53:02,507 --> 00:53:03,575
Hail Mary, brother.

580
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:07,747
Hello, relegating 1,270.

581
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,651
Ethan Whyte, DNA identity
confirmed.

582
00:53:11,684 --> 00:53:13,786
Chronicle access granted.

583
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,656
Portal priming sequence
commencing.

584
00:53:16,689 --> 00:53:20,059
Countdown commencing.

585
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:23,062
Four hours to
portal activation.

586
00:53:23,095 --> 00:53:25,631
Destination 2067 AD.

587
00:53:25,665 --> 00:53:28,067
Ethan.

588
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,669
Ethan, if this puppy
still works,

589
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:31,436
we can use it to get home.

590
00:53:33,973 --> 00:53:35,708
Where are the people?

591
00:53:37,977 --> 00:53:39,712
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

592
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:46,118
This doesn't make sense.

593
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:47,753
This is all wrong.

594
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:52,992
I'm just looking at
what's in front of me, man,

595
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,593
and I see a lifeboat.

596
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:56,394
I thought when you saved me
from the poison

597
00:53:56,428 --> 00:53:57,562
that it changed
the course of everything.

598
00:53:57,596 --> 00:54:00,833
Obviously, it changed nothing.

599
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:03,602
What does that mean?

600
00:54:03,636 --> 00:54:06,172
It means there's something
bigger at play.

601
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,140
When this thing
scanned my blood,

602
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:09,842
the light, it's been
red my whole life.

603
00:54:09,876 --> 00:54:12,111
It just changed to green.

604
00:54:12,144 --> 00:54:15,681
This one, from the skeleton,
it was already green.

605
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:17,183
So what?

606
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,618
It means the dead me
has been through this before.

607
00:54:19,652 --> 00:54:22,420
- The dead you?
- Every step I'm taking, he took.

608
00:54:22,454 --> 00:54:23,455
Are you listening to yourself?

609
00:54:23,488 --> 00:54:24,991
How is that possible?

610
00:54:25,024 --> 00:54:26,659
It's like he's my future.
It's like I'm becoming him.

611
00:54:26,692 --> 00:54:30,129
It's not possible!

612
00:54:30,162 --> 00:54:32,497
You got to bring it down,
brother.

613
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,066
You're losing your mind, man.

614
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:41,707
- Grid?
- Yes, Ethan?

615
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:43,976
Does this thing give me access
to the Chronicle's data backup?

616
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,610
Yes, Ethan.

617
00:54:45,645 --> 00:54:47,980
Decode the system logs.

618
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:56,923
Chronicle log number one...

619
00:54:56,956 --> 00:54:58,958
We are at the beginning
of a journey

620
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:02,962
that could change everything.

621
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:04,797
My name is
Professor Richard Whyte,

622
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,833
and I'm the lead physicist
of the Chronicle Project.

623
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:10,670
We have discovered an anomaly
in the Higgs field,

624
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:12,972
which might soon allow us
to send radio waves

625
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,641
and eventually matter
through time.

626
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:17,176
Stop!

627
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:23,649
What makes you think
you're going to find

628
00:55:23,683 --> 00:55:26,118
what you're looking for?

629
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:28,486
I have to.

630
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,022
No, you don't.

631
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:35,828
We have buried an atmospheric
monitoring station.

632
00:55:35,861 --> 00:55:37,196
It will continue to operate,

633
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:38,831
and if it reaches a time
in the future

634
00:55:38,864 --> 00:55:40,633
when the air is breathable,

635
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:43,936
it will send this data back
to us through the Chronicle.

636
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:46,806
Our hope is that the Chronicle
will help us learn

637
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,542
from our descendants how they
replenished the O2 levels.

638
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:52,244
Enough.

639
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:55,815
This is going to hurt
more than it helps.

640
00:55:55,848 --> 00:55:58,784
I can't run from him forever.

641
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:00,585
Please.

642
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:06,993
Log 97.

643
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:09,228
Bring your A game, people.

644
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:10,997
Prep the countdown.

645
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,644
Our entire lives have led
to this moment.

646
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:28,881
We are preparing
subject number one,

647
00:56:28,914 --> 00:56:30,716
the radio-wave packet
that will ping

648
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,584
the Chronicle in the future.

649
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:34,086
If it works,

650
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,822
we should get an echo
with data on the O2 levels.

651
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:42,895
Firing ping in 3, 2, 1.

652
00:56:52,004 --> 00:56:53,272
Echo received.

653
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:54,807
Ping returned.

654
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,944
Date... 2474 AD.

655
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:04,850
It works!

656
00:57:04,884 --> 00:57:07,053
Ping data decoded.

657
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:10,689
Data has been manually
overridden at destination.

658
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:14,994
English words encoded
in transmission.

659
00:57:15,027 --> 00:57:16,929
English? What?

660
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:34,213
Jesus.

661
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:45,891
What in God's name?

662
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:49,328
I didn't do this.

663
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:52,198
How is this possible?

664
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:54,333
You need to make this work.

665
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:57,236
It is working.

666
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:58,938
Someone is calling for my son.

667
00:57:58,971 --> 00:58:02,007
How the fuck do they know
about your son?

668
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,409
I can't explain this.

669
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:05,878
Don't tell me that.

670
00:58:05,911 --> 00:58:07,780
We all have families.

671
00:58:07,813 --> 00:58:09,782
It is working.

672
00:58:09,815 --> 00:58:11,016
Someone sent us this message.

673
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,152
There is someone
at the other end.

674
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:18,023
So we move to the next phase.

675
00:58:18,057 --> 00:58:20,259
How long before we can test
sending matter?

676
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,695
We can't.

677
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:23,963
Speak.

678
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:26,398
There's a problem with the power
at 2474.

679
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:32,238
Warning, nuclear core
power failure.

680
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:35,007
Warning,
Chronicle systems offline.

681
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,775
Archie, diagnose.

682
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:40,212
Nuclear core,
cold-fusion power feed corrupt.

683
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:41,914
What does that mean?

684
00:58:41,947 --> 00:58:45,351
The portal will not
tether to 2067, Ethan.

685
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:46,986
There is not enough power.

686
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:48,454
Archie, where is the failure?

687
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:50,856
Searching.
Searching.

688
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,458
Nuclear core control room,

689
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:55,828
access via service tunnel
section seven.

690
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:58,197
- Grid?
- Yes, Jude Mathers?

691
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,032
Why hasn't
the countdown stopped?

692
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:03,035
Jude Mathers,
the Chronicle priming sequence

693
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:05,304
has commenced
and cannot be stopped.

694
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:08,707
The system would reach
unstable particle levels.

695
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:10,075
Define unstable.

696
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:12,011
If the power feed
is not reconnected

697
00:59:12,044 --> 00:59:14,280
before the countdown
reaches zero,

698
00:59:14,313 --> 00:59:16,382
the charged particles
in the Chronicle

699
00:59:16,415 --> 00:59:19,752
will create a nuclear explosion.

700
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:22,154
Nuclear explosion
doesn't sound good.

701
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:24,857
Let's not die today, Eth.

702
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,425
Wait.

703
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:30,763
If they received this message
all that time ago,

704
00:59:30,796 --> 00:59:32,364
they knew about
the power failure.

705
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:35,034
Grid, if we fix
the Chronicle's power,

706
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:38,103
how long will portal stay open
before the nuclear core drains?

707
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:40,339
Once the countdown
reaches zero,

708
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:45,978
the portal will tether to 2067
for approximately 30 seconds.

709
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,416
Eth, it's going to take us
hours to get down to the core.

710
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:52,151
We got to gun it there now.

711
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,789
Jesus Christ.

712
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:59,892
Did you not see what I just saw?

713
00:59:59,925 --> 01:00:03,329
Someone sent that message
from here!

714
01:00:03,362 --> 01:00:04,897
That... That means
they fixed this place.

715
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,365
That means they have a cure!

716
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:08,000
They can help me fix Xanthe.

717
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,403
Yeah, whoever sent the message,
they're not here.

718
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:15,441
Why didn't they tell us
about the power failure?

719
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:17,176
Why did they send you?

720
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,814
What?

721
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:23,215
I came to save you,

722
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:26,385
stab antitoxin
in your dead body.

723
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:29,288
But why not send a soldier or...
or a medic?

724
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:34,793
Well, who else is going to
damn near kill themselves

725
01:00:34,827 --> 01:00:37,129
to save your thankless ass?

726
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:38,530
Listen, man.
You were right.

727
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:40,966
We can't save everyone,
but I can save you.

728
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,501
- Let's go.
- No. No.

729
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:45,070
I was wrong.
I need to figure this out.

730
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:50,075
We've got one shot at fixing
this thing.

731
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:54,213
One shot, Ethan.

732
01:00:54,246 --> 01:00:58,183
I can't do it without you,
brother, so let's take control.

733
01:00:58,217 --> 01:01:00,119
We've got to take control,
little brother.

734
01:01:00,152 --> 01:01:01,854
I need... I need more time.

735
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:06,091
So don't you want to see
Xanthe again?

736
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:07,459
Don't use her like that.

737
01:01:07,493 --> 01:01:09,495
I'm not going to let you
get yourself killed.

738
01:01:09,528 --> 01:01:11,163
Get off me.

739
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:19,338
Please, wake up, kid.

740
01:01:21,006 --> 01:01:25,577
I mean, I have never
let you down,

741
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:29,181
so don't let me down now.

742
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:33,085
3 hours, 50 minutes
to nuclear explosion.

743
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:37,923
Okay. Okay.

744
01:01:37,956 --> 01:01:41,560
Okay, whoever sent the message,
they're not here.

745
01:01:41,593 --> 01:01:44,129
Now we just need to make our
way down to the access tunnel.

746
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:45,531
We need to turn the power on,

747
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:49,368
and then we'll have enough
time to find them.

748
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:51,603
3 hours, 50 minutes,
tick tock.

749
01:02:06,618 --> 01:02:10,422
The city should be right here.

750
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:24,490
They never found a way
to survive.

751
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:29,261
The Earth just waited
for us to die.

752
01:05:06,498 --> 01:05:08,668
Eth,
where have you taken us?

753
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:10,402
'Cause this ain't the way.

754
01:06:10,362 --> 01:06:14,132
They just died
here in the classroom,

755
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:15,400
just sitting here.

756
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,639
Everything just got worse.

757
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:26,646
They didn't even
remove the dead.

758
01:06:29,882 --> 01:06:32,217
Does this mean that we failed?

759
01:06:38,423 --> 01:06:42,494
Eth.

760
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:47,232
Eth.

761
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:48,600
Eth, don't.

762
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:50,335
Ethan.

763
01:07:08,788 --> 01:07:10,489
Xanthe.

764
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:17,730
It's okay, buddy.

765
01:07:34,246 --> 01:07:35,882
Don't you dare leave again.

766
01:07:41,286 --> 01:07:43,622
Richard, where are you?

767
01:07:43,656 --> 01:07:46,391
What have you done to him?

768
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:48,928
No. What? No.
I don't... I...

769
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:50,362
No. I don't understand.

770
01:07:50,395 --> 01:07:52,899
You're going to have to tell him
yourself.

771
01:07:52,932 --> 01:07:55,300
Ethy...

772
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,936
Ethy, listen to me.

773
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:59,404
I need you to go for
a little walk with your mom.

774
01:07:59,438 --> 01:08:00,940
- Papa, I want to stay here.
- I will meet you.

775
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:02,507
I promise.
Do you understand?

776
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,242
You have to trust me now.

777
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,659
Okay.

778
01:08:23,328 --> 01:08:24,964
You have to climb up there,
baby.

779
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:27,532
Quick. Climb, baby.
Just go.

780
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:28,835
Just go, baby.

781
01:08:28,868 --> 01:08:29,936
- Mom!
- Climb.

782
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:32,537
Just climb, please, climb.

783
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,473
- Mom!
- Ethan.

784
01:08:34,506 --> 01:08:37,677
We don't have any money.

785
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,478
Please. He's just a boy.

786
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:41,279
Please. No!

787
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:50,355
No!

788
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,558
No!

789
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,427
Mama.

790
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:02,668
No.

791
01:09:02,702 --> 01:09:04,837
Mama, no.

792
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,678
Mama.

793
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,380
I'm with you.

794
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:19,618
No!

795
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,962
Mama!

796
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:57,455
Papa.

797
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,629
Papa.

798
01:10:03,663 --> 01:10:05,932
Papa.

799
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:08,701
Papa.

800
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,714
Papa.

801
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,935
Breathe.

802
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:45,503
Come on, breathe.

803
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:49,675
You've got to fight
for yourself now.

804
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:51,911
Your father's not here.

805
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:55,815
Breathe.

806
01:10:55,848 --> 01:10:57,083
Breathe.

807
01:10:57,116 --> 01:10:58,885
- No!
- Breathe.

808
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:00,686
- No! No!
- Breathe.

809
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,989
Breathe.

810
01:11:03,022 --> 01:11:04,924
Breathe.

811
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:12,899
There, you go.

812
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:15,101
- Jesus.
- I have to get back to her.

813
01:11:15,134 --> 01:11:16,601
I have to.

814
01:11:18,671 --> 01:11:20,405
I know.

815
01:11:22,675 --> 01:11:25,044
How could I leave her alone?

816
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,780
Well, you did what you thought
was right, Eth.

817
01:11:32,685 --> 01:11:34,586
Did I?

818
01:11:39,491 --> 01:11:41,459
I promised her I'd come back.

819
01:11:50,803 --> 01:11:53,039
We're in control of our fate,
right?

820
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:59,211
Just got to have fucking faith.

821
01:11:59,245 --> 01:12:01,613
Just got to have faith.

822
01:12:04,016 --> 01:12:08,187
I-I can't lose her again.

823
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,922
This is not your fault.

824
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:15,560
I left her to die.

825
01:12:15,593 --> 01:12:17,063
Hey.

826
01:12:17,096 --> 01:12:19,632
You're not him, Eth.

827
01:12:33,112 --> 01:12:34,880
What if we can't
change anything?

828
01:12:37,717 --> 01:12:39,652
Maybe it's not our place.

829
01:12:39,685 --> 01:12:41,287
That can't be true.

830
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,189
There... There has to be a way.

831
01:12:43,222 --> 01:12:48,995
It's dust and... dust and bones.

832
01:12:49,028 --> 01:12:51,931
It can't be the only way.

833
01:12:51,964 --> 01:12:53,265
It can't.

834
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:55,901
- We...
- No more detours.

835
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,972
Maybe it's better this way.

836
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:01,573
No one's suffering anymore.

837
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:05,543
Come on.

838
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:09,648
What did you just say?

839
01:13:13,019 --> 01:13:14,720
What?

840
01:13:16,789 --> 01:13:18,290
What?

841
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:23,696
Archie...
Archie, repeat last playback.

842
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:24,964
Who is that?

843
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:26,032
Maybe it's better this way.

844
01:13:26,065 --> 01:13:27,299
No one is suffering anymore.

845
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:28,768
Data corrupt.

846
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:30,069
Skipping ahead.

847
01:13:30,102 --> 01:13:32,872
What did you
have to sacrifice?

848
01:13:32,905 --> 01:13:35,775
I did this for you.

849
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:38,177
You did this
for yourself.

850
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,112
This is our fate, Ethan.

851
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:42,314
- There is no other way.
- Wait.

852
01:13:42,348 --> 01:13:43,983
What did you say?

853
01:13:44,016 --> 01:13:45,117
No, no, no!

854
01:13:48,754 --> 01:13:51,824
- No!
- Fight me!

855
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:53,259
I'm so sorry.

856
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:55,728
No, no.

857
01:13:57,196 --> 01:14:00,666
Power failure.
Shut down.

858
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:02,802
What are you...
What are you doing?

859
01:14:02,835 --> 01:14:04,070
Why the fuck is my voice
in that thing?

860
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:05,805
You tell me.

861
01:14:09,642 --> 01:14:11,744
Why did you hide that from me?

862
01:14:11,777 --> 01:14:13,212
Why did you hide that from me?

863
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,613
And why do you have a gun?

864
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,853
It's protection.

865
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:22,188
From what?

866
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:23,621
You said it yourself.

867
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:24,824
This place, it...
it's dust and bones.

868
01:14:24,857 --> 01:14:27,827
Protection from what, me?

869
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,762
Are you going to shoot me,
brother?

870
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:34,033
What?

871
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,005
You're losing your mind.

872
01:14:44,009 --> 01:14:45,845
That's not me on that thing.

873
01:14:49,882 --> 01:14:52,852
Jude, Jude, give me the gun.

874
01:14:52,885 --> 01:14:55,921
I'm in control.

875
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:58,257
- Please.
- Why did you trick me?

876
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,326
Please, please, please,
please, Jude.

877
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:02,862
- Give me the gun.
- Stay right there.

878
01:15:02,895 --> 01:15:04,063
- Just... Just...
- Stay right there.

879
01:15:04,096 --> 01:15:05,297
Just give me the gun, Jude.

880
01:15:08,067 --> 01:15:09,802
Please.

881
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:21,013
You know how my skeleton
got there, don't you?

882
01:15:27,153 --> 01:15:31,090
Warning... two hours
to nuclear explosion.

883
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:39,231
- Please, please, please, please.
- Move.

884
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:03,155
You want to tell me
what you're doing?

885
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:06,225
Saving you from yourself. Move.

886
01:16:25,377 --> 01:16:27,079
Looks like we found our problem.

887
01:16:29,114 --> 01:16:32,985
Emergency reroute
required.

888
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:39,825
It's so fried.

889
01:16:39,858 --> 01:16:41,794
We've got to reroute the power.

890
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:46,532
Archie, reroute stability.

891
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:49,401
Reroute stability 30%,
Ethan.

892
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,203
Okay. Hit it.

893
01:16:51,237 --> 01:16:52,871
Come on.

894
01:16:57,142 --> 01:16:58,444
Power reroute failure.

895
01:16:58,477 --> 01:17:01,046
Damn it.
Give us a fucking chance.

896
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:08,254
Evacuate service chamber.

897
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:10,789
Eth, look out! The door.

898
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:16,128
Depressurization required.

899
01:17:16,161 --> 01:17:17,396
Grid, override.

900
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:19,898
Unable to comply.

901
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,200
It won't work.

902
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:23,002
We need to manually pull
the backup breaker

903
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:24,903
while the room
is depressurized.

904
01:17:28,107 --> 01:17:31,310
Am I going to die in here?

905
01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:32,878
Purging O2.

906
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:34,413
You aren't.

907
01:17:40,219 --> 01:17:41,353
Ethan!

908
01:17:41,387 --> 01:17:43,289
Ethan!

909
01:17:45,991 --> 01:17:49,328
No!

910
01:18:50,989 --> 01:18:52,524
Stars?

911
01:18:54,661 --> 01:18:57,029
How are we like stars?

912
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:11,510
Power restored.

913
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:13,312
Nuclear core active.

914
01:19:59,057 --> 01:20:00,660
Grid, system status.

915
01:20:00,693 --> 01:20:02,461
Chronicle systems online.

916
01:20:02,494 --> 01:20:04,363
Critical systems nominal.

917
01:20:04,396 --> 01:20:07,466
37 minutes to portal launch.

918
01:20:07,499 --> 01:20:09,435
Thank fucking Christ.

919
01:20:17,042 --> 01:20:18,544
Where does this go?

920
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:37,657
No.

921
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,759
No. No.

922
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:42,695
- What?
- How didn't I-I see it?

923
01:21:42,729 --> 01:21:44,329
See what?

924
01:21:44,363 --> 01:21:45,832
The... The...
The... The future. It's...

925
01:21:45,865 --> 01:21:47,299
It's already written.

926
01:21:47,332 --> 01:21:49,401
We're just turning
the fucking pages.

927
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:53,806
Give that to me.

928
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,708
No.

929
01:21:55,742 --> 01:21:58,076
Ethan, stop playing games.

930
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:02,514
I-I am going to die.

931
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:08,821
What happens next, Jude?

932
01:22:08,855 --> 01:22:10,657
I-I thought that
when we changed my death,

933
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:12,591
it meant that I could
change fate...

934
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:16,161
mine, Xanthe's, everyone's.

935
01:22:16,194 --> 01:22:18,397
But the skeleton, it...
it's still there.

936
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:20,098
My skeleton is still here.

937
01:22:20,132 --> 01:22:22,467
Why are we still talking about
a fucking skeleton?

938
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:24,269
My skeleton is still here

939
01:22:24,303 --> 01:22:28,140
because
we can't change anything.

940
01:22:28,173 --> 01:22:29,709
Everything was always
going to play out this way.

941
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:32,679
No matter what we do,
it's leading us to that moment.

942
01:22:34,546 --> 01:22:36,448
You're confusing yourself,
Ethan.

943
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:37,650
No.

944
01:22:37,684 --> 01:22:39,484
We're going to go home,

945
01:22:39,518 --> 01:22:41,186
and you're going to shoot me
in the head,

946
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:43,856
and I'm going to rot
in that hallway for 400 years.

947
01:22:47,326 --> 01:22:50,228
Am I not useful to you anymore,
brother?

948
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:51,798
You wouldn't lie to me.

949
01:22:55,902 --> 01:22:59,204
Why would I? Why would I?

950
01:22:59,237 --> 01:23:02,474
Because you know I'm never
going to see her again.

951
01:23:02,507 --> 01:23:03,843
I'm protecting you.

952
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:06,345
By putting a fucking gun
to my head?

953
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:11,216
- Archie...
- Put that fucking thing away.

954
01:23:11,249 --> 01:23:13,151
- Yes, Ethan?
- ...play last recording.

955
01:23:19,524 --> 01:23:20,727
Please, no. No.

956
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,194
No.

957
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:24,664
Find me!

958
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:26,699
No.

959
01:23:26,733 --> 01:23:29,501
- I wouldn't.
- No!

960
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:34,874
Fuck.

961
01:23:35,574 --> 01:23:38,778
The second I got here, it was...
it was staring me in the face.

962
01:23:38,811 --> 01:23:40,512
I-I just didn't want
to believe it was you.

963
01:23:40,545 --> 01:23:42,581
- It's not me, Ethan.
- Why?

964
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:44,917
Why wait until we get back
to do it?

965
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:47,285
Why not just fucking do it now?

966
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:48,520
How could you do that to me?

967
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:49,756
It's not the plan.

968
01:23:49,789 --> 01:23:51,456
What plan?

969
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,959
- We've got to get out of here.
- What fucking plan?

970
01:23:52,992 --> 01:23:55,527
If we leave now,
we can change everything.

971
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,529
Get off. Fuck!

972
01:23:57,562 --> 01:23:59,598
- What fucking plan?
- You've got to trust me.

973
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:01,400
I'm protecting you,
God damn it.

974
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:03,201
Fuck!

975
01:24:03,235 --> 01:24:06,505
Fuck.

976
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:10,308
30 minutes
to portal launch.

977
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:12,444
I'm in control.

978
01:24:12,477 --> 01:24:13,713
I'm in control.

979
01:24:13,746 --> 01:24:14,947
This place is alive, Ethan.

980
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:17,784
There's no reason
we can't live here.

981
01:24:17,817 --> 01:24:21,219
And leave everyone to die?

982
01:24:21,253 --> 01:24:22,755
Ethan.

983
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:27,960
There's no masks.

984
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:30,897
You can't stop them.

985
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,700
I saved you, Ethan,
but we can't save everyone.

986
01:24:38,403 --> 01:24:40,640
You've lost your fucking mind.

987
01:24:40,673 --> 01:24:42,374
Stay away from me.

988
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:48,313
Ethan!

989
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:52,985
My birthday.

990
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:00,592
I've made a terrible mistake.

991
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:03,996
We can't play God.

992
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:06,498
We don't belong
in God's playground.

993
01:25:08,935 --> 01:25:11,470
Jude, what the fuck?

994
01:25:11,503 --> 01:25:13,940
You're not going to find
what you're looking for.

995
01:25:17,609 --> 01:25:21,446
Ethan, no!

996
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,049
Ethan!

997
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:25,550
There is no other way.
Ethan!

998
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:27,787
We don't belong
in God's playground.

999
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,056
We don't belong
in God's playground.

1000
01:25:30,089 --> 01:25:31,824
We don't belong
in God's playground.

1001
01:25:31,858 --> 01:25:33,592
It won't change anything.

1002
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:36,495
Maybe one day
I'll be there, and I can say...

1003
01:25:36,528 --> 01:25:38,363
say this to your face.

1004
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,971
All of this was for you, Ethan.

1005
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,508
If I could give you the life
I never had,

1006
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:54,814
then you'd know
that I love you.

1007
01:25:56,816 --> 01:25:58,550
Wouldn't you?

1008
01:26:03,656 --> 01:26:06,491
It's the hardest thing,
to admit what you're afraid of.

1009
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:12,765
I never had a father.

1010
01:26:12,799 --> 01:26:14,634
I don't know if you know that.

1011
01:26:18,905 --> 01:26:20,605
Why do I run away?

1012
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,609
I should have been there
for you.

1013
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:28,380
I should have been there
for you.

1014
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,450
I didn't know how.

1015
01:26:35,087 --> 01:26:37,924
I'm sorry.

1016
01:26:37,957 --> 01:26:39,659
I'm sorry.

1017
01:26:45,665 --> 01:26:48,500
Fuck.

1018
01:26:48,533 --> 01:26:50,102
Grid, dial home.

1019
01:26:54,506 --> 01:26:56,876
Richard, where are you?
What have you done to him?

1020
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:59,078
Sweetheart, I don't have time
to explain.

1021
01:26:59,111 --> 01:27:01,781
I need you to take Ethan
and leave the house.

1022
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:03,149
Meet me where we first met.

1023
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:05,084
No. What? No.
I don't understand.

1024
01:27:05,117 --> 01:27:07,753
You're going to have
to tell him yourself.

1025
01:27:07,787 --> 01:27:09,689
Ethy.

1026
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:13,558
Ethy, I need you to go
for a little walk with your mom.

1027
01:27:13,592 --> 01:27:15,161
Papa,
I want to stay here.

1028
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:16,896
I will meet you.

1029
01:27:16,929 --> 01:27:19,065
I promise.

1030
01:27:19,098 --> 01:27:20,867
You have to trust me now.

1031
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:24,804
Entry granted.

1032
01:27:24,837 --> 01:27:26,839
End call.

1033
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,385
Jude.

1034
01:27:41,754 --> 01:27:43,521
I can't let you do it.

1035
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:46,192
What are you thinking
now, Richard?

1036
01:27:46,225 --> 01:27:49,862
This isn't about
finding a cure anymore, is it?

1037
01:27:49,896 --> 01:27:54,767
You want to escape,
just leave the world behind.

1038
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,535
There is no cure.

1039
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:59,171
That message was sent
by someone.

1040
01:27:59,205 --> 01:28:01,007
There must be a cure.

1041
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,642
We have a responsibility.

1042
01:28:02,675 --> 01:28:04,810
It's too late for that.

1043
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:07,113
This world is done, Richard.

1044
01:28:10,082 --> 01:28:12,051
You want to save them all?

1045
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:13,219
Most of them would
cut your throat

1046
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:16,055
for one breath of fresh air.

1047
01:28:16,088 --> 01:28:19,759
They wouldn't know what to do
with another chance.

1048
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,193
You're wrong.

1049
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:23,561
Even if we could save them,

1050
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:25,831
humans are a virus.

1051
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:28,167
The Earth will heal but never
while we're suffocating it.

1052
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,070
- This isn't the way.
- This is the only way.

1053
01:28:33,105 --> 01:28:36,809
The Earth needs time
without us, so we jump ahead.

1054
01:28:36,842 --> 01:28:39,946
Start again, or humanity
dies for nothing.

1055
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:43,916
Who, your chosen few?

1056
01:28:45,985 --> 01:28:47,820
I know you've lost people,
but you can't...

1057
01:28:47,853 --> 01:28:49,755
This isn't about me, Richard.

1058
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:56,095
You're right.

1059
01:28:56,128 --> 01:28:58,164
People are going to have to die.

1060
01:29:00,733 --> 01:29:04,670
It's not an easy decision,
but it's the right one.

1061
01:29:04,704 --> 01:29:05,871
It's not what we want.

1062
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:07,640
It's what we need.

1063
01:29:09,607 --> 01:29:12,712
You need to have faith.

1064
01:29:12,745 --> 01:29:14,847
You're the scientist here.

1065
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,984
You want to talk about faith?

1066
01:29:18,017 --> 01:29:22,121
I am not risking the survival
of humanity on your faith.

1067
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:23,723
Hey, Richard.

1068
01:29:23,756 --> 01:29:24,991
Just wanted to say
thank you so much

1069
01:29:25,024 --> 01:29:26,659
for giving me this chance.

1070
01:29:26,692 --> 01:29:28,694
I've run the numbers,
and I'm sure it will work.

1071
01:29:28,728 --> 01:29:32,631
I've got the design team working
on a rough outline as we speak.

1072
01:29:32,665 --> 01:29:35,234
An outline for what?

1073
01:29:35,267 --> 01:29:38,270
What?

1074
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,973
Wait.
Did Richard not authorize this?

1075
01:29:41,007 --> 01:29:42,708
Is it going to work or not?

1076
01:29:44,744 --> 01:29:46,611
I think so.

1077
01:29:46,645 --> 01:29:49,115
Yes, I mean,
it will take some time,

1078
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:51,751
but I think we can eventually
jerry rig the Chronicle

1079
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:54,186
to fire a person one way,
kind of like a...

1080
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:57,757
a slingshot or a...
or a catapult.

1081
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:00,092
That's suicide.
You're going to kill someone.

1082
01:30:00,126 --> 01:30:02,328
With some kind of protective
suit, they might have a chance.

1083
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:04,030
All we need is one person
to fix the power

1084
01:30:04,063 --> 01:30:07,233
on the Chronicle
in the future, right?

1085
01:30:07,266 --> 01:30:09,235
We fix the power,
she opens up the portal,

1086
01:30:09,268 --> 01:30:10,936
and we can go safely through.

1087
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,671
The ping came back.

1088
01:30:12,705 --> 01:30:14,006
There's oxygen there.

1089
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,308
It proves the plan
has already worked.

1090
01:30:16,342 --> 01:30:19,311
Earth regrows only because
mankind doesn't make it.

1091
01:30:19,345 --> 01:30:21,080
No!

1092
01:30:24,817 --> 01:30:27,086
I don't believe
it's the only way.

1093
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:32,792
I've locked the system
so only Ethan's DNA

1094
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:35,728
can activate the Chronicle
at the other end.

1095
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:39,999
Somebody sent for him,
and whether you believe or not,

1096
01:30:40,032 --> 01:30:43,202
you need him if you want
to open the portal.

1097
01:30:46,105 --> 01:30:49,141
Can you do it?
Can you get one person through?

1098
01:30:49,175 --> 01:30:50,643
I mean, I think it might
be possible,

1099
01:30:50,676 --> 01:30:52,211
but it's Richard's science,
so...

1100
01:30:52,244 --> 01:30:55,081
Can you make it work?

1101
01:30:55,114 --> 01:30:58,951
- Can you make it work?
- Yes!

1102
01:31:07,293 --> 01:31:10,129
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1103
01:31:13,232 --> 01:31:14,967
Stop!

1104
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,302
Stop!

1105
01:31:16,335 --> 01:31:19,705
Damn it, stop! Stop.

1106
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:22,074
Ms. Jackson, I-I don't...
I don't...

1107
01:31:22,108 --> 01:31:24,944
Go down with a team.

1108
01:31:24,977 --> 01:31:28,948
Make sure the boy stays alive.
You will be his guardian.

1109
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:32,318
Let nothing happen to him.
You understand?

1110
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:35,888
He's the key to everything now.

1111
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:37,857
I know.

1112
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,823
30 minutes
to portal launch.

1113
01:32:10,856 --> 01:32:13,092
Fuck you.

1114
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:15,294
You fucking liar!

1115
01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:18,397
All this time, you used me!

1116
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,366
You used me.

1117
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,335
They used us.

1118
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:25,237
I was just a kid, man.

1119
01:32:29,975 --> 01:32:33,312
They're still coming, Ethan,
even if you try and stop them,

1120
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:35,881
and the world you care
so much about,

1121
01:32:35,915 --> 01:32:38,317
they died for nothing.

1122
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:40,085
That can't be true.

1123
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:43,756
We can't change the past.

1124
01:32:43,789 --> 01:32:48,727
Even if we could,
what would happen to this place?

1125
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,396
What would happen to us?

1126
01:32:50,429 --> 01:32:52,731
I don't know!

1127
01:32:52,765 --> 01:32:55,034
But we can't leave
millions of people to die!

1128
01:32:55,067 --> 01:32:58,003
They have already died!

1129
01:32:58,037 --> 01:33:01,373
It's already happened, man!

1130
01:33:01,407 --> 01:33:03,142
There is no cure!

1131
01:33:06,445 --> 01:33:09,515
Eth, you said it yourself.

1132
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:12,051
Things can't be changed,
little brother.

1133
01:33:16,088 --> 01:33:17,923
I'm not your brother.

1134
01:33:23,362 --> 01:33:27,099
You sound like your father now.

1135
01:33:27,132 --> 01:33:30,135
You know, if he had listened
to Jackson, he'd still be here.

1136
01:33:32,871 --> 01:33:34,974
Only the strong survive, Ethan.

1137
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,350
So you bought yourself a place
in the new world.

1138
01:33:47,019 --> 01:33:48,787
What did you have to sacrifice?

1139
01:33:50,889 --> 01:33:53,392
Me?

1140
01:33:53,425 --> 01:33:55,127
Xanthe?

1141
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:04,903
I am your family.

1142
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:06,438
I did this for you.

1143
01:34:08,841 --> 01:34:10,809
You did this for yourself.

1144
01:34:15,314 --> 01:34:18,317
There has to be another way.

1145
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:21,120
I have to stop this thing.

1146
01:34:21,153 --> 01:34:23,889
- No, I can't let you.
- I have to stop this thing.

1147
01:34:26,558 --> 01:34:28,527
There is no other way.

1148
01:34:29,629 --> 01:34:31,163
This is our fate.

1149
01:34:31,196 --> 01:34:33,832
There is no other way.

1150
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,939
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

1151
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:42,274
- No, no, no!
- I'm sorry.

1152
01:34:42,308 --> 01:34:44,143
No, no!

1153
01:34:44,176 --> 01:34:46,045
Fight me.

1154
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:47,613
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.

1155
01:34:47,647 --> 01:34:49,181
Fight me.

1156
01:34:49,214 --> 01:34:51,283
- Fight me.
- Please!

1157
01:34:51,317 --> 01:34:53,018
- No! No!
- Fight me!

1158
01:34:53,052 --> 01:34:55,020
No!

1159
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:01,026
No, no!

1160
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,995
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

1161
01:35:03,028 --> 01:35:06,165
- Fight me! Fight me!
- Please, no, no, no!

1162
01:35:06,198 --> 01:35:07,166
Fight me!

1163
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,301
No! Help me!

1164
01:35:09,335 --> 01:35:11,603
You got to fight
for yourself now.

1165
01:35:11,638 --> 01:35:14,139
Fight me!

1166
01:35:14,173 --> 01:35:16,375
Help.

1167
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:20,412
Please.

1168
01:35:20,446 --> 01:35:23,382
You got to fight me.

1169
01:35:23,415 --> 01:35:26,552
I believe in you.

1170
01:35:29,254 --> 01:35:31,123
I believe in you.

1171
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,564
It is me.

1172
01:35:40,966 --> 01:35:43,102
I can change.

1173
01:35:46,572 --> 01:35:49,074
I'm so sorry.

1174
01:36:13,132 --> 01:36:15,167
Ohh, geez.

1175
01:37:42,454 --> 01:37:46,091
Distinguished friends,
you have stood with me

1176
01:37:46,124 --> 01:37:50,095
while you watched your world
fall down around you.

1177
01:37:50,128 --> 01:37:53,398
This is our time.

1178
01:37:53,432 --> 01:37:55,100
Each one of you
has played a part

1179
01:37:55,133 --> 01:37:57,704
in bringing us to this point.

1180
01:37:57,737 --> 01:38:01,106
History will not forget you.

1181
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:04,309
This day will be marked
as the day that we proved

1182
01:38:04,343 --> 01:38:08,280
that we will not go quietly
into the night,

1183
01:38:08,313 --> 01:38:12,351
the day the human race
took control of its fate.

1184
01:38:19,826 --> 01:38:22,729
I have it on good authority
that you are going to grow up

1185
01:38:22,762 --> 01:38:26,498
to be someone very important.

1186
01:38:26,532 --> 01:38:29,769
This is going to hurt,
but it will help you become

1187
01:38:29,802 --> 01:38:32,639
who you are meant to be.

1188
01:38:32,672 --> 01:38:36,174
One day you'll understand it.

1189
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:39,111
You will want to trust what you
can see with your own eyes,

1190
01:38:39,144 --> 01:38:43,081
but it won't be enough,
and you'll need to make a choice

1191
01:38:43,115 --> 01:38:47,586
about whether you believe
in something bigger.

1192
01:38:47,619 --> 01:38:50,188
- Archie?
- Yes, Ethan?

1193
01:38:56,863 --> 01:38:58,765
Someone is here.

1194
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:00,566
Who is here, Ethan?

1195
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,075
I'm here.

1196
01:39:21,587 --> 01:39:23,622
I believe.

1197
01:39:38,705 --> 01:39:41,206
Believe in...
believe in what?

1198
01:39:45,243 --> 01:39:46,746
Believe in people.

1199
01:39:49,849 --> 01:39:53,352
- No!
- Fight me!

1200
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:55,187
I'm sorry.

1201
01:40:24,483 --> 01:40:27,285
Incoming particle stream.

1202
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,892
Ethan.

1203
01:40:36,595 --> 01:40:38,831
He's a liability.

1204
01:40:38,865 --> 01:40:40,399
Shoot him.

1205
01:40:40,432 --> 01:40:41,768
Leave him here.

1206
01:40:41,801 --> 01:40:43,970
Once we're gone,
it won't matter.

1207
01:40:44,003 --> 01:40:46,271
Remember the drill.

1208
01:40:46,304 --> 01:40:48,306
We have one shot.

1209
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:51,510
Once the portal opens, we have
30 seconds to clear through.

1210
01:40:53,478 --> 01:40:58,718
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

1211
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:05,357
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

1212
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:14,332
Tether interrupted.

1213
01:41:14,366 --> 01:41:15,868
Shutting down.

1214
01:41:25,477 --> 01:41:27,546
No.

1215
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:31,249
No.

1216
01:41:31,283 --> 01:41:33,485
No. No.

1217
01:41:33,518 --> 01:41:35,788
No.

1218
01:41:35,822 --> 01:41:37,824
No!

1219
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:16,394
ChroniCorp's headquarters
were raided just moments ago

1220
01:42:16,428 --> 01:42:20,499
after this news station
received an anonymous broadcast.

1221
01:42:20,532 --> 01:42:24,670
Officials seized hundreds
of believed-extinct plants.

1222
01:42:24,704 --> 01:42:27,405
If what we are hearing is true,
this may be the second chance

1223
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:31,711
the world so desperately needs
for ecological regeneration.

1224
01:42:31,744 --> 01:42:34,947
Religious groups are already
calling it the deus ex machina,

1225
01:42:34,981 --> 01:42:37,349
or God out of the machine.

1226
01:42:40,452 --> 01:42:43,588
Entry request.

1227
01:42:43,622 --> 01:42:45,357
Entry request.

1228
01:42:48,661 --> 01:42:50,562
Security override.

1229
01:43:00,773 --> 01:43:02,742
Xanthe Whyte?

1230
01:44:39,005 --> 01:44:40,840
Stars?

1231
01:44:40,873 --> 01:44:43,876
How are we like stars?

1232
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:46,578
Silly.

1233
01:44:46,611 --> 01:44:48,513
Okay. Here.

1234
01:44:48,546 --> 01:44:50,783
Here, try this.

1235
01:44:52,952 --> 01:44:55,087
What's between us?

1236
01:44:55,121 --> 01:44:56,088
Your hands.

1237
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:57,189
No.

1238
01:44:57,223 --> 01:45:00,960
Here.

1239
01:45:00,993 --> 01:45:04,764
Imagine for a moment that we are
all physically connected

1240
01:45:04,797 --> 01:45:07,432
by the very fabric
of the universe.

1241
01:45:10,502 --> 01:45:14,040
An invisible field
that bonds us together,

1242
01:45:14,073 --> 01:45:16,742
everything in the universe.

1243
01:45:16,776 --> 01:45:22,715
It's you, me, the stars.

1244
01:45:25,017 --> 01:45:27,119
We are all connected
through time.

1245
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:32,624
So you see, Ethy,

1246
01:45:32,658 --> 01:45:35,795
even when I'm not with you,

1247
01:45:35,828 --> 01:45:38,798
we are always together.

1248
01:47:35,021 --> 01:47:40,021

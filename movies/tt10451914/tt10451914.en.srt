00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,541
<i>Uh, this is Rattlesnake.</i>
<i>Hostiles in the area.</i>

3
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>Copy.</i>

4
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,666
<i>Put the Gumps out</i>!

5
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,666
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

6
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,833
<i>Jesus! IED blast ahead!</i>
<i>Gumps down! We cannot move forward!</i>

7
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,833
- Sarge, it's a fuckin' ambush!
<i>- Fuck, they're everywhere!</i>

8
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,250
Take cover!

9
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,375
Take fucking shelter now!

10
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,208
<i>We need to fall back!</i>

11
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,125
Contact! Contact!
West side checkpoint!

12
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,250
Man down! Over!

13
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,708
- Fuck! They took out the APC.
- Sarge, we need to fall back.

14
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,458
I'm not leaving anyone behind!

15
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,250
<i>Bigfoot, where are you? Over!</i>

16
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,333
<i>I'm on my way.</i>
<i>Are we pushing through?</i>

17
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,291
<i>Negative. We cannot move forward.</i>

18
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,916
<i>I think we lost the entire Gump unit,
and we have a man trapped. Over!</i>

19
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,416
Can't see shit!
Where the fuck are the Gumps?

20
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,666
Gomez! Get your ass over here.

21
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,291
- Where the fuck are they shooting from?
- They're fuckin' everywhere.

22
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,000
- Where the fuck are the Gumps?
- I've got you!

23
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,708
We need to get him out of there.
See a way through?

24
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,916
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, we'll provide covering fire.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,541
Gomez, go, go, go!

26
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,083
- Go!
- Open fire!

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,750
Contact! Covering fire now!

28
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,916
Go, go, go, go, go!

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,625
Two o'clock.

30
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,416
<i>Fuck! Krasnys all over!</i>

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,083
<i>Rattlesnake, I need cover!</i>

32
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,291
<i>Concentrate fire on the building.</i>

33
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,625
<i>Sarge, we can't get to him!</i>
<i>It's too far.</i>

34
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,041
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>I'm not leaving anyone behind.</i>

35
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,333
<i>Let's go! Cover fire, now!</i>

36
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,916
Go!

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,041
Contact right!

38
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,791
- Cover!
- Contact!

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,791
- Go!
- Bigfoot!

40
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,208
Cover fire, now!

41
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,208
- Now!
- Reloading!

42
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,541
Cover!

43
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,958
Bigfoot!

44
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,583
I'm hit!

45
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,500
Man down! Man down!

46
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,000
<i>Rattlesnake, come on.</i>
<i>I need cover. I'm hit!</i>

47
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,166
<i>This is Rattlesnake.</i>
<i>I hear you loud and clear.</i>

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,541
<i>- We'll be there. Stay where you are.</i>
- Rattlesnake,

49
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,500
this is Rolling Thunder.

50
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,458
Unidentified vehicle
approaching at high speed.

51
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,000
Potential attack.
Requesting permission to engage.

52
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,583
Hold on. I got you, buddy. Come on.

53
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,875
Permission denied. Two of our men trapped.

54
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,125
We have an additional
38 men on the ground.

55
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,916
They're a priority.
I need you to fall back. Over.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,125
Let me get my men out!

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,541
Bale, confirm Hellfire
with Captain Brydon.

58
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,458
Yes, sir. Base, this is Rolling Thunder,

59
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,166
<i>requesting permission for air strike.
Over.</i>

60
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,125
- I need Sector 9.
- Here, sir.

61
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,333
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,708
<i>Rattlesnake, I need that cover!</i>

63
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,041
Do you copy?

64
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,458
Stay there, hold position.
We'll come get you.

65
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,166
Rattlesnake,
I need you to fall back, over.

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,666
<i>I repeat!</i>
<i>Two of our men trapped! Over!</i>

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,583
Amber Base,

68
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,708
<i>this is Rolling Thunder.
Do I have permission to engage?</i>

69
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,000
I have a heavily armored truck,
broad wheelbase.

70
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,291
- High risk, mobile launcher.
<i>- Rolling Thunder,</i>

71
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,083
this is Amber Base, hold for command.

72
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,250
Truck's too close to our men
to risk Hellfire.

73
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,958
Rattlesnake, do you copy?
I'm getting fucking hit down here!

74
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,666
Come on!

75
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,208
<i>All right, Fire team,</i>
<i>prepare for cover fire.</i>

76
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,458
That's a launch... That's a launcher, sir.

77
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,375
<i>Over.</i>

78
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,875
No launcher visible in my feed.

79
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,791
<i>- Fire request denied.</i>
- I'm positive that's a launcher, sir.

80
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,333
Impact is imminent. Over.

81
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,541
<i>You heard him!</i>

82
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,958
Hold fire till I clear my men!

83
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,208
We have 38 men on ground,

84
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,083
<i>plus two exposed. They'll all die.</i>

85
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,166
It's not your call.

86
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,916
<i>Rattlesnake, do you copy?</i>

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,958
<i>- I'm getting fucking hit here!</i>
- Harp?

88
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,458
<i>We'll be there! Stay where you are!</i>

89
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,000
<i>Let's get those two Marines.</i>

90
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,541
Go!

91
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,083
Go! Moving out!

92
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,500
Let's get them! Let's go!

93
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,208
West flank, be ready!

94
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,416
Danger close.

95
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,666
<i>Target locked.</i>

96
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,583
- Goddammit!
- Abort, abort!

97
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,708
- Take cover.
- Stand down.

98
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,875
What are you doing, Harp?

99
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,291
DA1 off the rail on three…

100
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,125
Stand down.

101
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,291
<i>…two,</i>

102
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,666
…one.

103
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,916
Incoming!

104
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,041
Goddammit, Harp!

105
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,875
What the fuck, Harp?

106
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,875
You disobeyed a direct order.

107
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,125
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

108
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,291
You killed 'em!

109
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,500
<i>You killed 'em!</i>

110
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,000
Two US Marines.

111
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,958
Dead.

112
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,833
And one US Army Gump destroyed.

113
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,500
I made the call that felt most correct
given the intel available...

114
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,666
At the time.

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,083
We know.

116
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,208
With all due respect, Captain,
with 40 men on the ground, I saved 38,

117
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,666
including Master Sergeant Miller
and his convoy.

118
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,208
If Miller had been given the chance,
he would've tried to save all 40.

119
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,250
But you took that option away from him.

120
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
When did you do your basic?

121
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,666
Three years ago. Parris Island.

122
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,833
Have you ever experienced
a mass-casualty encounter,

123
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,708
other than from behind your screen?

124
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,541
Have you spent time
in a conflict zone, Harp?

125
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,208
- No, ma'am, but I...
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

126
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,291
Here's your deployment drive.

127
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,250
Captain, this can't be the only option.

128
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,000
They wanted to court-martial you.

129
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,458
- I fought for you.
- What am I gonna tell Olivia?

130
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,875
Tell her you're going on
an all-expenses-paid refresher

131
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,500
in how to make the world a safer place.

132
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,958
- Until when?
- Until you pass the assessment.

133
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,541
And when's that gonna be?

134
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,750
When's that gonna be, <i>sir?</i>

135
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,208
I like you, Harp.

136
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,416
You're precise, efficient.
Brilliant drone pilot.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,791
But you disobeyed a direct order.

138
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,083
Consider yourself lucky today.

139
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,375
Your CO at Camp Nathaniel
is a Captain Leo.

140
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,208
Report to him.

141
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,583
Camp Nathaniel?
That's where the platoon's based.

142
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,416
Keep your head down.
See it as an opportunity

143
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,083
to meet your fellow servicemen.

144
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,791
Let's pray you're a fast learner.

145
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,791
Dismissed.

146
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,791
Let's go, guys. Let's get moving!

147
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,458
Straight ahead, straight ahead.

148
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,875
Move it, soldier.
This is your new home, maggots.

149
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,083
Get into three separate lines
to get scanned in.

150
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,500
Pronto! Double-time! Move!

151
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,791
Welcome to Camp Nathaniel.

152
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,000
You'll be seeing a lot of my pretty face.

153
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,166
Get scanned in by the Gumps
and keep it moving.

154
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,916
Your digs are in Sections 2 and 4,
ahead on your left.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,208
Keep it moving, soldier.

156
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,583
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

157
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,708
Come on! Don't be shy.

158
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,041
Look at them straight in the eye.

159
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,708
Do not hesitate.

160
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,583
They smell fear, boys.
Keep it moving, soldiers. Come on!

161
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,208
Hey, eyes on the prize, soldier.
Eyes on the prize. Come on.

162
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,958
Left foot, right foot, keep it going.
Why are you being so slow? Come on!

163
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,541
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm looking for Captain Leo.

164
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,833
- Sorry. I'm looking for Captain Leo.
- Leo?

165
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,125
Oh man. I don't know.
You better talk to Colonel Eckhart.

166
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,666
- He's by the medical tent right there.
- Thank you.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,666
Hey! I am not gonna let my men
be out on inspection here. Move!

168
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,708
Make room. Got another one coming.

169
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,041
Colonel Eckhart?

170
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,500
Lieutenant Harp, sir.

171
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,750
Posted here from Creech Air Force Base.
Looking for Captain Leo.

172
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,833
You must've really fucked up
if they sent you to Leo.

173
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,333
What do you mean, sir?

174
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,791
You don't have permission to speak
until I ask you a question.

175
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,250
You even know why you're here?

176
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,291
<i>- Experientum Auctoriat,</i> sir.
- "Authority of experience."

177
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,958
Don't give it a Latin name, shit.
Explain it to me.

178
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,041
Uh, it's an Ethics Committee dictate, sir.

179
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,083
It proposes UAV pilots would exercise
greater caution if they experienced...

180
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,458
The Ethics Committee is a PR team.

181
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,541
This dictate is a bullshit pass
for pilots who fuck up.

182
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,416
You killed two marines.
You should be in jail.

183
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,916
Someone deemed
the dollar value of your training

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,541
to be higher than the lives
of those two men.

185
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,291
If you survive, Air Force keeps a pilot.

186
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,875
You don't, you're a cautionary tale
to all the other fly-by-wire assholes.

187
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,250
- With all due respect, sir...
- I didn't ask you a question, son.

188
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,375
Block 13. Follow the music.

189
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,750
Thank you, Colonel.

190
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,208
Harp…

191
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,875
…he's not like us.

192
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,083
This is ridiculous.

193
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,041
Can you believe
we have to read all this and file it?

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,333
Shh!

195
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,250
Be quiet!

196
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:44,125
<i>Remaining charging time</i>
<i>for Gump unit C-45, 20 minutes.</i>

197
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,833
Are you Captain Leo?

198
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,291
Lieutenant Harp, sir.

199
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,083
- My deployment drive, sir.
- Shh!

200
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,625
Lieutenant Thomas Harp.

201
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,250
Tier three UAV pilot,

202
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,083
56,000 flight hours,

203
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,333
99% performance record,
and 99% discipline.

204
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,333
Engaged to Olivia Rose Meyer of Carlsbad.

205
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,333
To be married in Palm Springs.

206
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,791
It's a very nice part of the world.

207
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,125
Did I leave anything out
other than your kills and commendations

208
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,458
or the fact
that you can't appreciate culture,

209
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,916
or you just don't know
when to shut the fuck up?

210
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,875
- No.
- No, <i>Captain.</i>

211
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:26,958
No, Captain.

212
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,000
Very good.

213
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,666
How many insurgents have you killed, Harp?

214
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,708
- 163.
- Collateral?

215
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,833
My numbers are consistent
with mission goals and flight hours, sir.

216
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,875
Your numbers?

217
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,666
Goddamn, you a cold motherfucker.

218
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,583
Here.

219
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,541
Grab that and follow me.

220
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,333
Far too many names
to memorize and recite, sir.

221
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,708
If you could, would you really want to?

222
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,583
I'm aware we kill people, Captain.

223
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,833
If you were aware of that,
you wouldn't be here.

224
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,291
You a quartermaster?

225
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,250
If I were…

226
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,333
Would you be disappointed?

227
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,583
- Why would I be disappointed?
- 'Cause that means you flew 10,000 miles

228
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,375
to sign equipment out of a warehouse.

229
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,750
We all play our part.

230
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,541
The fuck do you think you are?

231
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,291
Some Academy kid?

232
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,791
Daddy pay your way through cadet school
so you could mind your Ps and Qs?

233
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,625
With all due respect,
I put myself through cadet school.

234
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,500
Sir.

235
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,833
No.

236
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,083
No what, Captain?

237
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,958
No, I'm not a quartermaster.

238
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,416
We have to deliver
these vaccines to a clinic.

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,791
Twenty klicks outside the wire.

240
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,666
There's an outbreak of cholera,
and it's spreading fast.

241
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,791
It might be a war zone,
but women and children still get sick.

242
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,875
So you're "hearts and minds," sir?

243
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,750
Yes. I'm hearts and minds.

244
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,250
Ostensibly.

245
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,666
So, what do you really do?

246
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,791
I chase ghosts.

247
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,208
I'm sorry, what?

248
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,541
MARSOC. Marine Special Operations.

249
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:28,250
I locate and remove advanced weapons
from insurgents beyond the wire.

250
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,291
And what do you do?
Put them in filing cabinets?

251
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,583
It's the latest
in counter-intel technology.

252
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,166
Beats the hell out
of those Russian hackers.

253
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
It's your NDA.

254
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,416
- You can sign it or read all 90 pages.
- Oh. No, sir.

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,916
Welcome, Lieutenant.

256
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,916
You ever heard the name Viktor Koval?

257
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,208
Yeah. Heard insurgents say it
on intercepted radio comms.

258
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,458
Forget what you heard in the air.
You're on the ground now, kid.

259
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,000
Viktor Koval is a Krasny warlord.

260
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,875
The Krasny wanna make
the Ukraine a part of Russia.

261
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,375
- Like in the good old days.
- Opposing them

262
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,125
are the Resistance.

263
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,750
They're a militia set up to defend
the independence of the Ukraine.

264
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,458
But the Krasnys are getting stronger
with the full support of Moscow.

265
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,750
It's a war that's got too hot for the UN,

266
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,541
so now we're the assholes
in the middle of it,

267
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,333
in the demilitarized zone.

268
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,291
We're peacekeepers.

269
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,166
We're the only thing stopping these guys
from committing genocide.

270
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,041
You believe that, I have a timeshare
in Florida I want to sell you.

271
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,791
No, we're talking about Viktor Koval,
the Terror of the Balkans.

272
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:52,916
And nukes.

273
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,041
Nukes?

274
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,083
There's Intel that says
Koval is responsible for the dirty bomb

275
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,291
set off in Kiev,

276
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,500
using Russian uranium.

277
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,166
This motherfucker may be responsible
for 25,000 people's deaths.

278
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,625
My sources tell me he's trying
to get to Systema Perimeter.

279
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,083
Systema Perimeter?

280
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,875
That's Russia's
automated nuclear retaliation system.

281
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,750
<i>Exactly.</i>

282
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,083
<i>Even after Ukraine's independence,</i>

283
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,458
<i>the country still held one-third
of Russia's nuclear arsenal.</i>

284
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:27,041
<i>Silos scattered across the country
at top-secret locations,</i>

285
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,541
<i>ready to strike anywhere in the world.</i>

286
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,583
Yeah.

287
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,666
But it was shut down like 50 years ago,
after the Cold War.

288
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,750
You believe that?

289
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,750
You really think Russia would dismantle
its one true safeguard against attack?

290
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,666
You telling me
the Russian systems are still functioning?

291
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,125
And Koval…

292
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,875
He's trying to get
to the nukes here in Ukraine?

293
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,208
CIA sources say that
the Kremlin's lost control of Koval.

294
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,958
My informant believes
Koval's gonna make a move for those nukes

295
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,291
in the next 24 hours.

296
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,208
And if all this is true,

297
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,208
imagine what he'll do
if he gets his hands on those silos.

298
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,833
Yeah. A madman with nukes.

299
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,166
A crazy terrorist with nukes.

300
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,750
Downtown Washington,
New York, Paris. Who knows?

301
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,833
What I do know is, there won't be
a pretty little wedding in Palm Springs,

302
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,875
unless you're wearing
factor 500 UV protection.

303
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,041
Now, we deliver
these vaccines to the hospital,

304
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,166
and my informant will
feed us intel on Koval's next plan.

305
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,000
We ride out at dawn.

306
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:35,791
Dawn?

307
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,166
But that's… now!

308
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,750
Whoa, uh, Captain.

309
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,916
Uh, Sir?

310
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,125
With all due respect, sir,
I think there's been a mistake.

311
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,291
I just got here.

312
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,416
I don't make mistakes, Lieutenant.

313
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,625
No, I don't mean it like that, sir.

314
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,458
Dress, Lieutenant. Double-time.

315
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,166
What's this?

316
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,291
You wear your uniform,
you'll be a standing target.

317
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,166
Thought I'd be guarding the fence, sir.

318
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,958
I don't have any specialist training
as a field agent.

319
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,666
Don't worry.
I'm special enough for both of us.

320
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,416
What the fuck?

321
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,083
What the fuck, <i>Captain.</i>

322
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,875
- You're a...
- Your commanding officer.

323
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,291
Fourth-generation biotech,

324
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,916
and I'm gonna give you
60 seconds to deal with it.

325
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,791
I'm... I'm sorry, what, Captain?

326
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,041
Do you feel as though
you can trust me, Harp?

327
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,000
- I, uh...
- We're about to enter a war zone.

328
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,666
If I continue
to instill shock and distrust,

329
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,625
I'll file your removal papers myself,

330
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,375
and you'll have to deal
with the consequences.

331
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,500
Now…

332
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,833
Do you trust me?

333
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,625
Yes, sir.

334
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,583
Cool.

335
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,833
So, what are you? Like, AI?

336
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:34,083
Your cell phone's AI. A Gump's AI.

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
I'm a prototype.
My existence is classified.

338
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,166
You're evading the question, sir.

339
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,250
Ask the right question,
I'll give you the right answer.

340
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,750
Go again?

341
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,125
Okay. What the hell are you?

342
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,291
You want my model number or tech specs?

343
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,500
Both are classified.

344
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,208
Yo!

345
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,666
Oh, ten-hut!

346
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,916
The fuck are you doing?

347
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,333
Some asshole in Arlington thinks
a vending machine can do a soldier's job.

348
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,333
Aside from that, it's got a fucked rotor.

349
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,666
You want me to take the butt of my gun
and bash your ugly fucking mug in?

350
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,208
No, sir.

351
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,291
Charlie Nine.

352
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,375
Mount up.

353
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,000
This way, Lieutenant.

354
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,250
Only two people have clearance
to know who and what I am.

355
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,875
Colonel Eckhart and you.

356
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:32,000
Why was I assigned to you?
I'm not qualified to go chasing nukes.

357
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,333
You weren't assigned.

358
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,875
I chose you.

359
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,083
I can't do this alone.
I need eyes on my back.

360
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,791
I needed someone
who could think outside the box.

361
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,750
You got me?

362
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:51,666
So, we're partners?

363
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:53,666
Fuck, no.

364
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,208
You're my subordinate.

365
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,833
You respect me like the rest
of your commanding officers.

366
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,583
Don't question my authority,
and we'll get on fine.

367
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,083
Our jeep's over there.

368
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,416
- Captain.
- At ease, soldier.

369
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,500
Subordinate.

370
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,875
- Hey, drone boy!
- Come here.

371
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,500
Hey! What the...

372
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,208
Stand down!

373
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,958
You made your point.

374
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,833
You recognize my voice,
you son of a bitch?

375
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,291
They were only 19 years old.

376
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,625
Nothing I say will bring them back.

377
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,125
What are you staring at?

378
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:05,875
Load up.

379
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,083
<i>Report of hostile activities</i>
<i>in Sector 9.</i>

380
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,375
Eleven miles to the city.

381
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,958
We don't control
any of the area outside the wire.

382
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,208
- The Marines call it...
- "Running the gauntlet."

383
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,708
Because attacks in it are so frequent.

384
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,458
Good.

385
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,125
<i>All units be advised.</i>

386
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,416
<i>We are proceeding outside the wire.</i>

387
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,458
Pick up your rifle, Lieutenant.

388
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,541
If they attack,
you're gonna need to shoot back.

389
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,625
Must be nice.

390
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,333
Fight a war, never have to leave home.

391
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,458
When was the last time you saw her?

392
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,833
- Saw who?
- What do you mean "who"?

393
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,500
Olivia Rose Meyer.

394
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,416
Last week.

395
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,375
Last week. Damn.

396
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,750
- You fucking somebody else?
- Get the fuck outta here.

397
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,416
Come on. Look,
I get a sense of arrogance from you.

398
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:09,625
Guys like you, so dispassionate, so cold,

399
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,166
so into himself.

400
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:15,500
- Those are the guys that usually wander.
- Yeah? Well, I'm faithful.

401
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,791
- She faithful to you?
- Yeah. She is...

402
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,666
Why am I even
having this conversation?

403
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,875
Fair game, rookie.

404
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:27,000
I need your head out here,
not thinking about if Olivia's at home

405
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,875
playing "put the beef in my taco"
with her Pilates instructor.

406
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:33,666
- Her Pilates instructor's a woman.
- Oh, even better!

407
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,250
- She goes both ways. I knew I liked her.
- We're getting married in September.

408
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,750
What do you know about relationships?
Aren't you like three years old?

409
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,083
Five.

410
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,958
You got a picture of her?

411
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,500
Come on, man. Pull it out.

412
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,916
Holy shit.

413
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,958
She's a hottie. Congratulations.

414
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,791
- Thank you. She's special.
- Hey!

415
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,958
"My Gummy Bear."
She calls you Gummy Bear?

416
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,583
Aww, my Gummy Bear.

417
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,583
Fucking with you, rookie.

418
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,791
<i>This is Rattlesnake.</i>

419
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,875
<i>We've been moved up to Yellow alert.</i>

420
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,000
<i>So, eyes open. Over.</i>

421
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,958
Look at these poor bastards.
Stuck between us and Koval.

422
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,166
<i>I got a bunch of civilians.</i>
<i>Nine o'clock.</i>

423
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,541
<i>No signs of hostile activity.</i>

424
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,541
<i>Keep your distance.</i>

425
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,791
<i>This is Rattlesnake.</i>

426
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,750
<i>We have reports from base
of aid truck hit. Man down.</i>

427
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,833
<i>Repeat. Aid truck hit.</i>

428
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,250
Road to encampment blocked.

429
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,250
<i>Suspected militia attack.</i>

430
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,333
Get your rifle up.

431
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,166
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

432
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,750
<i>Execute to follow. Over.</i>

433
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,916
All units prepare to exit the vehicle.
Hostiles in the area.

434
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,958
<i>Stay frosty.</i>

435
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,000
Listen, put the Gumps out.
Form a perimeter

436
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,583
<i>in front of the convoy.</i>

437
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,750
- Get ready, kid.
<i>- All units on the ground.</i>

438
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,083
<i>Defense formation.</i>

439
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,625
<i>Let's keep it calm.</i>
<i>Let's keep it clean.</i>

440
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,583
<i>Gumps out now!</i>

441
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,541
- All Marines, defense formation.
- What the fuck's going on?

442
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,750
Defense formation.

443
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,916
Stay calm.

444
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,125
Stay calm. Nobody do shit.

445
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,708
The fuck?

446
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,833
I said hold fire, goddammit!

447
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:38,875
Goddamn Gumps pre-empted.
Charlie Nine, hold fire!

448
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,125
Drop the rifle now!

449
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,916
Slowly.

450
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,791
All of you guys, come on!

451
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,291
Let's go.

452
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,541
Put your weapons down!

453
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:53,083
- Don't you understand?
- Step away! Back!

454
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,833
Captain, just a sec, sir. Sir?

455
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:56,916
Cooperate!

456
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,291
- Sir...
- All right, Harp. Take it easy.

457
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,416
Stand down!

458
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,625
Stand down!
Put your weapons down.

459
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:07,916
- Put 'em down!
- Tell your men to put their guns down.

460
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,625
Captain, fall back.

461
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,916
Stay calm.

462
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,958
Step away from those Marines!

463
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,666
Goddammit! Tell your men
to lower their weapons now!

464
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,583
That's an order!

465
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,958
- Sarge?
- Lower your weapons.

466
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,125
- Come on...
- Lower your goddamn weapons!

467
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,208
That's an order.

468
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:38,916
Cap?

469
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,083
Shit.

470
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,125
All right.

471
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,416
All right.

472
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,916
Okay, all right.

473
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,833
All right.

474
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,625
Okay, calm down.

475
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,916
All right. I'm unarmed.

476
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,458
Tell your men to put their guns down.

477
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,250
Come on.

478
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:26,416
You gotta move this truck,
we gotta get our men out of here.

479
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,750
What do you want?

480
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,833
We don't want to fight.
You understand?

481
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,208
Okay?

482
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,708
- What the fuck?
- What's he doing?

483
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,375
Shh. Shut up.

484
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,125
All right.

485
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,458
Master Sergeant.

486
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:06,375
Get your men off the street.
Let's get that truck moved.

487
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,625
- Fuck, yeah.
- Copy that.

488
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,083
- I'm sorry.
- Relax!

489
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,666
- Go get those Marines.
- What did you say to him?

490
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,833
Said we had to get vaccines through.

491
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:16,541
- Is that all it took?
- No, I gave him the aid truck.

492
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:20,000
They had weapons, though.
They weren't after food.

493
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,875
- They were militia.
- Easy.

494
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,791
They can't be both?

495
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,750
It's our job to identify, neutralize.

496
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,541
It's our job to stay alive
long enough to get our intel

497
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,291
and focus on the bigger picture.

498
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:33,458
- We gotta get to the clinic.
- Keep your eyes open.

499
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,125
- He's gone.
- Check right.

500
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,041
- I got left.
- Right.

501
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,791
Easy, easy.

502
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:49,625
Nice and slow.

503
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,708
Just like that. We all go...

504
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,166
For Viktor Koval!

505
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,666
- Krasnys! Nine o'clock!
- Take cover!

506
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,708
Get down!

507
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,125
Fuck!

508
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,875
Fuck! Krasnys, three o'clock.

509
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,083
Take cover!

510
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:27,791
Try and concentrate fire on the building.
Flush them out into the open.

511
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,791
Got 'em! Stand down!

512
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,375
Cover me!

513
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:40,708
Fuck!

514
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,166
Go inside!

515
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,083
Stay down!

516
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,791
All right. Fire team…

517
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,125
Suppressing fire.

518
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,416
Suppressing fire. Goddammit!

519
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,000
Incoming!

520
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,041
Harp!

521
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,083
- Who's hit? Who's hit?
- Medic!

522
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,583
Harp!

523
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,416
Harp! Goddammit!

524
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,333
Yeah?

525
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:27,583
Get the gear!

526
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,875
We gotta make it to our contact!

527
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,750
Miller! Shit. Gyah!

528
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,458
We're gonna go ahead on foot!

529
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,125
Copy! We'll take care of this shitshow.

530
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:43,000
- You get that vaccine delivered.
- Okay.

531
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,375
One, two, go!

532
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,500
Cover fire!

533
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,250
What the fuck?

534
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,750
That was Koval's men attacking us?

535
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:24,875
Yeah, they hit the supply truck
and waited for the locals to go for food.

536
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,583
Koval's getting closer.
Popping up like a game of whack-a-mole.

537
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,750
Lose the helmet.

538
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,666
Makes you look aggressive.
Trying to cultivate trust.

539
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:38,666
Keep your gun in the holster.
It might just keep you alive.

540
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,666
Got you.

541
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,916
Miller doesn't know
about our real mission?

542
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,375
What about the colonel?

543
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,625
Eckhart thinks you can manage
this conflict from behind a fence.

544
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:49,916
War is ugly.

545
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,625
Sometimes you gotta get dirty
to see any real change.

546
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,208
He doesn't like you, you know.

547
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,000
Listen…

548
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,833
…I feel more than he does.

549
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,791
That gut feeling?

550
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,708
No.

551
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,958
Feeling's all I got, rookie.

552
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,458
Acute sensory perception.

553
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,208
- What? Can you feel pain?
- Of course I can.

554
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:25,541
I couldn't empathize with you if I didn't.
Like now, what do you feel?

555
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,208
Shit-scared and confused.

556
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,000
That's good.
That means you're here and alive.

557
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,791
Do you ever wonder
why I look like this, Harp?

558
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,208
What?

559
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,500
Chiseled cheekbones?

560
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,416
Funny.

561
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:43,708
Why would the Pentagon pick my face
to represent the United States Marines?

562
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:47,208
Why wouldn't they make me
a blond-haired, blue-eyed,

563
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,416
all-American varsity peckerwood?

564
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,833
Didn't wanna ask.
Thought it might be robotist.

565
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,166
Psy-ops.

566
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:03,041
My sleeve might say US,
but my face conveys neutrality.

567
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:04,916
Makes people calm.

568
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:23,916
Let's keep moving.

569
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,291
Our contact is waiting for us.

570
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,625
- That's the Damsk encampment, huh?
- It is.

571
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,791
A refugee shelter run by the Resistance.

572
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:49,708
Shit.

573
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,333
I've seen it from the air.

574
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,833
They're good people, Harp.

575
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:46,208
Trust is hard-earned.

576
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,125
Find out what they need
and give it to them.

577
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,875
Most of 'em just wanna live.

578
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,500
You manipulate people?

579
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,916
It's called compassion.

580
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:05,416
If Koval finds the nukes,
it's the end of the world as we know it.

581
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,708
Let's keep moving.

582
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,250
Hey. Doc.

583
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:00,375
Harp!

584
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,750
Bring the other supplies.

585
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,083
I'm in position.

586
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,916
Viktor?

587
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,333
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>the incendiary rounds?</i>

588
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,708
<i>Kill him. Kill them both.</i>

589
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,791
- Harp!
- Yeah?

590
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,250
Cap!

591
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,791
Who are you?

592
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,250
Who are you?

593
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,125
Fuck yourself, American pig!

594
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,833
I can do this all day.

595
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,958
Krasny.

596
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:13,083
What do you know about Viktor Koval?

597
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,291
- Give him to us, Americans.
- Tell me!

598
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:19,916
I hit you in your subclavian artery.
You're gonna bleed out.

599
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,583
So, where were we?

600
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,291
Come on. Tell me!

601
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,500
Or do you wanna spend
your final few moments

602
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,750
with my friends here?

603
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,625
Suit yourself.

604
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,125
Cap.

605
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,000
Cap, he's still alive.

606
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,833
Not for long.

607
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,000
He's a fanatic.

608
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,125
It always ends the same.

609
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,750
Welcome to the war, kid.

610
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,166
Hey! What the fuck?

611
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,125
- You gotta call this in.
- Nothing to call in yet.

612
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,875
What are you talking about?
We got insurgents. We got a sniper.

613
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:14,541
That's enough to get command to listen,
to commit a fucking task force...

614
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:18,416
All we have is enough for command
to hold us up in bureaucracy three days

615
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,500
while they consider
if Perimeter's even a conversation.

616
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,375
We don't have that kind of time.

617
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:27,375
If their spies and snipers are here,
that means Koval isn't that far behind.

618
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:30,458
You said we'd deliver
the vaccines to get intel on Koval.

619
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:32,083
Where the fuck are we going?

620
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,791
I didn't say the intel was at the clinic.

621
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:37,791
This is a live-fire scenario, son.
Think you can handle it?

622
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,250
Tell me what you're hiding.

623
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,125
I'll walk back to base,
tell 'em you went rogue.

624
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:46,625
Did your motherboard freeze?

625
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,958
Stop staring at me like that.
Did your motherboard freeze?

626
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:53,791
Say something!

627
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:58,875
Why are you such
a pain in my motherfucking ass?

628
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,083
Get in the fucking truck.

629
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,833
- Who programmed you to curse so much?
- Nobody.

630
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,333
I respond to the asshole
that's in front of me.

631
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,375
- Now get in the fucking truck!
- No.

632
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,916
I'm not getting in there.

633
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,833
Okay.

634
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:13,750
Walk.

635
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,000
How long do you think
you'll survive out here on your own?

636
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:00,458
You were right to fire.

637
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,125
It was a launcher.

638
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,583
You killed two marines but saved 38.

639
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,083
They should've put
a fucking medal on your chest.

640
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,500
I did the right thing.

641
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:17,541
You mean you stepped outside your box,
and they had to put you back?

642
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,083
- Is that why you think you're here?
- I broke chain of command.

643
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,875
What about you? What's your mandate?

644
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,791
Shit, I'm no expert, but this seems
beyond protocol for a r...

645
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,208
…whatever you are.

646
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,208
Shake my hand.

647
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,250
What do you feel?

648
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,875
A hand. Soft tissue and heat...

649
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:52,791
Heat.

650
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:55,791
Grab my arm.

651
00:44:58,958 --> 00:44:59,958
What do you feel?

652
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,166
Cold. Steel.

653
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,125
Lifeless.

654
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,500
I'm not a man, Lieutenant.

655
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,458
I was created to simulate one

656
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:14,791
to the exact necessity to do my damn job.

657
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,375
I'm a combat soldier.

658
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:22,458
But I also have the ability to break
the rules in certain circumstances.

659
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:24,750
- Just like you.
- What kind of circumstances?

660
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:28,583
In extreme situations, I have
the ability to act of my own volition.

661
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:32,625
And is this an extreme situation?

662
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,500
Ask me what you really wanna ask.

663
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:35,916
How come you're so like us?

664
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:38,375
Sentient?

665
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,291
Emotional.

666
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,083
So, you equate humanity with emotion?

667
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,500
I equate it with fault.

668
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,291
People are stupid,

669
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,875
habitual, and lazy.

670
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,750
Their emotions lead to mistakes.

671
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,750
Maybe humans aren't
emotional enough, Lieutenant.

672
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:23,416
Stay close, keep your mouth shut,
and pay attention.

673
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,041
Wait here.

674
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,291
Hey, can I play?

675
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:07,333
These are your informants?

676
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,458
You finally found a friend.

677
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,958
Pleasure to meet you. Lieutenant Harp.

678
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,833
So formal.
You'll be calling me ma'am next.

679
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:32,750
I hear you had some trouble in Damsk.

680
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:35,458
The vaccines were delivered.

681
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,416
Let's go, rookie.

682
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,541
Hello.

683
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,916
I've done everything
you asked me to do, Sofiya.

684
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,833
I'm gonna need you
to level with me, please.

685
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,750
Come on.

686
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,541
Tell me what you know.

687
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:12,666
In front of him?

688
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:14,833
You can trust him.

689
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,583
- She can trust you. Right, Harp?
- Uh, yeah.

690
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, you can trust me.

691
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:27,833
The violence at the hospital…

692
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,833
It was definitely a Krasny spy?

693
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,333
As Krasny as it gets.

694
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:33,666
Fuck.

695
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,958
I think Koval's one step away
from operating the silos.

696
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,583
What? How'd you know that?

697
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:44,750
The nuclear missiles can only be operated
by highly classified access codes.

698
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:50,041
<i>When the Cold War ended,
an FSK agent got hold of those codes</i>

699
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,833
<i>and hid them in a vault.</i>

700
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,625
Somewhere this side of the city.

701
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,958
Why would he do that?

702
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:59,208
The agent figured
the codes would fetch a price.

703
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:02,166
- And Koval met that price.
- I think so.

704
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,708
If he knows where the silos are,
and he gets those codes,

705
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,291
he'll have access to nukes.

706
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,333
- Tell me where those codes are.
- I don't know.

707
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,375
If we did,
we'd have gotten to them already.

708
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,041
Well, tell me who might know.

709
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,458
Come on.

710
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,375
Well,

711
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,500
to break into a vault, the Krasny
would need to buy hardware here,

712
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:27,583
as they wouldn't be able to smuggle it
or get it through our lines.

713
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,125
What? Black market?

714
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:32,750
There's only one arsehole
with access to the weapons they'd need

715
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,791
who wouldn't think twice
about betraying us.

716
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,250
He's an arms dealer called Varyk Oshlak.

717
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,166
If they went to him,
he might know where it's located.

718
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,541
Can you take us to him?

719
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,541
You'll need weapons of your own.

720
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,833
What's all this?

721
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,708
Sadly, no discounts for the US.

722
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:07,041
What? Hold up.
You're buying weapons from her?

723
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:09,041
How do you think I pay for this orphanage?

724
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,791
You know these are illegal weapons, right?

725
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,250
You gonna arrest me, Lieutenant?

726
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:18,625
Cap?

727
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,875
- You have to do this for us.
- I know. I will.

728
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,166
- What about him?
- He'll be fine.

729
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,916
It's his first day outside the wire.

730
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,125
His first day?

731
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,375
He's a drone pilot.

732
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:55,000
How does it feel
to see your work up close?

733
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,333
My work?

734
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,833
Yeah. Most of these kids
weren't orphaned by the civil war.

735
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,833
Your bombs destroyed their homes.

736
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,250
Hey, guys, we gotta get going.
Get in the car.

737
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,833
You sure about this?

738
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,333
That's his car. He's here.

739
00:51:57,708 --> 00:52:00,958
<i>Hungry cowboy.</i>

740
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,458
I'm looking for Oshlak.

741
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,291
He's not here.

742
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:38,500
Are you Oshlak?

743
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,583
Fuck.

744
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,833
Where's Viktor Koval?

745
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,250
Damn!

746
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,083
You wanna try that again,
or should I fuck you up a little?

747
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,166
Okay, okay.

748
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,125
Hey, Sofiya.

749
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:36,875
I haven't seen you for long.

750
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:39,166
I can see how much you missed me.

751
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,500
Stop. I'll tell you whatever you want.

752
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:44,375
Did you sell weapons
to a Krasny unit this morning?

753
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:47,125
Ten men. They took delivery one hour ago.

754
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,541
Details, piece of shit.
What did you sell them?

755
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,000
XR-12s.

756
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,500
Russian Gumps?

757
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:55,708
Where's the vault?

758
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:59,083
- Well, I'm a dead man if...
- Either I kill you or Koval kills you,

759
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,666
but I'm much closer right now.

760
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,750
- Dnipro Investment.
- Passazryski street.

761
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:07,916
Let's go.

762
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,333
- What about him?
- Sofiya, no!

763
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,333
Traitor.

764
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,916
Guess he won't be needing his car.

765
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,500
I'm going to kill you!

766
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:26,666
Be careful.

767
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,958
I will.

768
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:28,875
Go.

769
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,708
Come on! Let's go.

770
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,583
- Fastest way to Passazryski street?
- Head north, take Magistral.

771
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,416
You know the streets by memory?

772
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,291
- Like a fucking cab driver.
- Like a fucking drone pilot.

773
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:53,250
We can't go up against Koval alone.
We gotta call in for backup.

774
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,166
Come on, Harp.
What's wrong? You scared?

775
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,083
At what point does your program shut down?

776
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:01,375
- At what point are you violating orders?
- That's why you're here.

777
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:05,583
Our intel investigation into the Perimeter
is not just cold. It was aborted.

778
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:08,416
I'm sorry, what?

779
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,875
An intel officer like you
can follow an aborted line,

780
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:14,041
and it's considered a hunch.
If I do it, it's a fault.

781
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:17,125
Intel would take me offline,
leaving Koval to win.

782
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:24,125
What about your internal systems?
At what point do you cross the line?

783
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,666
When you're no longer with me.

784
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,958
I requested your deployment
because I need your help.

785
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,250
That means this whole shitty time,
I'm the one breaking orders?

786
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,250
I'll go to jail! I can't do this shit.

787
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,250
- Tell me to stop the car.
- You'll stop?

788
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,833
Tell me to stop the car!

789
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,833
We're the only ones searching for him.

790
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,791
But if you don't think
it's worth your time, call it in,

791
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:46,541
they'll shut me down,
and you can fucking walk!

792
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,791
Okay, let me… Let me think.

793
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,250
- You still thinking?
- Yes!

794
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:02,333
All I'm saying is, calling in for backup
might not be such a bad idea.

795
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:03,750
That's all I'm saying.

796
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:17,666
Here we go.
Keep your eyes open, kid.

797
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,291
There's something I need you to do for me.

798
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,000
Are you sure about this?

799
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:39,750
The Russians have
the capability to detect the signal.

800
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:42,125
- They put your tracker on your back?
- Cut it out.

801
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:49,250
- Does it hurt?
- Of course it fucking hurts.

802
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,625
Okay.

803
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,083
I think I got it.

804
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:24,125
This means we're partners now?

805
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:25,458
Take it out.

806
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,833
Give it here.

807
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:35,875
Patch it.

808
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,291
Double-time.

809
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:48,750
Whoa.

810
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:54,250
Fuck.

811
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:02,083
Let's go.

812
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:14,625
Shit.

813
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:25,458
No matter what happens,
Koval can't leave with those codes.

814
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:27,458
- You ready?
- Yeah.

815
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,750
Move.

816
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:34,458
Clock my six, Gummy Bear.

817
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,375
Got you.

818
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:36,708
Go.

819
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,166
Fuck. Shit.

820
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,750
Call Eckhart.

821
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,541
Tell him Koval's in the building.

822
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,791
Wait! Wait.

823
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:18,583
You stupid fuck!

824
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,125
My bad.

825
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,208
Where's the vault?

826
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:29,625
Get them out of here!

827
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,875
- Alone?
- Now!

828
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:32,791
Fuck.

829
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,916
It's okay. I'm here. You're safe now.

830
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,250
Harp! Move!

831
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,291
Be right back.

832
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,791
Leo!

833
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:10,041
The fuck are you doing, Harp?

834
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,375
Fuck!

835
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,875
Harp! Give me your grenade!

836
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:57,541
Cap!

837
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,291
Now!

838
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:19,083
- Cap!
- Call Eckhart! I'mma get Koval!

839
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,833
Fuck. Okay.

840
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,125
Come on, come on.

841
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,208
What fucking bank?

842
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:36,416
On Passazryski street.
Koval's here. He's going after the codes.

843
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,541
<i>Leo's gone after him.</i>

844
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,458
<i>- Look, sir...</i>
- All right, stop! Stop!

845
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,666
You're not making any sense.
Koval's where?

846
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,416
Of course
I don't make any fucking sense.

847
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,000
<i>Hey! You, go. Go, go.</i>

848
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,250
Go! Go!

849
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,958
- <i>Harp!</i>
- Uh…

850
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,666
<i>Dnipro Investment!</i>

851
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,708
Pull it up.

852
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,458
<i>We found Koval. He's here.</i>

853
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:59,041
<i>It's a hostage situation.</i>

854
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,791
<i>Krasnys everywhere,
and fucking Russian Gumps.</i>

855
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,541
<i>We need to call in the Marines.</i>

856
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,541
Get me eyes on the ground.

857
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,416
Okay, go! Go!

858
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,000
Go, go, go, go!

859
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,208
That's it.

860
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,083
Good job, Harp.

861
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,583
Fuck! Shit!

862
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:11,041
Drop your weapons.
Or she will die.

863
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:14,458
Okay.

864
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:18,666
Take it easy, okay?
No one else has to get hurt.

865
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,666
Drop your weapons!

866
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,291
It's okay.

867
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,958
The Marines are coming.
I'm sure we can work this out.

868
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,583
Okay.

869
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,708
Shit. Don't pre-empt, please.

870
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,500
Okay, easy.

871
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,833
Why don't you let them go, huh?

872
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:52,666
Easy, easy, hey!

873
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,000
Let them go!

874
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,208
No one else has to get hurt.

875
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,583
- Put it down.
- Okay, fine.

876
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:03,041
- Come on!
- Look, it's all gonna be okay.

877
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,291
Okay?

878
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,375
Fuck!

879
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,083
Hey, come on. Come on!

880
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,583
Hey! Hey, you! Come on.

881
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:29,916
Oh, no! Fuck!

882
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:32,250
Move!

883
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:33,958
Move! Come on!

884
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,458
Come on!

885
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,083
Come on! Okay.

886
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,375
Back door, okay?

887
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,541
Back door.

888
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,500
Come on.

889
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:01,041
- <i>Go for Eckhart.</i>
- Gumps are firing on civilians.

890
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,958
<i>- No one in command. Where are the Marines?</i>
- They're not coming.

891
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:05,666
What are you still doing there?

892
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:09,250
<i>We're about to take out Koval.
You need to move your ass now.</i>

893
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:10,916
Take out?

894
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:13,458
You sent a drone?

895
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:16,958
<i>ETA to target,</i>
<i>T-minus two minutes.</i>

896
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:21,041
Unless you wanna be that cautionary tale,
you better move your ass, son.

897
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:28,041
There's civilians on the ground,
sir, and Leo's still in there.

898
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,666
Captain Leo's collateral.

899
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,125
<i>They're all collateral.</i>

900
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:16,250
Please, no...

901
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,625
<i>ETA to target, T-minus one minute.</i>

902
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,625
Hey! You gotta go inside now. Come on!

903
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:50,250
Come on, come on.

904
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:59,166
Fuck!

905
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:00,666
Fuck.

906
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,958
<i>Weapons are hot.</i>

907
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,250
<i>Target locked.</i>

908
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,708
Come on. Come on!

909
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,375
We're gonna go in there, okay?
Okay. You ready?

910
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,583
Let's go.

911
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:42,000
Fuck. Get down, get down!

912
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:50,750
<i>Target destroyed.</i>

913
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:52,625
Gotcha.

914
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,166
Are we okay?

915
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,125
Yeah.

916
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:22,291
Stay here.

917
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:24,291
Stay.

918
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,208
They're all dead.

919
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,250
<i>I tried to save 'em, you know.</i>

920
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:58,000
<i>I tried to save 'em.</i>

921
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,791
Now you see your work first-hand.

922
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:18,000
- <i>Goddamn, you a cold motherfucker.</i>
<i>- I'm aware we kill people, Captain.</i>

923
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:24,041
<i>Incoming!</i>

924
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:27,750
<i>I don't wanna die down here!</i>

925
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,625
<i>They were only 19 years old.</i>

926
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,458
<i>Good job, Harp.</i>

927
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,125
Did you get the codes?

928
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:49,541
The codes. Did you…

929
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,666
I got 'em.

930
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,041
Great, let's call it in.

931
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,041
What the fuck are you up to, Leo? Hmm?

932
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,333
<i>I see you, you know.</i>

933
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,166
<i>You brought me here.</i>

934
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:24,500
A drone pilot
with a history of gross disobedience,

935
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:27,833
punished and humiliated,
and with nobody to believe anything I say

936
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:31,083
unless you back it up, so tell me
what the fuck am I doing here,

937
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:32,833
and what are you using me for?

938
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,291
Sounds like you don't trust me, Harp.

939
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:37,625
That makes me upset.

940
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,833
<i>You weren't assigned, Harp.</i>

941
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:46,875
I chose you. I needed someone
who could think outside the box.

942
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,625
Leo, I'm ordering you
to return us back to base immediately

943
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:55,625
or be in breach of your moral directives.

944
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:58,625
And the fact that I can act
of my own volition scares you.

945
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,375
No, you need me to validate you.

946
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:02,250
Oh, come on! Here we go.

947
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,833
Who validates you?

948
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:05,583
You follow me, I follow you.

949
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:08,041
It's kinda like
a paradox of command, isn't it?

950
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:11,416
- I'm ordering you to stop the fucking car.
- Or what?

951
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:19,375
My backup system allows me
to relinquish the need for human authority

952
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:23,041
if said person is exhibiting
improper or impaired judgment.

953
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,250
You, my friend,

954
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:28,291
have exercised improper,
impaired judgment throughout this mission…

955
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:31,625
- Do you trust me?
- Yes, sir.

956
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:38,125
…including the removal
of one fail-safe device.

957
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:41,458
A what? You told me that was your tracker.

958
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:46,125
You disabled US military hardware.

959
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,000
Thanks to your air strike back there…

960
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,875
Tell him Koval's in the building.

961
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:52,666
…Eckhart thinks I'm destroyed.

962
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,041
Gotcha.

963
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,208
<i>War is ugly.</i>

964
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,000
Sometimes you gotta get dirty
to see any real change.

965
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:07,583
Hey, hey! Don't grow balls now.

966
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,791
Put it down.

967
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:14,541
There you go.

968
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,708
You owe me more than this, man.

969
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:21,166
Nah, kid.

970
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,750
I just saved your fucking life.

971
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:17,458
Fuck!

972
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,250
Can't fucking breathe in here.

973
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,750
Hello?
I can't fucking breathe in here!

974
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,500
The boss is coming! Be quiet.

975
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,000
What the fuck is that?

976
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:14,708
Sodium pentothal.

977
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:17,458
It's truth serum.
You'll tell us all we need to know.

978
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:19,791
The boss?

979
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,458
Jesus Christ.

980
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,875
- Are you the leader of the Resistance?
- Are you our enemy?

981
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,125
No. No, I'm not your fucking enemy.

982
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:32,916
I-I don't have any information.

983
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,083
It wasn't pentothal.
It was antibiotic for your wounds.

984
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:43,375
Right. Awesome joke.

985
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,458
Hilarious, comical, very fucking funny.

986
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:46,875
Can you untie me now?

987
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,208
- Not until I know you're no threat.
- I'm not a threat. Leo is.

988
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,125
- I think he's going after Perimeter.
- No, he's going for Koval.

989
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:55,333
- Then he's going for Perimeter.
- Koval's dead.

990
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,791
- He died in the bank strike.
- He wasn't there.

991
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,458
He's still very much alive.

992
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:13,791
<i>Leo's going to take control of
the nuclear missiles for the Resistance.</i>

993
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,000
For us.

994
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:21,541
I told you I'd get the codes, Viktor.

995
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,291
General Koval.

996
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,958
Why would you try to kill me?

997
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:35,916
Oh, Leo…

998
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,666
I took insurance.

999
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,708
I am your insurance.

1000
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:52,750
You have the codes?

1001
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,916
Give them.

1002
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,916
What's stopping me
from killing you and taking it?

1003
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,708
You honestly think
I would have them with me, Viktor?

1004
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,541
I'm not an idiot.

1005
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,666
That would make me human.

1006
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:23,875
That's what he told you.

1007
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:27,416
- We trust in Leo.
- You trust in Leo?

1008
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:31,583
He's more likely to take control
of the nukes himself, and he used you.

1009
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,166
- He told you that?
- Not in so many words.

1010
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:40,625
I don't know exactly why he's doing it,
but you can't trust him.

1011
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:42,916
He's a machine, Sofiya.

1012
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,666
What do you want?

1013
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:51,166
I want the location of Perimeter.

1014
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,666
What do I get in return?

1015
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,625
I'll let you live.

1016
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:07,083
I didn't know your kind
had such a sense of humor.

1017
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:15,375
It's incredible
what man is able to create.

1018
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,250
I think I know Leo
better than you, Lieutenant Harp.

1019
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:23,708
You see, Leo, he can't lie to himself.

1020
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:27,541
<i>He can't pretend
there's virtue in an immoral act.</i>

1021
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,333
<i>That's why he's gone rogue.</i>

1022
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:35,041
- He's learned who the real enemy is.
- The real enemy. Who? The US military?

1023
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,041
They rationalize this war
because it serves their fucking agenda.

1024
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,833
This is a peacekeeping mission.

1025
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:40,875
"Peace."

1026
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,500
Russia wants its former territories back.

1027
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:48,083
The US wants to destabilize Russia
by extending conflict in those countries.

1028
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:51,125
We are the ones
who want fucking peace, Lieutenant Harp.

1029
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,500
And if Leo's rogue operation
makes sure you leave us in peace,

1030
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:58,416
if your war machine turns against you,
well then, why should I fucking care?

1031
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,125
<i>A crazy terrorist with nukes.</i>

1032
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,750
<i>Downtown Washington, New York…</i>

1033
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:09,625
Who knows?

1034
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:16,333
He's gonna launch
a nuclear strike on the US.

1035
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:23,125
Innocent people will die.

1036
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:29,208
Aren't they just collateral?

1037
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,750
Or not when it's American lives.

1038
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:37,083
It's not collateral. It's mass murder.
You can't let him do this.

1039
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,875
What will you do with so much power?

1040
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,833
That's between me and my creator.

1041
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:48,125
Philosophical.

1042
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,625
What would you do with it, Viktor?

1043
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,541
I will guarantee world peace.

1044
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:03,041
- I knew you would say that.
- Well, yeah. Can you say the same?

1045
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:04,208
We'll see.

1046
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:09,875
Now we have a deal.

1047
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:14,291
I take Perimeter.

1048
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,083
Then I dictate.

1049
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:21,875
Let's forget what happened.

1050
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:24,125
We can be good allies
in the worst to come.

1051
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:29,833
Don't make me have to ruin
this marvel of American technology.

1052
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:33,958
Viktor Koval,

1053
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,916
the Terror of the Balkans.

1054
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,458
My man,

1055
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:42,541
what makes you think
that you're still calling shots?

1056
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,583
You should have never tried to kill me.

1057
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,666
How many people will die?

1058
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,875
How many people will die, Sofiya?

1059
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,250
Can't answer it, can you?

1060
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,916
<i>Enough to teach Americans</i>
<i>about collateral damage.</i>

1061
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,083
You're on your own.

1062
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:00,000
What?

1063
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:02,291
Go home. It's over.

1064
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,333
<i>Spasiba,</i> Viktor.

1065
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:51,208
Halt!

1066
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:57,250
Stay where you are!

1067
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:01,833
I said, stay where you are!

1068
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:03,750
Down on the ground!

1069
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,375
Dismissed. At ease.

1070
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:26,750
What the hell's going on?

1071
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,708
Sergeant Miller has been briefed
on Operation Leo. Go ahead.

1072
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:34,375
Leo's alive, sir.

1073
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:37,208
He's gone AWOL.

1074
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:39,666
Right.

1075
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,041
I appreciate
that you had a rough time out there.

1076
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:46,375
Captain Leo was destroyed.
We lost his signal immediately.

1077
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:49,125
He lost his signal
'cause I removed his fail-safe.

1078
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:51,125
You did what?

1079
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:54,291
I know I fucked up, okay?
But, sir, you've gotta listen to me.

1080
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,833
Leo has the codes,
and he's going after the silos.

1081
01:26:56,916 --> 01:26:58,208
He's on his way to Koval.

1082
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,875
You said Koval was at the bank.

1083
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:02,458
- He's dead.
- Leo tricked me. Koval was never there.

1084
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:06,000
Wanted me to call in the drone strike
so it would appear he'd been destroyed.

1085
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,833
You could've turned back,
he would've been forced to comply.

1086
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:13,000
Leo's smarter than we are. He's stronger,
faster, and he can be very persuasive.

1087
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:16,166
This Viktor Koval Perimeter stuff,
it's all bullshit!

1088
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,916
Anything to it,
Intel would've made it priority.

1089
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,250
- I am the fucking Intel!
- Sit down!

1090
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,166
I saw the heist, sir.

1091
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:30,583
I was eyes on the ground.

1092
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,291
Perimeter's real, sir.

1093
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,833
- And Leo's going after it.
- I thought Koval was.

1094
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:40,083
Leo's playing the Krasnys
and the Resistance against each other.

1095
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:43,041
They all have the same goal.

1096
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,583
Nuke the US mainland.

1097
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:49,958
-But Leo is calling the shots.

1098
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,333
Impossible. He can't...

1099
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:55,291
He can! He put a gun to my head and said
something about a paradox of command.

1100
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:59,041
Me using my judgment
triggered his fail-safe directive

1101
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:02,375
to relinquish his need
to follow human authority.

1102
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:09,791
Jesus Christ.

1103
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,875
- How do you know he's gonna meet Koval?
- It's a long fucking story.

1104
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:19,958
Sir, we don't have time for this, okay?

1105
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,708
- We've gotta find him fast.
- How?

1106
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:24,291
Hmm? You made that practically impossible,
Lieutenant.

1107
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,000
How's he getting around?

1108
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:29,125
Oshlak's car.

1109
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,458
Who the fuck is Oshlak?

1110
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:35,166
Arms dealer.
We've been tracking him for months.

1111
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:40,666
It'll take us hours to go through Central.

1112
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,458
Do you have a phone?

1113
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,041
Corporal Bale.

1114
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:45,916
Bale, it's Harp.

1115
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:49,125
- Harp?
<i>- I need your help fast.</i>

1116
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,708
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later

1117
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:52,083
for now, trust me, okay?

1118
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:54,916
Bale?

1119
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,041
Bale?

1120
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,291
- Okay.
- Help me.

1121
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:00,208
Okay.

1122
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:04,625
Okay. Do we have any surveillance drones
out in the Snovski District

1123
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,083
along the Russian border?

1124
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,083
<i>Let me see.</i>

1125
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,500
- Got a Global Hawk Asset in the area.
- Okay. I need information

1126
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:22,458
<i>on a black Escalade, registration 1209.</i>

1127
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:24,583
- Heading east at high-speed.
- Roger that.

1128
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,500
<i>Is this what you're looking for?</i>

1129
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,666
Yes, that's him. Okay, okay. Stay on him.

1130
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:43,666
Copy that.

1131
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,041
<i>Don't lose him, Bale.</i>

1132
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:58,125
<i>He's in disputed territory</i>
<i>on the Russian border.</i>

1133
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:02,666
I can't send forces over unverified intel.
I will start a war with the Russians.

1134
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:04,166
You don't have to, sir.

1135
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,500
I'll go.

1136
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:08,208
Harp, you said it yourself.

1137
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:10,625
He's stronger, faster, smarter.

1138
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:13,625
- Once I find him, I'll call it in.
- And then what?

1139
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:19,208
Can we drone strike the silos
without detonating the warheads?

1140
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:22,875
It'll take out the command center
and disarm the missiles.

1141
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,291
What if you don't get to him?

1142
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:28,125
Then deny we had this conversation
and pray I'm wrong about his plans.

1143
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:32,541
Clock's ticking, Colonel.

1144
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,791
I fucked up, sir.

1145
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,291
Let me do the right thing.

1146
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:49,958
Incendiary rounds.
Designed to go through armored vehicles.

1147
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:53,250
- Those are gonna hurt.
- Might up your chances against Leo.

1148
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,041
- Yeah.
- Your vehicle's ready.

1149
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:58,125
GPS is connected to the Global Hawk.

1150
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,500
You should be good to go.

1151
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:02,166
Thanks.

1152
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,625
Look, Miller, appreciate your support.

1153
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,500
- I hope I never see you again after this.
- Yeah. I'll try not to disappoint you.

1154
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:14,500
Good luck.

1155
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:36,708
Harp, we've lost visuals of target.

1156
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:39,375
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>So where the fuck am I going?</i>

1157
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,583
Come on, Bale.

1158
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,750
Sending last coordinates now.

1159
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,250
Harp?

1160
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:14,958
<i>You're right at the Russian border.
Be careful.</i>

1161
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,583
<i>Harp?</i>
<i>I want cast-iron confirmation</i>

1162
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:34,416
<i>that we are taking out our operative,
and our operative only. Do you copy?</i>

1163
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:37,541
Copy that, sir.

1164
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:15,875
Fuck.

1165
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:50,125
Eckhart, come in.

1166
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,916
<i>Give me a second. Patching through.</i>

1167
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,750
Harp, according to your tracker,
you're in the Dastriz Complex.

1168
01:33:58,291 --> 01:34:00,666
Been fucking flying
over that place for years.

1169
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,041
Do you have visual on Captain Leo

1170
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,833
<i>or the Perimeter missiles? Over.</i>

1171
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:07,333
- Negative, sir.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1172
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:09,416
Drone is in position.

1173
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,250
Your confirmation brings the rain.

1174
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:12,750
Fuck.

1175
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:56,208
What the fuck are you doing here, rookie?

1176
01:36:58,291 --> 01:37:01,791
The war is fucking bullshit,
but setting off those nukes

1177
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:05,041
- won't solve anything!
- Says the man that killed two to save 38.

1178
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:08,250
- And you'll kill a million.
- And I'll save a hundred million.

1179
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,708
<i>We're picking up</i>
<i>significant heat readings.</i>

1180
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,333
Sir.

1181
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,625
I see it, Bale. Stand by.

1182
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,291
<i>Alpha Three, come in.</i>

1183
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:59,083
<i>Harp, drone is in position to strike.</i>

1184
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:00,708
<i>I need a sit-report. Over.</i>

1185
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,000
<i>Harp, I repeat.
Drone in position to strike.</i>

1186
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:11,041
I need a sit-report now.

1187
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:23,541
Okay.
Designed to go through armored vehicles.

1188
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,333
Hey, Leo!

1189
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:27,208
Try this.

1190
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:31,083
That hurt, rookie.

1191
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:55,291
Okay. How do you switch it off?

1192
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,083
How the fuck do you switch it off?

1193
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:00,666
Go home.

1194
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,875
Go home to Olivia Rose Meyer.

1195
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:06,000
How the fuck do you switch it off?

1196
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,583
You can't.

1197
01:40:07,666 --> 01:40:10,500
Harp, this is Eckhart.
Can you confirm eyes on Leo? Over.

1198
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:15,416
- Why the fuck are you doing this, Leo?
<i>- Harp, do you copy?</i>

1199
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:20,250
Remove the humanity, increase the fight.

1200
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,291
What?

1201
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:26,125
Machine versus machine.

1202
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:33,791
The world's first use
of a fully autonomous cyborg backfires.

1203
01:40:36,458 --> 01:40:40,458
What are you saying you want?
You want them to shut the program down?

1204
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:44,083
For a long, long time.

1205
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:46,375
No.

1206
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:50,291
No, no,
it's never that simple with you, Leo.

1207
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:53,583
You've been lying this whole time,
why the fuck would I believe you anyway?

1208
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:58,750
Believe what you want, but this…

1209
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:05,833
…this is the motherfucking truth.

1210
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:13,375
I have to destroy the monster.

1211
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:17,625
Destroy myself.

1212
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,250
My creator.

1213
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:22,166
The US.

1214
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:27,916
They need to understand
that these wars must end,

1215
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:32,875
and I am the face of never-ending war.

1216
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:42,875
Millions will die, Leo.

1217
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:44,916
Get the hell outta here.

1218
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:53,500
How about we do it my way?

1219
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,583
This is Lieutenant Harp.

1220
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:01,833
Confirming eyes on Leo.

1221
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,125
- Over.
- <i>Confirmed.</i>

1222
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,458
Positive ID. Preparing to engage.

1223
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:08,958
Weapons are hot.

1224
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,208
Target locked.

1225
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,000
<i>You just tell us
when to hit that red button, Harp.</i>

1226
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,916
Jesus Christ! Better move your ass.

1227
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,333
<i>Harp, do you copy?</i>

1228
01:42:23,416 --> 01:42:24,416
Don't do it.

1229
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,208
Harp.

1230
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:31,833
You know this makes sense.

1231
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:33,666
It's the greater good.

1232
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:38,375
You, of all people,
should understand that.

1233
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,833
Harp!

1234
01:42:43,916 --> 01:42:46,250
The missiles have range to the US.

1235
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:49,125
<i>- We've got to pull the trigger.</i>
- Sir?

1236
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:51,500
For fuck's sake.

1237
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:54,666
The drone strike is imminent.
Clear out of there, Alpha Three.

1238
01:42:55,708 --> 01:42:56,541
No.

1239
01:42:58,541 --> 01:42:59,666
You're wrong.

1240
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:02,833
Humans can learn to do better.

1241
01:43:04,791 --> 01:43:07,125
<i>That</i> is the greater good, Leo.

1242
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:10,708
<i>Harp, goddammit, do you copy?</i>

1243
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,083
Bale,

<i>DA1 off the rail in 30.</i>

1245
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:21,250
I need you to move your ass now.

1246
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:38,041
Please, don't be in there, Harp.

1247
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,416
<i>Weapon's away.</i>

1248
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:07,791
Target destroyed.

1249
01:44:08,625 --> 01:44:09,666
Missile disarmed.

1250
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:14,416
- Good job, everybody! Well done.
- All right!

1251
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:20,083
Alpha Three, come in.

1252
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:25,041
Harp, this is Eckhart. Do you copy?

1253
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:29,583

<i>Eckhart, come in.</i>

01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:54,250
Mission complete.

1258
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:57,458
Returning back to base.

<i>Over.</i>

Great job, kid.

1262
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:07,083
<i>You just saved the world.</i>

1263
01:45:21,583 --> 01:45:23,458
<i>Harp, you should be proud, son.</i>

1264
01:45:26,625 --> 01:45:28,625
<i>I already spoke to your captain, Brydon.</i>

1265

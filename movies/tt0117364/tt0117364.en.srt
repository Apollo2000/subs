00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,057
<i>The best part of a kiss,
I think,</i>

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,935
<i>is when you see that head
coming towards you</i>

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,105
<i>and you know
that you're going to get kissed.</i>

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,942
<i>That moment just before
is so exquisite.</i>

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>I'd never felt
the touch of another person my age.</i>

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>The sensation flew through me.</i>

8
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,785
<i>I love it.
I love kissing.</i>

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:40,581
<i>We were addicted to
that being entwined with each other,</i>

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,752
<i>whether it was really positive
or negative.</i>

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>I get this intense
look that says "I'm so mysterious,"</i>

12
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,344
<i>"and there's so much more to me
than meets the eye to find out..."</i>

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,680
<i>I believe in fate,</i>

14
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,476
<i>so that person will find me,
or we'll find each other somehow.</i>

15
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,022
<i>It means finding
a mirror, the clearest mirror</i>

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,733
<i>and the most loyal mirror,</i>

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>so when I love that person, I know
that they'll shine that back to me.</i>

00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:43,205
The Portrait of a Lady (1996)

19
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,413
There's one thing more, Miss Archer.

20
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,501
You know,
if you don't like Lockleigh,

21
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,129
if you think it's too damp
or anything of that sort,

22
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,341
you need never go
within 50 miles of it.

23
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,345
It's not damp, by the way. I've had
the house thoroughly examined,

24
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,349
and it's perfectly safe,
but if you shouldn't fancy it,

25
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,685
you needn't dream of living in it.

26
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,937
There's no difficulty about that.

27
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,314
I've plenty of houses.

28
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,151
I thought to let you know.

29
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,614
Some people don't like a moat,
you know.

30
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,118
I adore a moat.

31
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,416
I'm very sure you know...

32
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,337
I don't go off easily...

33
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,550
but when I'm touched,
it's for life, Miss Archer.

34
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,928
It's for life.

35
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,149
Look, here comes Miss Archer.

36
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,155
No... She's going up
to the house.

37
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:45,159
So she is.
Where is Lord Warburton?

38
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,369
He was with her.

39
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,205
Bunchie, go back. Back.

40
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,622
Shall I sit with you
until dinner, Daddy?

41
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,459
I would like that, but Isabel
has asked to talk with me.

42
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,338
Come in, my dear.

43
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,761
Do sit down. Hmm?

44
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,308
Ahem.

45
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,528
Uncle, I...

46
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,157
I ought to let you know that...

47
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,619
Lord Warburton has asked me
to marry him.

48
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,287
Well!

49
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,666
I told you you'd be
a success over here.

50
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,252
Americans are highly appreciated...

51
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,712
and you're very beautiful, you know.

52
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,090
Oh, yes, of course. I'm lovely.

53
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,387
I...

54
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,726
I know it seems tasteless
and ungrateful...

55
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,690
but I can't marry him.

56
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,862
You didn't find his proposal
sufficiently attractive?

57
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,738
It was attractive.

58
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:52,661
There was a moment when I would have
given my little finger to say yes,

59
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,330
but...

60
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,626
I think I have to begin by getting
a general impression of life.

61
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,628
Do you see?

62
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,632
And there's a light that has to dawn.

63
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,263
I can't explain it, but...

64
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,348
I know it's there.

65
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,022
I'm not afraid, you know.

66
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,357
He's a very fine man.

67
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,277
He earns 100,000 a year...

68
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,447
about half a dozen houses
to live in...

69
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:33,076
and a seat in Parliament
as I have one at my own dinner table.

70
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,037
Well...

71
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,332
I hope very much
I have no more offers.

72
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,417
They upset me completely.

73
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,630
Isabel, your uncle is quite right.

74
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,467
You certainly cannot go to London
without a proper escort.

75
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,261
Well, my friend Henrietta
will be with me.

76
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,097
Your friend sounds rather bohemian,

77
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,975
and no doubt she will want to stay
at a boarding house.

78
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,604
Ralph has put you down at his club.

79
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,606
With Ralph, you can go anywhere.

80
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,942
Isn't anything proper here?

81
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,028
You're too fond
of your own ways, miss.

82
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,030
Yes, I'm very fond of them.

83
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,827
Isabel, I do not expect you
to always heed my advice.

84
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,872
But as you have
neither mother nor father,

85
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,376
I do expect you to listen to it.

86
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,599
Hup, hup, hup.

87
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,144
Shall I love
your reporter friend or hate her?

88
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,189
Whichever you do will matter
little to Henrietta.

89
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,526
She doesn't care a straw
what men think of her.

90
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,571
- Will she interview me?
- You're not important enough.

91
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,492
Henrietta!

92
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,967
- So sad.
- Morbid, isn't it?

93
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,060
When I wrote to you from Liverpool,

94
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,439
I said I had something
in particular to tell you.

95
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,735
You haven't asked me what it is yet.

96
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,488
Is it because you suspected?

97
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,991
Mmm... Suspected what?

98
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,993
What have you to tell me?

99
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,080
What I have to tell you
is about your American admirer.

100
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:46,668
Mr. Goodwood has come over
on the steamer with me.

101
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,879
Oh!

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,881
You say that right.

103
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,925
He's come after you.

104
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,887
Did he tell you so?

105
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,180
No.

106
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,390
He told me... nothing.

107
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,269
- But I spoke of you a great deal.
- I'm sorry you did that.

108
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,065
Oh, no. It was a pleasure to me.
I like the way he listened.

109
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,987
He was so quiet,

110
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,739
so intense.

111
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,532
He drank it all in.

112
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,826
He thinks too well of me already.

113
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,953
He oughtn't be encouraged.

114
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,748
He's dying
for a little encouragement.

115
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,416
Shh!

116
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,797
I can see his face now.

117
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,383
And his look while we talked.

118
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,137
I... I've never seen an ugly man
look so handsome.

119
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,142
He's very simple-minded...

120
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,144
and he's not so ugly.

121
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,274
Does your cousin go around all day
with his hands in his pockets?

122
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,610
What does he do for a living?

123
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,822
He's terribly ill.
He's quite unfit for work.

124
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,782
Don't you believe it.

125
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,826
I work when I'm sick.

126
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,956
I should like to show him up.
He'd make a beautiful specimen.

127
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,881
Daddy and I lived here
when he worked at the bank.

128
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,883
We don't use it now.

129
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,139
I love this time of day,
just as it gets dark.

130
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,725
Don't you?

131
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,353
- Ralph?
- Huh?

132
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,612
- May I light a cigarette?
- You may do what you please,

133
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,948
as long as you'll amuse me.

134
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,291
What had you in mind
when you refused Warburton?

135
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,171
I have his leave to let you know
he has told me.

136
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,590
Did...?

137
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,176
Did he ask you to talk to me?

138
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,095
No, not that. He...

139
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,723
told me because he couldn't help it.

140
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,226
We're old friends,
and he was very heavy-hearted.

141
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,065
What had I in mind
when I refused him?

142
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,488
What logic dictated
so remarkable an act?

143
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,865
Why do you call it remarkable?

144
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,160
As a man, Warburton
is hardly at fault.

145
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,538
I refused him because
he was too perfect, then.

146
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:38,048
If you've really given Warburton
his final answer, I'm rather glad.

147
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,219
I don't mean I'm glad for you,
and still less, of course, for him.

148
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,221
I'm glad for myself.

149
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,686
Are you thinking of proposing to me?

150
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,526
What I mean
is that I shall have the thrill

151
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:02,614
of seeing what a young lady does
who won't marry Lord Warburton.

152
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,328
You asked about logic.

153
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,373
I'll tell you.

154
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,044
- It's that I can't escape my fate.
- Your fate?

155
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,424
It's not my fate to give up.

156
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,344
You call marrying Lord Warburton
giving up?

157
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,139
It's getting a great deal,
but it's giving up other chances.

158
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,100
Chances for what?

159
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,688
I don't mean chances to marry.
I mean...

160
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,358
from life...

161
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,529
from the usual chances and dangers.

162
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,536
You've answered my question.

163
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,414
It seems to me
I've told you very little.

164
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,624
You've told me the great thing.

165
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,420
The world interests you.
You want to throw yourself into it.

166
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:03,258
- I never said that.
- You meant it. Don't repudiate it.

167
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,260
It's so fine.

168
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:21,568
There he is, the Great Santini.

169
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,404
Go on. Pull!

170
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,032
Pull! Pull!

171
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,853
How did you know I was here?

172
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,022
Miss Stackpole let me know.

173
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,069
That is not kind of her.

174
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,783
You said you hoped never to hear
from me again. I know that.

175
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,661
But I never accepted
any such rule as my own.

176
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,163
I didn't say I hoped
never to hear from you.

177
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,958
Not for five years, then.
Ten, twenty, it's the same thing.

178
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,213
What good do you expect
to get by insisting?

179
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,676
I disgust you very much.

180
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,260
Yes.

181
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,139
You don't at all delight me.

182
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,768
You don't fit in,
not in any way. Not now.

183
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,773
Think of me or not.
Only leave me alone.

184
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,901
Until when?

185
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,364
For a year... or two.

186
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,993
Well, which?
Between one year and two,

187
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,830
there's all the difference
in the world.

188
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,083
Call it two, then.

189
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,923
You'll marry someone else
as sure as I stand here.

190
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,843
I don't wish to be
a mere sheep in the flock.

191
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,970
I shall probably never marry.

192
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:17,434
If you hear it rumored I'm near
marrying, remember what I've said...

193
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,770
and doubt it.

194
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,359
I hate to lose sight of you.

195
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,454
Goodbye.

196
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,481
Hmm.

197
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,416
<i>I love you.</i>

198
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,707
You acted very wrongly.

199
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,294
You don't mean to tell me
you've sent him off?

200
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,464
I asked him to leave me alone,

201
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,550
and I ask you the same, Henrietta.

202
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,844
If you marry one of these people,

203
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,056
I'll never speak to you again.

204
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,266
You better wait till I'm asked.

205
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,645
Oh, you'll be asked quick enough.

206
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,607
Annie Climber was asked
three times in Italy.

207
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,109
Poor, plain, little Annie.

208
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,614
Well, if Annie Climber
wasn't captured, why should I be?

209
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,534
Well, I don't believe
Annie was pressed, but you'll be.

210
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,208
Do you know where you're going,
Isabel Archer?

211
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,543
No, and it's very pleasant not to.

212
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,713
You're drifting off
to some great mistake.

213
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,715
You make me shudder.

214
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,851
My father's had an attack
of his old malady.

215
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,771
It's quite severe, I'm afraid.

216
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,818
By great good luck,
Dr. Matthew Hope is in town,

217
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,488
and I shall make sure of
his coming down to Gardencourt.

218
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,450
There's... an express train at 2.45,

219
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,620
and you shall come with me or not,
as you prefer.

220
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,915
I shall go with you. I'll pack now.

221
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,717
I'm not at peace about Isabel.

222
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:05,304
I fear she may marry one of these
Europeans, and I want to prevent it.

223
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,601
What a rage you have
for organizing people.

224
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,521
I simply want her to marry
Mr. Caspar Goodwood.

225
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,482
He's followed her
all the way from Boston.

226
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,737
He was here, last night.

227
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,822
In Pratt's?

228
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,701
Mmm. It was a little plot of mine.

229
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,413
Is she very fond of him?

230
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,749
If she isn't, she ought to be.

231
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,043
He's simply wrapped up in her.

232
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,590
Three months ago, she gave him every
reason to suspect he was acceptable,

233
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,427
and it's not really of Isabel
to go back on a friend

234
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,889
simply because
she's changed the scene.

235
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,143
Isabel... was cruel?

236
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,312
She gave him no satisfaction.

237
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,981
Her only idea was to be rid of him.

238
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,111
Poor Mr. Goodwood.

239
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:40,233
Sir Matthew, he had some kind
of seizure last night,

240
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,860
but I feel a dreadful
cold coming on.

241
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,655
- You will leave me a powder?
- Of course.

242
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,827
Oh, my great friend from Rome
has arrived.

243
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,037
You will stay for tea?

244
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,572
It's very beautiful,

245
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,035
and your playing makes it
more beautiful still.

246
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,247
You don't think I disturbed
Mr. Touchett, then?

247
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:03,042
His room is so far away,
and I play just...

248
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,211
just un peu des doigts.

249
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,675
No, I... I should think
that to hear such lovely music

250
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,261
would make him feel better.

251
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,805
I'm afraid there are moments in life

252
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,933
when even Schubert
has nothing to say to us.

253
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,987
Would...
Would you play something more?

254
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,783
If it will
give you pleasure, delighted.

255
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:45,209
Are you the niece, the young American?

256
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:50,131
- I'm my aunt's niece.
- C'est bon. We're compatriots.

257
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm Madame Merle.

258
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,971
Mmm.

259
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,823
Who's that with me?

260
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,825
Is it my son?

261
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,661
Yes, it's your son, Daddy.

262
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,749
- Is there no one else?
- No one else.

263
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,501
Cigarette.

264
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,974
What you should do when I'm gone

265
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,976
is to marry.

266
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,939
What do you think of your cousin?

267
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:39,532
Do I... do I understand you to propose
that I should marry Isabel?

268
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:43,202
Well, that's what
it comes to in the end.

269
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,329
Don't you like Isabel?

270
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,500
Yes, very much.
I like Isabel very much.

271
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,129
- I've thought a great deal about it.
- So have I.

272
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,423
I don't mind telling you that.

273
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,550
You're in love with her, then?

274
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:01,887
I should think you would be.
It's as if she came over on purpose.

275
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,063
No, I'm not in love with her, but...

276
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,444
I should be, if...
certain things were different.

277
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,698
Things are always different
from what they might be.

278
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,411
I shall not live many years...

279
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,999
but I hope long enough to see
what Isabel does with herself.

280
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,419
I should like
to do something for her.

281
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,797
- I should like to make her rich.
- What do you mean by rich?

282
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,091
I call people rich

283
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:43,220
when they're able to meet the
requirements of their imagination.

284
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,347
To do what she likes with it?

285
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,475
Absolutely what she likes.

286
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,520
Good boy.

287
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,481
You win.

288
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,400
Down.

289
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,698
Who is this Madame Merle?

290
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,202
She's very charming.

291
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,829
She plays beautifully.

292
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,666
- She does everything beautifully.
- You don't like her.

293
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,377
On the contrary,
I was once in love with her.

294
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,047
And she didn't care for you?

295
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,132
That's why you don't like her?

296
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,093
How can we have
discussed such things?

297
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,387
Monsieur Merle was then living.

298
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,848
Is he dead now?

299
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,725
So she says.

300
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,727
Don't you believe her?

301
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,773
Yes, because...

302
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,735
the husband of Madame Merle
would be likely to pass away.

303
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,698
Am I late?

304
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,992
I do apologise.

305
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,994
No, not at all.

306
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,792
Are you aware of the beautiful
walking paths round the estate?

307
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,967
Americans certainly
make poor Europeans.

308
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,929
We've no natural place here.

309
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,058
But a woman, it seems to me,
has no natural place anywhere.

310
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,062
Wherever she finds herself,
she must stay on the surface,

311
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,189
and more or less crawl.

312
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,691
I shall never crawl.

313
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,819
Yes. On the whole,
I don't see you crawling.

314
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,740
But the men, the Americans?

315
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,909
Look at poor Ralph Touchett.

316
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,620
What sort of figure do you call that?

317
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,957
Fortunately, he has consumption.

318
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,877
I say fortunately because
it gives him something to do.

319
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,839
His consumption's his... carrier.

320
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,216
It's a kind of position.

321
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,927
If he were not ill,
he'd do something.

322
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,888
He'd take his father's
place in the bank.

323
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,516
I doubt it.
He's not at all fond of the bank.

324
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:57,229
- Are you not good friends?
- Perfectly!

325
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,231
But he doesn't like me.

326
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,650
What have you done to him?

327
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,360
Nothing whatever,

328
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,113
but one has no need
of a reason for that.

329
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,409
For not liking you? I think one
has need of a very good reason.

330
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,412
Ah. I love the English rain.

331
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,499
There's always a little of it
and never too much at once.

332
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,252
And it always... smells good.

333
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,422
Ah, delicious!

334
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,217
Mmm, delicious!

335
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,888
Mmm, it is!

336
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,990
I'd give a good deal
to be your age again,

337
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,701
to have my life before me.

338
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,579
Your life's before you yet.

339
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,250
No. The best part's gone,
and gone for nothing.

340
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,378
Oh, surely not for nothing.

341
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,547
Why not? What have I got?

342
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:10,844
Neither husband
nor child nor fortune.

343
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,181
Nor even a house of my own.

344
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:18,435
What should you like to
do that you've not done?

345
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,151
I'm very ambitious.

346
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,197
To me,
you're the vivid image of success.

347
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:39,039
My dreams were so... great.

348
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:48,257
I should make myself ridiculous
by talking of them.

349
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,303
I should like you to have this.

350
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,098
I am going to six places
in succession,

351
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,518
and I shall meet no one
I like so well as you.

352
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,412
Ahem.

353
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,891
He has left me this house, but
naturally, I shall not live in it.

354
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,896
I have a much better one
in Florence, as you know.

355
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,316
And Ralph gets Gardencourt.

356
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,905
Serena, there is one remarkable
clause in my husband's will.

357
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,949
I'll ring for tea?

358
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,036
He has left my niece a fortune.

359
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,290
- A fortune?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:50,254
Isabel steps into
something like £70,000.

361
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,553
The clever creature.

362
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,206
She seems to me very genteel.

363
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,178
She's really pretty.

364
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,892
When her mother died, I sent her
to see what you'd make of her.

365
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,935
I had faith, you know.

366
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:51,023
She's perfect. She has no faults.

367
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,859
We've had her
since she was so small.

368
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,446
- It's not certain you'll lose her.
- Monsieur,

369
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,407
good as she is,
she's not one of us.

370
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,994
She's made for the world.

371
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,914
Nothing's settled yet.

372
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,675
- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.

373
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,105
It's only the color
that's different, Mama.

374
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,651
There are just as many
in one bunch as in the other.

375
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,027
Grazie.

376
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,865
Is there someone here?

377
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,535
Yes, there is. Someone you may see.

378
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,081
- Madame Merle.
- I've come to welcome you home.

379
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,334
May I not go to the carriage?

380
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,796
It would please me better
if you'd remain with me.

381
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,223
I do hope they see
that you wear gloves.

382
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,977
Little girls usually dislike them.

383
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,063
I used to dislike them,
but I like them now.

384
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,274
I'll make you a present of a dozen.

385
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:20,737
- And will they be very pretty?
- Not too pretty.

386
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,577
She's going to give me some gloves.

387
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,375
You're very kind to her.
But she has everything she needs.

388
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,919
I'd think
she's had enough of the nuns.

389
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,630
If we're discussing it,
she should leave.

390
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,550
Let her stay.
We'll talk of something else.

391
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,558
Go into the garden, mignonne,
and pluck a flower for our friend?

392
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,768
That's just what I want to do.

393
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,412
There's something I should
like you to do in Florence.

394
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,421
There's a friend of mine
I want you to know.

395
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,716
What good will that do me?

396
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,929
It will amuse you.

397
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,020
Oh, if only I could induce you
to make an effort.

398
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,231
Ah, I knew
something tiresome was coming.

399
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:43,403
What in the world that's likely to
show up here is worth an effort?

400
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,660
Don't be foolish, Osmond.

401
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,624
The person I came to Florence to see.

402
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,961
She's a niece of Mrs. Touchett.

403
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:06,551
She's young, 23 years old.
I met her in England six months ago.

404
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,679
I like her immensely.

405
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,894
And I do what I don't
do every day, I...

406
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,356
admire her.

407
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,983
You'll do the same.

408
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,487
Not if I can help it.

409
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,323
You won't be able to help it.

410
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,701
Is she beautiful,
clever, rich, splendid,

411
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,248
universally intelligent,
unprecedentedly virtuous?

412
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:40,502
It's only on those conditions
that I care to make her acquaintance.

413
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,297
I know plenty of dingy people.
I don't want to know any more.

414
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,508
Miss Archer isn't dingy.

415
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,138
She fills all your requirements.

416
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,889
More or less, of course.

417
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,852
No. Quite literally.

418
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,910
What do you want to do with her?

419
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:22,669
What you see. Put her in your way.

420
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,550
Isn't she meant
for something better than that?

421
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,636
I don't pretend to know
what people are meant for.

422
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,097
I only know what I can do with them.

423
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,725
I'm sorry for Miss Archer.

424
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:42,772
If that's the beginning of interest
in her, I take note of it.

425
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,774
You're looking very well.

426
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,197
You never look so well
as when you've got an idea.

427
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,909
They're always becoming to you.

428
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:03,168
I wish very much
you were not so heartless.

429
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,839
It's always been against you,
and it will be against you now.

430
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,717
I'm not so heartless as you think.

431
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:16,890
Every now and then
something... touches me.

432
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,768
As for instance,
your ambitions for me.

433
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:24,522
Why would you think Mrs. Touchett's
niece should matter to me when...

434
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,775
..I myself have mattered so little?

435
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,153
That is not what I
meant to say, of course.

436
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:36,743
When I have known and appreciated
such a woman as you.

437
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,371
Isabel Archer is better than I.

438
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,235
Have you seen my latest?

439
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,697
Isn't that one
of last year's sketches?

440
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,657
The one you did in Spain?

441
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,993
I've made improvements since then.

442
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,453
I don't care for your drawings.

443
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,956
They're much better
than other peoples'.

444
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:27,335
But as the only thing you do,
it's so little.

445
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,966
I should have liked you to do so many
other things. I had my ambitions.

446
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,803
- Things that were impossible.
- Things that were impossible.

447
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,980
Your room, at least, is perfect.

448
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,941
I'm struck with that afresh
whenever I come back here.

449
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,111
You've such adorable taste.

450
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,533
I'm sick of my adorable taste.

451
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,454
You must let Miss Archer
come and see it.

452
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:10,211
As cicerone of your museum,
you appear to particular advantage.

453
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,716
Did you say she was rich?

454
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,972
There's no doubt whatever
about her fortune.

455
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,502
Do you think it good for me
to be made so rich?

456
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,504
Henrietta doesn't.

457
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:57,509
Oh, hang Henrietta.
If you ask me, I'm delighted at it.

458
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,388
Did you know your father intended
to leave me so much money?

459
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,016
What does it matter?
My father was very obstinate.

460
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,352
So you did know?

461
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,479
Yes, he told me.

462
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,858
How did he know I'll make good uses
of a large fortune?

463
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,944
How did he know I'm not weak?

464
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:20,156
Don't ask yourself so much whether
this or that is good for you.

465
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,786
Live as you like best, and your
character will take care of itself.

466
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,956
I wonder if you know what you say.

467
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,751
If you do,
you take a great responsibility.

468
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:00,029
The facade is 16th century,
but the interior is much older.

469
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,080
I must tell you that Osmond
doesn't often invite me.

470
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,083
It was quite my own idea,
coming today.

471
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,379
I like to see new people,
and I'm sure you're very new.

472
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,465
Oh! But don't sit there.

473
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,676
That chair's not what it looks.

474
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:28,016
There are very good seats here, but
there are also some horrors. Pipi.

475
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,726
I don't see any.

476
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,645
Everything seems to me
beautiful and precious.

477
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:36,274
Thank you.
I've a few good things.

478
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,069
Indeed, I've nothing very bad.

479
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,698
Poor Osmond with his old curtains
and crucifixes.

480
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,952
Won't you have some tea?
You must be very tired.

481
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:51,080
No, I'm not tired.
What have I done to tire me?

482
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,875
You'll be tired when you go home

483
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:57,504
if he shows you all his bibelots

484
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,881
and gives you a lecture on each.

485
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,133
Then I'll have learned something.

486
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,637
Oh, well, for me,
one should like a thing or not,

487
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,348
but one shouldn't try
to reason it out.

488
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,183
Some very good feelings

489
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,019
may have very bad reasons,
don't you know?

490
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,980
It's a lovely day.
Shall we go for a walk?

491
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:22,153
Oh! And then there are some very bad
feelings that have very good reasons.

492
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,949
This hill of my brother's
is impossible.

493
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,743
It's terrible
to hear one's horses wheeze.

494
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,538
What do you think of my sister?

495
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,462
Don't ask me that, I- I...

496
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,006
I've seen your sister too little.

497
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,176
Yes, it's true,
you've seen her very little,

498
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:50,139
but I should like to know how she
strikes a fresh, unprejudiced mind.

499
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:57,272
I sometimes think
we've gotten into a rather bad way,

500
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:02,151
living here amongst people and things
not our own.

501
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:09,409
My sister's rather unhappy,
and as she's not of a serious turn,

502
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,871
she doesn't tend to show it
tragically, but comically instead.

503
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:21,379
Shall I take that painting down?
You'll want more light.

504
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:37,645
This is one of the first paintings
I bought when I came to Italy.

505
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,733
I've seen the girl but this once,
I like her very much.

506
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,568
So do I.

507
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,279
You have a strange way of showing it.

508
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,780
Do not agitate yourself.

509
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,576
The matter concerns three persons
stronger in purpose than yourself.

510
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:56,080
Three persons?
You and Osmond, of course.

511
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,042
But is Miss Archer also very strong?

512
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,753
Quite as much so as we.

513
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,506
You're capable of anything,
you and Osmond.

514
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,550
- You're dangerous.
- Better leave us alone, then.

515
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:15,933
Madame Merle spoke of you having
some plan of going around the world?

516
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,396
I'm rather ashamed of my plans.

517
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,899
I make a new one every day.

518
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,403
I don't think you should be ashamed.
It's the greatest of pleasures.

519
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,115
I made a plan years ago
and I'm acting on it today.

520
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,078
Must have been a very pleasant one.

521
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,539
Mmm, it was. Very simple.

522
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,085
It was to be as quiet as possible.

523
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,546
As quiet?

524
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,010
Not to worry,
not to strive nor struggle.

525
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,097
To content myself with little.

526
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,686
I've spent many years here
on that plan,

527
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,814
and been not at all unhappy.

528
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,947
It polishes me up a bit
to talk to you.

529
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:18,287
But you'll be gone
before I see you three times.

530
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,291
That's what it is to live
in a country that people come to.

531
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,839
Have you had the opportunity
to wander in Florence at all?

532
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,430
Serena, you know everything.

533
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:39,058
Is that curious creature
making love to my niece?

534
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,563
Gilbert Osmond?

535
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,275
Heaven help us, that's an idea.

536
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,695
It hadn't occurred to you? Hmm?

537
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,532
He's called five times
in the course of a fortnight.

538
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,288
You make me feel an idiot,
but I confess it hadn't.

539
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,832
I wonder if it
has occurred to Isabel?

540
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,751
I shall ask her.

541
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,755
Don't put it in her head.
The thing would be to ask Mr. Osmond.

542
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,633
I cannot. I'll not have him
inquire of me with that air of his.

543
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,094
I'll ask him myself.

544
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,974
I'll investigate and report to you.

545
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,186
She'd marry him
for the beauty of his opinions

546
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,980
or his autograph of Michelangelo.

547
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,043
Excuse me.

548
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,721
Which day is that?

549
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,183
She wants me to go to Caparola
with her.

550
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,526
To go with her?

551
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,278
To be there while she's there.

552
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:17,657
She proposed it.
Of course, I gave her the chance.

553
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:22,495
I rejoice to hear it,
but don't cry victory too soon.

554
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,913
Of course you'll go.

555
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,001
It makes me work, this idea of yours.

556
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,629
Don't pretend you don't enjoy it.

557
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:38,261
You've made a very good impression.
And I can see you've received one.

558
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:42,181
You've not come to Mrs. Touchett's
so often to oblige me.

559
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:46,269
The girl's not disagreeable.
She has only one fault.

560
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,230
- What's that?
- Too many ideas.

561
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,233
I warned you she was clever.

562
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,861
Fortunately, they're very bad ones.

563
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:58,990
- Why is that fortunate?
- No loss if they must be sacrificed.

564
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,248
You're unfathomable.

565
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,918
I'm frightened at the abyss
into which I've cast her.

566
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,463
You can't draw back now.
You're in too far.

567
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,258
Very good.

568
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,677
But you must
do the rest yourself.

569
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:24,348
It's incredible.
There's so much work,

570
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,602
and they would have been
paid a pittance for it.

571
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,980
I forgot my parasol. I must go back.

572
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,149
- I'll get it.
- No, it's fine.

573
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,527
- Do you want some caffe?
- Yes, thank you.

574
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,903
Oh!

575
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,950
So you decided to come?

576
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,869
Mm-hmm. I came last night.

577
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,913
Hmm.

578
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,082
The others are up above.

579
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,878
I didn't come here for the others.

580
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,964
I came to say goodbye.

581
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:42,385
Who knows if you'll come back?
You're under no obligation to.

582
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:45,429
- You think my travels ridiculous?
- No.

583
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,808
Go everywhere, do everything.

584
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,520
Be happy, be triumphant.

585
00:53:55,857 --> 00:54:01,362
- What do you mean by triumphant?
- Well, doing what you like.

586
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:06,951
Doing all the vain things one likes
may be tiresome.

587
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:11,038
Exactly. And you'll be tired someday.

588
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,377
I don't know whether
I'd better not wait until then

589
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,130
for something I want
to say to you.

590
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,509
I can't advise you
without knowing what it is.

591
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,469
But I'm horrid when I'm tired.

592
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,346
I don't believe that.

593
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,433
You're angry sometimes,
that I can believe,

594
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,685
but I'm sure
you're never horrid.

595
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,605
Not even when I lose my temper?

596
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,693
You don't lose your temper, you
find it. And that must be beautiful.

597
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,367
If only I could find it now.

598
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,123
I'm not afraid.

599
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,088
I should fold my arms
and admire you.

600
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,846
What I wish to say is that
I find I'm in love with you.

601
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,516
Oh... No, that had better wait.

602
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,352
No. You may heed it now or never,
as you please.

603
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,354
But after all, I must say it.

604
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,400
I'm absolutely in love with you.

605
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,154
Don't say that, please.

606
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,781
It will not matter to you.

607
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:30,409
I have neither fame nor fortune,
so I offer nothing.

608
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,872
I think I'm glad
that we're separating.

609
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,167
If you weren't going away,
you'd know me better.

610
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,377
I shall do that some other time.

611
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:47,885
There's one thing more, a little
service I should like to ask.

612
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,055
I'm going to Rome for a few days.

613
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:54,016
Would you visit my daughter
before you leave Florence?

614
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,107
Yes, of course.

615
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,573
Oh...

616
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,743
Hello? Hello?

617
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,787
<i>Isabel, are you down there?</i>

618
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,750
<i>We've got your coffee waiting!</i>

619
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,338
Hello? Can you see her down there?

620
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,592
- It's dark.
- Hello?

621
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,595
Oh, hello.

622
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:24,565
I think they're the
most beautiful gardens in the world.

623
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,070
Not that I've been
everywhere in the world.

624
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:37,328
Papa says while he's away,
I'm not to go beyond this line.

625
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,790
Your father says that?

626
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,168
He thinks I will get scorched.

627
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,547
Hmm.

628
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:53,510
Here... share my parasol.

629
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,563
What is it?

630
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,115
No, you're right to do
as your father says.

631
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:20,162
He'll never ask you
anything unreasonable.

632
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,834
Want tea?

633
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,089
There it is!

634
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,889
<i>Nine, ten. Excuse me.
No, no, no.</i>

635
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,941
<i>What I wish to say is that</i>

636
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,236
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

637
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:38,032
<i>I'm absolutely in
love with you... in love with you.</i>

638
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,330
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

639
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,460
<i>Absolutely in love with you.</i>

640
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:52,629
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

641
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:58,093
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

642
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,929
<i>Absolutely in love with you.</i>

643
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,766
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

644
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,935
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

645
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,397
<i>I'm absolutely in love with you.</i>

646
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,066
Oh, oh, oh...

647
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,461
I can't tell you how I hoped
you wouldn't come.

648
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,594
I've no doubt of that.

649
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,810
I gave you forewarning
I'd do as I choose.

650
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:34,523
I wanted to hear your explanation
of you having changed your mind.

651
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,024
An explanation?

652
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,736
- Do you think I'm bound to explain?
- You were very positive.

653
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,447
I did believe it.

654
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,494
I've not deceived you.

655
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,580
I was perfectly free.

656
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:55,169
When I had your letter, I thought
there might be some mistake.

657
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,214
There's no mistake whatever.

658
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:08,098
Well... I've done what I wished.

659
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,811
I've seen you.

660
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,292
Do you mean you came
simply to look at me?

661
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,336
You didn't come up for lunch.

662
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,759
I'm not hungry.

663
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,932
You ought to eat. You live on air.

664
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,439
I haven't congratulated you.

665
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,406
I wondered why you were silent.

666
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:51,034
I hardly got over my surprise
since my mother told me.

667
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:54,371
You're the last person
I expected to see caught.

668
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,043
I don't see why you call it "caught".

669
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,719
Because you're going to be
put into a cage.

670
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,139
If I like my cage,
that needn't trouble you.

671
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,355
I'd treated myself...

672
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,774
to a charming vision of your future.

673
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:30,240
I'd amused myself with planning out
high destiny for you.

674
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,578
There was to be nothing
of this sort in it.

675
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,748
You were not to come down
so easily or so soon.

676
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,750
"Come down"?

677
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,711
It hurts me.

678
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,591
Hurts me as if I'd fallen myself.

679
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,555
I don't understand you.

680
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,099
I should have said...

681
01:04:56,267 --> 01:05:00,103
the man for you
would have had a more...

682
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,730
active, larger...

683
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,358
freer sort of nature.

684
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,905
I can't get over the sense
that Osmond is... is somehow...

685
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,491
...well, small.

686
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,245
"Small."

687
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,248
I think he's narrow... selfish.

688
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,751
He takes himself so seriously.

689
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,421
He's the incarnation of taste.

690
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,382
His taste is exquisite.

691
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:32,761
You ever seen such a taste,
a really exquisite one, ruffled?

692
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:37,516
I hope I will never fail
to gratify my husband's.

693
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,810
Oh.

694
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,938
That's... that's capital, that's...

695
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,815
Wonderful!

696
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,609
That's what every wife
would wish for.

697
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,737
But weren't you meant
for something better

698
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:54,616
than to guard the sensibilities
of a sterile dilettante?

699
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,914
I've said what I've had on my mind.

700
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,379
Said it because I love you.

701
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,673
Then you're not disinterested.

702
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,848
I love you, but without hope.

703
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:29,192
I see Mr. Osmond in quite another way.

704
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,903
He's not important, no.
He's not rich.

705
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:37,117
He has no titles
nor honors nor property.

706
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:42,998
If that's what you mean by small,
he's as small as you please.

707
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,250
I call that large.

708
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,754
It's the largest thing I know.

709
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:54,342
He... he has the gentlest,

710
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,597
kindest, lightest spirit.

711
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:04,394
You've got hold of a false idea.

712
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:09,232
It's a pity, but I can't help it.

713
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,842
They think I'm
in love with your money.

714
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,969
How do you know?

715
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,263
You've not told me they're pleased,

716
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,308
and if they had been,
I should have had some sign of it.

717
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,270
I care for only one thing,

718
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,315
for you not having
the shadow of a doubt.

719
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,692
You know I have not, not one shadow.

720
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:55,821
I have never in my life
tried to earn a penny.

721
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,490
I ought to be less
subject to suspicion

722
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,076
than most people one sees grubbing.

723
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:05,789
I won't pretend I'm sorry
you're rich, I'm delighted.

724
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,668
At moments I'd like to kneel
by my uncle's grave and thank him.

725
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:13,463
It has made me better, loving you.

726
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,591
I'm not a failure,
as I used to think.

727
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,718
I've succeeded in two things.

728
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,804
I am to marry the woman I adore,

729
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,974
and I've brought up
my child in the old way.

730
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:28,812
We'll amuse ourselves
making up some little life for her.

731
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,601
That's why I wanted your advice...

732
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,687
as an old friend
of Miss Osmond's family.

733
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:15,317
What have you got besides your
Spanish lace and Dresden teacups?

734
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:20,530
My collection's well thought of and
I've a comfortable little fortune,

735
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,867
about 40,000 francs a year.

736
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:27,120
Miss Osmond and I
can live beautifully on that.

737
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:32,083
Beautifully? No. Sufficiently, yes.

738
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,420
Her father can give you nothing.

739
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:39,507
He, uh, he lives like a rich man.

740
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,217
The money's his wife's.

741
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,637
She brought him a large fortune.

742
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:47,599
Mrs. Osmond is fond of her
stepdaughter, she may do something.

743
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:52,103
For a lovesick man,
you have your wits about you.

744
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:59,653
No, she will probably prefer to keep
her money for her own children.

745
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,531
Her own children?
Surely she has none.

746
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,159
She may have yet.

747
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,955
She had a poor little boy
who died almost two years ago.

748
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,416
I'm... very sorry.

749
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,712
Uh, she's a splendid woman.

750
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:27,138
I don't say your offer's
to be jumped at,

751
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,349
but there might be a worse one.

752
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,688
Mr. Osmond, however,
will believe he can do better.

753
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,609
He can do better, perhaps,

754
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:44,197
but his daughter can do no better
than marry the man she loves.

755
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,199
Well, she does, you know.

756
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,412
And, in the meanwhile,
I'll say a word to Mrs. Osmond.

757
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,124
No. No, don't set her going,
or you'll spoil everything.

758
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:57,335
Her husband's
sure to have other views.

759
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:02,757
I advise you not to multiply the
points of difference between them.

760
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:07,512
Let the matter alone until
I've taken a few soundings.

761
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,390
Let the matter alone?

762
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,975
But I'm in love!

763
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,021
Oh, you won't burn up.

764
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,103
Where is Pansy?

765
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,189
She has already come down.

766
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,992
I hate his proposal.

767
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,955
I let him see that.
I was rude to him on purpose.

768
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,125
I'll tell him you'll think it over.

769
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,295
No! Don't do that, he'll hang on.

770
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:47,714
I hate talking with a donkey...

771
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,803
He's a gentleman.

772
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,598
He has a charming temper...

773
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,476
and, after all, a comfortable income.

774
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:03,104
It's misery, genteel misery.

775
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,523
It's not what I dreamed of for Pansy.

776
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:09,110
Fortunately, this doesn't
find me unprepared.

777
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,279
It's what I educated her for.

778
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:15,074
It's all for this, that
when a case like this should come up,

779
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,660
she should do what I prefer.

780
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:32,133
I've never been treated so.
I don't know what's against me.

781
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:36,137
It's not how I'm considered.
I could have married 20 times.

782
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,514
You're not rich enough for Pansy.

783
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:42,560
- She doesn't care about money.
- No. But her father does.

784
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,813
Oh, yes. Well, you would know that.

785
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,037
You're offended.

786
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,707
And now you'll never help me.

787
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,292
It's not that I won't...

788
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,004
I simply can't.

789
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,554
Isabel,
I bring you an old friend.

790
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,598
Lord Warburton.

791
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,518
I've only just arrived
this afternoon.

792
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,647
I knew you were at home
on Thursdays, so... I came.

793
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:31,901
You see, the fame of your Thursdays
has spread to England. Excuse me.

794
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,782
We're greatly flattered.

795
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,993
I'm really very glad to see you.

796
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:44,330
There's something I must tell you
without further delay.

797
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,292
I've brought
Ralph Touchett with me.

798
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,877
No, no, he's not here.
He's at the hotel.

799
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,796
He was too tired to come.

800
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,215
Why has he come to Rome?

801
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,176
He's very far gone, Mrs. Osmond.

802
01:15:57,177 --> 01:16:02,056
He can't keep warm. And the further
south we come, the colder he feels.

803
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,017
If you don't mind my saying,

804
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:08,980
it was the most extraordinary time
for Mrs. Touchett to go to America.

805
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:15,695
Do you know what your father
said to me just now?

806
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,782
Don't speak so loud.
Everyone will hear.

807
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:21,993
He says you've forgotten me.

808
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:25,496
No... I don't forget.

809
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,168
Everything's just the same?

810
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:36,924
Not the very same.
Papa's been terribly severe.

811
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,801
He forbids me to marry you.

812
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:40,636
Need you mind that?

813
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,640
I can't disobey Papa.

814
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,642
You sacrifice me like that?

815
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,691
I love you just as much.

816
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,693
What good will that do me?

817
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:01,991
Please don't talk any more.
Papa said I was not to talk to you.

818
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,203
It's too much.

819
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:15,880
- May I introduce you to some people?
- Oh, no, please don't.

820
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,841
Unless it be to that young lady
at the tea table.

821
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,927
She has a charming face.

822
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,137
That's my husband's daughter.

823
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,847
What a dear little maid.

824
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:28,893
- You must meet her.
- Oh, in a... in a moment.

825
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,188
I like looking at her from here.

826
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:41,155
You know... you've changed a bit.

827
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,741
Yes, a good deal.

828
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,327
I don't mean for the worse,
of course.

829
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,789
And yet how can I say for the better?

830
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,421
Oh.

831
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,484
I think, after all,
that I shan't go to Sicily.

832
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,319
Won't go to Sicily?

833
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,280
Where will you go?

834
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:27,618
I guess I won't go anywhere.

835
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,370
You'll return to England?

836
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,290
Oh, dear, no.

837
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:35,710
- I'll stay in Rome.
- Rome won't do.

838
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,005
- Rome's too cold.
- It will have to do.

839
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:43,676
Try Sicily.

840
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,095
I can't try.
I can't move further.

841
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:50,016
I can't face the journey.
And I haven't a cousin in Sicily.

842
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,728
What does the doctor say?

843
01:18:56,523 --> 01:19:00,109
I haven't asked him,
and I don't care a fig.

844
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,445
If I die here, you'll bury me.

845
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,615
You shan't die here.

846
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,962
I can't believe she's so cold.

847
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:23,549
She's utterly changed. It's Osmond.

848
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:42,610
I recommend that you get
the doctor's consent all the same.

849
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,822
The doctor's consent would spoil it.

850
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:50,868
You're sacrificing your health
to your curiosity, then?

851
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:55,915
I'm not interested in my health,
I'm deeply interested in Mrs. Osmond.

852
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,084
So am I.

853
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,378
Not as I once was.

854
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,349
Permit to ask whether it's
to bring out that fact

855
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,602
that you're so very civil
to the little girl?

856
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,105
Does that strike you as ridiculous?

857
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:25,069
Of course, there's the difference
in our ages... more than 20 years.

858
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,991
My dear Warburton... are you serious?

859
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:34,996
Perfectly serious...
as far as I've got.

860
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,379
I'm glad.

861
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,841
And heaven help us
how cheered up Osmond will be.

862
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:50,177
I say, don't spoil it.
Do you judge she'll be pleased?

863
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,722
The girl? Delighted, surely.

864
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,224
No, no. I mean Mrs. Osmond.

865
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,010
Lord Warburton was here?

866
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:36,390
Yes. He stayed half an hour.

867
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,979
Did he talk to Pansy?

868
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,190
He talked almost only to her.

869
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,283
It seems to me he's attentive.

870
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:56,285
Isn't that what you call it?

871
01:21:56,453 --> 01:22:01,290
I don't call it anything. I'm waiting
for you to give it a name.

872
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,292
Will you excuse us?

873
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:23,187
That's a consideration
you don't always show.

874
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:30,194
I... I had determined this time
to try and act as you'd like.

875
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,913
Are you trying to quarrel with me?

876
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:44,667
No. I'm trying to live at peace.

877
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,377
An excellent resolve.

878
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,672
Your temper isn't good.

879
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,848
That's partly why I've not spoken
about this business of my daughter's.

880
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:02,101
I was afraid I should
encounter opposition.

881
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:12,486
I've sent little Rosier
about his business.

882
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,408
You see, I believe my daughter
only has to sit perfectly quiet

883
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,118
to become Lady Warburton.

884
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:24,081
Perhaps she won't sit
perfectly still.

885
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,168
If she loses Mr. Rosier,
she may jump up.

886
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,756
Pansy would like to be a great lady.

887
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,508
She wishes above all to please.

888
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:37,928
To please Mr. Rosier, perhaps?

889
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,265
No. To please me.

890
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:55,446
Meantime, I should like our
distinguished visitor to speak.

891
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:00,367
He has spoken.

892
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:05,080
He said it would be a great pleasure
to believe she could care for him.

893
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,792
Why didn't you tell me that?

894
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,503
There was no opportunity.

895
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,798
You know how we live.

896
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,676
Why didn't he speak to me, then?

897
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:20,721
You should have patience.

898
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,848
Englishmen are shy.

899
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:25,684
This one's not,
not when he made love to you.

900
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,019
I beg your pardon?

901
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,979
He was extremely so.

902
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,981
Oh, I see.

903
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,613
You must have a great deal
of influence with him.

904
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:43,160
I'm sure the moment you really wish
it, you can bring him to the point.

905
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,713
Well...

906
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:00,970
It lies in your hands.

907
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,806
I shall leave it there.

908
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,767
With a little goodwill,
you may manage it.

909
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,272
Think that over. Hmm?

910
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:15,192
And remember how much I count on you.

911
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,231
It's all Pansy's.

912
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:37,733
It must be hers.

913
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,236
Yes. She gave it to me to hold.

914
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:43,238
May I hold it?

915
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,952
May I at least have a flower?

916
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:56,043
It's frightful
what I'm doing for you.

917
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:07,179
Don't put it in your buttonhole,
don't for the world.

918
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,433
You pity me.

919
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:14,979
But don't you pity her a little?

920
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,101
<i>She's promised
a dance with me later.</i>

921
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,395
<i>For the cotillion?</i>

922
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:59,940
<i>No, I didn't ask her for that.
It's a quadrille.</i>

923
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,859
You're not clever.

924
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,071
I told her to keep the cotillion
in case you should ask for it.

925
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:08,615
Poor little maid. Fancy that.

926
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,994
She didn't say.
Of course I will, if you like.

927
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:15,789
If I like? Oh, you dance with her
only because I like it.

928
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,791
I'm afraid I bore her.

929
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,503
She has a lot of young fellows
on her book.

930
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:27,342
Please, let me understand.

931
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:29,386
Understand what?

932
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:32,681
You told me you'd like
to marry my stepdaughter,

933
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,475
you've not forgotten it?

934
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:38,062
Forgotten it? No.
I wrote to Mr. Osmond this morning.

935
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:41,023
He didn't mention to me
that he'd heard from you.

936
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,942
It's an awkward sort of letter
to write.

937
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:48,238
Don't forget to send it.

938
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:22,189
Oh, most certainly.

939
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,360
Are you not dancing?

940
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:29,279
Certainly not,
if I can't dance with her.

941
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,993
- You should leave, then.
- Not until she does.

942
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:46,421
Who's your dismal friend?

943
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:48,549
He has a face a yard long.

944
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,676
He has reason.

945
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:53,887
- My husband won't listen to him.
- Oh, dear me.

946
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:57,015
He looked a well set-up young fellow.

947
01:29:57,016 --> 01:29:59,351
You've a kind thought
even for a rival.

948
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,437
A rival?

949
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:09,403
You don't mean
that she cares for him?

950
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,448
Well, yes...

951
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:15,742
I think she does.

952
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:20,247
You said she'd have no wish but her
father's and that he favored me.

953
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,792
I told you she had an immense wish
to please her father.

954
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,588
That seems very proper.

955
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,507
Very proper...

956
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:41,810
but hardly the sort of feeling a man
would wish to be indebted for a wife.

957
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:50,235
Why are you so unwilling,
so... skeptical?

958
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:11,715
- You're the most wonderful dancer.
- Oh, thank you.

959
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,132
I want you to answer me a question.

960
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:58,178
It's about Lord Warburton.

961
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,060
Is...

962
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:08,855
Is he really in love?

963
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:16,280
Yes, I think, very much.
I can make that out.

964
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,864
Oh.

965
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,910
You seem disappointed.

966
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:26,248
No...

967
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,752
No, only mistaken.

968
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:36,800
I'd made out that
he doesn't really care for Pansy.

969
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:39,011
Oh, for Pansy, no.

970
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,097
But you just said now that he did.

971
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,099
That he cared for you.

972
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:51,732
- That is nonsense, you know.
- To me, he's denied it.

973
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:02,367
Ralph...

974
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,288
you give me no help.

975
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:14,880
How unhappy you must be.

976
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,563
When... When I talk of
your helping me, I...

977
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:34,274
I- I talk great nonsense.

978
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:39,279
The idea of troubling you
with my domestic embarrassments...

979
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:42,824
Your husband may think you haven't...

980
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:44,618
pushed enough.

981
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,537
It's a matter we can hardly
quarrel about,

982
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:50,791
for almost all of the interest
is on his side.

983
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:55,087
You know what his interest
will make him say?

984
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:59,424
It will make him say that your lack
of zeal is owing to jealousy.

985
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:02,511
- To jealousy?
- To jealousy of his daughter.

986
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,598
Oh, you're not kind.

987
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,268
Be frank with me, and you'll see.

988
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:06,324
If I try to learn what you want...

989
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,454
what you desire...

990
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:16,918
it's only so that
I may act accordingly.

991
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:24,259
The only thing I want in life...
is to marry Mr. Rosier.

992
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:30,474
Your father would like you
to make a better marriage.

993
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:37,105
What should you like me to do?

994
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,274
Lord Warburton...

995
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:43,403
has shown you great attention.

996
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:47,032
If you mean that
he'll propose for me,

997
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:49,701
I think you're mistaken.

998
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:56,166
Your father
would like it extremely.

999
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,753
Lord Warburton won't propose
simply to please Papa.

1000
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,631
Oh, no. There's no danger.

1001
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:05,175
There's no danger.

1002
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,260
It's as if he said to me,

1003
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:10,555
"I like you very much,
but if it doesn't please you,

1004
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:12,933
"I would never say it again."

1005
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,812
And... he doesn't
care for me, either.

1006
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:21,775
Oh, no. There's no danger.

1007
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,277
You must tell your father that.

1008
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,074
I'd rather not.

1009
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:34,204
You wouldn't let him have
false hopes?

1010
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,710
But it will be good for me
that he should.

1011
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:43,588
Then Papa won't propose
anyone else...

1012
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:47,551
and that will be
a great advantage for me.

1013
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,100
Rosier.

1014
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:07,362
Does Warburton form his words
with such difficulty?

1015
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,365
Hmm?

1016
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,328
When he told you he intended to
write, what did you say to him?

1017
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:19,416
I think I told him not to forget it.

1018
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:22,836
Apparently, he has forgotten.
Please remind him.

1019
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:26,798
If hands are to be laid on
Lord Warburton, lay them yourself.

1020
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:29,384
It's hard with you
working against me.

1021
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,636
I told you I'd do what I could.

1022
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:34,389
Yes, that gained you time.

1023
01:37:36,475 --> 01:37:39,603
My husband and I were
just now talking of you.

1024
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:44,357
We wondered what had become of you.
We thought perhaps you'd gone away.

1025
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,527
I'm only on the point of going.

1026
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:50,739
I find myself suddenly
recalled to England.

1027
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,867
I'm awfully sorry
to leave poor Touchett.

1028
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,286
Take poor Touchett with you.

1029
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,830
He'd better wait for warmer weather.

1030
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:02,208
I shouldn't advise him
to... to travel just now.

1031
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,002
Hmm.

1032
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:07,922
I have a letter to write
before dinner. Will you excuse me?

1033
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:12,093
Of course, when you come to Rome,
you'll always look us up.

1034
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:26,107
I'm glad it's the last time.

1035
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:30,695
So am I.

1036
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:32,739
She doesn't care for me.

1037
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:52,133
Good night, Papa.

1038
01:38:52,968 --> 01:38:55,095
Good night. Sleep well.

1039
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,560
Don't go. I have
something to say to you.

1040
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,215
I don't understand
what you wish to do.

1041
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,718
I wish to go to bed. I'm very tired.

1042
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:46,980
I think you're trying
to humiliate me.

1043
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,649
You're playing a very deep game.

1044
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,776
You've managed it beautifully.

1045
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,530
What have I managed?

1046
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:59,159
You've kept this matter
quite in your own hands.

1047
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:03,830
Will you tell me in the plainest
words of what it is you accuse me?

1048
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:10,044
Of having prevented
Pansy's marriage to Warburton.

1049
01:40:10,045 --> 01:40:11,713
Are those words plain enough?

1050
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:15,175
On the contrary,
I took great interest in it.

1051
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,636
When you counted on me,
I accepted the obligation.

1052
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,138
I was a fool, but I did it.

1053
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:22,766
You pretended to do it.

1054
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:25,852
Where is the letter
you told me he'd written?

1055
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:28,730
I haven't the least idea.

1056
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:32,400
No, you destroyed it.

1057
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:39,699
Oh, Gilbert, for a man
Who was so fine...

1058
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,618
I was never so fine as you.

1059
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:44,329
You've done everything
that you wanted.

1060
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:47,165
You got him out of the way
without appearing to,

1061
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:51,044
and you've placed me in the position
in which you wish to see me.

1062
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,297
As a man who tried to marry
his daughter to a Lord,

1063
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:55,965
but grotesquely failed.

1064
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:59,427
- Pansy doesn't care for him.
- That has nothing to do with it!

1065
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:04,015
- And he doesn't...
- That won't do! You told me he did!

1066
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:07,727
After this, you must attend
to such things yourself.

1067
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:25,954
I always thought you were
fond of my daughter.

1068
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:29,123
I have never been more so than now.

1069
01:41:29,124 --> 01:41:31,876
Your affection has immense
limitations.

1070
01:41:31,877 --> 01:41:34,504
However, that, perhaps, is natural.

1071
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:37,006
Is that all you wish to say to me?

1072
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:40,844
Are you satisfied? Huh?

1073
01:41:42,721 --> 01:41:45,557
Am I sufficiently disappointed?

1074
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:49,727
I don't think, on the whole,
you're disappointed.

1075
01:41:49,728 --> 01:41:53,439
You've had another opportunity
to try to stupefy me.

1076
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:06,911
It's not that.

1077
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:11,040
It's proved that Pansy can aim high.

1078
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:05,345
I suppose you know you can't
go back to England alone.

1079
01:43:05,346 --> 01:43:10,308
I had no idea of doing that.
I'll have people with me.

1080
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:12,185
What do you mean by people?

1081
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:14,270
Servants whom you pay?

1082
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,234
After all, they're human beings.

1083
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:24,113
I guess I'll go with you.

1084
01:43:24,114 --> 01:43:26,449
- Go with me?
- Yes.

1085
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:30,328
I know you don't like me
but I'll go with you.

1086
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,374
And what's more,
I'll take care of you.

1087
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:38,878
I like you very much.

1088
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,506
You needn't think
you can buy me off.

1089
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:44,884
I'm afraid I shall be
a fifth wheel to the coach.

1090
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:47,512
Mrs. Osmond wants me
to travel with you.

1091
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:52,392
But that isn't the principal thing.

1092
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:55,812
The principal thing is
she wants me to leave Rome.

1093
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,315
She wants us all to leave Rome.

1094
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:19,210
It's wonderfully good of you.

1095
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:21,921
I can't tell you how kind
I think you.

1096
01:44:23,298 --> 01:44:26,259
With a few words like that,
you make me go?

1097
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:29,971
- You must come back someday.
- I don't care for your cousin.

1098
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:32,056
Is that what you wish to tell me?

1099
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:35,727
No. No, I don't want
to TELL you anything.

1100
01:44:37,187 --> 01:44:39,939
I can't understand.
What am I to believe?

1101
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:42,442
What do you want me to think?

1102
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:46,738
If you're happy, I'd like to know it.
That would be something for me.

1103
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,322
You SAY you're happy,

1104
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:50,491
and yet, somehow, you're so...

1105
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,369
still, so smooth...

1106
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:55,371
so hard.

1107
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:00,376
You're completely changed.
You conceal everything.

1108
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:04,881
- I haven't really come near you.
- You come very near.

1109
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,484
You seem uncommonly glad
to get rid of us all.

1110
01:45:30,491 --> 01:45:32,200
My dear Ralph.

1111
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:38,372
I've seen less of you
than I might have,

1112
01:45:38,373 --> 01:45:40,666
but it's been better than nothing.

1113
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:44,337
I've heard a great deal about you.

1114
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:49,217
I don't know from whom,
living the life you've done.

1115
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,470
From the voices of the air.

1116
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:02,939
You've been my best friend.

1117
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:10,530
It was for you
that I wanted to live,

1118
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:12,782
but I'm of no use to you.

1119
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:27,296
If you should send for me...

1120
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,716
I'd come.

1121
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:33,261
Your husband
won't consent to that.

1122
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,304
No, he won't like it,

1123
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:38,099
but I might go all the same.

1124
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:49,068
I'd hoped to find Lord Warburton here
and to be able to congratulate Pansy.

1125
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,697
You shouldn't have gone to Naples,
but stayed to watch.

1126
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,574
Is it too late?

1127
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:56,909
It's all over. Please...

1128
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,578
just let it rest.

1129
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:02,248
I've no doubt Osmond will
happily discuss it with you.

1130
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:06,460
Oh, I know what he thinks.
He came to see me last evening.

1131
01:47:09,131 --> 01:47:10,715
As soon as you arrived?

1132
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:16,095
Your husband judges you severely.

1133
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:23,728
Wait. Please.

1134
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:41,245
I want, if possible,
to learn the truth.

1135
01:47:44,499 --> 01:47:46,626
What truth do you speak of?

1136
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:50,630
Just this...

1137
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:57,970
whether Lord Warburton changed
his mind quite of his own accord

1138
01:47:57,971 --> 01:48:00,181
or because you recommended it.

1139
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,852
To please himself,
I mean, or to please you?

1140
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:07,772
Now, don't be unreasonable.

1141
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,690
Don't take offense.

1142
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,782
If Lord Warburton simply
got tired of the child,

1143
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,368
that's one thing, and it's a pity.

1144
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:24,538
But if he gave her up to please you,

1145
01:48:25,707 --> 01:48:27,959
that's another.

1146
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,294
If that's the case...

1147
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,381
let him off, let us have him.

1148
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:38,052
Who are you?

1149
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:40,346
Ah, you take it like that.

1150
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,474
What have you to do with me?

1151
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,981
Everything.

1152
01:48:57,739 --> 01:49:01,158
I would give my right hand
to be able to weep.

1153
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,202
What good would it do you to weep?

1154
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:07,790
It would make me feel...

1155
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:11,252
as I felt before I knew you.

1156
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,135
If I've dried up your tears,
that's something,

1157
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:21,262
but I've seen you shed them.

1158
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:24,890
You'll make me cry still,
make me howl like a wolf.

1159
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:27,893
I've a great need of that.

1160
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:31,022
I was vile this afternoon.
I was horrid.

1161
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:36,861
You may have said things
that were in bad taste.

1162
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:39,030
I was full of something bad...

1163
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:46,120
or something good, I don't know,
I couldn't help it.

1164
01:49:50,876 --> 01:49:55,129
You've not only dried up my tears,
you've dried up my soul.

1165
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:57,298
You're very bad.

1166
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,103
Is this the way we're to end?

1167
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,901
How do bad people end?

1168
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:21,822
Especially as to their common crimes?

1169
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:28,496
You have made me as bad as yourself.

1170
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:30,790
You seem to me quite good enough.

1171
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:41,842
Oh, God!

1172
01:50:41,843 --> 01:50:44,178
God!

1173
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:48,849
So you're going to weep after all?

1174
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:50,935
Have I ever complained to you?

1175
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:55,147
Of course you haven't,
you've enjoyed your triumph too much.

1176
01:50:56,608 --> 01:50:59,652
You made your wife
afraid of you, she was...

1177
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:04,407
She was afraid of me today,
but it was really you she feared.

1178
01:51:04,408 --> 01:51:07,451
This whole idea
didn't originate with me.

1179
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:09,537
Your genius brought it about.

1180
01:51:09,538 --> 01:51:11,664
I only ask that my wife
should like me.

1181
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:15,376
Oh, Jesus, she should
like you so much?

1182
01:51:15,377 --> 01:51:19,922
If you'll make a tragedy of that,
the tragedy is hardly for her.

1183
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:21,966
It's for me.

1184
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,847
I live with the consequences,
so must you.

1185
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:34,395
Please be careful
with that precious object.

1186
01:51:34,396 --> 01:51:37,231
It already has a wee bit
of a tiny crack.

1187
01:51:45,824 --> 01:51:49,994
However, since my wife
doesn't like me,

1188
01:51:49,995 --> 01:51:52,997
I shall look for
compensation in Pansy.

1189
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:57,376
Fortunately, I haven't a fault
to find with her.

1190
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:08,804
Mia! Listen to me. Oh! Leave me.

1191
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:16,896
Pansy!

1192
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,778
- Oh...
- Pansy.

1193
01:52:27,115 --> 01:52:29,700
Pansy? Pansy?

1194
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:34,079
- Mrs. Osmond? Mrs. Osmond!
- Pansy.

1195
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,332
Mrs. Osmond!

1196
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:38,042
I've been in Paris!

1197
01:52:38,043 --> 01:52:40,002
I've sold my bibelots!

1198
01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:43,380
The result's magnificent, $50,000!

1199
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:47,259
Will Mr. Osmond think me
rich enough now?

1200
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,473
Oh...

1201
01:52:54,142 --> 01:53:00,105
Pipi... eat your food.
Very good. Pipi.

1202
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:03,317
Oh.

1203
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:21,835
Is Pansy not well?

1204
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,507
No. She is quite well,

1205
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:29,051
but I've sent her to the convent.

1206
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:33,764
I didn't speak of it to you because
I doubt if I can make you understand.

1207
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,976
One's daughter should be
fresh and fair.

1208
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,938
Pansy's a little dusty,
a little disheveled.

1209
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:43,732
She'll have time to think,

1210
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:47,027
and there's something I want her
to think about.

1211
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:49,738
It's very absurd, my dear Osmond.

1212
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:53,033
Why don't you just say
you want to get her out of my way?

1213
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:57,204
My dear Amy, if that were the case,

1214
01:53:57,205 --> 01:54:00,124
it would be much simpler
to banish you.

1215
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:03,335
You know I think
very well of Mr. Rosier.

1216
01:54:03,336 --> 01:54:04,878
I do, indeed.

1217
01:54:04,879 --> 01:54:07,798
He seems to be simpaticissimo.

1218
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:11,885
He's made me believe in,
ah, true love.

1219
01:54:44,628 --> 01:54:48,213
Oh... Excuse me
for disturbing you.

1220
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:51,258
When I come into your room,
I always knock.

1221
01:54:51,259 --> 01:54:53,135
I forgot.

1222
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:57,473
I had something else to think of.

1223
01:54:57,474 --> 01:54:59,266
My cousin's dying.

1224
01:55:00,185 --> 01:55:02,186
I don't believe that.

1225
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:05,356
He was dying when we married.
He'll outlive us all.

1226
01:55:05,357 --> 01:55:07,191
My aunt telegraphed for me.

1227
01:55:09,152 --> 01:55:11,153
I must go to England.

1228
01:55:12,113 --> 01:55:17,284
- I don't see the need of it.
- I must see Ralph before he dies.

1229
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:21,497
I shall not like it if you do.

1230
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:23,499
You won't like it if I don't.

1231
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:28,045
You like nothing I do or don't do.

1232
01:55:30,507 --> 01:55:32,758
You pretend to think I lie.

1233
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:39,515
That's why you go, then?

1234
01:55:39,516 --> 01:55:43,394
Not to see your cousin,
but to take revenge on me?

1235
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:49,108
You wish immensely
I would commit some folly.

1236
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:59,618
If you leave Rome today, it will be
an act of the most deliberate,

1237
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:02,079
the most calculated opposition.

1238
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,417
I can't tell you
how unjust you seem to me.

1239
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:11,714
It's your own opposition
that's calculated.

1240
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:15,050
It's malignant.

1241
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:31,650
I have an ideal of what my wife
should do and should not do.

1242
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:36,864
She should not travel across Europe
to sit at the bedside of other men.

1243
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:40,659
Your cousin is nothing to you.
He's nothing to us.

1244
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:46,123
You smile most expressively
when I talk about us,

1245
01:56:46,124 --> 01:56:49,126
but I assure you that we...

1246
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:51,336
We, Mrs. Osmond...

1247
01:56:54,215 --> 01:56:56,216
is all I know.

1248
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:04,349
You are nearer to me
than any other human creature,

1249
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:06,727
and I am nearer to you.

1250
01:57:06,728 --> 01:57:09,271
It may be a disagreeable proximity,

1251
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:12,524
but it is one of our own
deliberate making.

1252
01:57:13,943 --> 01:57:17,446
You don't like to be
reminded of that, I know...

1253
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:21,784
but I am
perfectly willing, because...

1254
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:28,373
because I believe we should accept
the consequences of our actions...

1255
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:34,338
and what I value most in life
is the honor of the thing.

1256
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,970
Oh! My dear.

1257
01:58:22,971 --> 01:58:25,597
Do tell me some amusing book to read.

1258
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:27,266
Would this do me any good?

1259
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:31,353
My cousin, Ralph Touchett, is dying.

1260
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:35,691
Oh... He was so simpatico.

1261
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:38,360
I'm awfully sorry for you.

1262
01:58:41,281 --> 01:58:42,865
You look very badly.

1263
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:46,326
Osmond says it's impossible
I should go to England.

1264
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:50,080
And why does Osmond say
it's impossible?

1265
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:52,374
Because we're so happy together

1266
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:55,335
that we can't separate,
even for a fortnight.

1267
01:59:24,782 --> 01:59:26,658
You're very unhappy.

1268
01:59:29,203 --> 01:59:30,746
Yes.

1269
01:59:32,373 --> 01:59:35,167
But I don't think you can comfort me.

1270
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:39,338
Will you give me leave to try?

1271
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:42,674
There is something
I want you to know.

1272
01:59:44,218 --> 01:59:47,888
Perhaps you do.
Perhaps you've guessed it.

1273
01:59:47,889 --> 01:59:52,976
Oh, in your place
I should have guessed it ages ago.

1274
01:59:52,977 --> 01:59:55,145
Have you never really suspected?

1275
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:01,360
Suspected what?

1276
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:03,987
My first sister-in-law
had no children.

1277
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:11,912
The poor woman was married hardly
three years and died childless.

1278
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:18,126
Pansy's not my husband's child, then?

1279
02:00:18,127 --> 02:00:22,422
Oh, your husband's in perfection,
but not his wife's.

1280
02:00:23,508 --> 02:00:28,011
Oh, my dear Isabel,
with you, one must dot one's i's.

1281
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:30,013
Whose child?

1282
02:00:30,014 --> 02:00:34,643
Oh, she's been wonderfully clever,
magnificent about Pansy.

1283
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:43,652
Had it never occurred to you

1284
02:00:43,653 --> 02:00:47,823
that Serena Merle
was for six or seven years his lover?

1285
02:00:52,745 --> 02:00:54,955
At last you understand.

1286
02:01:36,831 --> 02:01:39,041
You're surprised to find me here.

1287
02:01:40,334 --> 02:01:43,045
And I'm afraid you're not pleased.

1288
02:01:46,674 --> 02:01:51,428
I confess I've been indiscreet,
I ought to have asked permission.

1289
02:01:55,808 --> 02:01:57,809
I came to see Pansy.

1290
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:03,273
It occurred to me this afternoon
that she must be rather lonely.

1291
02:02:14,452 --> 02:02:16,411
That it's a little dismal.

1292
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:23,126
So I came, on...

1293
02:02:26,923 --> 02:02:28,924
the chance...

1294
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:18,431
Don't you think I've made it pretty?

1295
02:03:18,432 --> 02:03:22,102
Yes. It seems... it seems comfortable.

1296
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:27,732
I've come to bid you goodbye.

1297
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,901
I'm going to England.

1298
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:37,659
Not to come back?

1299
02:03:39,036 --> 02:03:41,037
My cousin is very ill.

1300
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:48,128
Don't leave me here.

1301
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:50,839
Will you come with me now?

1302
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,175
Did Papa tell you to ask me that?

1303
02:03:54,177 --> 02:03:56,178
No. It's my own proposal.

1304
02:04:01,309 --> 02:04:03,393
I had better wait, then.

1305
02:04:04,604 --> 02:04:08,440
He thinks I have not
had enough, but I have.

1306
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:13,111
He wished me to think a little,
and I have thought a great deal.

1307
02:04:13,112 --> 02:04:15,447
What have you thought?

1308
02:04:15,615 --> 02:04:18,033
That I must never displease Papa.

1309
02:04:21,412 --> 02:04:24,080
Grazie.

1310
02:04:27,877 --> 02:04:30,754
I found I wished to wait for you.

1311
02:04:30,755 --> 02:04:33,256
But it's not to talk about Pansy.

1312
02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:35,508
Are you very fond of your cousin?

1313
02:04:35,509 --> 02:04:39,262
- I don't understand you.
- It's hard to explain.

1314
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:45,101
Your cousin once did you
a great service. Have you...

1315
02:04:45,102 --> 02:04:46,645
never guessed it?

1316
02:04:46,646 --> 02:04:48,647
He made you rich.

1317
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:53,109
He made me?

1318
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:57,239
It was your uncle's money,
but it was your cousin's idea.

1319
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,449
He brought his father over to it.

1320
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:02,327
I don't know why
you say such things.

1321
02:05:02,328 --> 02:05:07,374
- I don't know how you know.
- I know only what I've guessed,

1322
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:10,543
and I've guessed that.

1323
02:05:10,544 --> 02:05:13,630
At bottom, it's him you've to thank.

1324
02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:16,341
I believed it was you I had to thank.

1325
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:22,931
You're very unhappy, I know.

1326
02:05:22,932 --> 02:05:25,725
But I'm more so.

1327
02:06:15,276 --> 02:06:19,154
Hello. Isn't it wonderful she's come?

1328
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:23,950
- How was the channel?
- Very fine.

1329
02:06:25,661 --> 02:06:27,162
No.

1330
02:06:28,247 --> 02:06:30,373
No, I believe it was very rough.

1331
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:23,134
Will he see me?

1332
02:07:23,135 --> 02:07:25,261
Can he speak to me?

1333
02:07:25,262 --> 02:07:27,639
You can try him.

1334
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:31,142
- Is there really no hope?
- None whatsoever.

1335
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:33,144
There never has been.

1336
02:09:05,112 --> 02:09:07,280
It's very good of you to come.

1337
02:09:10,117 --> 02:09:12,785
I thought you would,
but I wasn't sure.

1338
02:09:12,786 --> 02:09:14,537
I wasn't sure, either...

1339
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:17,874
till I came.

1340
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:24,589
With me it's all over.

1341
02:09:27,801 --> 02:09:29,802
Isabel...

1342
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:36,226
I wish it were over for you.

1343
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:45,068
What is it you have done
for me in leaving Rome?

1344
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:49,614
What is it you did for me?

1345
02:09:51,909 --> 02:09:54,077
You did something once.

1346
02:09:55,162 --> 02:09:57,330
You know it.

1347
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,709
Oh...

1348
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:05,588
Ralph.

1349
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:07,924
Keep me in your heart.

1350
02:10:07,925 --> 02:10:10,969
I shall be nearer to you
than I've ever been.

1351
02:10:11,971 --> 02:10:16,933
I never thanked you.

1352
02:10:16,934 --> 02:10:19,394
I... I never spoke.

1353
02:10:20,604 --> 02:10:23,022
I never was what I should be.

1354
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:27,443
Yet how could I know?
I only know today

1355
02:10:27,444 --> 02:10:30,947
because there are people
less stupid than I.

1356
02:10:30,948 --> 02:10:33,199
Don't mind people.

1357
02:10:39,164 --> 02:10:41,583
Is it true?

1358
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,918
That you've been stupid?

1359
02:10:44,962 --> 02:10:46,796
No.

1360
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:51,175
He married me for the money.

1361
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:59,350
I only want you to understand.

1362
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:02,604
I always tried
to keep you from understanding.

1363
02:11:04,648 --> 02:11:06,941
But that's all over.

1364
02:11:11,113 --> 02:11:13,489
Was he very bad about your coming?

1365
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:15,950
He made it very hard for me...

1366
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:17,910
but I don't care.

1367
02:11:18,495 --> 02:11:22,081
Here... with you...

1368
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:27,754
I'm happier than I've been
in a long time.

1369
02:11:30,257 --> 02:11:33,635
I want you to be happy.

1370
02:11:33,636 --> 02:11:35,637
To feel that I'm near you.

1371
02:11:39,183 --> 02:11:41,601
That I love you.

1372
02:11:44,772 --> 02:11:46,814
Why should there be pain?

1373
02:11:47,983 --> 02:11:50,109
That's not the deepest thing.

1374
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:05,583
You must stay here.

1375
02:12:10,964 --> 02:12:12,882
Pain's deep...

1376
02:12:13,717 --> 02:12:16,844
but it... passes, after all.

1377
02:12:16,845 --> 02:12:18,805
- It's passing now.
- Oh...

1378
02:12:18,806 --> 02:12:20,848
But love remains.

1379
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:27,438
I don't know why
we should suffer so much,

1380
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:29,190
perhaps I should find out.

1381
02:12:30,901 --> 02:12:32,485
Shh...

1382
02:12:38,117 --> 02:12:40,076
I don't believe...

1383
02:12:43,706 --> 02:12:47,041
I don't believe
such a generous mistake as yours

1384
02:12:47,209 --> 02:12:49,627
can hurt you
for more than a little.

1385
02:12:52,423 --> 02:12:54,799
And remember this...

1386
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,051
that if you have been hated,

1387
02:12:57,052 --> 02:12:59,053
you've also been loved.

1388
02:13:02,015 --> 02:13:04,684
Oh, but, Isabel...

1389
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:09,814
..adored.

1390
02:14:25,682 --> 02:14:28,226
Man that is born of woman

1391
02:14:28,227 --> 02:14:32,438
has but a short time to live
and is full of misery.

1392
02:14:32,439 --> 02:14:35,483
He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.

1393
02:14:35,484 --> 02:14:41,030
He fleeth as it were a shadow
and never continueth upon this day.

1394
02:14:41,031 --> 02:14:43,574
In the midst of life
we are in death.

1395
02:14:43,575 --> 02:14:46,869
Of whom may we seek for succour
but of thee, o Lord,

1396
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:50,414
who for our sins
art justly mispleased?

1397
02:15:09,268 --> 02:15:11,102
I adore him.

1398
02:15:13,146 --> 02:15:28,953
I adore him.

1399
02:15:29,788 --> 02:15:32,081
Oh.

1400
02:15:34,084 --> 02:15:35,877
You frightened me.

1401
02:15:42,551 --> 02:15:44,886
I wanted to see you alone.

1402
02:15:44,887 --> 02:15:48,723
So I've been waiting and,
uh, walking about.

1403
02:15:54,813 --> 02:15:58,524
I don't wish to trouble you
as I did in Rome.

1404
02:15:58,525 --> 02:16:01,360
That was no use.
It only distressed you.

1405
02:16:01,361 --> 02:16:04,405
I knew I was wrong.

1406
02:16:04,406 --> 02:16:06,449
But I'm not wrong now.

1407
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:09,619
It's very different now.
I can help you.

1408
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,996
How can you help me?

1409
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:17,835
It was good when you made me
come away with your cousin.

1410
02:16:17,836 --> 02:16:20,922
He was a good man. A fine man.

1411
02:16:22,925 --> 02:16:25,468
He told me how the case
stands for you.

1412
02:16:25,469 --> 02:16:27,762
He explained everything.

1413
02:16:27,930 --> 02:16:30,181
He guessed my sentiments.

1414
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:43,110
Do you know what he told me here
the last time I saw him?

1415
02:16:43,111 --> 02:16:45,947
He said,
"Do everything you can for her."

1416
02:16:47,824 --> 02:16:49,867
"Everything she'll let you."

1417
02:16:52,496 --> 02:16:54,997
You had no business to talk of me.

1418
02:16:54,998 --> 02:16:56,707
Why not?

1419
02:16:56,708 --> 02:17:00,211
Why not, when we talked
in that way? He was dying.

1420
02:17:06,843 --> 02:17:09,887
It's too late to play a part.

1421
02:17:11,098 --> 02:17:14,642
Touchett knew and I knew
what it cost you to come here.

1422
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:18,229
It will cost you your life.

1423
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:21,232
Give me one word of truth.

1424
02:17:21,233 --> 02:17:23,234
You're afraid to go back.

1425
02:17:26,863 --> 02:17:29,782
You're perfectly alone.

1426
02:17:29,783 --> 02:17:31,993
Now I want you to think of me.

1427
02:17:34,037 --> 02:17:36,747
- To think of you.
- Turn to me.

1428
02:17:37,749 --> 02:17:39,542
Why should you go back?

1429
02:17:39,543 --> 02:17:42,003
Why go through that ghastly form?

1430
02:17:42,004 --> 02:17:44,880
- To get away from you.
- I want to prevent that!

1431
02:17:51,638 --> 02:17:55,474
If you'd only for once listen to me.

1432
02:17:55,642 --> 02:17:57,643
Why shouldn't we be happy?

1433
02:17:57,853 --> 02:18:03,274
Why? Why, when it's here
before us? When it's so easy?

1434
02:18:03,275 --> 02:18:05,735
We can do absolutely as we please.

1435
02:18:05,736 --> 02:18:09,238
To whom under the sun
do we owe anything?

1436
02:18:11,658 --> 02:18:13,909
I beg you to go away.

1437
02:18:16,204 --> 02:18:18,622
Don't say that, don't kill me.

1438
02:18:19,305 --> 02:19:19,352

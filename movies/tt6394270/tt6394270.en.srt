00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,236
<i>Welcome
to</i> The Kelly File, <i>everyone.</i>

3
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,536
<i>I'm Megyn Kelly.</i>

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,106
<i>Breaking tonight, polls are
moving, the race is changing,</i>

5
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,908
<i>and more than a dozen
Republican candidates</i>

6
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,209
<i>are trying
to make themselves heard</i>

7
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,178
<i>with a little more than
one week left</i>

8
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,281
<i>till the debate
that could change everything.</i>

9
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,682
<i>And we're the gateway.</i>

10
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>We, the questioners,
are the gateway.</i>

11
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,285
<i>We at Fox and CNN</i>

12
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,852
<i>and everybody else
who gets a chance</i>

13
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,820
<i>to actually moderate</i>

14
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,156
<i>a presidential debate
with these guys.</i>

15
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,123
<i>I mean, these guys,</i>

16
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,192
<i>they deserve to face
tough questioning.</i>

17
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,027
<i>As Chris says, and I agree,</i>

18
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,594
<i>they want
George Washington's job</i>

19
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,762
<i>and they better earn it.</i>

20
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,065
<i>They better show
the American people</i>

21
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,166
<i>they're worthy of it.</i>

22
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>A lot of folks assumed</i>

23
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,070
<i>Donald Trump
would flame out by now.</i>

24
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,738
<i>They have been proven wrong.
Now wait.</i>

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,839
<i>Here. We gotta get to this</i>

26
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,575
<i>because this is just breaking</i>
<i>on</i> The Daily Beast.

27
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,710
<i>The headline is,</i>

28
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:23,048
<i>"Ex-wife: Donald Trump made me
feel violated during sex.</i>

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,549
<i>Ivana Trump once accused</i>

30
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,052
<i>the real-estate tycoon
of quote, 'rape.'"</i>

31
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,720
<i>Somebody who speaks
for Donald Trump</i>

32
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,688
<i>has come out
and denied it as well</i>

33
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,857
<i>and added that legally,
he says,</i>

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,893
<i>"you cannot rape your spouse."</i>

35
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,629
<i>Here's the one thing
you probably know about me.</i>

36
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,265
<i>I have a big mouth.</i>

37
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,969
<i>Roger,
you have Megyn on line one.</i>

38
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,071
- Megyn.
- <i>Morning, Roger.</i>

39
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,173
What'd you do
to piss off Trump?

40
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,908
We did a segment
on recent coverage

41
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,609
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

42
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,844
You're giving that oxygen

43
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,246
before the first
goddamn debate?

44
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,950
Roger, we had a full-screen
of Ivana's recantation.

45
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,984
Which is soft.

46
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,953
<i>She accused him
during a divorce.</i>

47
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,621
Well, his lawyer,
Michael Cohen,

48
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,990
claims you can't
rape a spouse.

49
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,258
It pissed me off.

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,094
<i>Great. The future of Fox News
is now a goddamn feminist.</i>

51
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,595
No. I'm not a feminist.

52
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,097
- I'm a lawyer.
- <i>We need him.</i>

53
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,901
Clean this up. Now.

54
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,170
<i>Unfortunately,
when it comes to</i>

55
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,871
<i>politicians and the media,</i>

56
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,839
<i>Roger Ailes knows his shit.</i>

57
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,775
<i>Appointed head of
the Fox News channel</i>

58
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,344
<i>by media mogul Rupert Murdoch,</i>

59
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:29,614
<i>Roger transformed cable news,
pushing Fox to the forefront.</i>

60
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,649
<i>Years before,
to get Nixon elected,</i>

61
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,153
<i>he created the modern
town-hall debate.</i>

62
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,686
<i>To get Reagan elected,</i>

63
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,256
<i>he made him address
the elephant in the room.</i>

64
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,993
I will not make age
an issue of this campaign.

65
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,894
I am not going to exploit

66
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,130
my opponent's youth
and inexperience.

67
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,300
<i>To get
George H.W. Bush elected,</i>

68
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,968
<i>somebody did
the Willie Horton ads.</i>

69
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,205
<i>Roger denies it was him...
a lot.</i>

70
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,941
<i>I have been astounded
at the number of Americans</i>

71
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,976
<i>who are fine with our country</i>

72
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,777
<i>moving
in a socialist direction.</i>

73
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,745
Here we go.

74
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,949
<i>Their views on capitalism
are quite alarming.</i>

75
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,251
- <i>I'm a...</i>
- News is like a ship.

76
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,819
You take your hands
off the wheel

77
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,924
and it pulls hard to the left.

78
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,226
Hey, look at this.
James Murdoch.

79
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,727
Tell me those lips
haven't sucked cock.

80
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,604
This is what
nepotism gets you.

81
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,872
Roger rules Fox
from behind these doors,

82
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,341
on the second floor.

83
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,977
When employees say,
"the second floor,"

84
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,378
they mean Roger,

85
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,081
or the many VPs
paid to enact his will

86
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,350
without qualms or questions.

87
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,220
Now, I know what some of you
are thinking, and no,

88
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,255
Roger does not tell us
what to say on air.

89
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,356
He doesn't have to.

90
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,158
- Love that dress, Megyn.
- Thank you.

91
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,394
No, really. I love it.

92
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,098
He's not horny.
He's just ambitious.

93
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,066
<i>Roger is always watching.</i>

94
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,335
<i>The Eagles
postponed their appearance</i>

95
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,337
<i>because co-founder,
Glenn Frey,</i>

96
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,304
<i>is too ill to travel.</i>

97
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,106
<i>In a statement,
the band announced...</i>

98
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,241
Morons.

99
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,476
<i>The phone in his office
connects directly</i>

100
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,843
<i>to the control room...</i>

101
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,046
...which is down
on the first floor.

102
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,783
- Yes, sir?
- <i>You fucking idiots!</i>

103
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,752
That's not Glenn Frey,
it's Don Henley!

104
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,054
- Dump the B-roll.
- Dump it, dump it.

105
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,122
Back to anchor.

106
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,191
That's not Glenn Frey,
that's Don fucking Henley!

107
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,326
- Oh, shoot.
- What the fuck, Kayla?

108
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,728
I'm sorry.
I don't know secular music.

109
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,896
The <i>Eagles?</i>

110
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,198
Only the biggest band
of the '70s.

111
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,798
When my mom was a toddler.

112
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,134
They all look the same.

113
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,036
- They're just old.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,739
Down in the basement
is the Fox newsroom.

115
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,278
All our shows have crews
who work in these pods.

116
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,413
This is my staff.

117
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,947
Hey, guys.

118
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,416
We're below the city,
so it smells like mold.

119
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,118
But there hasn't been
a rat sighting

120
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,920
in four months.

121
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,388
Four months.

122
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,291
The anchors and their
key producers have base camps.

123
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,759
Here, on 17 and 18.

124
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,330
Often decorated
with viewer art.

125
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,933
And everyone in this building,

126
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,801
even Roger, answers to eight.

127
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,304
The eighth floor is home

128
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,073
to CEO Rupert Murdoch
and his sons.

129
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:11,410
This is the power
behind the power.

130
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:14,046
The actual studios are
scattered around the building.

131
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,182
Most anchor
and show offices are here.

132
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,351
Above are Fox Business, radio,

133
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,819
<i>New York Post</i>
and <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

134
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,323
Most of the American
conservative establishment.

135
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,491
In one building.

136
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,227
<i>The stage is finally set</i>

137
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,362
<i>for tonight's Republican
debate in Cleveland.</i>

138
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,463
<i>All the
candidates are looking</i>

139
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,364
<i>for a boost tonight,</i>

140
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,566
<i>but only ten of them
have a chance</i>

141
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,867
<i>to appeal to voters
in prime time.</i>

142
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,514
Trump has a real problem
with women.

143
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,783
I wanna ask about it.

144
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,785
You can back that up?

145
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,822
Yes.

146
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,157
Good morning.

147
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,361
Morning, Chris.

148
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,837
Excuse me.

149
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,590
Do you think that's it?

150
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,228
Sorry.

151
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,332
It's probably nerves.

152
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:44,169
No. When I'm nervous,
I hear my heart.

153
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,138
I can't hear it.

154
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,208
That's your first question?
Is this some feminist thing?

155
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,610
She's not a feminist.

156
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,080
It goes to his electability.

157
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,081
Did you run it
past Tom Lowell?

158
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,949
We can go after Trump.

159
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,217
The second floor
said that?

160
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,119
No.

161
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,023
The eighth. The Murdochs.

162
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,559
Rupert called Roger and said,
about Trump, enough is enough.

163
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,595
Look, all Trump does
is watch Fox.

164
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,398
Roger gave him air
for his crazy theories

165
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
and idiot grievances.

166
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:18,403
Why? 'Cause Roger shares
a lot of them.

167
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,272
Are you sure
you wanna take that on?

168
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,940
Yes.

169
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,975
<i>It's the new
look of politics...</i>

170
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,410
Okay, I don't know
if these are strong enough,

171
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,978
- but they help me.
- Uh-huh. Nausea?

172
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,516
Yeah.
You go live in five hours.

173
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,651
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

174
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,686
Okay.

175
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,922
<i>Donald Trump
feeds his own narrative.</i>

176
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh, fuck.
So nauseous.

177
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,558
If you can try
to keep them down.

178
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,559
Yeah.

179
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,994
Fuck.
Stop making that face, Julia.

180
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,429
I'm not making a face.

181
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,131
Five hours?

182
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,368
- Yeah.
- Okay.

183
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,139
Don't worry.
We're behind you.

184
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,242
Way behind you.

185
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,212
There's a blanket
on the chair

186
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,114
and, just in case,
a trash can beside it.

187
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,317
<i>Welcome to the first
Republican primary debate.</i>

188
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,121
<i>Tonight's moderators
will be Bret Baier,</i>

189
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,425
<i>Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly.</i>

190
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,168
<i>Mr. Trump, one of the things
people love about you</i>

191
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,169
<i>is you speak your mind</i>

192
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,371
<i>and you don't use
a politician's filter.</i>

193
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,141
<i>However, that is not
without its downsides.</i>

194
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:30,642
<i>In particular,
when it comes to women.</i>

195
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:35,514
<i>You've called women you don't
like, "fat pigs," "dogs,"</i>

196
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,651
<i>"slobs"
and "disgusting animals."</i>

197
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,618
What is she doing?

198
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,320
- <i>Your Twitter account...</i>
- <i>Only Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

199
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,588
Great TV.

200
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,590
She knows what she's doing.

201
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,127
<i>Your Twitter account...</i>

202
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,032
<i>For the record, it was
well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

203
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,233
<i>Yes, I'm sure it was.</i>

204
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,436
<i>Your Twitter account has
several disparaging comments</i>

205
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,104
<i>about women's looks.</i>

206
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,106
<i>You once told a contestant</i>

<i>it would be a pretty picture
to see her on her knees.</i>

208
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,244
<i>Does that sound to you

209
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,280
<i>of a man we should elect

210
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,548
<i>And how will you
answer the charge</i>

211
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,149
- <i>from Hillary Clinton...</i>
- She's calling him out.

212
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,618
<i>...who is likely
to be the Democratic nominee,</i>

213
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,721

214
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,559
<i>Call me stupid, but I thought
he'd respect the challenge.</i>

215
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,728
Trump is pissed.
He was up all night, tweeting.

216
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,697
Crap. Really?

217
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,798
What was he tweeting?

218
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,701
"Fox viewers give low marks
to bimbo @MegynKelly."

219
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,669
Ugh. I hate that word.

220
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,604
Yeah. It says you're too sexy
to be smart,

221
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,306
but not smart enough
to be sexy.

222
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,142
2:40 a.m. "Wow, @MegynKelly
really bombed tonight.

223
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,344
"People are going wild
on Twitter! Funny to watch."

224
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,714
- 3:07 a.m. "Dear @Megyn..."
- Go, Trump. Donald Trump.

225
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,782
Okay.

226
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,350
How many times did he tweet?

227
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,085
Like, 15.

228
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,520
Yeah.

229
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,123
He's never gonna be President.

230
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:54,226
Wait. Am I gonna be the story?

231
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,229
No.

232
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,762
- I'm gonna be the story.
- No.

233
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,431
No. No.

234
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,766
<i>I can't let you go without
talking about Donald Trump.</i>

235
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,602
Gretchen's giving
this two blocks?

236
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,136
It's that
far down the food chain?

237
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,471
We should get you
a security team.

238
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,572
Think it over.

239
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,610
Trump called me
before the debate.

240
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,680
He said he knew that your
first question was harsh.

241
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,449
- How could he know that?
- No idea.

242
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,619
I sure didn't.

243
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,591
It was good TV. Unexpected.
Goddamn tough.

244
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,128
Proud of you, Megyn.

245
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,764
Thanks, Roger.

246
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,799
Heard you were sick.

247
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,434
Yeah.

248
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,302
I think it was my coffee.

249
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,271
- Where'd you get it?
- My driver.

250
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,373
He insisted
on some fancy coffee joint.

251
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,543
You know this guy?

252
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,176
No. He's a driver, Roger.

253
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,778
- Did you know him?
- No.

254
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,282
You know
better than that.

255
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,417
<i>Okay, yes,
Roger Ailes is paranoid.</i>

256
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,452
<i>But his parents were nuts.</i>

257
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,453
<i>As he drove off to college,</i>

258
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,323
<i>they filed for divorce,
and didn't tell him.</i>

259
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,859
<i>At Christmas, he came home
to find strangers in his house</i>

260
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:01,860
<i>and all his things,</i>

261
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,863
<i>photos and yearbooks
and trophies thrown out.</i>

262
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,132
<i>I mean, is it any wonder
the man created</i>

263
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,769
<i>a nostalgia machine
for lost America?</i>

264
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,171
This is crazy.

265
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,239
We're sitting here wondering

266
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,541
if a candidate for President
poisoned my coffee.

267
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,310
It's only crazy
until it happens.

268
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,813
And it happens.

269
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,280
I hate being the story.

270
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,415
I'll call Trump.

271
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,650
You go on vacation.
Stay above it all.

272
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,453
He won't dent your ratings.

273
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:32,290
Nobody stops watching
because of a conflict.

274
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,192
They stop watching
when there isn't one.

275
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,627
Some viewers will listen
to him.

276
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,762
Well, some. But as long
as he keeps saying,

277
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,664
"Megyn Kelly is unwatchable,"

278
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,601
that means he's watching it.
They know that.

279
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,471
And they'll watch
what he watches.

280
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,306
You'll be okay.

281
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,708
See you in a week.

282
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,809
Drink up, buddy boy.

283
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,478
Thank you.

284
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,181
Here's to a week
of no kids, but my own.

285
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,049
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

286
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,284
Okay,
Frank Bruni in <i>The Times.</i>

287
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,819
- Boo.
- "The debate was riveting.

288
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,720
"It was admirable.

- Wow.

00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,525
Well, that's gotta
make you happy,

293
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,427
praise all tangled up
in an insult.

294
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,762
It does make me happy, Gil.

295
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,530
<i>And, you know,

- <i>wherever.</i>
- No. Oh, my God.

299
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,938
Did he just accuse me
of anger-menstruating?

300
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,640
Yes. Are... Um, yeah.

301
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:22,908
- Yeah.
- I'm calling Roger.

302
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,275
No. I'll talk to him.

303
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,610
Take your vacation.
I'll handle this.

304
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,745
- Oh, my God.
- Do you hear the phones?

305
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,812
Doug.

306
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:28,713
I have to call you back.

307
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,949
<i>Would you like to
correct yourself</i>

308

309
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,654
<i>We don't have any time.
I wish we did.</i>

310
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:36,855
<i>We're running over,

311
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,424
<i>Yeah, well, HR is on the phone
'cause you called me a skirt.</i>

312

<i>"Is Gretchen as cute in person
as she is on TV?"</i>

317
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,834
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>
- <i>And what did you answer him?</i>

318
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:50,903
<i>Beautiful dress.</i>

319
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,470
<i>You look wonderful.
Great color.</i>

320
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,838
<i>In summary,
Gretchen's beautiful.</i>

321
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,273
<i>Beautiful. You look beautiful.</i>

322
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,242
<i>Well, you look fabulous, too.</i>

323
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,377
<i>'Cause you gotta wax?
Does the waxing hurt?</i>

324
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,246
<i>Uh, he looks at me for that!</i>

325
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,781
<i>We'll try that.
Women are everywhere.</i>

326
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,516
<i>We're letting 'em play golf
and tennis now.</i>

327
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,650
- <i>It's outta control.</i>
- <i>You know what?</i>

328
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:06,818
<i>You know...
She's out.</i>

329
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,622
<i>You read the headlines,
since men are so great.</i>

330
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,691
<i>She needed a shower.</i>

331
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,427
The attitude off-camera
was even worse.

332
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,362
Steve simply started
ignoring me.

333
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,899
What did Mr. Ailes say
when you complained?

334
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,500
He said, "You act
like it only rains on women.

335
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:26,571
"Stop getting goddamn offended
by everything.

336
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:27,839
"You're a man-hater."

337
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,945
And, um, "Learn to get along
with the boys."

338
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,344
Then he took me off the show.

339
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,713
But gave you your own.

340
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,916
Well, in the afternoon
dead zone.

341
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,783
I mean, it was a demotion
and we both knew it.

342
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,854
Even though I did increase
the ratings by 15%.

343
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,225
He moved me
to second base.

344
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,425
<i>Back in Minnesota,</i>

345
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,295
<i>before I graduated
summa cum laude from Stanford,</i>

346
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,430
<i>before I was crowned
Miss America,</i>

347
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,832
<i>I played second base</i>

348
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,869
<i>in the sixth-grade
softball league.</i>

349
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,072
I hate second base.

350
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,041
Did he ever offer
to reverse that decision

351
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:05,310
if you made yourself
sexually available?

352
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,912
Not directly.

353
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,781
With Roger,
it's always about loyalty.

354
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,317
He says he can fix things
if you're loyal.

355
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,688
And you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

356
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,823
We don't guess.

357
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,760
Oral sex.

358
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:21,227
Roger likes to joke,

359
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,828
"To get ahead,
you gotta give a little head."

360
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,831
Really.

361
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,932
But Mr. Ailes

362
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,935
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex?

363
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,837
I mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

364
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,007
Like, "You're sexy
but you're too much work."

365
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,341
You're... I mean...

366
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,544
I have a whole list in here

367
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,813
because that's just
how Roger is.

368
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,115
What do you want
out of a lawsuit?

369
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:47,086
What do I want?
I want this behavior to stop.

370
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,888
Someone has to speak up.
Someone has to get mad.

371
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,991
Well, that may not be you.

372
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:53,926
Your contract
will have a clause

373
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:56,361
requiring secret,
mandatory arbitration.

374
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,829
You familiar
with Rudi Bakhtiar's case?

375
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,566
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Well, you're supposed to be.</i>

376
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,970
My first act as
DC bureau chief...

377
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:05,837
I want you down here
full-time.

378
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,373
Oh, my God.

379
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,942
That's amazing. Yes.

380
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,576
You do know
what this means for you?

381
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,812
<i>Shit.
He doesn't think I'm ready.</i>

382
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:16,115
Brian,
I will not let you down.

383
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,682
I'm gonna bust my ass for you.

384
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,818
Well, Rudi, come on,
that's a given.

385
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,619
<i>So, what's the problem?</i>

386
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,855
But, um...

387
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,993
Look, you do get
how I feel about you, right?

388
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,897
<i>Oh, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

389
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,532
Well, I'm glad
you said that, Brian,

390
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,068
because I really respect
you, too.

391
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,338
No. No. I mean...

392
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,975
How I really feel.

393
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,578
<i>Just look confused.</i>

394
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,545
All I want from you, Rudi,

395
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,982
is to see the inside
of your hotel room.

396
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,550
<i>God damn it.</i>

397
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,988
That's all it's gonna take.

398
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,991
<i>Don't react.
Make it your fault.</i>

399
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,791
Brian, if I've done anything

400
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,693
to make you think
I feel that way about you,

401
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,561
I apologize.

402
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,629
<i>Friends.</i>

403
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,897
We're friends.

404
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,166
<i>Professionals.</i>

405
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,735
We have
a great professional vibe.

406
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,070
<i>Now sell it.</i>

407
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:11,937
I just don't do that.

408
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,805
I've never had to do that
for a job.

409
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,940
I know, I know.

410
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,675
You know I'd kill for DC,

411
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,778
but there's no way
I'm showing you my hotel room.

412
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,749
<i>This is gonna
ruin my career.</i>

413
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,087
Well, now I feel
like a creep.

414
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,190
No.
No, you're so not.

415
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,759
<i>Fucking creep.</i>

416
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,797
They fired me.

417
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,469
I'm a lousy reporter
apparently. Assholes.

418
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,772
<i>She proved
what they wanted her to prove.</i>

419
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,675
No one really wins
by suing Fox News.

420
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,744
It's been our experience

421
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,049
that once you go public
in your job,

422
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,850
no one will hire you.

423
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,920
If you're able
to stick it out at Fox,

424
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:02,021
gather more evidence,

425
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:06,992
you might be able to sue
Ailes himself instead of Fox.

426
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,160
And that is why I'm here.

427
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:12,197
Because Marty Hyman told me
that over here in New Jersey,

428
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,800
I can avoid arbitration
by suing Roger personally.

429
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,003
He says that you've managed
to change the law,

430
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,671
and that we could
call other women

431
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,140
and show a pattern.

432
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,008
Will other women come forward?

433
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,276
Yes, they will.

434
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,678
You live and work in New York.

435
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,646
Roger has a house
in Bergen County

436
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,515
where he stays
when he can't make it upstate.

437
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,985
You do
your homework, Ms. Carlson.

438
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:35,653
No fingerprints.

439
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,923
That's how much I practiced
the violin as a child.

440
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,791
If Roger finds out
you came to us,

441
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,893
- he won't just fire you.
- Mmm.

442
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,130
He will bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

443
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,732
He will attack you personally.

444
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,667
These men, they care
more about their reputations

445
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,835
than they do money.

446
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,071
Roger won't stop.

447
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,671
- Oh, I know. Mmm-hmm.
- You know that.

448
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,275
Colleagues you admire
will say publicly

449
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:58,310
you're a superior,
ambitious woman

450
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,680
who's suing
because her career stalled.

451
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:02,749
Let 'em.

452
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,353
Okay.

453
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,621
If we work hard,
you might be lucky enough

454
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,257
to watch
the most powerful man in TV

455
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,093
go after you
with everything he's got.

456
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,629
Thank you.

457
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:23,037
I'm telling you,
other women will come forward.

458
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,971
Let's hope.

459
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,839
Frankly,
I think you have a gap

460
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,908
in the network, Mr. Shine.

461
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,245
There are millions of young
conservatives in this country.

462
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:36,148
I mean, you can look at my
Instagram account. There are.

463
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,219
They don't have a voice
on our network.

464
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:42,321
I see myself as an influencer
in the Jesus space.

465
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:43,755
And don't get me wrong,

466
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,890
I've learned a ton
from Gretchen,

467
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,026
I truly have, of course.

468
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:49,694
But no judgment here,

469
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,597
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

470
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,700
It's just not that helpful
to her.

471
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,703
I mean, to be honest,
Mr. Shine,

472
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,073
she's sort of Establishment.

473
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,807
With a capital E.

474
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,344
That's why I wanted
to talk to you in private.

475
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:08,249
Kayla, before we
move you up,

476
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:12,217
I want to ask you
something personal.

477
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,254
Mmm.

478
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,654
What do you think
of our slogan,

479
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,925
"Fair and Balanced"?

480
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,927
I'm glad you asked.

481
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,827
Look, our news shows

482
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,862
and our opinion shows
are very different.

483
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,167
Our news is impartial,
it's top-of-the-line.

484
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:29,801
Our opinion shows,

485
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,870
Roger gave a voice
to people who didn't have one.

486
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,375
And he balanced
the American conversation.

487
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:40,245
So, our newspeople are fair.

488
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:44,851
Our entertainers are a very
necessary form of balance.

489
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,291
Attagirl. Perfect.

490
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,825
But today,
we're sticking up for girls

491
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:56,128
on International Day
of the Girl.

492
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,031
And, for the first time
on cable news, here I am,

493
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,366
makeup-free for a reason.

494
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:05,070
<i>Tomorrow I'll be back
in my regular makeup.</i>

495
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,371
And I thank
the other brave women

496
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,373
who came on today's show
<i>sans</i> makeup.

497
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:13,245
But let's continue to tell
our girls, "Just be yourself."

498
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,379
Shep.

499
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,414
- And clear.
- Yes.

500
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,848
Great show.

501
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,317
Get me some makeup.

502
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,085
I have some bad news.

503
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,222
Kayla is leaving us
for the asshole.

504
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,689
- O'Reilly?
- Mmm-hmm.

505
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,426
It is our
highest-rated program.

506
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,061
And we can't be?

507
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:31,130
No, I believe
in <i>Real Story,</i> I do.

508
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,764
Did you just see that segment?
Did you see it? Did you see...

509
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,766
We're doing
something unique here.

510
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,702
- Mmm-hmm.
- Together. All of us.

511
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,871
- Can you just...
- Sure.

512
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:40,908
Listen to me.

513
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:44,842
I can get you
where you wanna be.

514
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,211
I can protect you.

515
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:47,446
Just don't get ahead
of yourself.

516
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,780
You have a lot to learn.
I can teach you.

517
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,183
I'm not getting ahead
of myself, Gretchen.

518
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,750
- I'm taking the next step.
- No. Listen.

519
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,954
- I learn by doing.
- Come on. Come on, please.

520
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,089
I'm confused.

521
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,924
You want me to pass on
a promotion

522
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,727
so you can help me
get the same promotion

523
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,263
- on a show with worse ratings?
- No. I just...

524
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,431
I want a little loyalty.
I need loyalty.

525
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,832
Women, together.

526
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,435
- I'm loyal to the network.
- All right.

527
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,037
It's not us versus them,
Gretchen.

528
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,140
Miss America.

529
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,207
Roger.

530
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,841
Hi, there.

531
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,944
- This is a treat.
- What the fuck are you doing?

532
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,846
A segment on how
we oversexualize women.

533
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,017
I mean, you said
be more myself, so, ta-da.

534
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,451
You know
what makeup does?

535
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,253
Keeps everybody
from seeing you sweat.

536
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,923
Well, it's... Most of
the mean tweets that I receive

537
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,357
are about my appearance,

538
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,992
so it is important
that we fight back

539
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:35,060
against this kind of bullying.

540
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:36,495
Bullying isn't meanness.

541
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,163
Bullying is
people with more power

542
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:39,797
hitting people with less.

543
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,533
These jackasses
have cellphones.

544
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,270
You have a fucking TV show!

545
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,539
We have to fight
the objectification of women.

546
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,839
Oh, bullshit.

547
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,476
Listen,
mouth shut, ears open.

548
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,445
Nobody wants to watch
a middle-aged woman

549
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:55,047
sweat her way
through menopause.

550
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:55,981
What?

551
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,250
Not on
national fucking television!

552
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:00,785
Thank you for the advice.

553
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,789
Objectification.

554
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:09,394
All right.

555
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,828
Gretchen,
I really appreciate...

556
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,831
Shut up.

557
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,169
Good luck.

558
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:24,445
Drift.

559
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:26,879
Go, go, go!

560
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:29,414
Whoo! Good one, honey.

561
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,916
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

562
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,423
Hey.

563
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,958
It's a zoo here.

564
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,195
The phone's ringing
off the hook.

565
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,996
Anyone care
he called me a bimbo?

566
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:45,097
Not really.

567
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,332
- He tweeted the <i>GQ</i> photo.
- <i>I saw.</i>

568
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,201
- <i>And?</i>
- Torn.

569
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:52,870
God, I'd love
to be slut-shamed.

570
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,307
Gil wants to ask again
if we should make a statement.

571
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,576
No. No response. Zero.

572
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,981
Doug just lost.
I gotta go.

573
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,149
Next time, honey.

574
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,317
Nice.

575
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,421
- Good game.
- Trump, '16.

576
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:10,322
Excuse me.

577
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:11,856
You talk to my wife again,

578
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,394
I will beat you
to a fucking pulp.

579
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,398
- That was weird.
- Mmm-hmm.

580
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,199
You're getting some action.

581
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,334
Oh, really?

582
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,980
Oh, man.

583
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,550
Asshole.

584
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,151
You don't have to worry
about Trump.

585
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:41,019
You're tougher
than all those guys, okay?

586
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,220
You just gotta worry
about the crazies.

587
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:43,622
- I can handle a few crazies.
- I know.

588
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:44,756
Mommy.

589
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,059
Trump will stop once he feels
he's won the argument.

590
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:48,560
I feel like
he's less interested

591
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,895
in winning the argument

592
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:54,032
than just having the argument
with you in public

593
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,901
to prove he can
take on the establishment.

594
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,569
I'm not the establishment.

595
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:00,906
Honey, get real.
You are the establishment now.

596
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:02,376
- Mommy!
- Not yet!

597
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:08,347
You do understand I have
to be above this, right?

598
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,082
I have to be an anchor first,
then a woman.

599
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,416
You know the entire country

600
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,119
is talking
about your period right now?

601
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,088
- Mommy!
- What?

602
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,956
- There's a man.
- What?

603
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,558
- Yardley!
- Look. He's right there.

604
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,226
- Yardley, where is he?
- Look. There he is.

605
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,461
Oh, Jesus.
He's got a fucking camera!

606
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:23,528
Come here, honey.

607
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,629
No, no, no!
Don't open the door.

608
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,997
They can't sell them
if we're inside.

609
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,366
Get out. Get out of here! Go!

610
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,369
Are you okay?

611
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,305
What were
you guys doing?

612
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,540
- Mommy and Daddy?
- Mmm-hmm.

613
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,176
Um...
It was a crossword...

614
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,312
Mommy was just taking
a quick little nap.

615
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,149
- Quick one.
- It wasn't that quick.

616
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,584
I'm gonna have to
call Roger about security.

617
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,252
<i>It's as clear as a bell</i>

618
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:49,988
<i>that Mayhem Kelly has
gone over to the dark side.</i>

619
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,723
<i>The more she sells out,</i>

620
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:53,625
<i>the wider
her nostrils have become.</i>

621
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,460
<i>Listen to
what I've just said to you.</i>

622
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:56,361
He's here.

623
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,563
<i>This woman was once pretty,</i>

624
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,165
<i>and the more she has sold out,</i>

625
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,533
<i>the wider
her nostrils have become.</i>

626
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,101
<i>They're almost porcine.</i>

627
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:05,103
<i>She snorts her insults
at America...</i>

628
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:06,371
Roger!

629
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,206
<i>...and, as I say, it's now
the portrait of Dorian Kelly,</i>

630
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,641
<i>not the portrait
of Dorian Gray.</i>

631
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:13,111
Give me a day to figure out
how we hit Trump back.

632
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,246
Stop by later.

633
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:16,081
I don't want my kids
hearing this crap.

634
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,651
Ignore the damn morons.

635
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,185
I'm old, fat, and ugly.

636
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,587
Christ,
they call me Jabba the Hutt.

637
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:27,058
Hemophilia swells my joints.
Can't exercise.

638
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,361
I feel fine,
but I look like shit.

639
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,663
I look the opposite
of how I feel.

640
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:34,935
Do I let it affect me?
No, I do not.

641
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,170
<i>This isn't entirely true.</i>

642
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,604
<i>Roger is also fat</i>

643
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,273
<i>because he'll get
a room-service menu</i>

644
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,374
<i>and order page two.</i>

645
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,443
No goddamn orange on Fox!

646
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,278
<i>But he cares a lot
about looks.</i>

647
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,579
Fucking idiots.

648
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,514
Let's turn our attention
to South Korea.

649
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,682
South Korean officials say

650
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:53,452
talks with the north have
adjourned until tomorrow...

651
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:54,753
<i>Early on, he realized</i>

652
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,788
<i>for a network to stay on
24 hours a day,</i>

653
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,391
<i>you need something
to hold an audience.</i>

654
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,592
Joining me to discuss

655
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:02,394
the Korean peninsula
is Seth Choy...

656
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:05,297
<i>That something is legs.</i>

657
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:07,167
There's a reason
for clear desks.

658
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:11,136
We need you
in a shorter dress.

659
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:12,270
<i>But you know
that they're gonna take...</i>

660
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,274
Wide shot! Wider!

661
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,107
Go to the wide shot!

662
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,809
I want to see
her goddamn legs.

663
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,744
Why the fuck
do you think I hired her?

664
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,146
<i>But this might
be seen by racial activists</i>

665
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:22,449
<i>purely
through the racial prism.</i>

666
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,819
Uh, stand up
and give me a spin.

667
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:30,224
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a visual medium.

668
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:38,396
Yeah.
That's good. Sit down.

669
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,265
I support the wall. I do.

670
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,434
But mass deportations,
come on.

671
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,535
That'll never work

672
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,770
because of the 14th Amendment.
You want me to quote it?

673
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,305
"If you were born in America,

674
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,307
"you're an American, period.
Period."

675
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,276
Get me
a demographically friendly

676
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,211
Hispanic woman on immigration.

677
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:56,615
But, hey, she needs to be
very demographically friendly.

678
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,152
Okay. Uh, new girl's up.
Kayla.

679
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,720
Hi, sir.

680
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,788
So, I was listening to
Rush Limbaugh this morning.

681
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,658
He said something kind of cool
about Anthony Weiner.

682
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,694
How he's an exhibitionist
in every aspect

683
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,397
of how he presents himself
politically.

684
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,465
Oh, my God.

685
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,367
Is she the best
you can do?

686
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:18,503
Bill Shine asked us
to give her a try, so...

687
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,675
Okay, let's not lose
focus. Back to immigration.

688
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:23,875
Oh, my gosh.

689
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:25,277
I can't get fired.

690
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,246
This is the only job
I have ever wanted.

691
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:31,483
I don't wanna be on TV,
I wanna be on Fox.

692
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,352
- Uh-huh.
- My family, every day,

693
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:36,788
every holiday,
especially holidays,

694
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,256
they watch Fox News.

695
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,125
We're like addicts.

696
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,459
Fox is how we do church.

697
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:42,761
You know when they made
the corner logo turn...

698
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:43,895
The bug.

699
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:46,498
...because folks had "Fox"
burned into their TV screens?

700
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,632
That's us.

701
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,234
Kayla,
you're not getting fired.

702
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,702
He cannot scale his anger.

703
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,370
He's a perpetual
outrage machine.

704
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:54,606
That's why crazies love him.
No offense to your family.

705
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,909
You want to do the folders?
No crying at Fox.

706
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:58,111
No crying.

707
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,381
Let me explain
your mistake here.

708
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:05,383
So, Rush is on Hannity's team.

709
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,552
They're the competition.
They're GOP party hacks.

710
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,154
So, he thinks
he's way ahead of them,

711
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,389
so steal from Drudge
and Breitbart, not talk radio.

712
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,357
Okay.

713
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,259
Also, stop worrying
if the story's legit.

714
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:15,327
If you can't source it,

715
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,262
just go with,
"Some are saying."

716
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:18,332
Seriously?

717
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,199
You have to adopt

718
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,834
the mentality of
an Irish street cop.

719
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,870
The world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

720
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,305
minorities are criminals,

721
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:29,174
sex is sick,
but interesting.

722
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,576
Ask yourself, "What would
scare my grandmother,

723
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,511
"or piss off my grandfather?"

724
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:36,181
And that's a Fox story.
Are you writing this down?

725
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:37,382
Oh, it makes
so much sense.

726
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,750
- Frighten, titillate.
- Right.

727
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:41,954
Frighten, titillate.
Frighten, titillate.

728
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:43,355
When you're starting
the story,

729
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:44,656
you need to start
with a clear villain.

730
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:48,493
Liberal judge,
pinhead mayor,

731
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,729
- Vermont, Hollywood.
- Uh-huh.

732
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,430
Conservatives
want to conserve.

733
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,568
- Uh-huh.
- You're the last defense

734
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:58,737
against Jesus-hating,
trans-loving,

735
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:02,374
Clinton-controlled
Armageddon, baby.

736
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:04,342
Oh, come on.

737
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:07,214
You do believe
some of that, right?

738
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:08,815
Yeah.

739
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,318
Uh...

740
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,257
That's quite a face
you have.

741
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,825
Really?

742
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,529
Thank you.

743
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:24,930
I'm drunk.

744
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,431
I'm drunk as well.

745
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,910
You have a Hillary poster
in your house.

746
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,445
I guess I do.

747
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,313
Okay, my parents
would be horrified

748
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:43,684
if I went home
with a Democrat.

749
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:47,852
The lesbianism, however?

750
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,456
Oh, I'm not a lesbian.

751
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,590
I'm not a Democrat.

752
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:55,862
I just have two giant
Hillary posters in my kitchen.

753
00:29:57,531 --> 00:29:59,264
As a joke, though, right?

754
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,267
No. That's who
I'd like to be the President.

755
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:04,036
Are you serious?

756
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:06,638
I'm a closeted Democrat.

757
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,273
At Fox News?

758
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,975
Oh, my God.
I thought that you knew that.

759
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:12,877
No, I didn't know that.
Does anyone know that?

760
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,480
Can you not tell?
You can't tell anyone.

761
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,217
- Of course I won't tell.
- No, I'm so serious.

762
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,519
- Can I ask something?
- Mmm-hmm.

763
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,924
Why do you work at Fox?

764
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:27,525
Why don't you work
at MSNBC or something?

765
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:31,763
I think I, like,
thrive in toxic environments.

766
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,901
I never know
if you're kidding or not.

767
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,667
I am kidding.

768
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,869
I applied everywhere

769
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,039
and I got a job at Fox.

770
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:42,307
And I keep applying
to other places

771
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,278
and they keep not taking me
because I work at Fox.

772
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:49,316
Oh, my gosh.

773
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,816
It's okay.

774
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:54,385
One day I'm gonna be free.

775
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:55,553
What? It's not that bad.

776
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:58,790
If you're gay,
it's pretty bad.

777
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,760
Well, yeah, you don't
wanna be gay at Fox.

778
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:05,430
You work for Bill O'Reilly
and you have a Hillary poster?

779
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,397
You do know he likes to

780
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,433
call up female producers
and whack off, right?

781
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:09,534
Bill?

782
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,936
Yes, Bill.

783
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,071
No.

784
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:14,073
You haven't heard about
the Andrea Mackris lawsuit?

785
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:16,341
- No.
- Oh, my God.

786
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:17,910
This should be
in the welcome packet.

787
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:20,411
She was one of
his associate producers.

788
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,580
He took her,
and only her,

789
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:24,049
to the Republican
National Convention.

790
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,784
Called her up at 11:00,

791
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:26,785
touching himself

792
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,787
and telling her
what he wanted to do to her

793
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,522
with the old falafel.

794
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:32,757
Are you kidding?

795
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,559
It's on the internet.

796
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:38,563
And then, quote, "using
a vibrator upon himself."

797
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,833
Like, he brought a vibrator
from home to the convention?

798
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,135
Yes, well, you have to bring

799
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:44,602
a vibrator from home
to the convention.

800
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:49,741
The question is, what does
a man do with a vibrator?

801
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:54,412
Do you place it
alongside the shaft?

802
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,086
I don't wanna hear that.

803
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,656
"Fucking die, bitch."

804
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:05,525
"If I see you,
you better run."

805
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:09,563
"I wouldn't be sleeping
too soundly if I were you."

806
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,629
Trump's lit the torches.

807
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:14,033
You're getting
security tonight.

808
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:17,102
All I want is for this
to go away, Roger.

809
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,071
Look, every general in history

810
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:21,341
has gone into battle
feeling the same.

811
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:25,612
Right.

812
00:32:27,148 --> 00:32:29,714
I'll read a statement
at the top, saying,

813
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:32,784
"Yes, Trump is attacking me,
but I'm not going to respond."

814
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,421
Any defense
will come from you.

815
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:39,693
Not right now.

816
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:43,695
You set a record
on viewer email.

817
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:44,698
Let me guess.

818
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,001
None of it on my side.

819
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:48,733
No.

820
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:50,535
Our audience loves Trump.

821
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:53,705
A hell of a lot more
than the Murdochs realize.

822
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,408
More than Trump knows.

823
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,576
He's tweeting
we made peace.

824
00:32:58,578 --> 00:33:00,778
He'll come on <i>Fox & Friends</i>
tomorrow.

825
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
He needs us.
We need him.

826
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:04,118
It's got nothing
to do with you.

827
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:09,088
All right. It's late.

828
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,757
I have dogs to feed.

829
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,010
Just to be clear,

830
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:33,544
I will not be
kissing Trump's ass at 9:00.

831
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:36,614
We fight
tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

832
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,164
Can I see
that statement again, Bill?

833
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,100
Heard there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

834
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:57,470
and presidential contender
Donald Trump.

835
00:33:58,772 --> 00:33:59,873
How you doing, Megyn?

836
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:03,710
Hanging in there.

837
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,746
Give him hell, Megyn.

838
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,920
<i>Okay, quiet on the set.</i>

839
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:18,458
<i>We go live in five, four,
three, two...</i>

840
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,526
I just got back
from a weekend at the beach

841
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:22,627
with my husband
and my three kids.

842
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:24,562
Did anything happen
in the news while I was gone?

843
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,031
You may have heard

844
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,900
there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

845
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:30,069
and presidential contender
Donald Trump.

846
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:32,139
Mr. Trump was upset
with a question I asked...

847
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,840
Oh, cute baby.

848
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:38,511
I gotta say,
I can't stand your show.

849
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,114
Oh.

850
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:41,779
You guys at Fox,

851
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,917
you're doing terrible things
to our country.

852
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:46,786
Well, I hope
that makes you feel better.

853
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:50,089
How you treat
people you disagree with

854
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,926
says everything about you.

855
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,901
<i>You know, I mean, Jesus was
a white man too, you know?</i>

856
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:04,602
<i>It's like,
he was an historical figure.</i>

857
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,870
<i>I mean,
that's a verifiable fact.</i>

858
00:35:05,872 --> 00:35:08,173
<i>As is Santa. I just want the
kids watching to know that.</i>

859
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:10,808
<i>But my point is,
how do you just revise it</i>

860
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,610
<i>and change Santa
from white to black?</i>

861
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,148
<i>I mean, you can't. Not really.</i>

862
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:19,318
Wow.

863
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,086
Nice dress.

864
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:23,621
I hope you don't
wear that to Sunday service.

865
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,656
Please. I have church jeans,

866
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:28,029
so I can hold a latte
on my knee.

867
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:31,196
Oh, my God. Kayla.

868
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,766
- Did you see this?
- What?

869
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:38,638
I'm a creep.

870
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,174
- That is gross.
- I know.

871
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,878
I love that.

872
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:49,181
Are you crazy?

873
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,349
What?

874
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:52,552
That's my friend from college.

875
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,120
I'm just
looking out for you.

876
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:56,687
Who are you stalking?

877
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:57,690
No one.

878
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,573
I feel for you.

879
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,241
That show.

880
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,911
Oh, his bark is worse
than his bite.

881
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:20,345
Well, I work for Roger.

882
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,882
We have two, three
and four-donut days.

883
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,850
Sugar does make
everybody crazy.

884
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,186
No, these aren't donuts
he eats.

885
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:29,656
They're donuts he throws.
At somebody.

886
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,128
No,
he's a pussycat.

887
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,198
Come say hi. We're always
looking for on-air talent.

888
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,901
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

889
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,270
Now?

890
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,438
Sure.

891
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,214
That's Roger's
private elevator.

892
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,616
Hang on a sec.

893
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,328
Mmm-hmm.

894
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:09,727
Hello.

895
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,798
- Ah, have a seat.
- Thank you.

896
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,001
Liberals don't get Megyn.

897
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:19,371
She's a star not because
she thinks Santa's white,

898
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:21,406
- but because she'll say it.
- That's right.

899
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,909
Yeah, few have courage
in the spotlight.

900
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,377
It's powerful to watch.

901
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:27,980
And she went up 30%
that quarter.

902
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,082
Well, that, too.

903
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:33,318
All audiences want
is authenticity.

904
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,053
- Mmm.
- For 200 years,

905
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:36,421
Santa's a fat white guy.

906
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,190
They think Santa,

907
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:39,291
- that's what they see.
- Right.

908
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:41,160
You want to
change that? Fine.

909
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:44,263
Let's discuss it without you
calling my people racist.

910
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:45,397
Exactly.

911
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:48,200
A liberal is somebody
who wants to live in a future

912
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:50,235
that he is too lazy

913
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:53,138
or too arrogant
to actually create.

914
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,375
Well, in my family,
Santa's always been white

915
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:59,810
and, according to my
granddaddy, a communist.

916
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,284
So, that's my family.

917
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:07,785
So, what can I do
for you, Kayla?

918
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,522
Why did you
drop by to see me?

919
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,524
Well, the thing is, sir,

920
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,927
I actually started on-air
during college

921
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:17,062
in Central Florida. Weather.

922
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:19,897
I want
to convince you

923
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:22,867
that that is where I
belong, Mr. Ailes.

924
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,204
I think I'd be freakin'
phenomenal on your network.

925
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:27,908
Well, it's
Mr. Murdoch's air,

926
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:32,444
but I did create it.
I do run it.

927
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:33,512
Right.

928
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:34,949
You have a pretty face.

929
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,817
Here, uh, stand up
and give me a twirl.

930
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:40,953
Now?

931
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:43,055
Yeah.
Just a quick spin.

932
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,491
Oh. Sure.

933
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:57,069
That's very good.

934
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:01,808
Now, uh, pull your dress up
and let me see your legs.

935
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:08,415
Um...

936
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,491
It's a visual medium, Kayla.

937
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:20,527
Come on.

938
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:30,471
Higher.

939
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:48,255
Come on. Higher.

940
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:12,546
That's fine, Kayla.

941
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:17,184
Why don't you
sit down?

942
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:29,594
Thank you.

943
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,597
Mmm-hmm.

944
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,199
You have a great body.

945
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,302
Thank you.

946
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:41,841
Mr. Ailes...

947
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,912
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this...

948
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:49,047
- No, no, of course.
- ...to anyone.

949
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:50,482
I'm here to help
my employees,

950
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,918
- not hurt them.
- It would just sound...

951
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,921
Anything that happens
here, in this room,

952
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:59,124
is strictly
between you and me.

953
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,528
- Okay.
- Of course, it cuts both ways.

954
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,331
I'm discreet,

955
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,001
but unforgiving.

956
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:20,414
Success in
broadcast television

957
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,248
is hard.
It's arbitrary.

958
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,885
This is the most competitive
industry on earth.

959
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,620
You understand
what I'm saying?

960
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:29,990
Mmm-hmm.

961
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,025
We could work together.

962
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,262
I could pluck you out
and move you

963
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,333
all the way
to the front of the line.

964
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,137
But I want
something in return.

965
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,610
Do you know
what that is, Kayla?

966
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:55,315
Loyalty.

967
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:59,286
I need to know
that you're loyal.

968
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:05,025
I need you to find
a way to prove it.

969
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,759
Mmm-hmm.

970
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,430
You think about that,
all right?

971
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,171
So, we'll talk again?

972
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,041
Faye can show you
the way out.

973
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,709
Thank you, sir.

974
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,301
Jess. Jess.

975
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:55,375
Something really weird
just happened.

976
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,312
I just went
to say hi to...

977
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:04,218
I just... I met...
I was invited to meet Roger.

978
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:07,321
I mean, nothing...

979
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:10,121
Nothing happened.

980
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:11,325
Kayla.

981
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:15,126
It's actually
better for you

982
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:16,463
if you don't
involve me in this.

983
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,168
Um, 'cause they know
that we're friends.

984
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:23,704
I'm sorry.

985
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:25,639
Okay.

986
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:27,641
This place is crazy.

987
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,117
No Trump. No KKK.

988
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,418
No fascist USA.

989
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,387
- Jesus.
- Okay, we're here.

990
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,089
<i>His assistant's name is Rhona.</i>

991
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:45,724
<i>The security guard is Keith...</i>

992
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:46,791
Got it.

993
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,494
Gil, last words?

994
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,431
<i>Yeah, don't piss him off.
I need this job.</i>

995
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,231
<i>Good luck.</i>

996
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:54,535
I'll be waiting
right here, okay?

997
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:06,813
Are you
happy now, bitch?

998
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,883
<i>During the day,
if I'm in the office,</i>

999
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,652
<i>I have a number of people</i>

1000
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:15,186
<i>that I'll just call out
a tweet to.</i>

1001
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:16,488
<i>It's always my right.</i>

1002
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,223
<i>You probably had some pretty
nasty tweets sent your way.</i>

1003
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:19,357
<i>I don't want that to happen.</i>

1004
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,592
<i>I have fans
that really love...</i>

1005
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:23,461
<i>But you retweet some of those.
It's not just the fans.</i>

1006
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:25,130
<i>But not
the more nasty ones.</i>

1007
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:27,265
<i>You would be amazed
at the ones I don't retweet.</i>

1008
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:28,833
<i>"Bimbo"?</i>

1009
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:32,370
<i>Uh, well, that was a retweet.
Yeah, did I say that?</i>

1010
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:35,140
<i>Many times.
Ooh, okay. Excuse me.</i>

1011
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,710
<i>But not the most
horrible thing, you know.</i>

1012
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:41,346
<i>Over your life, Megyn, you've
been called a lot worse.</i>

1013
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,915
- <i>Is that right?</i>
- All right, that's enough.

1014
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,683
<i>It's not about me.
It's not about me.</i>

1015
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:46,620
Well, what do you think?

1016
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:50,455
I think
you're too solicitous.

1017
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:52,324
Thank you.

1018
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:54,559
But this once, I can handle
a straight-up positive.

1019
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,294
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

1020
00:44:56,296 --> 00:44:59,698
He attacks you
for a year straight

1021
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,601
and you let him off
with a fucking "oops."

1022
00:45:02,603 --> 00:45:04,703
What?
I don't let him off.

1023
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:08,273
I confront him.
I used Donald Trump.

1024
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:10,275
Honey, you absolved him.

1025
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:11,610
Doug, there are internal

1026
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:13,345
political pressures
at play here as well.

1027
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:15,213
Yeah, yeah. I bet.
I get it, Gil.

1028
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,681
You know what,
can we have a second, guys?

1029
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:17,851
Please.

1030
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,356
I'm not trying to be critical.
I just...

1031
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:26,424
Well, you are.
I made this go away.

1032
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:29,594
I stopped his
harassing bullshit. For us.

1033
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,896
I never
asked you to do that.

1034
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:33,198
He is going to be

1035
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,833
the Republican candidate
for President.

1036
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:36,701
I'm a news anchor.
I need access to him.

1037
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:39,404
You need access?
At what fucking price?

1038
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:43,375
At what price? The price
of our apartment. My salary.

1039
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:45,712
That pays our fucking bills.

1040
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,656
- Look. For the record...
- No. You know what?

1041
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:59,192
It's been a shitty year!

1042
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,293
Really fucking shitty year,

1043
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:04,496
and I'm allowed
to want it over.

1044
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:06,700
You are.

1045
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:10,335
Fuck.

1046
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,871
So, what I'm saying is,
do we really need AR-15s

1047
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,506
to be able to hunt deer,

1048
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:15,573
protect our families?

1049
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:19,912
I'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

1050
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:21,880
Some of these mass shootings
would have been less deadly

1051
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,348
if that had been the case.

1052
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,651
But I'm also with
the majority today,

1053
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,989
taking a stand against
semiautomatic assault weapons.

1054
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:31,856
Which brings us back
to the question of the day.

1055
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:36,394
Should Congress reinstate
the Assault Weapons Ban?

1056
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:38,732
I know a lot of you
don't agree with me.

1057
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:40,434
That's fine.

1058
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:43,336
Huh.

1059
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:45,806
89% of you say no.

1060
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:49,776
And that's what makes
America great.

1061
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:54,013
- Clear.
- Great.

1062
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:55,882
The second floor
wants to see you.

1063
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:58,318
- Now?
- Yeah.

1064
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:03,890
This is Kayla.

1065
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:07,527
Hi.

1066
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:10,764
Mmm-hmm.

1067
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:16,436
Yeah. I'll come
right up then.

1068
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:26,974
Ladies.

1069
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:28,976
Hi.

1070
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:52,066
Phew. Hot in here.

1071
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,727
Gretchen.
Well, how are you?

1072
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:26,098
- Faye, I miss our lunches.
- Mmm.

1073
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,601
- Roger wants to see me?
- Oh.

1074
00:49:29,603 --> 00:49:31,571
Uh, no, I think
it was Dianne.

1075
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:34,574
I just saw her in with Bill.

1076
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,510
All right. Well...

1077
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,081
See you ladies later then.

1078
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,715
Bye.

1079
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:45,516
Roger's ready
for you, Kayla.

1080
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:48,519
Okay.

1081
00:49:57,098 --> 00:49:59,464
Never stops.

1082
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:01,799
Gretchen, you've been
such an instrumental part

1083
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:02,968
of the Fox family.

1084
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,669
Absolutely.

1085
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,905
We just
wanted to tell you

1086
00:50:05,907 --> 00:50:07,872
that we appreciated
the work...

1087
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,476
He's firing me,
isn't he?

1088
00:50:12,046 --> 00:50:13,047
Yes.

1089
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:18,752
You wanna
tell me why?

1090
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:29,794
<i>What could they say?</i>

1091
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:31,898
<i>"You're sexy,
but you're too much work.</i>

1092
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,100
<i>"You're a man-hater.</i>

1093
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:37,804
<i>"To get ahead
you gotta give a little head."</i>

1094
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:46,211
Good luck, Ms. Carlson.

1095
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,646
<i>Do you know why
we dress soldiers the same?</i>

1096
00:50:48,648 --> 00:50:50,815
<i>So everybody knows
they're replaceable.</i>

1097
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:55,089
<i>I refuse to be replaceable.</i>

1098
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:01,927
Well, they finally
did it. I'm out.

1099
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,028
<i>Did they
give you a cause?</i>

1100
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,198
- No.
- <i>Good. Ready to go to war?</i>

1101
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,635
Oh, yeah.
I'm ready.

1102
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:25,084
Murdoch here.

1103
00:51:25,086 --> 00:51:27,052
<i>Funny.
Have you seen the lawsuit?</i>

1104
00:51:27,054 --> 00:51:28,686
Which lawsuit?

1105
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:33,258
I'm not stopping.

1106
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,693
<i>Roger's being sued
for sexual harassment</i>

1107
00:51:35,695 --> 00:51:37,131
by Gretchen Carlson.

1108
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,665
Where's Dad?

1109
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:41,668
<i>Paris.</i>

1110
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,972
Yeah.

1111
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:48,806
<i>I have your
father's attorney for you.</i>

1112
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:49,809
Thank you.

1113
00:51:50,643 --> 00:51:51,709
<i>Morning.</i>

1114
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:54,581
<i>So, this employee
has sued Roger personally.</i>

1115
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:58,219
He doesn't know
who she is.

1116
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:01,253
Are you familiar
with Ms. Carlson?

1117
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:03,688
No. Until two hours ago,
I'd never heard of her.

1118
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:06,591
More importantly, no one heard
from her after she was fired.

1119
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:08,593
Wait. Not even to
negotiate a severance?

1120
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:09,827
<i>No. And that suggests</i>

1121
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:12,697
she knew it was coming
and she had a plan.

1122
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:15,167
<i>As News Corp attorney,
I recommend you conduct</i>

1123
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:17,735
<i>an internal investigation
into Roger's behavior.</i>

1124
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:20,872
I know you two
have had issues with him.

1125
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:23,808
I need everyone's attention.
Listen up, people!

1126
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,879
A <i>Post</i> employee has received
a package of anthrax.

1127
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:29,148
That's just above us.

1128
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,715
Close the goddamn vents!

1129
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:31,783
All of them!

1130
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,986
- Roger.
- And nobody opens the mail!

1131
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,853
- Roger.
- We're under attack!

1132
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:37,789
Roger! Hey!

1133
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,225
Everything upstairs
is under control.

1134
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:41,795
You need to calm down.

1135
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:45,197
Do not give orders
in my newsroom.

1136
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,332
If it were yours,

1137
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,601
you'd own it.

1138
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:54,940
It's okay, everyone. Everything's
gonna be fine. You can go back to work.

1139
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:55,943
Thank you.

1140
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:02,247
Uh-huh. Yeah,
let's look into her claims.

1141
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:03,250
<i>Done.</i>

1142
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:22,733
- Hi.
- Hi.

1143
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:24,905
Oh, my God,
it's Anchor Barbie.

1144
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,908
I'm testing for Fox Business.

1145
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:32,779
Holy fucking Christ!

1146
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,118
I'll call you right back.

1147
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,918
Pull up <i>The New York Times</i>
right now.

1148
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,053
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

1149
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:42,720
Holy shit!

1150
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:43,857
Did you see this?

1151
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:49,161
Holy shit!

1152
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:50,695
Oh, my God.

1153
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:52,097
<i>The Times?</i>

1154
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:54,801
No way.

1155
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,805
Josh. Get me a nice shot
from Main Street.

1156
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:03,041
- No Priuses in it.
- Right.

1157
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:06,247
When you're photographing for my
paper, don't wear a hoodie.

1158
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:09,081
Okay.

1159
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,384
Hoodies are creepy.

1160
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:12,752
Thank you. Thank you.

1161
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,160
What is that?

1162
00:54:21,162 --> 00:54:23,763
Oh, uh,
just grocery-store sushi.

1163
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,698
Mmm.

1164
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,402
Sushi's not liberal food.

1165
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,370
I didn't say that it was.

1166
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,542
Hi, love.

<i>I'm leaving now.
Go home. I'll meet you there.</i>

1170
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:46,151
- What?
- <i>Fox News host Gretchen Carlson</i>

1171
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:49,021

1173
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,824
Fox News chairman Roger Ailes
is responding to a lawsuit

1174
00:54:53,826 --> 00:54:56,128
filed by lawyers
for Gretchen Carlson...

1175
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,329
<i>Alleges she was fired</i>

1176
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,131
<i>after turning down
sexual advances.</i>

1177
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,532
<i>Carlson claimed in the lawsuit</i>

1178
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:03,168
<i>that Ailes took her off
the popular morning show,</i>

1179

<i>The lawsuit was filed

1185
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:26,325
Champ's making his rounds.

1186
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:27,328
Good boy.

1187
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:29,430
Are you okay?

1188
00:55:31,198 --> 00:55:32,199
No.

1189
00:55:45,878 --> 00:55:47,312
<i>Beth,</i>
<i>I just talked to</i> TheWrap.

1190
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:50,048
It's an online publication.
I said, how sad it is

1191
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,951
we've got this woman
making these complaints

1192
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:55,853
when there are real victims
out there.

1193
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:57,456
I know, Roger.
I told <i>People</i> magazine

1194
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:00,158
we've been in your office
alone a lot over 15 years.

1195
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,994
I've never seen anything
like what I'm reading about.

1196
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:03,562
I said, "I don't think
Gretchen Carlson

1197
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:04,496
"has a friend
in the building."

1198
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:06,365
I know, Roger.
Someone would've told me.

1199
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:07,599
They're gonna quote me
on that.

1200
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:08,766
Not a ring of truth.

1201
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:11,869
Maria Bartiromo
sent <i>Variety</i> a stock chart.

1202
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:13,372
- Oh, hey, we're up.
- Whoo-hoo.

1203
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:15,974
Hannity tweeted, "I talked to
hundreds of women at Fox this week,

1204
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:17,209
"both on air and off.

1205
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:18,876
"They say it all BS."

1206
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:20,412
- Brit Hume, too.
- Brit?

1207
00:56:20,414 --> 00:56:22,414
"Why didn't Gretchen
quit and sue

1208
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:24,449
"instead of suing
only after she got fired?

1209
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:25,517
"Why didn't she complain?"

1210
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,219
Why didn't she complain?
Really?

1211
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:28,886
He means
the anonymous hotline.

1212
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,322
- There's a hotline?
- Yeah.

1213
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:32,457
I did
the harassment seminar twice.

1214
00:56:32,459 --> 00:56:33,558
I never heard about a hotline.

1215
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,825
Because it's bullshit.

1216
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:37,562
They have a contractual right
to monitor our communications.

1217
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:41,035
A hotline in this building is like
a complaint box in occupied Paris.

1218
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:45,470
It's like we're telling women,
"Go on. Speak up for yourself.

1219
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:48,507
"Just know the entire network
is with Roger."

1220
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:50,375
No one will believe you.

1221
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:52,110
They'll call you a liar.

1222
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:55,213
Oh, and as for your career,
you want assignments and air time?

1223
00:56:55,215 --> 00:56:56,581
Go ahead.
Call the paranoid man

1224
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,150
who decides your salary
a pervert,

1225
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:00,885
and do that on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls.

1226
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:03,555
On a phone he has
a contractual right to record.

1227
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:06,158
Jesus fucking Christ,
do you think women are idiots?

1228
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,892
It's like
somebody stripped you naked

1229
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:09,294
and they want you
to walk through this office

1230
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:10,897
just to fucking prove it.

1231
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:12,499
Okay.

1232
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,537
Can I see you for a minute?

1233
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,446
What the fuck was that?

1234
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,183
I don't know, but I liked it.

1235
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:37,389
I won't call you a feminist,

1236
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:39,458
but say there's a spectrum,
you are...

1237
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,095
Roger harassed me.

1238
00:57:43,697 --> 00:57:45,099
Ten years ago.

1239
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:49,368
I had turned down
a law-firm partnership

1240
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,437
for an entry-level job
here at Fox.

1241
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:56,176
Roger would call me up to
New York to dangle prospects.

1242
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,346
I wanted his help.

1243
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,151
Did you

1244
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:06,420
do anything?

1245
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:09,289
No.

1246
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,191
Will you talk?

1247
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:15,994
- Megyn?
- I don't know.

1248
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:17,097
I don't know.

1249
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:21,935
I mean, going on the record...

1250
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:26,004
Jesus.

1251
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:28,607
It's basically admitting you're
the weak one in the herd.

1252
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:31,676
No, it's admitting
you're the hot one.

1253
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,345
It has nothing
to do with that, Gil.

1254
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:35,113
- Say women.
- Oh, my God.

1255
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:36,381
Look, there is a reason

1256
00:58:36,383 --> 00:58:38,216
certain women
can defend Roger.

1257
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:40,452
If I report this and it leaks,

1258
00:58:40,454 --> 00:58:43,088
it will follow me
for the rest of my career.

1259
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,623
I don't wanna be defined
by Roger's bullshit.

1260
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:48,160
I refuse to be the fucking poster
girl for sexual harassment.

1261
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:51,129
He can't still be doing
that crap, right?

1262
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:52,132
I mean, the man has a walker.

1263
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,235
- Viagra?
- Gil.

1264
00:58:56,403 --> 00:58:57,671
Help me here.

1265
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:00,707
Please. How do I play this?

1266
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:05,979
Well, you only ask
when you already know.

1267
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:10,315
If I learned anything
this year,

1268
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:11,516
it's to not get sucked
into a fight

1269
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:13,687
with someone who has better
reason to be in it than you do.

1270
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:16,590
Okay.

1271
00:59:18,258 --> 00:59:19,460
Okay.

1272
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:23,096
So, what is it you wanna do?

1273
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,032
For right now, nothing.

1274
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,202
- Good.
- Good.

1275
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:52,224
There she is.

1276
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:54,159
Hi, Roger.

1277
00:59:54,161 --> 00:59:55,496
Hello, sweetheart.

1278
00:59:57,664 --> 00:59:59,231
Hi.

1279
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:00,234
Sit, sit.

1280
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:04,436
- You've met Mayor Giuliani before?
- Of course.

1281
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,438
There's
an internal investigation,

1282
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,440
but I'm not gonna wait for it
to clear me.

1283
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:11,176
The Republican convention
is less than two weeks away.

1284
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:13,545
This is bullshit.
I'm gonna fight it.

1285
01:00:13,547 --> 01:00:15,213
The charges are absurd.

1286
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:16,781
I'm in, Roger.

1287
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,417
I love that fate has given me
a chance to repay you

1288
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:21,152
for when I was
in intensive care.

1289
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:24,489
Roger called my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks.

1290
01:00:24,491 --> 01:00:25,790
Told them
he'd put me on the air

1291
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:26,825
live from the hospital bed

1292
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:29,728
if they didn't fix
every stitch of damage done.

1293
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,364
But I'm also here as someone

1294
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:34,633
who has dealt with this issue
for years,

1295
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:38,103
years on the side of women.

1296
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:40,405
I don't wanna see
sexual violence trivialized.

1297
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:44,376
I don't wanna see it become
some damn political football.

1298
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:47,579
In that spirit, I need to ask,

1299
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:50,415
will an investigation
find anything,

1300
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,486
well, uncomfortable?

1301
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:57,522
Well, define uncomfortable.

1302
01:00:57,524 --> 01:00:58,857
Roger, quote,

1303
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,458
"I think you and I
should have had

1304
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,727
"a sexual relationship
a long time ago.

1305
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:04,296
"And then
you'd be good and better

1306
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:05,430
"and I'd be good and better."

1307
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:08,633
- Did you say that?
- No, I'm not a fool.

1308
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:11,536
"You missed your chance for me
to harass you"? Come on.

1309
01:01:11,538 --> 01:01:13,305
I think they'll argue
it's solicitous.

1310
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:16,808
Telling a woman she was
fuckable "a long time ago."

1311
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,510
Who the hell thinks
that works?

1312
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:20,178
Why's she suing, Roger?

1313
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,781
Gretchen is
a very competitive woman

1314
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,685
facing a severe
likability issue.

1315
01:01:25,752 --> 01:01:29,487
One that I shielded her from
for years.

1316
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,323
Her career's over, I'm afraid.

1317
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:32,624
And she can't take
a joke.

1318
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:34,593
Roger is very salty.

1319
01:01:34,595 --> 01:01:38,496
I find it amusing.
It's my fault. I encourage it.

1320
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:41,700
James Murdoch
could be behind this.

1321
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:43,868
His wife
openly supports Hillary.

1322
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,770
And it could go deeper.

1323
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:47,672
I have good reason to believe

1324
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:49,808
that inside
the Obama White House,

1325
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,176
there have been discussions,

1326
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,146
on what level I do not know...

1327
01:01:54,615 --> 01:01:55,882
of having me killed.

1328
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,168
Oh, Jesus.

1329
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,472
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

1330
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:55,742
Roger needs you.

1331
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,378
Your silence is being noticed.

1332
01:03:00,647 --> 01:03:02,580
Well, the whole point
of an investigation

1333
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:04,315
is to find the truth, Jeanine.

1334
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:06,418
Until that happens,
I don't have a lot to say.

1335
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,687
If this charge sticks,

1336
01:03:08,689 --> 01:03:10,321
the working assumption
will be,

1337
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:13,326
"Every woman at Fox got down
on her knees."

1338
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:15,894
Even you.

1339
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,896
If we sweep this thing
under the rug, Jeanine,

1340
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:19,531
and it happens again,

1341
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:21,033
under Title Seven,

1342
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:22,333
Fox will be liable

1343
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:24,769
for compensatory
and punitive damages.

1344
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:26,438
That could be
hundreds of millions.

1345
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,809
Let's worry about the law
before we do the PR, okay?

1346
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,676
Does Roger want us?

1347
01:03:31,678 --> 01:03:34,448
Yes. He's a man.

1348
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:36,949
He also gave us time.

1349
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,918
He gave us opportunity.

1350
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,922
We benefited
from that kind of attention.

1351
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:46,324
I mean, Jeanine Pirro?

1352
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:49,061
She's the founding member
of Team Roger.

1353
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:50,328
You're not answering
your phone.

1354
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,596
No, I'm holding it.

1355
01:03:51,598 --> 01:03:53,465
Okay, well, everybody's
still looking for you.

1356
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:56,902
- Where were any of these people to defend me from Trump, hmm?
- Excuse me.

1357
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:58,271
Bill Shine told them not to.

1358
01:03:58,805 --> 01:04:00,371
What the fuck?

1359
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:02,041
Our boss.

1360
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:03,775
Why are you guys in the hall?

1361
01:04:03,777 --> 01:04:05,410
I got a call
from Roger's lawyer

1362
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:07,579
saying to, quote, "relax."

1363
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:09,647
They're convincing Rupert
to limit the investigation

1364
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:11,083
to Gretchen and her team.

1365
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:13,384
That's only five or six women.

1366
01:04:13,386 --> 01:04:14,788
Are you gonna let that happen?

1367
01:04:22,964 --> 01:04:25,463
I like Roger. I do.

1368
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:26,431
I know.

1369
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:29,101
Even if he can be controlling
and vindictive.

1370
01:04:29,103 --> 01:04:31,803
Those sins aren't really
the problem, Meg.

1371
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:33,838
I mean, there were
hundreds of stories

1372
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,607
of Roger paying
an employee's rehab,

1373
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:38,077
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll.

1374
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,779
You remember
when Shep came out.

1375
01:04:40,781 --> 01:04:42,047
All Roger said was,

1376
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:43,149
"I don't care
where you put your pecker,

1377
01:04:43,151 --> 01:04:45,383
"as long as you don't tell me
where to put mine."

1378
01:04:45,385 --> 01:04:47,987
Again, not the most redeeming.

1379
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:51,523
He promoted me,
he looked past the rejection,

1380
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:54,626
he looked past the risk
of this exact conversation.

1381
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:56,630
He handed me the power
to hurt him.

1382
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,560
- Morning.
- <i>Hi, Megyn.</i>

1383
01:05:28,562 --> 01:05:31,696
We need to get
Gerson Zweifach on the phone.

1384
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:33,698
<i>Gerson, I'm calling for Roger.</i>

1385
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,700
<i>He wants me to be
part of your investigation.</i>

1386
01:05:35,702 --> 01:05:37,502
We've decided
on an outside firm.

1387
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:41,006
No, why? Gerson, we can
handle this ourselves.

1388
01:05:41,008 --> 01:05:42,640
I'm asking Paul/Weiss.

1389
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:43,675
<i>Paul/Weiss?</i>

1390
01:05:43,677 --> 01:05:46,778
You tell them that
I can actively participate.

1391
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,814
Mr. Giuliani,
you're an old friend of Roger.

1392
01:05:49,816 --> 01:05:50,950
You married them.

1393
01:05:50,952 --> 01:05:52,784
<i>Sharing information with you</i>

1394
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:54,786
<i>will remove the cloak
of attorney-client privilege,</i>

1395
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,754
making the testimony
of any woman

1396
01:05:56,756 --> 01:05:59,058
who comes forward
subject to discovery.

1397
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,626
I understand.
You get me a waiver.

1398
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:02,962
I will not structure
this investigation

1399
01:06:02,964 --> 01:06:05,697
so Roger isn't perceived of
as its target.

1400
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:07,933
<i>You want him to look guilty?</i>

1401
01:06:07,935 --> 01:06:09,603
Well, that depends
on what we find.

1402
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,607
You know a reporter,
Gabe Sherman?

1403
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:17,742
- No.
- You're about to.

1404
01:06:17,744 --> 01:06:18,944
He's found six women

1405
01:06:18,946 --> 01:06:20,812
who claim Roger Ailes
harassed them.

1406
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:23,516
All from before Roger
founded Fox News.

1407
01:06:25,852 --> 01:06:27,452
<i>This was years ago.</i>

1408
01:06:27,454 --> 01:06:29,154
<i>He said he would
put me on the show,</i>

1409
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:30,923
<i>but I had to go to bed
with him.</i>

1410
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:34,126
<i>And I just said, "Yeah, right.
You and who else?"</i>

1411
01:06:34,128 --> 01:06:35,860
<i>And he said, "Just me</i>

1412
01:06:35,862 --> 01:06:38,398
<i>"and a few of
my preferred friends."</i>

1413
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:42,634
<i>I came in
and he closed the door,</i>

1414
01:06:42,636 --> 01:06:43,969
<i>turned, and kissed me.</i>

1415
01:06:43,971 --> 01:06:45,703
<i>Like I was his girlfriend.</i>

1416
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:47,139
<i>Like he knew it was coming.</i>

1417
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:49,041
<i>He grabbed my tits
and he said,</i>

1418
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:52,479
<i>"Look, no girl gets a job here
unless they're cooperative."</i>

1419
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:55,247
<i>"If you wanna make it
in New York City</i>

1420
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:56,648
<i>"in the TV business,</i>

1421
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,050
<i>"you're gonna have to fuck me.</i>

1422
01:06:58,052 --> 01:06:59,251
<i>"And you're gonna have to
do that</i>

1423
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:00,820
<i>"with anyone I tell you to."</i>

1424
01:07:01,821 --> 01:07:03,188
<i>He finishes the test,</i>

1425
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,190
<i>which is me
pretending to cook,</i>

1426
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:07,558
<i>then he pulls out
a garter belt and stockings</i>

1427
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,161
<i>and says, "Put these on."</i>

1428
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:12,199
<i>So, yeah, well, I put them on.</i>

1429
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:14,799
<i>And he said,</i>

1430
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:16,201
<i>"You know,
I can really help you,</i>

1431
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:18,170
<i>"but if you wanna play
with the big boys,</i>

1432
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:20,505
<i>"you have to lay
with the big boys."</i>

1433
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:22,475
<i>It was very transactional.</i>

1434
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:27,246
<i>It was quiet.
He stared at me.</i>

1435
01:07:27,248 --> 01:07:29,614
<i>He undid his pants</i>

1436
01:07:29,616 --> 01:07:33,651
<i>and took out his penis
very gingerly.</i>

1437
01:07:33,653 --> 01:07:35,955
<i>I had never seen one.</i>

1438
01:07:35,957 --> 01:07:38,023
<i>I was scared.</i>

1439
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:41,126
<i>Then he said, "Kiss it."</i>

1440
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:42,729
<i>I was 16.</i>

1441
01:07:45,665 --> 01:07:47,066
<i>Former anchor
Gretchen Carlson</i>

1442
01:07:47,068 --> 01:07:48,968
<i>filing a sexual-harassment
lawsuit</i>

1443
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,103
<i>against Fox News
chief Roger Ailes.</i>

1444
01:07:51,105 --> 01:07:52,737
<i>More women are coming forward.</i>

1445
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,039
<i>Ailes is denying
the allegations</i>

1446
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:55,573
<i>and getting
some high-profile support...</i>

1447
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:57,742
<i>The accusations
against Roger Ailes are growing...</i>

1448
01:07:57,744 --> 01:07:59,777
<i>I have never run
a goddamn Dairy Queen.</i>

1449
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:02,915
<i>You don't get to go
and get whatever you want.</i>

1450
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:06,085
<i>Everybody on my shows
knows the meaning of decency,</i>

1451
01:08:06,087 --> 01:08:08,320
<i>and I do mean everybody.</i>

1452
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:11,823
A TV outfit needs tough,
confident women.

1453
01:08:11,825 --> 01:08:14,226
Do I push them?
You bet your ass I do.

1454
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:17,695
But have I ever demanded sex
during a casting session?

1455
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:20,732
Have I offered extra pay
for blowjobs?

1456
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:24,336
Give me a goddamn break!
Why the hell would I do that?

1457
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:27,172
You know the look in a woman's
eye when she's interested.

1458
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:30,641
Walk into casting
back then as the decider.

1459
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:33,578
There was a look
they gave.

1460
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,914
I did not always
look like this.

1461
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,282
I never had to harass anybody

1462
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,918
and it's fucking offensive
to say that I did!

1463
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,886
Well, they're trying
to change history.

1464
01:08:41,888 --> 01:08:45,092
For their families. Some of them probably
don't even remember what happened.

1465
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,229
That's gracious of you, Beth.

1466
01:08:51,098 --> 01:08:53,198
But this is political.

1467
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,667
I defy you
to find any evidence

1468
01:08:56,669 --> 01:08:59,804
that a single part of what
these women are saying is true.

1469
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:01,974
Get ready. More will come.

1470
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:04,742
We need to let Rupert know
what it means if I lose.

1471
01:09:04,744 --> 01:09:07,879
Gretchen Carlson
could kill Fox News.

1472
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:10,115
This is a fight for your jobs.

1473
01:09:10,117 --> 01:09:11,917
If I go, you go!

1474
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:17,755
If you'd asked me what type of
sexual fetish Roger Ailes had,

1475
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:19,091
I never would have come up
with garter belts,

1476
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:20,658
but it's fucking perfect.

1477
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,627
Their stories are so similar.

1478
01:09:22,629 --> 01:09:23,661
That doesn't prove much.

1479
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:25,863
Sherman met them all
through Gretchen's lawyer.

1480
01:09:25,865 --> 01:09:26,866
They could have been coached.

1481
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:29,935
The blowjob thing
feels real to me.

1482
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:32,104
Does Roger seem like a guy
who would get off

1483
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:34,306
on that particular
power dynamic? Yes.

1484
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:35,908
A guy who maybe thinks

1485
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,343
oral doesn't
really count? Maybe.

1486
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,079
A guy who has
reasons to prefer

1487
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:42,249
a sex act that lets him
keep his clothes on?

1488
01:09:42,882 --> 01:09:44,349
Sure.

1489
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:45,685
Still doesn't make it true.

1490
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:48,287
Well, if true,

1491
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:51,225
these incidents all happened
before Fox started.

1492
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:54,093
- Should that matter?
- No.

1493
01:09:54,095 --> 01:09:55,096
Yes.

1494
01:10:02,002 --> 01:10:03,304
I talked to Gerson Zweifach.

1495
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:05,437
And?

1496
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,072
He asked me to encourage women

1497
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:08,574
who have claims
to come forward.

1498
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:11,878
You remember what happened last time
you got between Rupert and Roger?

1499
01:10:14,048 --> 01:10:16,248
Before I speak out,

1500
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,086
I need to know if this
happened to other women at Fox.

1501
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:22,389
You understand that?

1502
01:10:24,858 --> 01:10:26,860
Is this one
where you really wanna know,

1503
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:29,094
or you wanna look like

1504
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:30,663
you really wanna know,
but don't?

1505
01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:33,901
I really wanna know.

1506
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:38,405
I'm not always like that.

1507
01:10:40,141 --> 01:10:41,406
No one around here believes

1508
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:43,708
Roger would want
to harass Gretchen.

1509
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:47,179
I will send you some of
her soapy notes to Roger.

1510
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:49,448
"Last night
Sandra filled in for Megyn.

1511
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,416
"Why not me? Smiley face."

1512
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:54,852
Who sends a harasser
a smiley face?

1513
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:56,455
- Martin.
- Hey, Nancy.

1514
01:10:56,457 --> 01:10:58,259
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1515
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:01,093
Hi, Nancy. Coffee?

1516
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:02,662
Thank you.

1517
01:11:04,465 --> 01:11:06,167
So, what do you got?

1518
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:12,104
So, um, no one from Fox
has come forward.

1519
01:11:12,106 --> 01:11:13,472
No one?

1520
01:11:13,474 --> 01:11:14,741
Rudi Bakhtiar.

1521
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:19,011
But no one who's still there?

1522
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,746
There's been nothing
but praise for Roger.

1523
01:11:21,748 --> 01:11:23,949
Except from Megyn Kelly.

1524
01:11:23,951 --> 01:11:25,117
She's been unusually silent.

1525
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,985
Right. Well,
something must've happened

1526
01:11:26,987 --> 01:11:28,921
to Megyn in the past
with Roger.

1527
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:31,490
She's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1528
01:11:31,492 --> 01:11:32,825
Possibly.

1529
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:35,227
Should you call?

1530
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:38,263
Tell her this is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1531
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:40,265
Megyn, share?

1532
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:42,234
No. She wouldn't do it.

1533
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:44,036
- What makes you say that?
- Because I wouldn't.

1534
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:47,105
I mean, Roger plays his women
off against each other.

1535
01:11:47,107 --> 01:11:48,407
He's always done it.
He'll say,

1536
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:50,375
"Megyn thinks that
Lisa should get your spot."

1537
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:52,877
Or, "Megyn suspects
that you're screwing Cal."

1538
01:11:52,879 --> 01:11:54,513
And then he'll offer advice
on how to get back at her,

1539
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:55,746
as if you brought it up.

1540
01:11:55,748 --> 01:11:58,350
She's renegotiating her deal.
I can think of roughly

1541
01:11:58,352 --> 01:12:01,053
15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

1542
01:12:01,055 --> 01:12:03,121
We do need some collaboration.

1543
01:12:03,123 --> 01:12:04,323
Well,
that would certainly help

1544
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:06,024
with the other networks.

1545
01:12:06,026 --> 01:12:07,860
Oh, God. What?

1546
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:09,995
What, Marty?

1547
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:12,364
Well, we've not had, um,

1548
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:15,167
a lot of incoming
job interests from them.

1549
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:18,005
What's not a lot?

1550
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:21,308
None.

1551
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:23,743
They're afraid of Roger.

1552
01:12:24,578 --> 01:12:26,411
No.

1553
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:28,547
No woman gets to sue her boss.

1554
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:30,515
Rule number one
of corporate America,

1555
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:31,952
you don't sue your boss.

1556
01:12:34,121 --> 01:12:36,457
I jumped off a cliff.

1557
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:42,294
I thought one of them
would stand with me.

1558
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,200
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, we're home.

1559
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:50,469
God, uh... Hey, honey.

1560
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:52,371
There's a snack
in the kitchen.

1561
01:12:52,373 --> 01:12:53,540
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1562
01:12:58,878 --> 01:12:59,947
We're gonna get him.

1563
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:04,349
Megyn doesn't want
to release a statement.

1564
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:06,585
It could be seen as
influencing the investigation.

1565
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:09,421
Have her say that
to Roger's face.

1566
01:13:09,423 --> 01:13:13,058
Look, let us know who else
hasn't spoken up for him,

1567
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,461
and maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

1568
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:19,500
No! Jesus. We need
our anchors. We need her.

1569
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:21,967
Let me talk to her.

1570
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:23,568
Yes, please.

1571
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:28,573
Look, sweetheart. This is
an island of safety and truth.

1572
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,342
I wear pants.

1573
01:13:30,344 --> 01:13:32,611
No one has ever told me
not to wear pants.

1574
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:35,514
I wear pants. I'd love to know
where that came from.

1575
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:37,082
It's obnoxious. It's toxic.

1576
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:40,185
We need everyone
on Team Roger.

1577
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:41,987
Everyone.

1578
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:43,490
- Hi.
- Good morning.

1579
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:49,628
Come on. No one
makes me wear short skirts.

1580
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:55,267
He was the first
to put a female on

1581
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,035
as host of a prime-time show.

1582
01:13:57,037 --> 01:13:59,104
Roger Ailes champions women.

1583
01:13:59,106 --> 01:14:02,007
No. There is no leg cam.

1584
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:04,976
No. Could you just
hold on for one sec?

1585
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:07,045
Maggie? I have to
wear pants tomorrow.

1586
01:14:07,047 --> 01:14:09,614
Not without authorization from
the second floor, you don't.

1587
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,383
We never fitted her for pants!

1588
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:12,617
You can print
whatever story you like,

1589
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:13,685
but there is no leg cam.

1590
01:14:13,687 --> 01:14:15,087
- Lily?
- Hmm?

1591
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:17,055
Beth needs me
to talk to Megyn.

1592
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:18,457
I'm gonna do
an on-air statement

1593
01:14:18,459 --> 01:14:19,591
while all the Fox women
come out

1594
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:21,226
one by one behind me
for Roger.

1595
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:22,895
That will never happen.

1596
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:25,399
Ains?

1597
01:14:32,339 --> 01:14:35,273
Well, you know why Roger's got
that door blocking his office?

1598
01:14:35,275 --> 01:14:37,576
Well, yeah, 'cause
a Bangladeshi from Accounting

1599
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:39,277
wandered in one day
by mistake.

1600
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:40,645
Please.

1601
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:41,613
It's so girls can come in

1602
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:43,283
from the back elevator
and no one sees 'em.

1603
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:45,917
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1604
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:48,320
We get talent
coming here all the time

1605
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:50,088
looking to get
their faces done.

1606
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,457
"I'm going to see Roger.
I gotta look my best."

1607
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:53,558
Yeah. One came back out

1608
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,929
with it rubbed off her nose
and chin.

1609
01:14:57,197 --> 01:14:58,399
Who was that?

1610
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:04,669
My memory's horrible.

1611
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,673
You should go see Janice
in Weather.

1612
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:11,476
I mean, nobody wants to talk.

1613
01:15:11,478 --> 01:15:14,279
- Can you blame them?
- No.

1614
01:15:14,281 --> 01:15:15,649
Where'd you disappear to?

1615
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:19,084
I've got names.

1616
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:21,553
Women rumored
to have stories about Roger.

1617
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:23,188
- From who?
- Janice.

1618
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:26,057
- Weather Janice?
- Everybody confides in her.

1619
01:15:26,059 --> 01:15:27,659
Nobody from Weather
wants your job.

1620
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:28,727
What are you going
to do with them?

1621
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:30,262
Tell them
this time's different.

1622
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,396
- Wait.
- No, don't wait.

1623
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:32,330
Don't listen to him.

1624
01:15:32,332 --> 01:15:35,066
Listen... Look, it's not only
your job here.

1625
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:38,103
I got kids, okay?
Lily has a baby now.

1626
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:40,705
Julia'll lose her visa
and have to go back to Canada.

1627
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:44,476
And we know that you've been
talking to broadcast networks.

1628
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:48,079
Yeah, you can get a job
anywhere. But we can't.

1629
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:50,484
And no offense,
but who the hell will you be?

1630
01:15:51,552 --> 01:15:54,753
Nobody leaves Fox, Megyn.
Not really.

1631
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:57,289
It's in your DNA now.

1632
01:15:57,291 --> 01:16:00,692
So, think about
what you're blowing up here.

1633
01:16:00,694 --> 01:16:02,463
I say find the truth.

1634
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:13,238
Well, that face
tells me nothing.

1635
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,640
Well, if they come after you,

1636
01:16:15,642 --> 01:16:18,111
it won't be you
they come after.

1637
01:16:26,386 --> 01:16:27,619
<i>Gretchen Carlson,</i>

1638
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:29,154

<i>What is your position on this?</i>

1643
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:36,394
<i>What did you think

1644
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:38,497
<i>In this country,

1647
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:46,137

1650
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:51,176
<i>And that's
a deplorable situation.</i>

1651
01:16:51,178 --> 01:16:53,378
<i>I've worked for Roger Ailes

1652
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,113
<i>Best boss I've ever had.</i>

1653
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,184
Well, I've never been told
what I can't wear.

1654
01:16:58,118 --> 01:16:59,518
Well, I know you didn't ask,

1655
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,188
but I think
it needs to be said.

1656
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,524
It's a very confusing time
right now.

1657
01:17:05,526 --> 01:17:07,292
Tonight is Manhattanhenge.

1658
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,828
Sunset will align perfectly
with the city's grid.

1659
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:13,698
The best viewing streets
are 14th, 34th and 57th.

1660
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,567
- Good day, New York.
- And clear.

1661
01:17:15,569 --> 01:17:16,635
See you tomorrow,
Jimmy.

1662
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:17,904
Yep. Have a good one.

1663
01:17:17,906 --> 01:17:21,573
A babe with no geezer?
This can't be a Fox affiliate.

1664
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:24,676
Megyn. My God. How are you?

1665
01:17:24,678 --> 01:17:26,278
Good. How about you?

1666
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,179
Good. How's your mom?

1667
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:30,615
She's good. She's training
to be a security guard.

1668
01:17:30,617 --> 01:17:32,784
Is that because of
the Trump stuff, or is that...

1669
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:35,520
No. She just wants a job
where she gets to carry a gun.

1670
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:44,262
So, did you come up here
to talk about Roger?

1671
01:17:44,264 --> 01:17:46,197
What would make you
say that?

1672
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,632
I've been at local
for two years,

1673
01:17:47,634 --> 01:17:49,169
nobody's ever come to see me.

1674
01:17:50,203 --> 01:17:51,305
You miss us?

1675
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:54,706
The network I worked at
for 14 years?

1676
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,744
That my dad helped build?
Where my brother's a reporter?

1677
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:01,846
Juliet, did Roger ever...

1678
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:03,815
No.

1679
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:06,253
I heard things,
but nothing firsthand.

1680
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,821
Good.

1681
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:10,755
- I miss you.
- I miss you more.

1682
01:18:10,757 --> 01:18:13,260
- We should go have a drink.
- Yes.

1683
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:16,129
Um...

1684
01:18:23,203 --> 01:18:24,204
Roger...

1685
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,343
He has detectives on staff.

1686
01:18:31,345 --> 01:18:32,744
Up on 14.

1687
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:36,481
They look into enemies,
follow them,

1688
01:18:36,483 --> 01:18:38,350
post negative stories online.

1689
01:18:38,352 --> 01:18:39,718
It's called the Black Room.

1690
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,286
I don't want you
in danger, all right?

1691
01:18:41,288 --> 01:18:43,457
No, no, no.
I'm not talking about me.

1692
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:46,760
I'm talking about you.

1693
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:51,798
Be careful who you ask
questions about Roger Ailes.

1694
01:18:57,804 --> 01:18:59,907
My lawyers
are negotiating with Fox.

1695
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:04,711
Not that Bill will pay
any of it.

1696
01:19:05,345 --> 01:19:06,478
Bill?

1697
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,648
O'Reilly.

1698
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:10,384
And Jack.

1699
01:19:12,653 --> 01:19:14,319
Jesus.

1700
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:16,890
Sorry.

1701
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,928
Fish rots from the head.

1702
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,900
I'm gonna talk
to the outside firm

1703
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:29,904
investigating this,
Paul/Weiss.

1704
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:33,838
I heard you had
some issues over here.

1705
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,373
I did.

1706
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,843
If you have a name to give.

1707
01:19:38,311 --> 01:19:40,278
Roger.

1708
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,380
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't think it was safe.

1709
01:19:48,522 --> 01:19:49,487
Roger.

1710
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:52,624
<i>Jack. Roger. Roger.</i>

1711
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,325
<i>Doug. Roger. Jack.</i>

1712
01:19:54,327 --> 01:19:55,961
<i>Roger. Francisco. Doug.
Bill. Jack.</i>

1713
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,365
<i>Jack. Francisco. Bill.
Roger. Roger.</i>

1714
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:05,305
It's Kayla, right?

1715
01:20:05,839 --> 01:20:06,840
Yeah.

1716
01:20:07,841 --> 01:20:09,476
- Hi.
- Hi.

1717
01:20:09,944 --> 01:20:11,043
Megyn.

1718
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:12,546
I know.

1719
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:16,514
You used to work
with Gretchen, right?

1720
01:20:16,516 --> 01:20:17,749
Mmm-hmm.

1721
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:19,018
Did you learn a lot from her?

1722
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,885
I did, yes.

1723
01:20:20,887 --> 01:20:23,655
I have nothing but
good things to say about her.

1724
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,690
That's great.

1725
01:20:25,692 --> 01:20:27,625
You know, I always find it
so interesting

1726
01:20:27,627 --> 01:20:28,760
who history chooses

1727
01:20:28,762 --> 01:20:30,831
- to do something important.
- Mmm.

1728
01:20:32,866 --> 01:20:34,699
I guess.

1729
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:36,436
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

1730
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,542
I wanted to ask you
if Roger is harassing you.

1731
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:52,285
How did you know?

1732
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:57,424
We find each other.

1733
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:01,795
You, too?

1734
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,331
Long time ago.

1735
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:09,336
Wow.

1736
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:18,545
You okay?

1737
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:20,814
Mmm-hmm.

1738
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,555
You should report Roger.

1739
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:30,724
You'll be protected.

1740
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:32,359
Did you?

1741
01:21:33,094 --> 01:21:34,795
I took it to his superior.

1742
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:40,665
Nothing happened.
I had to drop it.

1743
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:41,668
Why?

1744
01:21:44,105 --> 01:21:45,772
I wanted to be on television.

1745
01:21:48,441 --> 01:21:50,443
Did you think
what your silence would mean?

1746
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:54,679
For us? The rest of us?

1747
01:21:54,681 --> 01:21:56,949
Roger is not my fault.

1748
01:21:56,951 --> 01:22:00,152
It would've been nice if...

1749
01:22:00,154 --> 01:22:04,357
If somebody told us that
he's after more than legs.

1750
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:08,526
It's nobody's job
to protect you, Kayla.

1751
01:22:08,528 --> 01:22:10,363
That's all of our job.

1752
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:14,732
I don't get you. You're...

1753
01:22:14,734 --> 01:22:16,401
You have power.

1754
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:18,536
Why are you still playing
by old rules?

1755
01:22:18,538 --> 01:22:19,941
You're Megyn Kelly.

1756
01:22:20,807 --> 01:22:22,609
Look around, snowflake.

1757
01:22:23,577 --> 01:22:25,543
How do you think I succeeded?

1758
01:22:25,545 --> 01:22:28,381
How do you think a woman
gets a prime-time Fox show?

1759
01:22:31,751 --> 01:22:33,785
So, you had sex with him?

1760
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:35,822
Jesus fucking Christ.

1761
01:22:41,494 --> 01:22:42,694
<i>One thing to keep in mind</i>

1762
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:45,430
<i>about the prospect of Indiana
governor, Mike Pence,</i>

1763
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,498
<i>becoming Donald Trump's
running mate...</i>

1764
01:22:53,573 --> 01:22:54,574
Hello.

1765
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:57,508
Hey, it's me.

1766
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:00,845
Oh, my God.
What the fuck? Kayla.

1767
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:03,949
<i>It said "Bill" in my phone.
What the fuck?</i>

1768
01:23:03,951 --> 01:23:07,619
Oh, sorry. I saved my number
under his name

1769
01:23:07,621 --> 01:23:09,888
in your phone, um, as a joke.

1770
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:12,690
- <i>I forgot.</i>
- Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

1771
01:23:12,692 --> 01:23:14,592
I had a heart attack.

1772
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:17,528
<i>Where are you?</i>

1773
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,663
Um...

1774
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:21,168
- I'm on a date.
- <i>Oh.</i>

1775
01:23:22,203 --> 01:23:23,701
Okay.

1776
01:23:23,703 --> 01:23:24,704
<i>Hey. Did you, um...</i>

1777
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:30,475
Did you give my name
to Megyn by any chance?

1778
01:23:30,477 --> 01:23:34,746
I... I may have, um,

1779
01:23:34,748 --> 01:23:38,516
worried about you out loud
once or twice.

1780
01:23:38,518 --> 01:23:39,786
Why didn't you just

1781
01:23:41,155 --> 01:23:42,221
support me?

1782
01:23:42,223 --> 01:23:43,989
<i>I don't... I don't even know.</i>

1783
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:47,395
I couldn't
do anything. And I...

1784
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:52,899
I can't fuck up because
I'm a lesbian at Fox News.

1785
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:55,767
So?

1786
01:23:55,769 --> 01:24:00,072
So, who's your date with, Kayla?

1787
01:24:00,074 --> 01:24:02,107
<i>I can't just go
on a date with a dude</i>

1788
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:05,079
<i>and make it go away, you know?</i>

1789
01:24:13,853 --> 01:24:15,488
I think I'm...

1790
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:18,926
I think I'm gonna
call Paul/Weiss.

1791
01:24:19,927 --> 01:24:22,660
Okay. That's good.

1792
01:24:22,662 --> 01:24:23,795
<i>That's really good.</i>

1793
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:26,131
<i>I'm really glad
you're doing that.</i>

1794
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:29,101
<i>I think that's absolutely
what you should do.</i>

1795
01:24:29,103 --> 01:24:30,237
Okay, great.

1796
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:33,738
<i>I just, um... I just...</i>

1797
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,640
I didn't...

1798
01:24:35,642 --> 01:24:37,575
I can't call anyone else
and I just...

1799
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:39,677
I need someone right now

1800
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,847
to tell me
that that's what I should do.

1801
01:24:42,849 --> 01:24:44,016
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

1802
01:24:44,018 --> 01:24:45,650
I heard it was, like,
an outside firm

1803
01:24:45,652 --> 01:24:47,587
and they're taking it
really seriously.

1804
01:24:48,655 --> 01:24:50,790
Okay, great. Thanks.

1805
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:55,096
Kayla.

1806
01:24:57,064 --> 01:24:58,665
<i>What happened?</i>

1807
01:25:01,768 --> 01:25:03,037
I did it.

1808
01:25:04,038 --> 01:25:05,672
I...

1809
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,842
I did it. I gave in to him.

1810
01:25:13,014 --> 01:25:14,547
<i>Kayla, I...</i>

1811
01:25:16,217 --> 01:25:17,751
I'm so sorry.

1812
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:21,819
He kept talking.
He just kept talking.

1813
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:23,190
He kept saying...

1814
01:25:24,624 --> 01:25:26,657
"Good girl.

1815
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:28,828
"That's a good girl.
Be a good soldier.

1816
01:25:31,664 --> 01:25:33,265
"Earn your place."

1817
01:25:33,267 --> 01:25:34,766
Fuck.

1818
01:25:34,768 --> 01:25:37,069
<i>He didn't even...</i>

1819
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:38,305
Didn't even unbuckle.

1820
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,206
He couldn't get...

1821
01:25:52,053 --> 01:25:54,153
I feel so filthy.

1822
01:25:54,155 --> 01:25:55,921
<i>No, Kayla.</i>

1823
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:57,958
You didn't do anything wrong.

1824
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:02,296
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1825
01:26:05,966 --> 01:26:07,234
I better go.

1826
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:12,137
Roger can sense
vulnerabilities.

1827
01:26:12,139 --> 01:26:15,640
In those days, our meetings
were career-strategy sessions

1828
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:19,211
mixed with good advice
and comments like...

1829
01:26:19,213 --> 01:26:22,880
The most basic thing
is confidence.

1830
01:26:22,882 --> 01:26:25,150
Feel at home in your own skin.

1831
01:26:25,152 --> 01:26:27,685
If you're confident,
you're sexy.

1832
01:26:27,687 --> 01:26:30,055
I'm sure you have
some sexy bras.

1833
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:32,859
I'd love to see you in those.

1834
01:26:35,229 --> 01:26:37,429
It was a cat-and-mouse game.

1835
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:39,797
But he always gave me
good advice,

1836
01:26:39,799 --> 01:26:41,102
and let me deflect,

1837
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,604
tell him to dream on.

1838
01:26:46,974 --> 01:26:48,842
The more I let him
get away with,

1839
01:26:51,011 --> 01:26:53,245
the more he pushed my buttons.

1840
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:56,915
<i>I don't know if women
can be good interviewers.</i>

1841
01:26:56,917 --> 01:27:00,121
Men have that killer instinct.

1842
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:03,821
We do bad things.

1843
01:27:03,823 --> 01:27:05,758
And we do not
feel guilty about it.

1844
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:11,898
How can I be sure
you have that kind of drive?

1845
01:27:16,237 --> 01:27:18,170
Finally, in January...

1846
01:27:18,172 --> 01:27:19,371
This is '06?

1847
01:27:19,373 --> 01:27:20,640
Yes.

1848
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:47,935
He grabbed me.

1849
01:27:50,404 --> 01:27:51,838
Tried to kiss me.

1850
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:02,183
I pushed him away twice.

1851
01:28:07,087 --> 01:28:11,158
<i>As I was leaving, he asked,
"When's your contract up?"</i>

1852
01:28:28,209 --> 01:28:30,275
After the third time, I left.

1853
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:33,245
And he never tried
anything again?

1854
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:34,448
No.

1855
01:28:35,549 --> 01:28:38,018
I ignored his calls.
Stayed in DC.

1856
01:28:38,718 --> 01:28:40,254
Two years later, I had a show.

1857
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:44,556
Any long-term consequences?

1858
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:50,030
Yeah. Um...

1859
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,572
Am I Witness W?

1860
01:29:00,574 --> 01:29:02,943
Yes. Why?

1861
01:29:04,044 --> 01:29:06,013
It's the 23rd letter
in the alphabet.

1862
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:08,879
Have 22 other women
come forward

1863
01:29:08,881 --> 01:29:10,417
since I first spoke to you?

1864
01:29:12,186 --> 01:29:13,187
Have they?

1865
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:18,825
Will there be more?

1866
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:30,402
<i>A major bombshell
this morning.</i>

1867
01:29:30,404 --> 01:29:33,305
<i>Star anchor Megyn Kelly
has informed lawyers</i>

1868
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:35,207
<i>that Fox News CEO,
Roger Ailes,</i>

1869
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,942
<i>sexually harassed her.</i>

1870
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,310
<i>For her to level
these allegations</i>

1871
01:29:38,312 --> 01:29:39,844
<i>is devastating against Ailes.</i>

1872
01:29:39,846 --> 01:29:42,214
<i>We are seeing
the end of an era at Fox News.</i>

1873
01:29:42,216 --> 01:29:44,049
<i>The dagger in his heart,
in some ways,</i>

1874
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:45,617
<i>was the notion
that Megyn Kelly</i>

1875
01:29:45,619 --> 01:29:47,619
<i>was among his accusers.</i>

1876
01:29:47,621 --> 01:29:49,321
What?

1877
01:29:49,323 --> 01:29:51,889
What?

1878
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:53,527
Yes. Yes.

1879
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:05,203
Roger, what's the matter?

1880
01:30:05,205 --> 01:30:06,471
Megyn's claiming
I harassed her.

1881
01:30:06,473 --> 01:30:08,206
- What?
- You saw Gabe Sherman's post?

1882
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:10,242
James has been
feeding him bullshit.

1883
01:30:10,244 --> 01:30:11,376
Comb through Megyn's press.

1884
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:14,079
Find every single positive
thing she's said about me

1885
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,414
and get it out, now.

1886
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:18,851
Roger, I can't discredit
an anchor I'm paid to promote.

1887
01:30:21,021 --> 01:30:23,455
Glad I'm not in a foxhole
with you.

1888
01:30:23,457 --> 01:30:26,491
Well, we'll leak something
to Breitbart or to Drudge.

1889
01:30:26,493 --> 01:30:27,892
I'm sorry, Roger.

1890
01:30:27,894 --> 01:30:29,561
Well, do something!

1891
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:31,997
At least get some shit
about Gretchen out there.

1892
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:33,901
These women
are trying to fuck me!

1893
01:30:38,072 --> 01:30:40,072
I have no answers for you
that you don't already know.

1894
01:30:40,074 --> 01:30:41,540
It's out of my hands
at this point.

1895
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:44,242
We will be emailing you guys.
Please just hold tight.

1896
01:30:47,047 --> 01:30:48,048
Thanks.

1897
01:30:48,482 --> 01:30:49,648
Hey, Gil.

1898
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,016
Hey, Greta.

1899
01:30:51,018 --> 01:30:53,151
What's Megyn's endgame?

1900
01:30:53,153 --> 01:30:55,354
This part of her
contract negotiation?

1901
01:30:55,356 --> 01:30:57,022
It's not economic.

1902
01:30:57,024 --> 01:30:58,490
Or political.

1903
01:30:58,492 --> 01:30:59,493
Okay, Gil.

1904
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:05,097
No, this is scaring me.

1905
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:06,398
It's like
the whole world's on fire

1906
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,333
- and no one can be trusted.
- Hey, Geraldo.

1907
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:10,235
- CNN, line six.
- Can't talk.

1908
01:31:10,237 --> 01:31:11,970
These are the end-times.

1909
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:13,038
Why aren't you on the phone?

1910
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,539
To comment
on sexual harassment?

1911
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:16,241
We work for Bill.

1912
01:31:16,243 --> 01:31:17,409
Team Roger.

1913
01:31:17,411 --> 01:31:19,010
Hey, we need you to wear it.

1914
01:31:19,012 --> 01:31:20,212
- No.
- Are you kidding?

1915
01:31:20,214 --> 01:31:21,380
- No.
- Are you kidding?

1916
01:31:21,382 --> 01:31:22,647
- Doesn't she have a job?
- Get it on.

1917
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:24,149
Megyn Kelly has no comment.

1918
01:31:24,151 --> 01:31:25,285
She's traveling.

1919
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,486
To Cleveland.

1920
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:30,122
For the Republican convention,
remember?

1921
01:31:30,124 --> 01:31:32,023
Look, I've known him
for 40 years,

1922
01:31:32,025 --> 01:31:34,426
and he's about as flirty as
the grizzly from <i>The Revenant.</i>

1923
01:31:34,428 --> 01:31:35,594
Let me
tell you something.

1924
01:31:35,596 --> 01:31:38,430
I called these allegations
sick 'cause they are sick.

1925
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:40,999
Hey, why wasn't I let in
on the pact?

1926
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:42,067
What pact?

1927
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:43,535
Breitbart is saying
there's a pact

1928
01:31:43,537 --> 01:31:45,537
among our
top 50 on-air talents

1929
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:46,972
that if Roger gets fired,
we all walk.

1930
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:48,140
Great. Where do I sign?

1931
01:31:48,142 --> 01:31:49,408
Wait, I never heard of a pact.

1932
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:50,411
Me either.

1933
01:31:53,046 --> 01:31:54,214
Roger placed it.

1934
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:57,215
Fake news.

1935
01:31:57,217 --> 01:31:58,283
Come on.

1936
01:31:58,285 --> 01:32:00,187
<i>How bad
does it look for Roger?</i>

1937
01:32:00,988 --> 01:32:02,654
<i>Bad.</i>

1938
01:32:02,656 --> 01:32:05,657
Doesn't feel
like I imagined it would.

1939
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:08,662
<i>Gretchen, you achieved
something remarkable.</i>

1940
01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:12,232
Yes, I did.

1941
01:32:14,668 --> 01:32:15,702
Mom?

1942
01:32:17,137 --> 01:32:19,504
I think it's time
we finish this.

1943
01:32:19,506 --> 01:32:21,408
<i>Okay. I'll let you know.</i>

1944
01:32:25,012 --> 01:32:26,346
Mom, are you done with that?

1945
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:28,982
Mmm-hmm. I'm done.

1946
01:32:31,251 --> 01:32:32,584
I made the Murdochs

1947
01:32:32,586 --> 01:32:35,320
1.5 billion in profit
last year.

1948
01:32:35,322 --> 01:32:36,388
Pure profit.

1949
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:38,356
Fox News
is the most successful

1950
01:32:38,358 --> 01:32:41,261
cable franchise in history.

1951
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:43,997
Gretchen Carlson's lawyers.

1952
01:32:45,466 --> 01:32:47,799
She wants to settle.

1953
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:50,302
It's a lot less appealing
to sue you personally

1954
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,239
without Rupert's money
behind you.

1955
01:32:56,276 --> 01:32:57,277
Hey, Ken.

1956
01:33:00,681 --> 01:33:01,682
Ken.

1957
01:33:27,808 --> 01:33:30,709
- Hey! Look who's here.
- Oh, my gosh!

1958
01:33:30,711 --> 01:33:33,111
- I brought you some small people.
- Yard! Yatesy!

1959
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:34,646
Oh, my gosh.
I've missed you guys so much.

1960
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:36,515
We practiced that scare
for two weeks.

1961
01:33:36,517 --> 01:33:37,716
Look at you.

1962
01:33:37,718 --> 01:33:39,351
- Hi.
- Hi.

1963
01:33:39,353 --> 01:33:42,587
- I love you, Mama.
- My little chubble-wubbles.

1964
01:33:42,589 --> 01:33:44,623
- We got her.
- All right.

1965
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,525
She was so scared.

1966
01:33:46,527 --> 01:33:47,859
Thank you.

1967
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:49,861
How are you, sweetheart?

1968
01:33:49,863 --> 01:33:51,763
I'm either damned for doing it

1969
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:53,166
or damned
for not doing it sooner.

1970
01:33:55,402 --> 01:33:57,704
Tell me my big mouth
didn't ruin our life.

1971
01:33:58,505 --> 01:33:59,506
Not yet.

1972
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,448
Can I speak
to Roger alone, please?

1973
01:34:17,124 --> 01:34:18,458
Are you sure
you want Beth here?

1974
01:34:19,493 --> 01:34:21,061
Well, of course.

1975
01:34:27,501 --> 01:34:29,836
Gretchen taped
your conversations.

1976
01:34:31,638 --> 01:34:33,204
That's a goddamn lie.

1977
01:34:33,206 --> 01:34:34,508
For over a year.

1978
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:38,779
But...

1979
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,413
you don't believe her?

1980
01:34:41,415 --> 01:34:44,384
Your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from tapes.

1981
01:34:48,455 --> 01:34:50,221
Why didn't they
tell us before?

1982
01:34:50,223 --> 01:34:52,259
So you'd issue
complete denials.

1983
01:34:54,394 --> 01:34:56,129
So you'd have no credibility.

1984
01:35:02,769 --> 01:35:04,705
Apparently,
she did her homework.

1985
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:24,723
<i>God bless our
next President, Donald Trump,</i>

1986
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:28,895
<i>and God bless
the United States of America!</i>

1987
01:35:29,863 --> 01:35:31,531
<i>USA!</i>

1988
01:35:32,499 --> 01:35:34,633
Mr. Giuliani's fired up.

1989
01:35:34,635 --> 01:35:36,668
When we come back,
we'll discuss his speech

1990
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,670
with the man
who helped write it.

1991
01:35:38,672 --> 01:35:40,205
Clear.

1992
01:35:40,207 --> 01:35:41,840
<i>Don't react, okay?</i>

1993
01:35:41,842 --> 01:35:42,908
Mmm-hmm.

1994
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:44,244
<i>Roger's out.</i>

1995
01:35:47,681 --> 01:35:48,981
Is that sourced, Gil?

1996
01:35:48,983 --> 01:35:50,983
<i>Yeah. The</i> New York Post.

1997
01:35:50,985 --> 01:35:52,851
<i>They put him on the cover.</i>

1998
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:54,554
<i>Rupert's telling him
to let go.</i>

1999
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:56,721
Then it's a scoop.

2000
01:35:56,723 --> 01:35:58,757
<i>We're gonna win.
We're gonna win so big.</i>

2001
01:35:58,759 --> 01:36:00,625
<i>Thank you very much,
everybody.</i>

2002
01:36:00,627 --> 01:36:01,961
There is some
breaking news tonight

2003
01:36:01,963 --> 01:36:03,695
in the worlds of
media and politics.

2004
01:36:03,697 --> 01:36:05,497
A blockbuster shakeup
at Fox News.

2005
01:36:05,499 --> 01:36:06,932
A dramatic fall from grace.

2006
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:09,935
Roger Ailes is out
as top boss.

2007
01:36:09,937 --> 01:36:11,670
They want us
to circle the block.

2008
01:36:11,672 --> 01:36:12,873
No. Hold on.

2009
01:36:16,376 --> 01:36:18,245
- What's going on?
- Go around.

2010
01:36:21,314 --> 01:36:22,649
I've been shut out.

2011
01:36:31,358 --> 01:36:32,223
<i>It's true.</i>

2012
01:36:32,225 --> 01:36:34,693
Everything Gretchen said,
it's all true.

2013
01:36:34,695 --> 01:36:35,827
Roger lied to me.

2014
01:36:35,829 --> 01:36:38,363
Why?
Because I'm a manager here,

2015
01:36:38,365 --> 01:36:40,532
so I have concerns
my public defense of Roger

2016
01:36:40,534 --> 01:36:42,333
could be construed
as coercive.

2017
01:36:42,335 --> 01:36:44,404
Hey. Huh. Pants.

2018
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:45,940
Fuck off, Neil.

2019
01:36:59,619 --> 01:37:00,986
Sorry to keep you waiting.

2020
01:37:00,988 --> 01:37:02,654
No, no, no, no, no, sit down.

2021
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:04,891
Appreciate you
driving up here, Roger.

2022
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:07,661
- Susan Estrich.
- Susan.

2023
01:37:10,697 --> 01:37:13,065
I hate that it's come to this.

2024
01:37:13,067 --> 01:37:14,568
Me, too.

2025
01:37:24,979 --> 01:37:28,948
We gave these women jobs.

2026
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:31,917
Put them on the air,
made them famous.

2027
01:37:31,919 --> 01:37:33,818
Do you think
for a goddamn second

2028
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:36,256
I did any damage
to any of them?

2029
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:38,792
No, you don't.

2030
01:37:41,461 --> 01:37:42,662
You don't, Rupert.

2031
01:37:44,698 --> 01:37:47,567
There's no audience
for that side of the story.

2032
01:37:58,079 --> 01:37:59,245
To begin with,

2033
01:37:59,247 --> 01:38:02,047
half this, you already owe him
from last year's bonus.

2034
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:03,916
And we're paying it.

2035
01:38:03,918 --> 01:38:05,650
And paying off your contract.

2036
01:38:05,652 --> 01:38:06,919
Consider yourself lucky.

2037
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:10,355
It's a contractual obligation.

2038
01:38:10,357 --> 01:38:14,526
I created the Murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

2039
01:38:14,528 --> 01:38:16,929
A third of your margin.

2040
01:38:16,931 --> 01:38:19,064
There are three of you.

2041
01:38:19,066 --> 01:38:20,933
I guess that means
I pay for the food

2042
01:38:20,935 --> 01:38:22,736
that one of you puts
in your mouth.

2043
01:38:24,371 --> 01:38:25,603
What if it's you?

2044
01:38:25,605 --> 01:38:27,372
I'd have fired you for cause.

2045
01:38:27,374 --> 01:38:28,740
Roger,

2046
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:31,409
you built an amazing business.

2047
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:33,313
No one can take that
away from you.

2048
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:37,084
But under the circumstances,

2049
01:38:38,385 --> 01:38:40,953
this is a lot of money.

2050
01:38:40,955 --> 01:38:42,620
And it won't look good
to the people

2051
01:38:42,622 --> 01:38:44,089
that don't know your worth.

2052
01:38:44,091 --> 01:38:45,790
Take it.

2053
01:38:45,792 --> 01:38:47,661
Honor your non-compete.

2054
01:38:55,069 --> 01:38:56,870
I never cared about the money.

2055
01:38:58,005 --> 01:38:59,472
We know, Roger.

2056
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,714
Okay.

2057
01:39:09,549 --> 01:39:12,450
Okay.

2058
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:14,954
I'd like to go
to the newsroom with you.

2059
01:39:14,956 --> 01:39:17,791
I'd like us to announce
my leaving together.

2060
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:24,798
No.

2061
01:39:36,843 --> 01:39:39,412
The end of the leg man.

2062
01:39:41,015 --> 01:39:42,749
I won't miss him.

2063
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:44,684
Boys.

2064
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:55,729
Hope you two know
what you're doing.

2065
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:03,868
Once Roger's office is cleared
of handguns, I'll move in.

2066
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:06,537
I'll run the network
till the ship's aright.

2067
01:40:09,911 --> 01:40:12,011
Donald.

2068
01:40:12,013 --> 01:40:14,046
How's our speech coming?

2069
01:40:14,048 --> 01:40:15,950
Yeah.

2070
01:40:18,085 --> 01:40:20,953
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

2071
01:40:20,955 --> 01:40:25,257
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

2072
01:40:25,259 --> 01:40:26,758
Convention's
downstairs, folks.

2073
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,859
What's going on at Fox?

2074
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:28,760
Would you say
people are shocked?

2075
01:40:28,762 --> 01:40:30,561
Can Rupert
afford to dump Roger?

2076
01:40:30,563 --> 01:40:32,563
What did he do to you?
Megyn. Come on!

2077
01:40:32,565 --> 01:40:34,233
<i>Of all the ways
this could end,</i>

2078
01:40:34,235 --> 01:40:35,568
<i>I didn't see this one coming.</i>

2079
01:40:36,904 --> 01:40:38,636
<i>Gretchen Carlson
got the Murdochs</i>

2080
01:40:38,638 --> 01:40:40,505
<i>to put the rights of women
above profit,</i>

2081
01:40:40,507 --> 01:40:43,175
<i>if only temporarily.</i>

2082
01:40:43,177 --> 01:40:46,145
<i>And I found myself
with a job I didn't want</i>

2083
01:40:46,147 --> 01:40:48,015
<i>or couldn't really leave</i>

2084
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:50,615
<i>even when I did.</i>

2085
01:40:58,758 --> 01:41:00,825
You should keep that out.

2086
01:41:00,827 --> 01:41:02,794
People, can I get
your attention, please?

2087
01:41:02,796 --> 01:41:04,930
Mr. Murdoch
is joining us today.

2088
01:41:04,932 --> 01:41:06,901
He has a very important
statement he'd like to say.

2089
01:41:08,302 --> 01:41:10,202
Excuse me, everyone.

2090
01:41:10,204 --> 01:41:12,137
I won't take long.

2091
01:41:12,139 --> 01:41:15,240
Roger Ailes is leaving Fox.

2092
01:41:15,242 --> 01:41:18,077
Now, I want to start
by thanking Roger

2093
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:20,578
for his
remarkable contribution

2094
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:23,148
to our company
and to our country.

2095
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:26,118
Twenty years ago,
Roger shared...

2096
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:27,286
<i>Here's the thing about</i>

2097
01:41:27,288 --> 01:41:30,555
<i>being sexually harassed
at work.</i>

2098
01:41:30,557 --> 01:41:31,993
<i>It condemns you to questions.</i>

2099
01:41:34,627 --> 01:41:36,063
<i>You keep asking yourself,</i>

2100
01:41:37,098 --> 01:41:38,565
<i>"What did I do?</i>

2101
01:41:39,133 --> 01:41:40,533
<i>"What did I say?</i>

2102
01:41:41,202 --> 01:41:42,968
<i>"What did I wear?</i>

2103
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,138
<i>"What did I miss?</i>

2104
01:41:45,139 --> 01:41:46,806
<i>"Am I seen as weak?</i>

2105
01:41:49,576 --> 01:41:51,511
<i>"Will they say
I'm after money?</i>

2106
01:41:53,314 --> 01:41:55,582
<i>"Will they say
I'm after attention?</i>

2107
01:41:57,884 --> 01:41:59,220
<i>"Will I be left out?</i>

2108
01:42:02,089 --> 01:42:05,290
<i>"Will I be defined by this
for the rest of my life?"</i>

2109
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:08,893
I will take over
as Chairman and acting CEO

2110
01:42:08,895 --> 01:42:12,031
with the support of our
existing management team,

2111
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:13,833
under Bill Shine.

2112
01:42:15,735 --> 01:42:18,705
<i>If I stay, do I just
have to put up with it?</i>

2113
01:42:25,946 --> 01:42:27,814
<i>Will the next place
be different?</i>

2114
01:42:30,384 --> 01:42:32,652
<i>Or can I make it different?</i>

2115
01:42:45,865 --> 01:42:46,899
<i>Roger always said,</i>

2116
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:49,769
<i>"Everyone on television
only has one real job.</i>

2117
01:42:50,905 --> 01:42:52,173
<i>"To be likable."</i>

2118
01:42:53,673 --> 01:42:55,908
<i>Well, I don't care
if you like me,</i>

2119
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:57,677
<i>only that you believe me.</i>

2120
01:42:59,246 --> 01:43:01,313
<i>A lot of people, even women,</i>

2121
01:43:01,315 --> 01:43:03,315
<i>are skeptical
of harassment claims</i>

2122
01:43:03,317 --> 01:43:05,783
<i>until they experience it
themselves,</i>

2123
01:43:05,785 --> 01:43:07,685
<i>or know someone who has.</i>

2124
01:43:07,687 --> 01:43:09,854
Let me be that person for you.

2125
01:43:09,856 --> 01:43:10,857
As you can see,

2126
01:43:11,724 --> 01:43:13,225
it's 20 million.

2127
01:43:13,227 --> 01:43:14,759
Plus the apology.

2128
01:43:14,761 --> 01:43:16,661
- Mmm.
- Correct.

2129
01:43:16,663 --> 01:43:19,131
I can't believe
Fox agreed to the apology.

2130
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:20,332
I mean, it's unheard of.

2131
01:43:20,334 --> 01:43:22,301
I mean, that never happens.

2132
01:43:22,303 --> 01:43:24,403
But you will have to
sign that.

2133
01:43:24,405 --> 01:43:27,372
It's a strict confidentiality
agreement.

2134
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:29,308
Money will establish
you told the truth,

2135
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,443
but no one can ever hear it
directly from you.

2136
01:43:31,445 --> 01:43:33,880
You will be muzzled, Gretchen.

2137
01:43:43,357 --> 01:43:44,391
Maybe.

2138
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:22,150

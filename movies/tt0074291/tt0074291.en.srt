2
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:55,644
Real figure, real nature,
sending out rays like the dawn,

3
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:58,523
making us all fall in love.

4
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:00,761
Oh, Venice!

5
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:05,719
Oh, queen!
Oh, queen!

6
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:12,555
Your breath is
the sirocco or bora wind

7
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:16,273
that awakens the shivers
of eternal life,

8
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:19,752
golden lady who governs us.

9
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,150
Oh, Venice!

10
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:31,666
Holy head, stone and diamond,
mouth that speaks,

11
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,864
ear that hears...

12
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:37,382
Raise that ribbon.
If you are afraid, close your eyes.

13
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,369
Oh, how you grow,
oh moon, with deep caves.

14
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,686
Oh, how you rise,
with blue and blond hair...

15
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,319
Rise! Rise!

16
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,717
Put up the irons, put up the poles,
pour wine, bring out the jug for her.

17
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:28,555
Fill her up with only the best.

18
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,754
She is a drunkard, a glutton!

19
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:35,912
Who knows what she will donate
to us, after!

20
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:40,350
Miuna screwer, defecating buttocks,
subterranean old woman,

21
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:45,387
old smelly woman or big Miuna,
flirter and cheater,

22
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:51,424
who we are forced to accept as wife
mother, wicked mother- in-law,

23
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:55,022
sister and grandmother...

24
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:51,272
A tragedy! A tragedy!

25
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:54,311
We won't see it anymore!
We won't see it anymore!

26
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,948
We won't see
this damned head anymore!

27
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:53,320
"A nun who has seen you for
two months at the convent Mass,

28
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,119
wishes to meet you.

29
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,957
She will be waiting for you
at San Bartolo island tonight.

30
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:03,354
Without a servant,
and carrying a candle."

31
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:39,624
My love, please. Let me take off
those clothes which are so serious.

32
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:43,423
They are ill-suited
for our love encounter.

33
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,462
We must wait.

34
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,060
What?

35
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,099
I do not know if my friend
has already arrived.

36
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:53,057
Friend?

37
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,409
He is here.

38
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,888
Who?

39
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:14,526
My lover De Bernis.
The French ambassador?

40
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:19,284
That is really something!
It will add a different flavor.

41
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:21,522
This villa is his.

42
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,202
He will allow us to use it,

43
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,240
but in exchange he wants to watch,
without our seeing him.

44
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,479
Where will this bizarre man stay?

45
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,197
He is over there.
Where?

46
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:35,315
Did you see those little fishes
on the wall?

47
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:37,954
He is back there.

48
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,711
If you do your duty diligently,
he will not be bored.

49
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,430
Bored?

50
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:47,868
With me?

51
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,987
He will be amazed.
Really?

52
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,985
Never has he seen
your femininity, your grace,

53
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:58,503
highlighted by such
a well-mannered lover.

54
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:03,021
Not well-mannered!
It is an offense.

55
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,578
When do two lovers, overtaken
by frenzy, worry about manners?

56
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:11,577
Then... I will only be delicate.

57
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,530
What is it?
Oh, what a lovely jewel!

58
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,288
Is it gold?

59
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,566
What bird is it?

60
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,525
A dove? Or an owl?

61
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,843
No, no, no.

62
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,882
Stop.

63
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,840
There.

64
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,717
Now you must chase me because
that is what he likes.

65
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:48,997
Alright.

66
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:55,673
Your lover deserves being a cuckold.

67
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:58,712
And we will apply ourselves to this,
all night long.

68
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,579
Come up.

69
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,092
Very good.

70
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:50,404
Turn around.

71
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,354
Stop, stop!

72
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,421
No, no, no.

73
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:15,538
Love, love.

74
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:36,047
Well done, my young man.
Very good.

75
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:39,485
I would say your performance
was excellent.

76
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,963
I have heard many admirable
things about you.

77
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,081
To be more demanding,

78
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:51,198
when you were on your back,
you could have done better.

79
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,757
There, you lacked a bit in...

80
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,916
imagination.

81
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:02,193
But on the whole,
the performance was well done.

82
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:04,232
Bravo!

83
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:06,311
Mister Ambassador, your approval...

84
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,830
Giacomo.

85
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,228
Your approval fills me
with great pride.

86
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:19,024
However, with your permission,
I want to say that my capacities

87
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:22,063
go beyond what you have
just been a spectator of.

88
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:24,821
I studied engineering, literature...

89
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,740
Giacomo.

90
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,737
and I am learned in the art
of politics and economy.

91
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:35,136
I modestly believe
that some of my discoveries

92
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:38,734
would be favorably accepted
by the King of France's government.

93
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:41,812
Besides being a dilettante
in the studies of alchemy,

94
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:46,050
which almost led me to increase
the volume of mercury,

95
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,689
I am an expert in divination.
Take this.

96
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:53,287
I invented an infallible method

97
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:57,284
to double the profits of a state,
in the brief time span of one year.

98
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,284
If I may dare...

99
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,162
Your cape.

100
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:07,199
In all humility, I would like
to ask your excellency,

101
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,118
for a letter of presentation.

102
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,876
I am ready to leave immediately
for your wonderful country

103
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:15,595
which I love and consider
my second homeland.

104
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:48,058
Good-bye.

105
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:50,457
Do you care for me?

106
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,664
Giacomo Casanova!

107
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:56,102
Giacomo Casanova!

108
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:03,618
In the name
of Messer Grande,

109
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:06,936
the illumined judges
of the Inquisition court,

110
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:09,095
you are under arrest.

111
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:12,413
Why? Why?

112
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:33,042
"Giacomo Casanova, you are guilty
of exercising black magic,

113
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:36,441
of possessing prohibited evil books,

114
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:40,239
of being the author of heretic
writings and of criticizing religion.

115
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,678
I, Messer Grande, by order
of the Inquisitors of Venice,

116
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:47,835
declare you under arrest. You will be
put into the Piombi prison.

117
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:55,631
I respect the illuminated judgement
of the court, Messer Grande,

118
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:59,589
but I am obliged to repeat that
I declare myself absolutely innocent.

119
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:42,846
Come.

120
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,282
Listen, listen...

121
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,438
Open! Open! I cannot live
in this horrible cell!

122
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,597
It is an injustice! Open!

123
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,475
I am not a heretic. Open!

124
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,154
Open!

125
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:14,869
Why?

126
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:35,779
My life of freedom
seemed so far away.

127
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:40,816
The pleasant company,
the love encounters.

128
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:46,493
Marietta, we need a different
thread here!

129
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,731
He looks a like a mannequin.

130
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,410
Are those things real?
What?

131
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:55,808
That silk, those ornaments,
that satin he is wearing.

132
00:21:56,967 --> 00:22:02,165
With a nose such as his,
I wonder what the rest is like!

133
00:22:03,644 --> 00:22:05,683
Tonina, pass me the thread.

134
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,477
Look at what a lovely statue!

135
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:22,514
The artist should have added
more color.

136
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:25,712
That girl is a big worry for me.

137
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:30,310
She does not eat, does not sing, does
not laugh and is always at home!

138
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:33,949
Here she is!

139
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:43,343
My lady is outside waiting.

140
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,581
Hurry! Hide!
Slip underneath!

141
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,849
She looks like a peacock!

142
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:21,003
Come out from under there! Get
to work or it will never get done.

143
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:38,195
You know he is starting
to act like a madman again?

144
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:42,313
Again?
I cannot believe it.

145
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:45,751
I tell you that it is so.
Worse than before.

146
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:48,909
He is insolent and brazen.

147
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:51,148
My dear, it is a real martyrdom.

148
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,826
Do you not think we should do
something to repress

149
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:58,664
who is so disobedient
and rebellious?

150
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:02,662
But what?
What more can I do?

151
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,020
I try to hide him,

152
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:09,458
to keep him away from other
people's looks, as much as I can.

153
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:14,016
But he is so brazen and reckless
and shrewd!

154
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:16,575
He shamelessly likes to show off.

155
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:20,133
Wherever he goes, he does anything
to be seen by everyone!

156
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:23,531
I live in the fear that any moment

157
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:25,730
he may even speak.

158
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,328
He might make fun of me
to make me look ridiculous.

159
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,805
Yes, he is very pompous
and self- centered.

160
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:36,364
He looks like a fanatic.

161
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:40,882
He bloats more and more
every day, right?

162
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:44,800
That is right, and he
always causes scandal in church!

163
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,439
He distracts the faithful
from thinking of God.

164
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,796
Everyone's eyes go to him!
He is a sacrilegious instrument.

165
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:54,435
He interrupts prayer,
communication with God!

166
00:24:54,515 --> 00:25:00,512
He fills everyone's eyes
with his fat, round cheeks.

167
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,788
There is nothing left to do.

168
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,826
He absolutely must be punished.

169
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:13,345
Yes, he must be whipped.
Uncover him!

170
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,824
I have waited so long
to hear him scream!

171
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:19,262
Whip me, mortify my flesh!

172
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:24,059
Do it! Make him cry!
He is so brazen!

173
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:25,858
Have no pity!
No!

174
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:29,936
I cannot. I love him too much.
Have pity on him.

175
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:34,854
He is not wicked. He loves me.
Do you not love me?

176
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:40,011
He is lovely, he is my best
friend. My sweetheart.

177
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:46,048
He is lovely! He is lovely!
He is lovely! He is lovely!

178
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:50,765
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

179
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:53,644
One, two, three...

180
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:01,439
No, with me, silly!
Maestro... look at me!

181
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:06,997
My respects, Sir.

182
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:19,830
Your servant, Master.

183
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:24,748
Very good.

184
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:34,383
She looks like a broom.

185
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,458
Turn.

186
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:04,527
What is the matter?
Annamaria is sick again.

187
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:10,044
Poor girl.
Three or four times a day.

188
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:13,123
Shall I call a doctor?
Run. Have him come immediately!

189
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:16,640
Thank you for your trouble.

190
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,278
The doctor is coming!
The doctor!

191
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,394
Bleeding.

192
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,233
Bleeding?

193
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,550
Give it to me.

194
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,747
Look, Holy Mother!

195
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,866
I cannot look at it.

196
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,137
What can I do if I am in love
with you, Annamaria?

197
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:06,495
Your spiritual beauty attracts
the artist that is inside of me.

198
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:09,533
I would like to model you
like a wax statue,

199
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:12,012
like the statue
I thought you were.

200
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:15,970
I would be your pygmalion, I would
give vital breath to my creature

201
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,729
and would give you my life
with my own blood.

202
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:22,046
My own fire would burn
inside of you.

203
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:19,896
What are you doing here?

204
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:25,053
I am breathing the sea air.
In the dark, and all alone?

205
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:30,730
It is the best hour. After which,
the mosquitoes begin to bite.

206
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:43,284
Do you know that you frightened me?

207
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,123
You are so pale!

208
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,922
Do you know these verses?

209
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:52,439
"The moon itself
was incarnated inside of her."

210
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:56,197
What is it?

211
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,156
The figure-head of a ship
which sunk.

212
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:03,274
The sea dragged it here.
Think of those poor people!

213
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:06,232
Deep down there...

214
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:11,029
People of the house!
Annamaria fainted. Hurry!

215
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,948
The doctor, please.

216
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:29,100
Annamaria, love.

217
00:30:38,735 --> 00:30:40,734
Doctor, she is here.

218
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:45,092
Why does this always happen
to the poor girl?

219
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:49,009
What can we do, Doctor?
Bleeding.

220
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:04,961
What is her disease?

221
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:55,263
My escape from the Piombi prison
was an artwork of intelligence.

222
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:59,062
The calculation was exact,
together with intuition and courage.

223
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,380
These qualities were all
blessed by good fortune.

224
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:21,130
I had never seen Venice
from so far above.

225
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,009
I could barely recognize it.

226
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:27,406
My beloved city,
which I had to abandon forever.

227
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:55,032
In Paris, the Marquise D'Ufre's salon
was the one most sought after,

228
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:58,230
by every outstanding person
of art and culture.

229
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:00,789
I had the honor of being
invited there.

230
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:04,188
Among others,
I met Count Saint- Germain,

231
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:08,305
a magician who practiced occultism,
who I considered without scruples.

232
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:10,824
He boasted being 300 years old,

233
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:14,742
thanks to some
of his alchemy secrets.

234
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:17,621
I had a discussion with him,
in which I was victorious.

235
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,138
The famous Marquise D'Ufre',

236
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:23,897
an extraordinary
and fascinating woman,

237
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,456
adored being surrounded by magicians,
people with exceptional perception.

238
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:30,774
She, herself, was an expert
in necromancy.

239
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,488
I am in contact
with the Queen of Saba.

240
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:46,085
Oh, how kind!
She has returned to us.

241
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:49,724
What is the water that does not
come from the rocks,

242
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:52,562
that does not fall from the sky,

243
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:57,760
that does not come from the earth?
Answer, the sweat of a horse.

244
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,277
They are the enigmas of Salomon.
That is his answer to the queen.

245
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:09,514
We received the message.
Thank you.

246
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:17,149
If you really believe
in these extra- human contacts,

247
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:20,908
why do you not move inside the soul
of the Queen of Saba?

248
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:23,705
She has soul deficiency,
as all women do.

249
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:29,143
The Council of Trento gave judgement
on this nonsense.

250
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:33,900
Women possess only two soul
qualities. Men have three.

251
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:37,378
Women lack the noble soul,
the immortal one.

252
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:46,094
But for a real woman,
even one soul is more than enough,

253
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:49,573
as long as it blends in with that
of a man, in perfect harmony,

254
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:52,451
with the fusion of their bodies.

255
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:06,204
What do you want, Marquese?
Oh, yes. I understand.

256
00:36:10,841 --> 00:36:14,760
She want us to hear the opinion
of her young niece, Edvige,

257
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,118
who is very learned in theology.

258
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:21,875
What were you studying this morning,
my child?

259
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:26,313
I was reading Saint Augustine,
which I found absurd.

260
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,752
I think I can disprove
some of his statements.

261
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:32,510
Which of his statements
did you disprove?

262
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,548
His theory on the mother
of the Savior.

263
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:40,945
Saint Augustine sustains that Mary
conceived Jesus through her ears.

264
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:45,903
Do you doubt it?
Yes, for three reasons.

265
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:49,901
First: because God, since He is not
material substance,

266
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:55,937
needs no hole through which
to enter or exit.

267
00:36:56,498 --> 00:37:00,775
Second: the hearing tubes do not
communicate with maternal alveolus.

268
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:04,933
Third: if the Virgin Mary
had conceived through her ears,

269
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:08,372
she should have given birth
through her ears, right?

270
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:11,730
But in this case... Excuse me...

271
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,368
In this case,
the Catholics are right

272
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:20,165
in considering the Virgin,
a virgin before she conceived.

273
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:18,615
Here is my refuge, my secret church,
my interior dwelling.

274
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,652
My magic laboratory.

275
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:28,049
Everything you see,
comes from an antique period.

276
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,727
And it arrived here... mysteriously.

277
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:37,925
Did you recognize it?
It was from the divine Paracelsus.

278
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:42,482
This liquid has been boiling
for 15 years,

279
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:46,719
and will have to boil
for another five.

280
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:53,636
Tell the truth.

281
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:57,994
You possess the secret
of the philosopher's stone, right?

282
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:01,192
No. No, madam.

283
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,631
What makes you think that?

284
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,869
My dear friend

285
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:11,147
you can trust me.

286
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:14,665
I know you have the famous stone

287
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:19,702
and also the capacity to communicate
with the spirits of the 4 elements.

288
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:24,940
You could overthrow
the King of France at any time.

289
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,978
I would never dare.
I love France.

290
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:30,457
You over-estimate me, my friend.

291
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:36,254
Giacomo, I beg you,

292
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,772
help me in the great work.

293
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:43,490
The great work?
What do you mean?

294
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,608
Please, you know what it is about.

295
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:49,367
Speak.

296
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:55,764
I have to die,

297
00:39:56,523 --> 00:39:59,521
and at the moment of my death

298
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:02,600
I will be transformed into a man...

299
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,958
A man who will live in eternity!

300
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:11,035
But this is possible
only if I am fecundated

301
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:14,314
by an initiate
of my same pyramidal sign.

302
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:21,790
At the moment of birth, my soul
will enter in the newborn's body

303
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,268
and I will no longer exist
as a woman,

304
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:29,386
but will go back to living
as a man.

305
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:33,464
A man who will live forever!

306
00:40:35,263 --> 00:40:38,661
You, without a doubt,

307
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:43,619
are the man who was sent to me
to help me carry out

308
00:40:45,298 --> 00:40:48,776
this great work.

309
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:55,772
My dear friend, why are you crying?

310
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:58,051
It is nothing.

311
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,968
Nothing, really.
Show me your other treasures.

312
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:09,166
Please, Madam.

313
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:28,476
All this will be yours

314
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:32,233
when together we will have created
the great work.

315
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,752
Oh, no!

316
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:41,389
I did not mean material treasures,
but spiritual ones.

317
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:46,346
The treasures of your
ultra-terrestrial knowledge.

318
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,900
My dear Giacomo,

319
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:04,137
the divine Anael has already painted
your portrait in a dream for me.

320
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:06,175
And I knew...

321
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:08,495
Be silent.

322
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,248
I am in Paris!

323
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:24,366
You are in Paris!

324
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:29,883
Beautiful Paris,
the city of the Mazzarinos,

325
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:34,201
the Racines, the Voltaires!
Paris!

326
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,477
My young and greedy heart
sings a voluptuous hymn of glory!

327
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:56,069
The sudden overturning of
the carriage which frightened me,

328
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:58,428
was maybe a help from destiny.

329
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:01,426
In fact, he who had almost ended up
under the wheels,

330
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:04,505
was non-the-less
than my abbey brother,

331
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:07,583
who some time ago
left Venice and his priest's cassock

332
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:09,702
to lead a decadent life in Paris,

333
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:12,101
together with a young red haired
woman from Treviso,

334
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:14,859
who had incautiously given in
to his flattery.

335
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,613
I eliminated that dirty liar
with a few coins

336
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:31,211
and brought with me the girl, who,
besides being attractive and witty,

337
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:35,369
would have been the ideal person
in my plan for the Marquise.

338
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:38,007
I planned on talking to her
about it.

339
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,110
Selene.

340
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:13,909
Anubis.

341
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:15,948
Osiris.

342
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:26,502
Let us go beyond
the pleasures of the flesh.

343
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:30,780
Let us concentrate on melting
our souls together in perfect unison.

344
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,979
Scent of Venus!

345
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:35,058
Love is the source
and root of life.

346
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:38,536
Love generates both good and bad
impulses and passions.

347
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:42,334
Love generates the eternal flame,
both divine as well as human.

348
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:45,772
Love generates gods and demons.

349
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,569
Take her in your arms.

350
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,649
Come, madam.

351
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:59,205
Come closer.

352
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:01,804
Scent of Venus.

353
00:45:36,546 --> 00:45:39,943
Giacomo, the hour of Venus has come.

354
00:45:40,024 --> 00:45:43,982
I am yours.
May the great work be accomplished.

355
00:45:44,062 --> 00:45:45,621
Wait.

356
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,499
I must first complete
my calculations.

357
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:55,775
I think we are still
in the hour of Mars.

358
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:00,973
Marcolina.

359
00:46:04,571 --> 00:46:06,130
Come here.

360
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,808
Turn around. I cannot do it.
Bend over.

361
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,446
Never does a man fall
into the deep abyss

362
00:46:14,526 --> 00:46:16,805
and then with equal violence
is thrown up

363
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:21,043
towards he who is perfection,

364
00:46:21,122 --> 00:46:24,080
like that diaphanous instant

365
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:26,800
in which the essence of his virility
reaches and touches

366
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:28,719
the root of the opposite sex.

367
00:46:28,798 --> 00:46:30,518
There, there!

368
00:46:41,752 --> 00:46:43,591
Now silence.

369
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,909
Silence.

370
00:46:57,624 --> 00:47:00,022
Love.
Yes.

371
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:27,808
Marcolina.

372
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:30,486
Move.

373
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:36,163
Closer. Come!

374
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:38,762
Uncover it.

375
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,225
I can do it. I can do it!

376
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:17,982
I will pierce you!
I will open you up!

377
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,340
I can do it!
Good boy!

378
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:40,769
Sirs! Sirs!

379
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:42,368
Two years later, in Forli',

380
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:46,446
I was to meet the greatest
love of my life.

381
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:49,164
Requested by some policemen,
I had gotten myself

382
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:52,244
into a furious brawl
which started in an inn.

383
00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:56,041
The man in the adjacent room
had been accused by the Pope's guards

384
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:59,200
of having let a woman in,
dressed as a man.

385
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,116
Put down that sword
or I will be forced to fire!

386
00:49:05,197 --> 00:49:08,795
The host declares that last night
he asked for a lodging

387
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:13,512
with a young officer who this
morning he discovered was a woman.

388
00:49:13,592 --> 00:49:16,951
He has been screaming like a madman
and slaps that document in our face.

389
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,230
Do you understand
what is written in it?

390
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:20,549
This gentleman is Hungarian.

391
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:24,027
He is a Hungarian officer,
so you are committing a violation.

392
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:26,465
We were called by the host!

393
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:30,343
Yes. I don't want to go to jail. You
cannot joke with the Holy Father!

394
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:32,382
Enough!

395
00:49:33,462 --> 00:49:35,101
Bring the coffee!
It is a scandal!

396
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:02,367
I am French.

397
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:04,965
My name is Henriette.

398
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:08,323
What language do you speak
with your lover?

399
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:11,482
We do not speak.
It has no use in what we do.

400
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:20,477
Whoever takes a journey to Parma

401
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:23,675
must be prepared to know at least
three divinities:

402
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:25,635
salami, ham

403
00:50:25,714 --> 00:50:29,233
and the famous third one...
Parmesan cheese.

404
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,670
I asked myself who
this young lady was.

405
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,108
What is her relationship
with this Hungarian

406
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:39,307
who could be her father?

407
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:41,946
Does she have a husband in Parma?

408
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:47,623
Or in her libertine frenzy, does she
look for other lovers and pleasures?

409
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:05,174
The captain seemed to have read
my thoughts.

410
00:51:05,254 --> 00:51:06,973
In his bad grammar Latin,
he told me

411
00:51:07,053 --> 00:51:10,931
that even he knew nothing about
this lovely and mysterious lady.

412
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:13,449
She had turned to him,
asking for protection

413
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,488
as if she feared something
or someone.

414
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:20,885
But now he had to leave her,
having to go up north.

415
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:23,284
I could have taken care of her.

416
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:42,834
Why do you look at me like that?

417
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:47,072
You do not recognize me anymore?

418
00:51:47,592 --> 00:51:51,390
I feel unimportant next to you.
I cannot call you by your first name.

419
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:55,748
You are no longer the brave
and bizarre officer I knew.

420
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:08,820
I will always remain the same girl.

421
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,818
She who had three moments of madness
in her life.

422
00:52:12,898 --> 00:52:18,736
And the last, wonderful madness
was knowing you.

423
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,529
We were invited to a concert
at the hunchback Du Bois' home.

424
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:35,407
He was an eccentric gentleman
with uncertain amorous boundaries,

425
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,326
just as uncertain were
the boundaries of the Parma dukedom,

426
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,764
divided between the Spanish
and the French.

427
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:43,402
That evening, two civilizations,
two opposite conceptions of life,

428
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:45,641
faced each other.

429
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:49,200
An antique proverb says,

430
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,838
"What is lighter than a feather?

431
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,796
Ashes.

432
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:57,236
And what is lighter than ashes?

433
00:52:58,395 --> 00:52:59,913
The wind.

434
00:52:59,994 --> 00:53:01,513
And lighter than the wind?

435
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:03,152
Woman.

436
00:53:03,232 --> 00:53:05,111
And lighter than woman?

437
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:06,790
Nothing."

438
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,189
We exercise much power over women,
much tyranny,

439
00:53:10,268 --> 00:53:13,586
and we made them accept it
only because

440
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:16,105
they are kinder,

441
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:18,424
more reasonable,

442
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:20,383
more generous than man.

443
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:24,221
Such qualities which should have made
them superior to us,

444
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,860
instead, put them at our mercy,

445
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,058
because men, in fact, are a hundred
times more unreasonable,

446
00:53:31,138 --> 00:53:32,937
more cruel, violent.

447
00:53:33,016 --> 00:53:35,855
They are more inclined
by nature, to oppress.

448
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:40,253
Women's kisses are like a glass
of wine.

449
00:53:40,332 --> 00:53:43,691
You drink and drink,
and drink... and then succumb.

450
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:48,289
He who never speaks badly of women,
does not love them.

451
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:54,885
Because to understand them and love
them, you must suffer for them.

452
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,723
So then, and only then,

453
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:01,321
can you find happiness
on the lips of your beloved.

454
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:06,200
A kiss is just the desire
of devouring what you kiss.

455
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:11,437
I really think that Du Bois
has that sort of appetite!

456
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,635
What is a kiss?

457
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:18,712
Simply the desire to get lost

458
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:20,712
in the soul of the woman you love.

459
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,978
We are beginning!

460
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:50,816
Silence. You will see
a lovely performance.

461
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,257
He himself embroidered
his costume.

462
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,360
It is all metaphoric.

463
00:59:37,346 --> 00:59:39,265
The boy is good too!

464
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:42,064
He is very handsome!
Bravo!

465
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,058
He was extraordinary. Do you not
agree? You loved him, right?

466
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:57,975
The music made me cry,
but I did not understand the story.

467
00:59:59,935 --> 01:00:02,773
I do not deserve so much applause.

468
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:06,451
I wrote this work
for Giambruno.

469
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:09,689
Thank you, Giambruno.

470
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:11,528
Bravo.
Thank you.

471
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,687
My sincere compliments
for the virtuoso singer

472
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:17,525
and the mime instructor.
Amazing.

473
01:00:17,725 --> 01:00:20,804
But after the topics discussed
at the table,

474
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:24,282
you will not be surprised
of my absolute disapproval

475
01:00:24,362 --> 01:00:28,080
of the idea behind
your captivating ballet.

476
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:27,129
Who is this Enrichetta?

477
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:32,167
Who is this priceless treasure
of which I have become owner?

478
01:01:32,246 --> 01:01:34,645
Is it really possible?

479
01:01:34,964 --> 01:01:37,843
Oh, stars! You tell me!

480
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,802
Cry it out from the depth
of your sky,

481
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:44,160
that the happy mortal
to which this creature belongs to,

482
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,039
is Giacomo Casanova. Only him!

483
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,917
Mister Casanova,
what is the matter?

484
01:01:50,676 --> 01:01:54,955
My friend, I am afraid.
I am afraid of my happiness.

485
01:01:55,034 --> 01:01:56,673
Yes?
Enrichetta...

486
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:01,190
She is an extraordinary woman,
with an extraordinary destiny.

487
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:04,829
However, I am tempted...
Forgive me, gentlemen.

488
01:02:06,628 --> 01:02:08,627
Mister D'Antoine.

489
01:02:08,747 --> 01:02:13,984
Wonderful!
A real concert player!

490
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:17,742
Where did you learn so well?
In the convent.

491
01:02:18,182 --> 01:02:20,461
But if it was not for a precise
order from the bishop,

492
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:23,819
the abbess would never have given
me permission to play.

493
01:02:23,899 --> 01:02:27,137
That pious wife of Christ, said that
when I played the violoncello

494
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:29,816
I always had an indecent pose.

495
01:02:30,575 --> 01:02:34,653
Mademoiselle, I apologize
for being so late.

496
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,252
The trip is long.

497
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:59,281
Always, always with you,
my sweet Enrichetta.

498
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,318
Cruel Enrichetta,
how many things you hide from me.

499
01:03:04,398 --> 01:03:08,276
Your past, your virtues,
your talents.

500
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:10,595
When I heard you play
the violoncello,

501
01:03:10,675 --> 01:03:13,633
you almost made me die.

502
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,871
Enrichetta.

503
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,109
Love.

504
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:38,740
Love.

505
01:03:45,536 --> 01:03:47,495
Forever.

506
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,517
Mister Du Bois.
Good morning.

507
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:29,754
I am sorry to have intruded
into your apartment,

508
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:34,191
but the servants let me in
without announcing me.

509
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:38,989
I accept your apologies, but what do
I owe the honor of this visit to?

510
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:44,066
As you noticed, Miss Enrichetta
is no longer here.

511
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:46,824
Where did she go?
What happened to her?

512
01:04:47,624 --> 01:04:52,741
Nothing. My dear friend,
she is better off than you or me.

513
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:58,978
But sudden important obligations
forced her

514
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:01,457
to leave before dawn.

515
01:05:01,537 --> 01:05:03,176
I only caught a glimpse of her

516
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:06,414
while she was climbing
into Mister D'Antoine's carriage.

517
01:05:06,494 --> 01:05:11,411
In this circumstance,
she begged me to come advise you.

518
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:16,849
Or better yet, advise you not to do
anything to find her.

519
01:05:16,928 --> 01:05:19,648
Why did she have to leave?
Who is D'Antoine?

520
01:05:19,727 --> 01:05:23,765
Do not be agitated.
I cannot tell you anything else,

521
01:05:23,845 --> 01:05:27,443
except that the mysterious Enrichetta
is no longer available.

522
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:31,521
An important person,
from a European court,

523
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,480
has full power over her.

524
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,597
D'Antoine is the emissary who came
to take her to her right place.

525
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:41,636
Her place is with me.
I will find her.

526
01:05:41,715 --> 01:05:45,713
I will not lose her, if I have
to face the armies of all of Europe.

527
01:05:48,392 --> 01:05:50,591
Where did she go?

528
01:05:50,671 --> 01:05:54,709
Where is she headed?
Towards the Alps, naturally.

529
01:05:55,308 --> 01:05:57,227
I will leave immediately.

530
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,985
I must find her at all costs.

531
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:05,863
She is my sole, only love.

532
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:11,220
Mister Casanova!

533
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:15,218
I beg you!

534
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:20,656
In my super-human pain
I was anxious to kill myself.

535
01:06:22,055 --> 01:06:24,173
Or bury myself in a cloister.

536
01:06:24,254 --> 01:06:26,212
A monk forever.

537
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,729
I did not choose death,
nor to become a monk.

538
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:36,847
Death, the great friend of generous
and unfortunate spirits.

539
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:42,844
Many years later, in London,
I tried the extreme step.

540
01:06:42,924 --> 01:06:45,243
Guilty of such unhealthy temptation,

541
01:06:45,322 --> 01:06:49,400
was the infamous Charpillon,
and her daughter.

542
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,837
Thief! There were 200 sequins,
the corsets and the silver mirror!

543
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:58,916
I will not tolerate this insinuation.

544
01:06:58,995 --> 01:07:00,715
Take your hands off of me,
you whore!

545
01:07:00,794 --> 01:07:06,151
Me, whore? I did not have the chance
of being one with you, impotent!

546
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:12,748
Exploiter! Damned the day
I accepted you in my home!

547
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:16,226
You and your lies on the stars,
on horoscopes!

548
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:18,425
You and your daughter
are truly damned.

549
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:21,863
You contaminated what was most dear
to me... My health!

550
01:07:21,944 --> 01:07:24,182
Filthy syphilis carriers,
thieves, leaches!

551
01:07:24,262 --> 01:07:27,181
Because of you, I am ruined.
All of London laughs behind my back.

552
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:33,857
You, with that rotten worm between
your legs, infected me!

553
01:07:33,937 --> 01:07:37,695
Enough! Coachman, stop!
Coachman!

554
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:42,293
Let me off, or I'll stab you
with my sword, witches!

555
01:07:42,372 --> 01:07:45,531
We are going to the police station!

556
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:48,090
You will repeat your accusations
to them!

557
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:51,727
Go to hell, you and
your miserable daughter!

558
01:07:51,808 --> 01:07:54,807
Do not touch those bags!
Coachman, leave immediately!

559
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:57,805
Whip those horses if you do not want
Lord Winston to whip you!

560
01:07:57,885 --> 01:07:59,444
Whore!

561
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:01,483
Thief!
Leave me alone!

562
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:05,321
My bag!
Mother, I have it!

563
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,439
Mother, do something!
Mother!

564
01:08:11,078 --> 01:08:13,157
Cowardly bastard.

565
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:17,475
If you take one step,
I will kill you.

566
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:21,912
Damned witches.
Quick, open!

567
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:25,391
May you end your days

568
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:28,509
in the filthiest brothels
of Turkey.

569
01:08:30,908 --> 01:08:33,346
May you be locked up
in the most miserable prisons.

570
01:08:33,426 --> 01:08:34,785
Leave!

571
01:08:36,224 --> 01:08:40,062
Disgusting bitches!
Damned whores!

572
01:08:40,143 --> 01:08:42,302
You dishonor the name of all women!

573
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,419
Away!

574
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:07,128
Why?

575
01:09:11,566 --> 01:09:15,204
You two witches mortified me,
robbed me,

576
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,442
destroyed me... Why?

577
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:22,160
Giacomo,

578
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,677
is it possible that your star
has reached the hour of dawn?

579
01:09:29,076 --> 01:09:31,715
You put up with vile insults,

580
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:34,554
you underwent the worst
humiliation of your life.

581
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:36,872
For the first time,

582
01:09:39,631 --> 01:09:43,149
your senses did not correspond
to your desire.

583
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,545
Eros has abandoned you.

584
01:09:51,945 --> 01:09:55,423
And dark death arises
in front of you.

585
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:09,816
So, if destiny decides,

586
01:10:14,773 --> 01:10:16,332
that I

587
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:20,810
am to face the moment of death,

588
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,807
I shall do so as best suits me.

589
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:31,244
I will go dressed
with my best attire,

590
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,403
the one I wear for festivities.

591
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:36,881
Soon I shall be ready

592
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,439
to enter into the antique courts

593
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,797
of antique men.

594
01:10:46,237 --> 01:10:49,395
In the peace of Limbo,

595
01:10:50,634 --> 01:10:52,593
they will welcome me.

596
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:57,431
I will meet Horace, Dante,

597
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,188
I will converse with Petrarch,

598
01:11:03,028 --> 01:11:04,987
with Ariosto,

599
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:09,824
and with you, Torquato Tasso.

600
01:11:09,905 --> 01:11:13,263
My tender friend whose verses
come to my mind

601
01:11:13,342 --> 01:11:15,261
in this supreme moment.

602
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:55,049
Where are you?

603
01:12:59,646 --> 01:13:01,606
Where are you?

604
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:10,610
The great Mouna!
The queen of whales!

605
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:14,048
Everyone can enter.
The stomach is still warm.

606
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:17,686
A female whale. Look at its
mouth, inviting you to go inside.

607
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:18,646
Are you afraid?

608
01:14:18,725 --> 01:14:22,364
He who does not enter into its
stomach will not find the treasure.

609
01:14:22,444 --> 01:14:25,482
So says the antique book of wisdom.

610
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:30,160
Come and you will see inside
its throat and farther down,

611
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,318
in the stomach
of the great Mouna...

612
01:14:36,316 --> 01:14:40,314
The Mouna is a door
that leads who knows where,

613
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,633
a wall that must be knocked down.

614
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:52,380
The Mouna is a spider-web,
a silk funnel.

615
01:14:52,461 --> 01:14:54,779
The heart of all flowers.

616
01:14:58,257 --> 01:15:02,735
The Mouna is a white mountain
of sugar,

617
01:15:02,934 --> 01:15:06,253
a forest where wolves pass by.

618
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:09,132
It is the carriage
that pulls horses.

619
01:15:19,646 --> 01:15:24,523
The Mouna is an empty whale,
full of air and black with fireflies,

620
01:15:24,643 --> 01:15:26,883
an oven that burns everything.

621
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:37,836
When the time comes, the Mouna
is the face of the Lord, His mouth.

622
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:47,592
The world with its trees came out
of the Mouna.

623
01:15:47,671 --> 01:15:51,389
Clouds, men...
One at a time, all races.

624
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:56,547
Even woman came out of the Mouna.

625
01:15:57,626 --> 01:16:00,785
Hurrah for the Mouna,
the Mouna, the Mouna!

626
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:30,928
Giacomo?

627
01:16:33,648 --> 01:16:34,526
Giacomo.

628
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,084
What are you doing here?

629
01:16:40,523 --> 01:16:43,682
Egard! How strange to meet you.

630
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:47,200
Maybe you can help me. Listen.

631
01:16:47,839 --> 01:16:53,517
"When I am drunk, I know neither
the sky nor the earth.

632
01:16:53,596 --> 01:16:58,194
I lie alone,
immobile in my bed.

633
01:17:00,274 --> 01:17:04,591
Until, in the end,
I forget that I exist.

634
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:10,468
And at that moment
my happiness has no limits."

635
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:16,425
Lung-ho-Tse: a Chinese poet
of the Eighth Century.

636
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:19,663
You travel in lands
that do not exist, Egard.

637
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,702
Oh, Giacomo!

638
01:17:21,782 --> 01:17:24,381
I travel much too,
but in the real world.

639
01:17:24,821 --> 01:17:30,138
But where do your travels,
in the bodies of women, take you?

640
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:33,137
No place.

641
01:17:33,496 --> 01:17:35,655
Something strange happened to me.

642
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,774
Life, having nauseated me,
I wanted to kill myself.

643
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:40,252
I was already inside
the waters of the river,

644
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,411
reciting one of Tasso's sonnets,

645
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:46,729
when I saw an extraordinary woman
pass by. She was over 7 feet tall.

646
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:50,727
She aroused my curiosity. I tried
to follow her, but she disappeared.

647
01:17:50,807 --> 01:17:52,246
And I have lost hope of finding her.

648
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:57,563
You have found her, Giacomo.
She is here.

649
01:17:58,563 --> 01:18:01,761
Princess Hathajaha!

650
01:18:01,841 --> 01:18:06,319
The tallest and strongest woman
in the world!

651
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:08,518
A jug of beer
to who can defeat her!

652
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:11,996
Big John! That is who is needed.
He will defeat her.

653
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:15,194
He will break her in two.
Big John, come. They want you.

654
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:18,473
Big John! Call the apothecaries!

655
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:22,710
Call the surgeon
for your giant woman!

656
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:27,788
Come on. She is not a cannibal!

657
01:18:28,387 --> 01:18:30,306
Who else? Who else?

658
01:18:51,216 --> 01:18:54,254
Whoever is brave,
will fight with the strong woman.

659
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:57,252
Whoever is a coward, will run away!

660
01:18:58,052 --> 01:19:00,811
What do you mean?
Nothing, my lord.

661
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,168
Do not think I said"coward"
to a gentlemen like you,

662
01:19:05,249 --> 01:19:09,726
certainly continental! It is not
possible that you have no honor.

663
01:19:09,806 --> 01:19:12,764
I am the sole custodian of my honor,

664
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:16,643
and I consider any reference to it,
a violation.

665
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:19,361
Do you accept fighting
for a jug of beer?

666
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,599
Keep your beer.
Of course I will fight!

667
01:19:25,038 --> 01:19:29,675
I am a Venetian gentlemen.
I fought against the Turks.

668
01:19:30,675 --> 01:19:32,474
It is my turn, madam.

669
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,549
He will not even get to five!

670
01:20:02,138 --> 01:20:05,096
Let me win. Do not make me give
a bad impression.

671
01:20:06,256 --> 01:20:08,215
Please.

672
01:20:09,015 --> 01:20:11,373
What do you think you are doing?

673
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:14,652
Are you Venetian?
From the mountains.

674
01:21:01,028 --> 01:21:05,465
Who are you, mythological creature?
How did you end up in London?

675
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:12,141
I had a bad marriage.
My husband sold me like an animal.

676
01:21:12,222 --> 01:21:15,300
I was weak
and could not defend myself.

677
01:21:19,578 --> 01:21:23,056
I like it here,
and enjoy the work.

678
01:21:23,136 --> 01:21:25,574
I like the people, good people.

679
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:48,643
Come with me.
This is the fighting tent. See?

680
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:51,041
Tonight she was an earthquake.

681
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,719
She knocked down eight men
that were bigger than you.

682
01:22:07,193 --> 01:22:12,470
The strongest woman in the world
in one minute will become a fury!

683
01:22:16,228 --> 01:22:18,507
Go, Angelina!

684
01:22:21,426 --> 01:22:22,785
One!

685
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:24,943
Two!

686
01:22:27,502 --> 01:22:28,862
Three!

687
01:22:29,342 --> 01:22:30,700
Four!

688
01:22:35,898 --> 01:22:37,857
Angelina, do not eat them!

689
01:22:37,937 --> 01:22:42,375
She is the strongest female in
the world! The queen of the forest.

690
01:22:46,733 --> 01:22:50,931
She won!
She threw eight men on the ground!

691
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:54,568
Hurrah for the queen!
Hurrah for the queen!

692
01:23:01,045 --> 01:23:03,404
I absolutely must see her.

693
01:23:03,484 --> 01:23:04,883
It is forbidden.

694
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,881
Follow me.

695
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:15,757
The opening! Slowly!

696
01:23:25,992 --> 01:23:29,950
You know you should not stop
with people you do not know.

697
01:23:30,309 --> 01:23:32,668
You know nothing about
the evils of the world.

698
01:23:32,748 --> 01:23:37,705
Behind the face of a flower,
you can find a black heart.

699
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:42,943
Remember how we ran that winter
in Hungary?

700
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:46,501
You have long legs and with only
one step, you go where you want,

701
01:23:46,581 --> 01:23:49,939
but Ali' and I have short legs...

702
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:54,217
Luckily, the elephant made
her die of fright!

703
01:23:54,976 --> 01:23:57,615
Good. You put all the dolls
to sleep!

704
01:23:57,695 --> 01:24:00,893
Take off your clothes, Angelina.
The bath is ready.

705
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:06,211
My cape fell!

706
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,250
Good!

707
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:12,328
Another blow like that and
Totonno will become a midget!

708
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,806
The tub is full!

709
01:24:15,725 --> 01:24:18,004
Come, Angelina.
Is it hot?

710
01:24:18,085 --> 01:24:22,122
The other evening you made me sneeze
all night!

711
01:24:22,202 --> 01:24:25,201
Slowly. You will make
the water overflow!

712
01:24:40,113 --> 01:24:43,791
Hold still!
Stop, Angelina.

713
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:48,629
I put my foot in your hair.
Yes, and in my balls!

714
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:53,466
Angelina, sing that song
from your country

715
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:57,104
which makes me nostalgic
about my country.

716
01:25:54,554 --> 01:25:56,873
The horses are ready, Sir.

717
01:26:12,945 --> 01:26:14,904
Everyone has left.

718
01:26:54,163 --> 01:26:56,482
What an unforgettable day!

719
01:26:56,562 --> 01:26:59,880
How exciting that day in Rome
when the Holy Father

720
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:04,197
let me kiss his loving hand
so many times.

721
01:27:04,437 --> 01:27:08,716
On that same evening I was invited
to Lord Talou's patrician building.

722
01:27:08,795 --> 01:27:11,474
He was the English ambassador
to the holy city of Rome.

723
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:17,431
It is him! My handsome Carluccio!

724
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:19,470
Come on, Carluccio!

725
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:30,344
Come on, run!

726
01:27:43,177 --> 01:27:45,216
Come on, handsome!
You can make it!

727
01:27:52,652 --> 01:27:55,851
Carluccio, run as you do
when you run away from the police!

728
01:28:03,287 --> 01:28:06,965
Run, Carluccio!
Run as if I were riding you!

729
01:28:26,915 --> 01:28:30,753
My dear Giacomo,
welcome to Rome.

730
01:28:31,832 --> 01:28:34,551
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

731
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:38,669
This evening we will not play,
at least not with cards!

732
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:42,946
It does not matter, my lord.
Your company pleases me, anyway.

733
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:45,025
Is this magnificent building yours?

734
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:48,183
No. I rented it from the Prince
Del Brando for 100 guineas,

735
01:28:48,264 --> 01:28:50,622
including his hams.

736
01:29:05,135 --> 01:29:07,574
Lord Talou, try to stop them!

737
01:29:07,653 --> 01:29:11,491
I know them. When they drink,
they make you go mad!

738
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:15,250
Lord Talou, he will break his head!
Stop, Rolando!

739
01:29:18,568 --> 01:29:21,646
Take him below and send him away.

740
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,083
That stupid idiot has no balls!

741
01:29:27,923 --> 01:29:32,001
I won!
The competition is over. Carlo won.

742
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,199
Natale, check if the basin
is empty!

743
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,597
The competition is over.
The basin is empty. Carlo won!

744
01:29:39,677 --> 01:29:42,075
You are not giving me a little kiss?

745
01:29:46,513 --> 01:29:49,711
It is embarrassing to admit that
the city where the Holy Father lives

746
01:29:49,792 --> 01:29:52,230
is still like the days
of Trimalcione.

747
01:29:54,549 --> 01:29:58,747
In the Piombi prison,
one could not play certain games,

748
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,265
especially for lack of space.

749
01:30:01,345 --> 01:30:03,384
If I know who
I have the honor of...

750
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,303
I am the Prince Del Brando.

751
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:10,180
Excellency, everyone knows I was
thrown into that miserable prison

752
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:12,540
for noble political causes.

753
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:16,138
I will not even allow a prince
to make certain insinuations

754
01:30:16,217 --> 01:30:18,656
on the injustice I underwent there.

755
01:30:20,216 --> 01:30:23,493
Do not take my joke so seriously!

756
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:25,772
Wine!

757
01:30:27,292 --> 01:30:31,289
I have heard of you, Mister Casanova.
I am your great admirer.

758
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:35,208
If I were a woman, I would not have
hesitated to come to bed with you.

759
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:38,806
I heard many great things
about you!

760
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:41,804
I thank you. The admiration
of such a gentleman like you

761
01:30:41,884 --> 01:30:43,843
makes me undoubtedly proud.

762
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:49,680
Your merits were compared
to those of a stallion,

763
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,118
and sometimes to those
of a less noble animal.

764
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:54,717
What do you mean?

765
01:30:54,797 --> 01:30:57,396
From this point of view, I mean!

766
01:30:57,476 --> 01:31:01,714
Your jokes should be taken seriously,
because they are not humorous.

767
01:31:02,593 --> 01:31:05,552
I will smash this lying pig!

768
01:31:06,471 --> 01:31:11,868
This gentleman from Venice is a poet,
a philosopher, a mathematician,

769
01:31:11,948 --> 01:31:14,507
and is learned in who knows
how many other things.

770
01:31:14,587 --> 01:31:18,185
I know someone who can do better
than you in a certain field.

771
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:20,224
Who?
Righetto.

772
01:31:21,183 --> 01:31:23,142
Where is Righetto?

773
01:31:23,382 --> 01:31:26,901
Find Righetto, my coachman.
Tell him to come here!

774
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:30,778
He is outside, Excellency!
Righetto, come here. They want you.

775
01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:32,217
At your command, Prince.

776
01:31:32,298 --> 01:31:37,455
Righetto, how many times did you
make love last night with Ubaldina?

777
01:31:38,974 --> 01:31:40,853
Come on, answer!

778
01:31:42,332 --> 01:31:44,691
With everyone's respect, 7 times.

779
01:31:48,449 --> 01:31:49,728
He is lying.

780
01:31:49,809 --> 01:31:55,046
Brutal force alone is not capable
of such amorous feats.

781
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:58,044
Only a body supported by cleverness,
intelligence,

782
01:31:58,124 --> 01:32:00,363
and culture can reach such peaks.

783
01:32:00,443 --> 01:32:05,161
I know what I am talking about.
A moral maturity is required,

784
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:09,678
and especially knowledge
of movement of fluids,

785
01:32:09,758 --> 01:32:12,396
of star and planet influences.

786
01:32:12,477 --> 01:32:14,876
Excellent, Giacomo. Excellent.

787
01:32:14,955 --> 01:32:18,673
You convinced everyone
with your eloquence.

788
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:25,430
Why not accept a challenge?
Brutal force against intelligence.

789
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:28,828
The good savage exalted
by that boring Rousseau,

790
01:32:28,908 --> 01:32:31,787
against the gentleman
with style and culture.

791
01:32:33,186 --> 01:32:36,024
What does it mean?
I shall explain.

792
01:32:36,105 --> 01:32:40,183
Righetto and Casanova are invited
to participate in a competition.

793
01:32:40,262 --> 01:32:43,501
Who can do it more times
in an hour, right?

794
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,539
Right!

795
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:50,857
I am very disappointed that you,
such a good host,

796
01:32:50,937 --> 01:32:53,736
should risk the honor
of your guest,

797
01:32:53,815 --> 01:32:57,013
by obliging him in a competition
with a coachman!

798
01:32:57,094 --> 01:33:01,331
Mister Giacomo, do not take Lord
Talou's proposal the wrong way.

799
01:33:01,412 --> 01:33:05,849
On the contrary, it honors you.

800
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:11,486
Why not consider it a competition
between vulgarity and poetry?

801
01:33:12,645 --> 01:33:17,683
I, to begin with,
am convinced that you will win.

802
01:33:18,043 --> 01:33:22,560
Once again, homo sapiens
will defeat primitive man.

803
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:27,797
Madam, your way of...

804
01:33:28,237 --> 01:33:30,516
speaking, of exposing...

805
01:33:30,596 --> 01:33:33,514
However, I am certain
that the victory will be mine.

806
01:33:33,594 --> 01:33:37,312
In any case, it is clear
that I must choose my companion

807
01:33:37,392 --> 01:33:38,111
in this competition.

808
01:33:38,192 --> 01:33:42,750
He is right. He should choose her.
It is his right!

809
01:33:44,748 --> 01:33:47,467
My choice goes to...

810
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:52,184
Romana.

811
01:33:58,861 --> 01:34:02,379
Romana, the most beautiful
model in Rome.

812
01:34:03,859 --> 01:34:07,856
Her generous forms have often
been immortalized on canvas, marble.

813
01:34:07,937 --> 01:34:10,655
Romana, the Venus
of the countryside!

814
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:14,893
Now bring me a basket of eggs,
a bottle of wine from Spain,

815
01:34:14,973 --> 01:34:16,971
ginger, cinnamon, and clover.

816
01:34:17,052 --> 01:34:19,650
My necklace on Casanova!

817
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:25,647
My robust Righetto, will you accept
me as the woman, who, for one hour,

818
01:34:25,727 --> 01:34:29,405
will receive the impulses
of your rustic loins?

819
01:34:30,644 --> 01:34:33,762
May the good Lord
make me worthy, Princess.

820
01:34:33,843 --> 01:34:35,882
Challengers, go to your places,

821
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:40,679
and begin their pleasant,
I hope, trial.

822
01:34:41,958 --> 01:34:47,396
He put eighteen eggs inside!
God protect you and give you health!

823
01:34:47,476 --> 01:34:50,874
Oh! Nineteen!

824
01:34:51,434 --> 01:34:54,192
He is drinking all of them!

825
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:56,910
What do you have inside there?

826
01:34:56,991 --> 01:35:00,109
Where will all those eggs
come out from?

827
01:35:00,189 --> 01:35:03,027
How do you feel?
Flabby, flabby, huh?

828
01:35:03,427 --> 01:35:06,026
What does he want now?

829
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,583
With such an omelet in his stomach!

830
01:35:12,823 --> 01:35:15,541
I bet on you, and I want to win!

831
01:35:19,099 --> 01:35:22,337
Make sure that I win.

832
01:35:23,536 --> 01:35:26,295
If I bet on you,
will you make me win?

833
01:35:29,653 --> 01:35:32,492
I will do everything
to make you win.

834
01:35:32,572 --> 01:35:35,731
The challenge entailing
four testicles is about to begin!

835
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:39,169
A great poet
against a dirty primitive!

836
01:35:39,248 --> 01:35:42,887
Move from there.
It is not something for children.

837
01:35:49,803 --> 01:35:52,801
Is it shaped the way the say?
Go away!

838
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,639
I bet both my horses on Casanova.

839
01:36:09,913 --> 01:36:12,432
Righetto, help me.

840
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:18,108
This for the back
and this for the head.

841
01:36:21,307 --> 01:36:24,585
Righetto, take my shoes off.
Your servant, Princess.

842
01:36:27,544 --> 01:36:29,943
Be silent!

843
01:36:30,022 --> 01:36:33,500
Thirty seconds left!

844
01:36:40,656 --> 01:36:44,574
Shall I get undressed too?
Of course.

845
01:36:47,053 --> 01:36:52,650
Silence, please! The competition
will begin in 20 seconds!

846
01:37:00,686 --> 01:37:03,684
Fifteen seconds left!

847
01:37:09,602 --> 01:37:11,600
Ten seconds!

848
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:15,119
Nine seconds!

849
01:37:16,237 --> 01:37:18,197
Eight seconds!

850
01:37:18,477 --> 01:37:19,836
Seven!

851
01:37:20,636 --> 01:37:22,594
Six seconds!

852
01:37:23,394 --> 01:37:25,113
Five!

853
01:37:25,193 --> 01:37:27,592
Four seconds!

854
01:37:27,672 --> 01:37:29,031
Three!

855
01:37:29,111 --> 01:37:31,070
Two seconds!

856
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:32,469
One second!

857
01:37:32,549 --> 01:37:34,028
Go!

858
01:38:07,052 --> 01:38:09,370
Three! He already did three!

859
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:13,608
How do you feel down there?
Want me to substitute you?

860
01:38:15,367 --> 01:38:19,605
Righetto is very nervous,
but he is calming down now.

861
01:38:19,684 --> 01:38:21,244
He did two!

862
01:38:26,961 --> 01:38:29,200
Three! Righetto, three!

863
01:39:01,743 --> 01:39:04,901
Hurrah for the performance
of the trial!

864
01:39:12,537 --> 01:39:15,536
If you had not won,
I would have mounted you!

865
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,614
Let us bring him in triumph!

866
01:39:28,169 --> 01:39:30,128
Bravo!

867
01:39:30,488 --> 01:39:36,245
Who will let you leave now?
Rome is yours!

868
01:40:03,111 --> 01:40:06,349
I would like to tell you
about a marvelous creature

869
01:40:06,429 --> 01:40:09,987
who my restless spirit
looked for all my life.

870
01:40:13,705 --> 01:40:16,784
I was in Switzerland,
in the antique town of Bern,

871
01:40:16,863 --> 01:40:20,661
a guest of Doctor Moebius,
a famous entomologist.

872
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:26,858
I was looking at his daughters
at work, scientists and seers,

873
01:40:31,455 --> 01:40:34,654
when suddenly a silence
isolated me from everything,

874
01:40:34,734 --> 01:40:38,412
and I was overtaken
by a strange ill feeling.

875
01:43:27,004 --> 01:43:29,363
The miracle took place.

876
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:34,800
Not only am I cured, but I feel much
better and stronger than before.

877
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,519
It is thanks to you,
my adorable scientists.

878
01:43:37,598 --> 01:43:44,355
You made me become ill and
you gave me back the joy of health.

879
01:43:46,034 --> 01:43:48,433
Why do you say we made you ill?

880
01:43:48,513 --> 01:43:50,472
Did I say that?

881
01:43:51,271 --> 01:43:52,631
Strange.

882
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:55,429
I do not know.

883
01:43:56,988 --> 01:43:58,748
Oh, yes. I remember.

884
01:43:59,507 --> 01:44:03,625
Those horrible insects
with those monstrous demon forms

885
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:06,383
that move about without a reason.

886
01:44:07,263 --> 01:44:10,981
Evil!
Evil in its living state.

887
01:44:11,341 --> 01:44:13,340
And you there,
with your big pins...

888
01:44:13,419 --> 01:44:17,257
Seeing both of you piercing
them, one by one... horrible!

889
01:44:17,338 --> 01:44:20,736
Was it as if you were pierced
a thousand times?

890
01:44:20,816 --> 01:44:25,653
Yes. The pain I imagined
was so real on me,

891
01:44:25,734 --> 01:44:27,812
that it overwhelmed me.

892
01:44:29,251 --> 01:44:33,010
I am very sensitive, without a doubt.

893
01:44:33,329 --> 01:44:36,927
I am a creature of elements,
air, water...

894
01:44:37,008 --> 01:44:40,846
And fire, too.
That is what I heard about you.

895
01:44:50,441 --> 01:44:53,039
My God, how beautiful you are.

896
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:57,157
Your gracious smile
is so descreet.

897
01:44:57,237 --> 01:45:00,115
It is like those figures
on Etruscan tombs.

898
01:45:00,195 --> 01:45:02,994
A merry and deathly smile.

899
01:45:03,074 --> 01:45:07,031
Deathly? Is that how you speak
to who saved you from death?

900
01:45:07,112 --> 01:45:11,390
Only to deliver me to another
sweet death, that of love.

901
01:45:11,469 --> 01:45:15,388
I feel that I want to be annulled
inside of you, my wise Minerva.

902
01:45:15,628 --> 01:45:18,106
What a strange man you are,
Giacomo.

903
01:45:18,186 --> 01:45:22,344
You cannot talk about love
without using deathly figures?

904
01:45:22,424 --> 01:45:26,941
The sweetest of deaths. You want
to annul yourself in love...

905
01:45:27,501 --> 01:45:32,019
Maybe there is more to love.
You wish to die?

906
01:45:32,858 --> 01:45:36,776
As late as possible,
enchanting Isabella.

907
01:45:36,857 --> 01:45:40,934
When that moment comes, I want
to be able to squeeze your hand.

908
01:45:41,014 --> 01:45:44,132
Would you like to eat?
Yes?

909
01:46:01,123 --> 01:46:04,961
Isabella, I finally understand
the mysterious evil

910
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:08,120
that struck me in this house,
that brought a light inside of me.

911
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,918
I want a different life,
one in the quiet of my study.

912
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:14,757
I want to give up
my useless, boring freedom

913
01:46:14,836 --> 01:46:17,795
and always be lovingly guided
by you.

914
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:21,913
Say yes, Isabella.
I beg you, my illuminated savior.

915
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:24,631
You are mad, Giacomo.

916
01:46:24,871 --> 01:46:29,788
Maybe you speak like this because
you are still weak from your illness.

917
01:46:29,869 --> 01:46:33,746
Listen to me, Isabella. You cannot
refuse me, or I will be ill again,

918
01:46:33,827 --> 01:46:35,905
and this time, forever.

919
01:46:35,986 --> 01:46:39,503
I was right in saying
that you are made of fire.

920
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:45,301
Tomorrow I am leaving.
Please, Isabella, come with me.

921
01:46:48,818 --> 01:46:50,897
No, it cannot be.

922
01:46:51,537 --> 01:46:56,854
Join me in Dresda.
Dresda? How is that possible?

923
01:46:57,813 --> 01:46:58,773
I...

924
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:06,929
Oh, Giacomo!

925
01:47:07,009 --> 01:47:11,327
Yes, alright.
At the Moors' inn in Dresda.

926
01:47:12,446 --> 01:47:14,005
My life!

927
01:47:49,387 --> 01:47:51,746
A lady is expecting me.
Have you been informed?

928
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:56,184
It is not necessary.
Answer my question.

929
01:47:59,741 --> 01:48:03,020
Is there someone among you
expecting this gentleman?

930
01:48:17,173 --> 01:48:21,610
Isabella, you cannot
have betrayed me.

931
01:48:23,329 --> 01:48:25,488
I know you will come.

932
01:48:26,008 --> 01:48:28,966
I shall wait here
all my life, if need be.

933
01:48:29,486 --> 01:48:31,925
It is not possible!

934
01:48:33,404 --> 01:48:36,322
Look who is here! Giacomo!

935
01:48:38,881 --> 01:48:41,080
You are here, handsome!

936
01:48:43,919 --> 01:48:46,318
There is nothing to laugh about!

937
01:48:46,677 --> 01:48:48,156
Hello, old friend!

938
01:48:48,237 --> 01:48:50,675
He is better than four stallions!

939
01:48:54,673 --> 01:48:58,631
Madam, excuse me. I believe I do not
have the honor of knowing you.

940
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,190
Are you playing precious with me?

941
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:04,188
With Astrodi, the singer,
who once you graciously

942
01:49:04,268 --> 01:49:06,467
gave her your attention.
Madam, please...

943
01:49:06,547 --> 01:49:09,545
Remember in Venice in the home
of the woman with the fat buttocks?

944
01:49:09,625 --> 01:49:13,743
I am doing a theater performance
where the grand duke will attend.

945
01:49:13,823 --> 01:49:16,782
I have an appointment now.

946
01:49:18,221 --> 01:49:22,498
There is a naughty German girl
in the group who will do anything.

947
01:49:22,578 --> 01:49:24,857
There she is! Hey, you!

948
01:49:25,097 --> 01:49:28,056
German girl,
come out from under there!

949
01:49:28,416 --> 01:49:31,374
There is a real gentleman
who wants to meet you.

950
01:49:31,453 --> 01:49:33,772
She is hunchback like the devil.

951
01:49:33,852 --> 01:49:35,732
Wait, look.

952
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:40,689
Pull out your tongue.
Stupid, pull it out!

953
01:49:51,243 --> 01:49:55,361
She is greedy, a"handle eater"!

954
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:02,597
Inn keeper! The best room.

955
01:50:03,077 --> 01:50:04,796
I will spend the night here.

956
01:50:31,103 --> 01:50:34,140
She is an earthquake!
Come see!

957
01:50:38,378 --> 01:50:40,338
Glutton!

958
01:50:57,648 --> 01:51:01,167
Wait! Wait! I shall sit here
so I can see better!

959
01:51:01,406 --> 01:51:04,125
Come out.
You must see everything!

960
01:51:12,201 --> 01:51:15,559
I am falling!
Gisella, give me a hand!

961
01:55:28,906 --> 01:55:30,466
Giacomo.

962
01:55:43,899 --> 01:55:48,456
Do you not recognize me?
I did so immediately,"cabalon"!

963
01:55:48,537 --> 01:55:52,015
Mother! It is really you!

964
01:55:57,212 --> 01:56:00,250
Did you forget that your mother
lives in Dresda?

965
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:05,847
I have 400 thalers retirement money,
thanks to the prince's generosity.

966
01:56:05,928 --> 01:56:07,127
My God protect him!

967
01:56:08,087 --> 01:56:11,964
I knew you were in Saxony...
What are you doing here?

968
01:56:12,045 --> 01:56:13,844
I am here on business.

969
01:56:13,923 --> 01:56:17,202
For a project that the minister
is interested in.

970
01:56:17,282 --> 01:56:21,079
An excellent project, I must say.
An excellent occasion.

971
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:25,797
I see, the usual fables,
the usual nonsense.

972
01:56:25,877 --> 01:56:29,076
You never send a cent
to your poor, old mother!

973
01:56:30,635 --> 01:56:33,793
I did not know your address,
Mother!

974
01:56:33,873 --> 01:56:35,792
You never know anything!
It is true!

975
01:56:35,872 --> 01:56:40,310
I wanted to write to you,
visit you sometimes, but...

976
01:56:40,589 --> 01:56:43,467
And your second husband?
He is dead.

977
01:56:46,466 --> 01:56:49,704
Do you live here in Dresda?
No, I live in the country.

978
01:56:51,824 --> 01:56:54,942
I could come to your house
for a few days.

979
01:56:55,022 --> 01:56:58,300
As long as my business
allows me, but I hope so.

980
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:01,338
In my house, with me?
Yes.

981
01:57:08,654 --> 01:57:10,894
Are you expecting someone,
Mother?

982
01:57:11,093 --> 01:57:15,091
I am waiting to be taken
to the carriage.

983
01:57:15,171 --> 01:57:18,129
My poor legs do not stand up
anymore!

984
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:21,288
I shall come to get you.
I shall take you.

985
01:57:21,368 --> 01:57:23,087
I am coming up.

986
01:57:39,238 --> 01:57:40,598
Mother.

987
01:57:42,357 --> 01:57:44,116
How long it has been!

988
01:57:44,236 --> 01:57:45,995
How are you?

989
01:57:46,635 --> 01:57:48,194
Slowly!

990
01:57:52,112 --> 01:57:54,271
Turn around now.
On the shoulders.

991
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:58,068
Get lower! Get lower!

992
01:58:10,302 --> 01:58:13,820
You are wrong, Mother
in saying I am just a"cabalon".

993
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:17,858
My name is known in all of Europe.

994
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:19,978
I am considered a literary person.

995
01:58:20,137 --> 01:58:22,017
A brilliant business man.

996
01:58:23,735 --> 01:58:26,294
I do not understand German well,
Mother. What are you saying?

997
01:58:26,374 --> 01:58:29,732
You do not understand
or do not want to?

998
01:58:32,651 --> 01:58:36,889
I could find a house in the country,
maybe next to yours.

999
01:58:36,968 --> 01:58:40,727
I have 400 sequins.
I can give you half if you want.

1000
01:58:41,286 --> 01:58:45,204
I intend to stop running around
the world. I am no longer young.

1001
01:58:45,804 --> 01:58:48,283
Do you have news of our relatives?

1002
01:58:48,362 --> 01:58:51,321
I also hope to return to Venice,
as soon as...

1003
01:59:47,292 --> 01:59:50,130
I did not even ask for her address!

1004
01:59:59,205 --> 02:00:02,484
I went to Holland, to Belgium,
to Spain.

1005
02:00:02,923 --> 02:00:05,402
In Oslo, I became seriously ill.

1006
02:00:05,482 --> 02:00:07,361
Finally I reached Wurtemberg,

1007
02:00:07,441 --> 02:00:10,719
which, at the time, was the most
brilliant court of Europe.

1008
02:00:49,459 --> 02:00:53,777
I would like to ask you, madam,
since you wisely influence the duke,

1009
02:00:53,856 --> 02:00:57,694
could you not suggest to him to
offer me the position of ambassador

1010
02:00:57,775 --> 02:01:02,692
to the court of Saxony?
The prince highly respects me.

1011
02:01:37,074 --> 02:01:40,992
I have a letter from his excellency
Cardinal Lowrier.

1012
02:01:41,072 --> 02:01:44,830
He kindly accepted
to recommend me to you.

1013
02:01:44,910 --> 02:01:47,789
I would like to submit
to the attention of your...

1014
02:02:15,574 --> 02:02:18,973
In my country, turtles are a sign
of good luck, Highness.

1015
02:03:12,705 --> 02:03:15,703
Here are the designs
for a new type of fortress

1016
02:03:15,783 --> 02:03:18,141
based on three principles
of Democritus and Leucippus.

1017
02:03:18,222 --> 02:03:20,580
I know that your war
at the borders...

1018
02:04:01,839 --> 02:04:03,478
Observe these seeds, Highness.

1019
02:04:03,557 --> 02:04:07,275
They produce a repulsive
red efflurescence,

1020
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:10,634
but it has miraculous virtues.
It was discovered by a Spanish monk

1021
02:04:10,714 --> 02:04:14,312
who experimented it many times
on himself.

1022
02:04:14,432 --> 02:04:18,590
Nobody in the world could say
that man is over 40,

1023
02:04:18,669 --> 02:04:22,348
but he actually is over one hundred.

1024
02:04:24,867 --> 02:04:27,505
Princess,
I am desperate in my love for you

1025
02:04:27,585 --> 02:04:29,464
but your heart is of iron!

1026
02:04:29,544 --> 02:04:32,263
And your buttocks is of wood!

1027
02:04:34,942 --> 02:04:37,060
Never in my life

1028
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:40,258
have I been so insulted!

1029
02:04:40,858 --> 02:04:43,537
I will no longer permit
that he come before my eyes,

1030
02:04:43,616 --> 02:04:47,175
even if I am in this palace,
and my duty as a guest

1031
02:04:47,255 --> 02:04:50,253
does not allow me to take up
my sword!

1032
02:04:50,333 --> 02:04:53,691
Go away, scoundrels,
back to your sewers!

1033
02:05:05,325 --> 02:05:10,123
My brother, the Duke, says you
frightened Rosalba with your sword.

1034
02:05:10,203 --> 02:05:15,200
That is not good for a Latin
lover of beautiful women as you are.

1035
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,599
Enchanting!

1036
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:20,518
I heard that in Nuremberg
a general had built

1037
02:05:20,597 --> 02:05:26,035
a mechanical chess player,
but this goes beyond any imagination.

1038
02:05:26,875 --> 02:05:30,152
Look! It is perfect!

1039
02:05:30,233 --> 02:05:33,231
One could swear it is real flesh.

1040
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:35,750
The right color.

1041
02:05:36,669 --> 02:05:38,668
It would fool anyone.

1042
02:06:48,071 --> 02:06:51,350
It is very late.
Are you still up?

1043
02:10:20,121 --> 02:10:25,678
I hope you will excuse me,
Madam, for the liberty I took.

1044
02:10:25,758 --> 02:10:29,316
But I so much wish
to see what you are, naturally.

1045
02:10:29,596 --> 02:10:31,555
You do not protest?

1046
02:10:35,792 --> 02:10:38,511
What sort of mad inventor
was your father?

1047
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:44,108
Certainly mad, but a poet,
if he made you so beautiful.

1048
02:10:45,867 --> 02:10:49,465
Did he incestuously possess you?

1049
02:10:51,065 --> 02:10:54,343
You excite me
with your secret silence.

1050
02:10:54,423 --> 02:10:56,942
Will you lie down with me?

1051
02:10:57,021 --> 02:11:01,539
Will you give your delicate
mechanism to my eagerness?

1052
02:11:02,778 --> 02:11:05,097
Yes? Oh, yes!

1053
02:11:11,893 --> 02:11:13,373
You are beautiful, you know?

1054
02:11:14,253 --> 02:11:17,411
Do not refuse.
What is your name?

1055
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:19,569
Oh, Rosalba!

1056
02:11:20,449 --> 02:11:24,167
No, Rosalba. You are called love!
Love!

1057
02:11:26,086 --> 02:11:29,085
That is your name!
Do you know that?

1058
02:11:29,485 --> 02:11:32,523
I have been looking for you forever.

1059
02:11:34,002 --> 02:11:36,601
Beautiful! Child!

1060
02:11:54,792 --> 02:11:57,670
My beautiful devil!

1061
02:12:04,346 --> 02:12:07,305
Love. Give it to me!

1062
02:14:40,465 --> 02:14:43,543
The winter is very long in Bohemia.

1063
02:14:43,623 --> 02:14:48,460
For many years I have been living
in Dux, in the Waldenstein castle.

1064
02:14:48,541 --> 02:14:51,459
I am a librarian for the count.

1065
02:14:51,539 --> 02:14:57,176
An important assignment that
is fit for my studious character,

1066
02:14:57,256 --> 02:14:59,895
for a man of literature.

1067
02:15:25,561 --> 02:15:27,960
Do you feel better this evening?
It is very warm.

1068
02:15:41,713 --> 02:15:45,631
My macaroni!
I want my macaroni!

1069
02:15:45,711 --> 02:15:49,069
I did not prepare macaroni
this evening. No macaroni!

1070
02:15:49,149 --> 02:15:51,868
If you want,
there is goat fried brain.

1071
02:15:51,948 --> 02:15:57,225
I clearly said I want macaroni
on my plate every evening!

1072
02:15:57,304 --> 02:16:00,503
If that is not possible,
the count will be informed.

1073
02:16:00,583 --> 02:16:03,661
There is polenta,
which is almost ready.

1074
02:16:04,701 --> 02:16:06,820
I do not want polenta!

1075
02:16:06,899 --> 02:16:12,377
I cannot stand that my dinner
be disturbed by such people!

1076
02:16:12,457 --> 02:16:16,095
Mister Casanova,
your agreement with the count

1077
02:16:16,175 --> 02:16:19,293
dispenses you from eating
with the servants and the troops.

1078
02:16:20,493 --> 02:16:22,731
Then why do you give us
this honor?

1079
02:16:22,812 --> 02:16:25,890
Listen, Faulkircher.

1080
02:16:25,969 --> 02:16:30,208
Only because of one
of life's cruel turn of events,

1081
02:16:30,287 --> 02:16:33,206
that the two of us met.

1082
02:16:33,326 --> 02:16:37,004
You, a butler,
and I a librarian.

1083
02:16:37,084 --> 02:16:42,441
Respect my solitude and keep away
from me!

1084
02:16:42,521 --> 02:16:44,840
You are a cheating scoundrel!

1085
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:50,317
You take advantage of the count's
absence, but he will find out!

1086
02:16:50,396 --> 02:16:53,116
Also that you practice

1087
02:16:53,195 --> 02:17:00,552
anti-physical attractions
with your Viderol. You disgust me!

1088
02:17:00,631 --> 02:17:04,189
Go ahead and speak
in your vulgar German!

1089
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:06,069
Who understands you?

1090
02:17:06,149 --> 02:17:11,666
I am an artist, a writer.
I do not mingle with certain people.

1091
02:17:11,745 --> 02:17:14,944
He is an artist too,
a very talented actor.

1092
02:17:15,024 --> 02:17:17,423
It disgusts me to talk to you.

1093
02:17:17,502 --> 02:17:20,461
Do not be so arrogant, Casanova.

1094
02:17:20,541 --> 02:17:24,379
You are a servant of the count
of Waldenstein, like us. A servant!

1095
02:17:24,459 --> 02:17:26,737
Disgusting! You are disgusting!

1096
02:17:32,655 --> 02:17:38,092
I received the greatest insult ever,
in this place.

1097
02:17:38,172 --> 02:17:41,970
That portrait has been hung up
with a disgusting substance.

1098
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:45,808
The person responsible is Faulkircher
or his deprived lover Viderol.

1099
02:17:46,167 --> 02:17:50,086
Which of the two furnished
the fecal material, I do not know,

1100
02:17:50,166 --> 02:17:53,244
considering their terrible
relationship

1101
02:17:53,324 --> 02:17:57,162
which easily enables
mixture of that substance.

1102
02:17:57,762 --> 02:18:01,960
Observe.
It is a very similar portrait.

1103
02:18:08,236 --> 02:18:13,873
It was printed as an illustration
in my famous novel"Icosameron".

1104
02:18:14,593 --> 02:18:16,952
Did you read it by chance?

1105
02:18:17,391 --> 02:18:19,510
I will offer you a copy, if I may.

1106
02:18:19,591 --> 02:18:25,787
I think that after my death there
will be talk of me for some time,

1107
02:18:25,867 --> 02:18:31,184
as author of that work.
I am a famous Italian writer.

1108
02:18:37,141 --> 02:18:40,180
You surely know my name.

1109
02:18:42,858 --> 02:18:46,457
Giacomo Casanova from Venice.

1110
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,175
A literary man,

1111
02:18:49,815 --> 02:18:51,374
a philosopher...

1112
02:18:56,172 --> 02:18:59,849
It is not for a whim
that I come to you, Countess,

1113
02:18:59,929 --> 02:19:04,407
but to implore justice
for a poor old man.

1114
02:19:04,807 --> 02:19:11,323
That shady individual, Faulkircher,
and that Viderol

1115
02:19:11,483 --> 02:19:14,681
find many pretexts to torment me.

1116
02:19:14,762 --> 02:19:18,679
They broke the door of the library,
and took away books.

1117
02:19:18,759 --> 02:19:22,918
And they blame me
for their disappearance!

1118
02:19:22,997 --> 02:19:25,556
And I have not eaten macaroni
since Wednesday!

1119
02:19:26,475 --> 02:19:30,594
These unpleasant happenings
disturb my activity as writer.

1120
02:19:30,873 --> 02:19:33,312
What should I do, Countess?

1121
02:19:34,871 --> 02:19:39,429
When my son returns,
he will take care of everything.

1122
02:19:43,746 --> 02:19:49,064
There is a crane
above the wood-shack roof.

1123
02:20:08,134 --> 02:20:10,772
I want you to meet Giacomo Casanova,

1124
02:20:11,572 --> 02:20:15,449
an Italian adventurer
who there has been much talk about.

1125
02:20:22,446 --> 02:20:24,005
Giacomo!

1126
02:20:24,804 --> 02:20:29,443
Come. We are waiting for you.
My friends want to hear you.

1127
02:20:29,522 --> 02:20:31,761
Recite something.

1128
02:24:14,324 --> 02:24:15,684
Venice!

1129
02:24:20,201 --> 02:24:23,080
Will I ever return to Venice?

1130
02:24:26,838 --> 02:24:28,397
The other night...

1131
02:24:31,116 --> 02:24:32,555
I had a dream...

1132
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:01,460
Isabella.

1133
02:25:02,305 --> 02:26:02,556

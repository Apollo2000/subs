2
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,665
- To a wonderful film. You were great.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:52,900
- What a romantic you are.
- To the agency and my little protege.

4
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:54,909
Bless you.
Thank you, daddy.

5
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,511
Eight years at Berlitz,
that's what you learn?

6
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,414
He learned chin the first month
and then chin-chin.

7
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,350
Am I right?

8
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:05,855
I can't be clever.

9
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:08,016
It was really beautiful,
what you guys did.

10
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:12,029
It was beautiful,
and you guys are great.

11
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:13,462
I love the food here.

12
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:18,027
The nicest thing about the film
is that we get to handle guns.

13
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:20,038
- I had never done that.
- Peter.

14
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:21,540
- Very rare.
- What?

15
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:24,042
- How are you?
- Wow. Ben, how are you?

16
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,045
Outstanding, sir.

17
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:31,648
Excuse me.
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum.

18
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,984
- Of course.
- How are you?

19
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:35,819
- Sheila.
- Ladies.

20
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,486
- Hi, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:44,263
I'm a big fan of your writing.
I thought Bay of Pigs was great.

22
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:48,796
Actually, I didn't write it,
I just got the credit. I was fired.

23
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:53,334
Didn't I talk to you a couple
of years ago when you both worked...

24
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:56,849
- at MGM with Laddie?
- That's right, by God.

25
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,852
So are you still at ICM?

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,016
- I'm at TriStar.
- You're at TriStar.

27
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,858
- You'll have to say hello to Mike.
- I will.

28
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,390
He's not there anymore,
but I'll hunt him down.

29
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:15,370
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

30
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,202
- Please?
- Be right back.

31
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:20,836
Hold the fort, kiddo.
I have my own office this way.

32
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,437
- What is the matter with him?
- He's sick.

33
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,814
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

34
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:30,652
This is the last time. I promise.
I just need some cash tonight.

35
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:34,717
- How are you?
- I lost my credit cards.

36
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,662
The money will be on your desk
first thing in the morning.

37
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:41,669
How's the new one coming along?
I hear you got Dickie Gere.

38
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:45,503
- That is great, man.
- I got everybody in the movie.

39
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:48,510
Look, you're sick.

40
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:51,012
This is all I have in cash.

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,676
Please, don't drink it in here.

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,788
- Man.
- That's fine, Peter.

43
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:01,348
I'll messenger it over to you
in the morning.

44
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:04,362
I don't want it.

45
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,697
I think it would be the best thing
if you don't contact me again.

46
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:21,473
- What's your name?
- Terri.

47
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,486
- Terri, I am going to buy you a drink.
- I'm okay. Thanks.

48
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,689
Bud, please. Buy the lady a drink
and another one for you.

49
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,093
I'm Benjamin. Ben.

50
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,498
Benny Goodman, that's me.
I think you're sexy. That's right.

51
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:40,004
Look at those eyes.
Sexy like a kitty cat.

52
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:42,166
You turn me on

53
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,337
You're not too tall
You're not too short

54
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,176
You're not too round

55
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:51,878
You're like a cat
The cat in the hat

56
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,353
Look at those eyes.
Honest to God.

57
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:57,017
You're luminescent, baby.
What?

58
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:00,859
- You've been drinking all day.
- Of course.

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,525
Speaking of drinks,
here is yours.

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,033
- Thanks.
- Down that hatch.

61
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:07,537
And here is mine.
Cheers. Come on.

62
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:11,041
There we go.
Let's do it to it.

63
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:19,377
I just thought
of an amazing concept.

64
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,579
What do you say
we finish these...

65
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:24,716
and we go back
to my apartment on the beach!

66
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,124
I'll throw a movie in the VCR...

67
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:30,062
and mix you up
a gooey blender drink.

68
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:31,463
Sound good? Sound sexy?

69
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,783
Bud, give me another.

70
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,859
I really wish you'd come home with me.
You're so cute.

71
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,727
I'm really good in bed too.
Believe me.

72
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,867
And you smell great...

73
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:06,874
and you look great
and your hair's great.

74
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:15,114
Look, I've got to wake up early
in the morning.

75
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:18,713
I have to go. Thank you.

76
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,493
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

77
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,967
Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much.

78
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:43,810
That's it, pal.
We're closing up now.

79
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,854
I'm gonna finish this.

80
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:19,589
Hey, Mr. Erection,
you want a date?

81
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,896
The room is 20.
You pay for it.

82
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,670
But only because I think...

83
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:33,045
that the concept of surrender...

84
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:37,712
fits with the big picture right now.

85
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,519
Hey, get outta the street!

86
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:55,371
I don't remember
if I started drinking...

87
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,206
because my wife left me or...

88
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,546
my wife left me
'cause I started drinking.

89
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,551
Fuck it anyway!

90
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:04,590
Next, please.

91
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,800
One moment, sir.

92
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:20,232
Sign the back
of the check, please.

93
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:26,807
- Can't you just cash it as it is?
- Is there a problem?

94
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,758
I'm a little shaky right now.

95
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,438
I had brain surgery.

96
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:49,603
I'll go get some lunch,
and then I'll come back...

97
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:52,169
and take care of it then.

98
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,285
Next I'll have a gin and tonic.

99
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,295
Do you know what time it is?

100
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:09,797
You should be drinking coffee.

101
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,632
You're a young guy.

102
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:18,975
It's none of my business...

103
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:23,313
but if you could see
what I see...

104
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:25,819
you wouldn't be doing this
to yourself.

105
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,766
I understand
what you're saying.

106
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,597
I appreciate your concern.

107
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:43,066
It's not my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

108
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:49,614
Please, serve me today,
and I'll never come in here again.

109
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,776
If I do, you can 86 me.

110
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,786
Stop fucking with me!

111
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,290
I can 86 you anytime I want to.

112
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:15,813
I don't give a fuck what you do.

113
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,907
That one's on the house, son.

114
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,815
Were you in Los Angeles
for the earthquake?

115
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:23,184
- It was pretty scary.
- Did you have a lot of damage?

116
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:26,817
- Just a little bit.
- Are you desirable?

117
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:29,590
Are you irresistible?

118
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:32,929
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me,
it would help.

119
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,529
If you kissed me, and I could taste
the sting in your mouth, it would help.

120
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:39,301
If you drank bourbon with me naked...

121
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:43,243
if you smelled of bourbon
as you fucked me, it would help.

122
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:46,408
It would increase
my esteem for you...

123
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:51,217
if you poured bourbon on your naked body
and said to me, "Drink this."

124
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:56,387
If you spread your legs and you had
bourbon dripping from your breasts...

125
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:00,262
and your pussy and said,
"Drink here"...

126
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:03,461
then I could
fall in love with you.

127
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:06,974
Because then I would have a purpose:
To clean you up.

128
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:11,375
And that would prove...

129
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,813
that I'm worth something.

130
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:19,480
I'd lick you clean so that you could
go away and fuck someone else.

131
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,490
Our business is
to make our customers happy.

132
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,522
Next, please.

133
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:28,865
I am back.

134
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:32,734
I've got my check,
and, baby, I'm ready to sign.

135
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:37,603
There.

136
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:42,006
Steady as a fucking rock.
Excuse my French.

137
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,111
Want to have dinner with me?

138
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:51,117
But what's the back end like?

139
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:54,493
By the time we're through
with P and A...

140
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,431
the "above the line"
is gonna take it to about 15.

141
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:00,471
With something like this,
what would Disney think?

142
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,973
Messages.

143
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,306
What did Diller say?

144
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:10,141
Listen, I'm very busy.
Just kidding.

145
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:12,810
Can I call you back on this?

146
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:15,320
Ciao for now.

147
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,823
Could somebody fix the phones
around here?

148
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:20,224
- Good morning.
- Mr. Simpson's looking for you.

149
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:22,195
He wants you to go in
as soon as you get...

150
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:30,433
- Are you all right?
- Outstanding.

151
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:36,275
But I have to go
to a very important meeting.

152
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:38,781
Could make a couple million
for the company.

153
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,624
What?

154
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,464
You should go in there now.

155
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,476
- Hi, Bill.
- Take a seat.

156
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,188
We're gonna let you go.

157
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:40,283
This is too generous, Bill.

158
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:48,757
We really liked having you around,
but you know how it is.

159
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,460
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:58,143
What are you gonna do now?

161
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,643
I thought...

162
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,657
I thought
I'd move out to Las Vegas.

163
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:40,126
My name is Yuri Botsov.

164
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,287
Where you from, Yuri?

165
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:45,856
You sure don't sound like you come
from around these parts.

166
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,459
That is very true.

167
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:50,938
Very good observation.
I am from Latvia.

168
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,605
Very tough place.

169
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:58,136
I hear this,
but I am not a tough man.

170
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:02,619
I am a humble man who is here to learn
from my friends in the New World.

171
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:29,112
This must be Yuri's friend.

172
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:32,917
Sera is my gift to you all.

173
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,452
You will find her a very willing girl
for each of you...

174
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,621
just as we arranged.

175
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:45,370
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

176
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,150
Do you wanna watch?

177
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,317
Are you scared?

178
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,495
It's all right.

179
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,165
It's okay.

180
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:21,508
I bring out the best
in the men who fuck me.

181
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:24,178
It's not easy,
but I'm very good.

182
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,781
It's amazing. I haven't worked
for a really long time...

183
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,453
and I can just turn on a dime.

184
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,723
I can just become
who they want me to be.

185
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:35,460
I walk into that room,
I know right away...

186
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,798
this is their fantasy,
and I become it.

187
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,137
I'm that service.
I perform it, and I perform it well.

188
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,641
I'm an equation mostly.

189
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,978
Thirty minutes of my body
costs $300.

190
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,314
That's just to get into the room.

191
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:54,822
It's about $500 after that.
We negotiate.

192
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,621
But it's a performance.

193
00:18:57,693 --> 00:19:00,218
It's definitely a performance.

194
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:03,994
I am very pleased with how
you've moved up in the world.

195
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:07,765
It is, after all,
a glamorous world I showed you.

196
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:15,173
Why did you leave me
in Los Angeles?

197
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,685
Because you are sly.

198
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,856
You knew there was more money
here in Las Vegas.

199
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:30,857
You don't need to fear me, Sera...

200
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,197
because we belong together.

201
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,701
Don't we?

202
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:51,519
- Are you lonely?
- I am lonely, Yuri.

203
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,354
So am I.

204
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,034
Janek, we called you last night!

205
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:26,335
There was no one home.

206
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:32,178
We're 30 miles
outside of Las Vegas.

207
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:37,209
Someone saw him there yesterday.

208
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:44,084
No, this is the end of it!

209
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:48,657
Yuri knew what he was doing.

210
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,199
That was a red light.

211
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,204
I walk, you stop.

212
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,405
Are you sorry?

213
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:26,444
Good.

214
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:51,464
Three towels in each room
and a complimentary bar of soap.

215
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:56,503
If you run out of soap,
you can buy an extra bar.

216
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:59,141
Feel free to use our pool,
but use it at your own risk.

217
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:02,346
- There are three towels in your room.
- Do you have vacancies?

218
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,857
We do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

219
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:09,862
Linens are provided for you.
Rooms are $29 a night.

220
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,027
You pay at the beginning of each week.
Maid service is optional.

221
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:23,873
Maid service is optional.
It costs $3.50 a day.

222
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:27,042
Feel free to use the pool,
but use it at your own risk.

223
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:29,211
We don't have a lifeguard.

224
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:34,225
No kids, no pets and no guests
after 11:00 at night.

225
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,227
You've been provided
with three towels.

226
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:40,232
We expect when you check out
there will still be three towels.

227
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,134
There's a complimentary
bar of soap.

228
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:46,995
I walked into the room,
and he was lying on the bed.

229
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:50,339
He had his arms
behind his head...

230
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,847
and there was
just hair everywhere.

231
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,713
He was really, really fat.

232
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:59,117
He had a large erection.

233
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:03,818
I remember he was so proud
of his large erection.

234
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,966
I asked him where my money was,
and he pointed to the dresser.

235
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:14,801
And then I asked him
what he wanted...

236
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:20,312
and he said,
"Lie down, I'm on top."

237
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,819
He started pounding me
really hard.

238
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:30,991
I had to bite my tongue
to keep from crying.

239
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:36,658
He did that for awhile,
and then I started to get up.

240
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:41,500
He pushed me back down,
and he held my hair.

241
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:47,011
He was pulling it,
and he stuck his penis in my mouth.

242
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:52,608
I tried to get up again,
and he said...

243
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:57,680
"Stay there, baby,
I'm gonna come on your face."

244
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:01,284
So he did.

245
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:05,298
Then he rubbed his semen
all over my face and in my hair.

246
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:13,567
Then he kicked me off the bed
and told me to leave.

247
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:48,407
- Are you working?
- What do you mean? I'm walking.

248
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:51,454
Just wait one second.

249
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:53,822
Great ass!

250
00:26:57,395 --> 00:27:00,922
- Want some?
- Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?

251
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,270
That's pretty funny.

252
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:09,934
I wonder if you'll take $250
to fuck me?

253
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:15,281
That is, if you'll come
to my room for one hour...

254
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:17,614
I will give you $500.

255
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,957
- You're pretty drunk.
- Not really.

256
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,585
My room's not far.
It's The Whole Year Inn.

257
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:29,723
You could drive with me if you want
or we could walk.

258
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,434
Or I could give you cab fare.

259
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:34,095
- In the car.
- Whatever you want.

260
00:27:34,172 --> 00:27:36,606
Why don't you give me the money
in the car?

261
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:46,779
I'm Ben.

262
00:27:47,354 --> 00:27:49,117
I'm Sera.

263
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:02,061
Sarah with an "H"?

264
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,739
With an "E." S-e-r-a.

265
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,583
You wanna start the engine?

266
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,775
What this room needs
is more booze.

267
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:38,773
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

268
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:43,051
Want a drink?
I'm having one.

269
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,783
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila,
if you can spare it.

270
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:14,547
Your drink's here.

271
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,437
For 500 bucks, you can do
pretty much whatever you want.

272
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:30,305
- You can fuck my ass.
- Oh, my God.

273
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:36,179
You can come on my face.
Whatever you want to do.

274
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,949
Just keep it out of my hair.
I just washed it.

275
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:07,044
Just because my feet
were too big in the morning

276
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,489
Just because I can't remember
your mother's name

277
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:17,987
Just because I put the octopus
in the bed

278
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:22,901
Just because, because
because, because Bill Cosby

279
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:28,767
You wanna fuck now?

280
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,953
Maybe something to drink first.
More tequila?

281
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:38,412
Whatever.

282
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:19,034
What's the story?
Are you too drunk to come?

283
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:24,138
I don't care about any of that.

284
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:33,981
There's time left.
You can have more money.

285
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,991
You can drink all you want.

286
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,154
Just stay.
That's what I want.

287
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,259
I want you to talk or listen.

288
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,826
Just stay.

289
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,126
So, Ben with an "N"...

290
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:11,359
what brings you to Las Vegas?

291
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:12,958
Business convention?

292
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:26,341
I came here
to drink myself to death.

293
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:29,321
Cashed in all my money...

294
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:33,323
paid my American Express card...

295
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:35,485
gonna sell the car tomorrow.

296
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:42,166
How long is it gonna take
for you to...

297
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,670
drink yourself to death?

298
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:53,439
I think about four weeks.

299
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:56,007
I don't know for sure,
but I think.

300
00:32:56,086 --> 00:33:01,855
I got enough
for about 250, $300 a day.

301
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:03,861
That should do it.

302
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:08,195
What am I? A luxury?

303
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:14,904
You're a luxury,
and your meter just ran out.

304
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:17,136
That's a nice watch.

305
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,680
You do like it?

306
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:25,810
You can talk
a little bit more.

307
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:28,152
I don't have to be anywhere.

308
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:30,992
Talk.

309
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:34,655
In Los Angeles...

310
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:39,694
I kept running out of booze
and the store would be closed...

311
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,900
because I forget
to look at my watch.

312
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:50,013
I used to live in Los Angeles.

313
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:56,754
But I don't anymore.

314
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,023
I think the tough times
are finally behind me.

315
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:09,328
There'll always
be bad things, but...

316
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,738
my life is good.

317
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:15,242
It is as I want it to be.

318
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:21,049
It's good.

319
00:34:24,324 --> 00:34:28,454
It's good being here with you.

320
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,508
Shit.

321
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:09,372
Hey, Bill.
How are you?

322
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:27,498
Is this a full night's work?

323
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:31,995
I'm really sorry.

324
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,268
It was such a slow night,
and I couldn't score.

325
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:42,678
What do you think?

326
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,720
You're just a 16-year-old girl
on Hollywood Boulevard?

327
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:48,689
Is that what you think?
Is that what you play?

328
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:03,865
Here.

329
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:09,580
Go ahead.

330
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,167
I could kill you, Sera.

331
00:36:37,582 --> 00:36:40,176
You work tonight,
and you bring me the money.

332
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:42,379
It doesn't matter how late.

333
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:45,856
I will.

334
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:52,858
He cut me a couple of times.

335
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:57,530
He'd always say,
"Never on the face."

336
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,407
So, he cut me right here.

337
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:07,715
He cried...

338
00:37:07,784 --> 00:37:12,984
and I felt sorry for him.

339
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:15,322
In his mind,
I'd done something bad...

340
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:18,989
but in my mind
I hadn't done anything bad.

341
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:21,158
He's kind of paranoid.

342
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,648
This ring is a ruby.
It's my lucky ring.

343
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:37,345
This watch is real gold.
It's not plated.

344
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,786
It's the real thing.
Feel how heavy it is.

345
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:44,816
- These rings, $3,000.
- One thousand.

346
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,888
One thousand?
Look what you're getting.

347
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,128
It's a ruby. It's my lucky ring.
It's a beautiful thing.

348
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:54,366
I can put that in.
Two thousand dollars.

349
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,378
- I can't give you more than a thousand.
- But I just added the ring.

350
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,607
- Synthetic ruby.
- Look...

351
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,946
What can I do for you?

352
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,952
Five hundred.

353
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:21,967
Five hundred dollars
for a 1993 Rolex Daytona watch.

354
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,475
I'll do it.

355
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:33,850
- How are you doin'?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

356
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,520
Are you here for the convention?

357
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,619
I didn't think I was that obvious.

358
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:48,301
- It was just a wild guess.
- My name's Paul, honey.

359
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:53,868
- Vodka Seven.
- And for the lady?

360
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:56,435
- Are you ready for another one?
- Sure.

361
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,709
- I'll have a margarita.
- Good choice.

362
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,516
Are you alone?

363
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:07,318
Or are you using me
to make someone jealous?

364
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:10,362
Alone. I'm here alone.

365
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:13,463
Thank you.

366
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,636
Cheers.

367
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:21,667
Where are you staying?

368
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,008
Right here at the hotel.
Why?

369
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:28,009
I thought
you might be looking for a date.

370
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:31,520
"A date"?
What are you, a hooker?

371
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:34,114
What exactly do you mean
by a date?

372
00:39:34,192 --> 00:39:36,353
I got a wife waiting
for me at home.

373
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:40,364
- I just came over to talk.
- I'm sorry. I guess I misunderstood.

374
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:43,197
- I guess you did.
- Just keep your voice down.

375
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,533
I won't bother you again.

376
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:49,269
Here, have another one on me.

377
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,867
Christ.

378
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:57,380
Maybe you should give it a miss
for tonight.

379
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:09,493
I don't know, it's just...

380
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:13,560
I really like this guy.
I've never felt anything...

381
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:19,411
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

382
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:22,480
It's weird.
I feel kind of confused about it.

383
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,982
We were with each other
only one night...

384
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,246
but I felt like
the relationship...

385
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,587
I felt like there was
a relationship being formed.

386
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:33,627
I was kind of scared.

387
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:39,096
I don't think
I should see him again.

388
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:42,167
But I look for him.

389
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:48,169
I went out last night.
I was looking for him.

390
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,993
Where's your car?

391
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,629
I sold it this morning.

392
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:14,342
I'm gonna take cabs from now on.

393
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:21,345
What's it tonight?
Another 500 to watch you sleep?

394
00:41:27,492 --> 00:41:30,951
- What's up?
- I was looking for you tonight.

395
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:34,932
I don't know
if you have a boyfriend...

396
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,765
or a girlfriend...

397
00:41:37,837 --> 00:41:41,774
but, if you have
some free time...

398
00:41:41,842 --> 00:41:46,439
I thought maybe
we could get some dinner.

399
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,850
Are you serious?

400
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:55,321
I think you know I'm serious.

401
00:41:57,694 --> 00:42:02,962
I'll pay you if you like,
but I just want to see you.

402
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:17,579
I can't have dinner with you.

403
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:24,917
We could get prime rib.

404
00:42:26,662 --> 00:42:29,757
They've got it on sale for $2.99.

405
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:36,272
I love that dress.

406
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,425
I had a really good night.

407
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,107
I think things
are finally picking up.

408
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:36,200
We made so much money.
Look.

409
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:37,939
Come here.

410
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,975
Now listen.
Do you hear?

411
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:07,472
They're talking about me.

412
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:26,602
Are you all right?

413
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:36,915
Get out.

414
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:50,024
Do not come back here.
I'll not see you again.

415
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,640
Do you still wanna have dinner?

416
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,455
I think I put too much salt on it.

417
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:46,131
- It's not good.
- It's good.

418
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:59,318
- Why are you a drunk?
- Why am I a drunk?

419
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:01,911
Is that really
what you want to ask me?

420
00:47:07,729 --> 00:47:12,326
Then this is our first date
or our last.

421
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:14,835
Until now,
I wasn't sure it was either.

422
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,839
First.

423
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:22,846
It's our first.

424
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,807
I just wanna know.

425
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,513
Why are you killing yourself?

426
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:32,956
Interesting choice of words.

427
00:47:35,028 --> 00:47:40,126
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

428
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,669
Is your drinking a way
to kill yourself?

429
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:46,441
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

430
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,678
Shoot.

431
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:55,650
Can I have another one?

432
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:21,304
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

433
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:49,445
Good night.

434
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:57,320
- I had the most wonderful...
- Why don't you stay at my place tonight?

435
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:02,386
Look, you're pretty drunk.

436
00:49:02,465 --> 00:49:08,336
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

437
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,896
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

438
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:14,741
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

439
00:49:16,714 --> 00:49:21,175
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

440
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:25,156
We'll talk about it tonight
at my place.

441
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:30,395
I'm not much good in the sack.

442
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:34,468
It's not about sex.

443
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:36,970
I'll make you up a bed
on the sofa.

444
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,601
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

445
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,612
As you know,
I am my own boss.

446
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,208
Do it, Ben.

447
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:57,322
I'll do it.

448
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:20,682
This is the home of an angel.

449
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:25,691
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

450
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,194
You look extremely beautiful.

451
00:50:33,439 --> 00:50:35,304
I do?

452
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:54,896
It's really weird because...

453
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:56,728
you know...

454
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,564
it's just like
this thing's happening...

455
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:01,571
really quickly.

456
00:51:03,307 --> 00:51:05,868
I just don't know
what's going on.

457
00:51:05,944 --> 00:51:09,744
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

458
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:14,185
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

459
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,849
And it's just...

460
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:19,518
It's all happening really quickly.

461
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:23,530
I just felt like
we've been together for a long time.

462
00:51:23,598 --> 00:51:26,693
It just felt so easy...

463
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:30,034
and I felt like...

464
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:32,541
I felt like I was me.

465
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:35,043
I didn't feel like I was...

466
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,044
trying to be somebody else.

467
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:05,675
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

468
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,683
What do you mean?

469
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:15,352
I think you should go
and bring all your stuff over here.

470
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:26,472
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

471
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,907
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

472
00:52:32,313 --> 00:52:37,547
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

473
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,988
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

474
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:45,153
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

475
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:52,503
Right now I feel really good.

476
00:52:55,541 --> 00:53:00,605
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

477
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,946
But that won't last forever.

478
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:13,225
All right,
you go back to your motel.

479
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:17,130
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

480
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:24,699
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash...

481
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:27,244
to take the taste
of come out of my mouth.

482
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:33,875
I'm tired of being alone.
That's what I'm tired of.

483
00:53:56,046 --> 00:53:58,981
Don't you like me, Ben?

484
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:05,790
What you don't understand is...
No. See? No.

485
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:07,553
What?

486
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:16,536
You can never, never...

487
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:19,038
ask me to stop drinking.

488
00:54:20,608 --> 00:54:23,339
Do you understand?

489
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:27,879
I do.

490
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:29,680
I really do.

491
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:54,145
I'm nuts about you.

492
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,718
We didn't know...

493
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,286
- whether to call the police.
- He has been here about half an hour.

494
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:39,631
- I know that...
- Mickey had seen you two together.

495
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,969
I wasn't opening the door.
I don't know who, I don't know where...

496
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,305
I don't know what,
I don't know whatever these days.

497
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:51,975
He's my friend. I'm sorry.
He must have had too much to drink.

498
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:56,818
That's why I had him patch the key code.
Because he's not gonna do it.

499
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:58,653
I'll help him inside.
Thank you so much.

500
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,819
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No trouble.

501
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:04,331
You just give me a call
if you need any help.

502
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:07,095
Ben, can you wake up?

503
00:56:12,408 --> 00:56:16,607
We gotta go inside,
but I have some presents for you.

504
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,170
Up we go.

505
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,780
- Here we go.
- This is Mrs. Van Houten.

506
00:56:22,854 --> 00:56:24,481
This is Ben.

507
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:26,114
Outstanding, sir.

508
00:56:26,191 --> 00:56:28,955
All right.
Here we go.

509
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:30,791
- You're okay?
- I'm fine.

510
00:56:30,864 --> 00:56:33,628
- Good.
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

511
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,636
- Thank you for being so nice.
- Sure.

512
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:39,639
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

513
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,509
Sorry.
I was miles away.

514
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:48,649
The gifts.

515
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:53,656
I love that name.

516
00:56:57,395 --> 00:57:01,331
Before we proceed onwards,
there's something I have to say.

517
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:10,335
I've come this far.
Here I am, in your house.

518
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:16,073
- Let me pay this month's rent.
- Why?

519
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:18,676
Because...

520
00:57:19,755 --> 00:57:22,883
Because it's better for me
that way.

521
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:34,567
I'll tell you right now...

522
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:36,800
I'm in love with you.

523
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:46,011
But, be that as it may,
I am not here...

524
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:50,854
to force my twisted soul
into your life.

525
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,325
I know that.

526
00:57:53,394 --> 00:57:56,159
We both know I'm a drunk.

527
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,326
And I know you're a hooker.

528
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:04,332
I hope you understand
that I'm a person...

529
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:07,002
who is totally
at ease with this...

530
00:58:07,078 --> 00:58:11,311
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

531
00:58:11,383 --> 00:58:13,510
I do.

532
00:58:13,585 --> 00:58:17,647
It simply means I trust
and accept your judgment.

533
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,791
I was really worried
about how that would be...

534
00:58:22,863 --> 00:58:25,627
but now I'm not.

535
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:33,138
But you should know that included
with the rent around here...

536
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,336
is a complimentary blow job.

537
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,582
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

538
00:58:44,055 --> 00:58:45,989
Whatever that means.

539
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:51,755
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

540
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:56,835
All right.

541
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:00,507
Open this one first.

542
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:11,845
Very nice.

543
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,858
This should go very nicely
with my suit...

544
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:19,122
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing...

545
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:22,633
I brought over
from the motel with me.

546
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:25,363
Right.
The suitcase was clinking.

547
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:27,303
What did you do
with your clothes?

548
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:31,401
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral...

549
00:59:31,478 --> 00:59:34,311
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

550
00:59:34,381 --> 00:59:37,476
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair of jeans...

551
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:42,752
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

552
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,658
That's nice talk, Ben.
Keep drinking.

553
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:51,326
Between the 101-proof breath
and the occasional drool...

554
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:54,166
some interesting words
fall from your mouth.

555
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:25,299
It looks like
I'm with the right girl.

556
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:31,113
I'm very impressed
you would buy this for me.

557
01:00:35,988 --> 01:00:38,650
I'm gonna fill it right now.

558
01:00:40,225 --> 01:00:42,160
Do you want
to go gambling tonight?

559
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:46,996
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

560
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:50,999
I hadn't planned to gamble...

561
01:00:51,073 --> 01:00:53,337
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money...

562
01:00:53,408 --> 01:00:58,676
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

563
01:00:58,748 --> 01:01:01,239
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

564
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:08,525
Then come.

565
01:01:50,576 --> 01:01:52,009
I'm sorry.

566
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:56,113
I love you.

567
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:16,536
- You got a 13.
- Hit me.

568
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:20,304
- Wait. She's got a seven.
- I don't know. You tell me.

569
01:02:20,378 --> 01:02:24,839
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

570
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:52,339
You got it.
You can do it.

571
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,852
Wait a minute!
Really? Oh, man!

572
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:57,352
- What?
- He's okay.

573
01:02:57,421 --> 01:02:59,856
Do you want anything?

574
01:02:59,924 --> 01:03:05,022
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

575
01:03:05,097 --> 01:03:06,860
What?

576
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:13,201
Fuck you! Fuck!
You fucker!

577
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:22,315
That boy is...
You can't judge me!

578
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:25,980
You! I am his father!

579
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:27,488
Get up!

580
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:32,157
Let's go, guys.

581
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,383
How are you?

582
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:23,893
Very well.

583
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,231
I never expected
to have to ask this again...

584
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:32,566
but how did our evening go?

585
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:39,078
I remember getting
to the casino.

586
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:45,913
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

587
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:49,416
And then playing blackjack...

588
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:51,585
and then security came.

589
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:56,292
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

590
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:59,598
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street...

591
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,630
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

592
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:07,042
That's impressive.

593
01:06:07,113 --> 01:06:09,047
How did you do that?

594
01:06:11,952 --> 01:06:14,386
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

595
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:18,550
and that I would take you home...

596
01:06:20,061 --> 01:06:23,498
and that we would never
go in there ever again.

597
01:06:28,605 --> 01:06:30,539
"We"?

598
01:06:42,354 --> 01:06:44,687
That's amazing.

599
01:06:44,757 --> 01:06:46,816
What are you?

600
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:52,696
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

601
01:06:55,036 --> 01:06:57,368
How can you be so good?

602
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,378
I don't know
what you're saying.

603
01:07:07,718 --> 01:07:10,779
I'm just using you.

604
01:07:10,855 --> 01:07:13,221
I need you.

605
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:20,723
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

606
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:26,095
You go back to sleep...

607
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:30,234
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

608
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:33,839
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

609
01:07:50,335 --> 01:07:52,964
Ben, I'm working tonight.

610
01:07:56,676 --> 01:07:58,269
I know.

611
01:08:15,031 --> 01:08:18,968
I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

612
01:08:19,036 --> 01:08:22,528
- So fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up.

613
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:29,408
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

614
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:34,918
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

615
01:08:34,988 --> 01:08:37,252
Just lean into the railing.

616
01:08:38,525 --> 01:08:41,962
It's not vino veritaz.
It's en vino veritaz.

617
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,089
Who the fuck are you talking to?

618
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:48,933
Little brown-nosed gnomes
with a slingshot.

619
01:08:53,677 --> 01:08:58,445
- To be in drunk.
- Lean into the bar?

620
01:08:58,516 --> 01:09:00,814
You lean into the bar.

621
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:05,881
My boyfriend over there
is really boring the shit out of me...

622
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:08,359
and I was wondering
if you would buy me a drink?

623
01:09:08,428 --> 01:09:11,022
Do you mind
if I buy her a drink?

624
01:09:11,097 --> 01:09:16,297
- I don't care what you do with her.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

625
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,737
Barman, a rum and Coke.

626
01:09:22,812 --> 01:09:25,940
Can I stay with you for awhile?

627
01:09:26,015 --> 01:09:29,918
You mean move in with me?
Isn't this a bit sudden?

628
01:09:29,987 --> 01:09:33,424
I don't have a lot of things.

629
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:37,427
I don't think my wife
would dig it very much.

630
01:09:37,495 --> 01:09:43,162
Then maybe we should just go
to a motel and fuck all day.

631
01:09:43,235 --> 01:09:46,364
I could suck you like this.

632
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:49,033
I'm sure fucking you
would be wonderful...

633
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:54,047
but it's almost impossible for me
to imagine being with someone else.

634
01:09:54,115 --> 01:09:57,950
Now listen, asshole,
I'm not just gonna sit here...

635
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,285
and watch her suck on your ear!

636
01:10:00,356 --> 01:10:02,790
Shut the fuck up!

637
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:11,301
I am sorry...

638
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:15,172
but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together...

639
01:10:15,305 --> 01:10:17,433
in a motel.

640
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:19,874
And after that, caviar.

641
01:10:23,815 --> 01:10:25,578
Baby, wait up!

642
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,095
You're quite a fighter.

643
01:10:36,163 --> 01:10:38,257
Here.

644
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:42,430
Listen,
this may sound silly...

645
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,439
but I have to ask you
to leave.

646
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,841
It's what we do around here
when there's a fight.

647
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,936
The men's room
is around the back.

648
01:10:57,855 --> 01:10:59,949
Sexy.

649
01:11:04,364 --> 01:11:05,797
I'm back.

650
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:11,300
Oh, my God.

651
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:13,932
- Did I scare you?
- What happened?

652
01:11:15,877 --> 01:11:18,471
Fuck, Ben.
Did you get in a fight?

653
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:21,907
I thought you said
you didn't fight.

654
01:11:23,152 --> 01:11:25,587
How do you feel?

655
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:29,752
Like the kling-klang king
of the rim-ram room.

656
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,762
Did you stop at a bar?

657
01:11:33,098 --> 01:11:35,589
Did you say something stupid
to somebody stupid?

658
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:37,602
Absolutely not.

659
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:43,302
I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.

660
01:11:45,512 --> 01:11:47,447
I bet you were.

661
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:55,623
Why don't you go take a shower
and put on your other shirt?

662
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:59,458
Then we'll go shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

663
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:01,963
I think this shirt is unlucky.

664
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:05,464
Not at all.

665
01:12:06,537 --> 01:12:08,472
Your blood tastes good.

666
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,770
We got eggs.

667
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:17,475
I always had a fantasy
of being a flamenco dancer.

668
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,244
I think you look great.

669
01:12:21,322 --> 01:12:23,256
We'll just get you a bow tie...

670
01:12:23,324 --> 01:12:26,419
and then you can be one
of those blackjack dealers.

671
01:12:26,494 --> 01:12:29,259
- All right?
- They wear it because they have to.

672
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:32,096
I'll wear it
because I want to...

673
01:12:32,168 --> 01:12:34,433
which will make me
look different.

674
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:40,103
Let's get a drink!

675
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,112
- What is that?
- What?

676
01:12:43,181 --> 01:12:47,812
Holy cow.
It came out of your ear!

677
01:12:49,555 --> 01:12:51,490
I didn't have time
to write you a card...

678
01:12:51,558 --> 01:12:53,958
with you breathing down
my neck all day...

679
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:56,155
so you'll just have
to wing it, baby.

680
01:12:57,565 --> 01:12:58,998
Open it.

681
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,140
They're your color.

682
01:13:13,217 --> 01:13:15,913
I think you should wear
one of them at a time.

683
01:13:15,986 --> 01:13:19,320
One of these
and one of your other ones.

684
01:13:19,391 --> 01:13:22,759
I was gonna buy you just one...

685
01:13:22,828 --> 01:13:24,955
but I didn't think it would fly.

686
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:27,625
Nurse!
As a gift, I mean.

687
01:13:33,674 --> 01:13:36,040
I'll wear them tonight.

688
01:13:37,678 --> 01:13:39,271
One of them.

689
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,615
Tonight.

690
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,454
Put it on.

691
01:13:56,001 --> 01:13:58,834
I can't get it.

692
01:13:58,904 --> 01:14:00,839
I'll help you.

693
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:10,177
You'll be able to feel it,
sharp and hot under your ear...

694
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:13,687
as one of the brothers
is putting your head facedown...

695
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:17,192
into one
of the penthouse pillows.

696
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:55,670
Wait!

697
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:03,006
Maybe you should wait.

698
01:15:05,783 --> 01:15:09,481
- Why?
- You can tell.

699
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:11,489
She really wants you to.

700
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:33,972
Maybe I should
follow you around...

701
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:38,886
and ask one of your tricks
what it's like to sleep with you.

702
01:15:38,956 --> 01:15:40,891
They wouldn't know.

703
01:15:44,429 --> 01:15:46,694
Maybe you should ask me
sometime.

704
01:15:46,766 --> 01:15:49,030
Be happy to show you.

705
01:15:52,105 --> 01:15:55,302
I'm gonna be home around 3:00.

706
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:58,743
If you're back, we could
watch some TV or something.

707
01:16:01,783 --> 01:16:06,050
What I'm saying is that I hope
you're back when I get home.

708
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:11,587
Be careful.

709
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:16,592
You be careful too.

710
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,136
I'm gonna miss you.

711
01:16:26,346 --> 01:16:29,783
I know this really cool place
in the desert.

712
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,784
We could go away
for a couple days.

713
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:38,627
I'd like that.

714
01:16:52,777 --> 01:16:56,214
I make comic faces and...

715
01:16:56,281 --> 01:16:59,842
stand on my head and grin at you
between my legs and...

716
01:17:02,188 --> 01:17:04,247
I know loads of jokes.

717
01:17:07,495 --> 01:17:09,360
Wouldn't stand a chance,
would I?

718
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:22,374
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

719
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,209
I like it here with you.

720
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:31,521
Let's stay for awhile.

721
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:12,905
- Need a mix master.
- What?

722
01:18:12,972 --> 01:18:17,239
Just sort of take everything
and blend it all together.

723
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,905
Take this off.

724
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:51,051
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

725
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:06,736
I want my drinky.

726
01:21:14,154 --> 01:21:17,420
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

727
01:21:24,099 --> 01:21:27,035
You're bleeding.
Wait. Hold it.

728
01:21:27,103 --> 01:21:31,540
- There's glass in here.
- I'm like a prickly pear!

729
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,874
- I'm a prickly pear!
- Go inside.

730
01:21:35,946 --> 01:21:40,714
- I wanna clean up the glass.
- Go inside. I'll take care of it.

731
01:21:40,785 --> 01:21:42,548
Are you sure?

732
01:21:43,622 --> 01:21:45,214
All right.

733
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:01,898
- Everybody okay?
- We're fine.

734
01:22:01,977 --> 01:22:04,241
I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the table...

735
01:22:04,314 --> 01:22:08,250
- and I'll clean this up.
- Don't worry.

736
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:12,084
You seem prepared for accidents.

737
01:22:12,156 --> 01:22:14,317
We get a lot of screwups here.

738
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:20,255
You two take your loud talk
and your liquor to your room.

739
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,028
You check out
first thing tomorrow.

740
01:22:22,101 --> 01:22:24,695
I don't want to see
either of you here ever again.

741
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:26,865
Don't you worry
about paying for anything.

742
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,103
And don't you worry about cutting
your little hands on the glass.

743
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:32,908
Let's just leave it at that.

744
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,745
See you in the morning.

745
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:05,422
I'm in here, Ben.

746
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:15,257
I bought some plain rice.

747
01:24:15,335 --> 01:24:18,863
You probably don't want
to hear it right now, but...

748
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,204
I think it's something
that you could eat.

749
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:24,871
If you get hungry,
will you let me know?

750
01:25:23,983 --> 01:25:26,611
I think I'm ready for rice.

751
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:44,970
I want you to see a doctor.

752
01:25:57,756 --> 01:26:00,658
I'm not gonna see a doctor.

753
01:26:05,232 --> 01:26:08,497
Maybe it's time
I moved to a hotel.

754
01:26:10,405 --> 01:26:12,168
And do what?

755
01:26:13,241 --> 01:26:15,733
Rot away in a room?

756
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:23,618
We're not gonna talk about that.

757
01:26:23,687 --> 01:26:25,622
Fuck you.

758
01:26:27,992 --> 01:26:29,926
You're staying here.

759
01:26:31,931 --> 01:26:35,628
You're not going to any motel.

760
01:26:35,701 --> 01:26:39,138
It's just one thing
you can do for me.

761
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:43,410
That's all I ask.

762
01:26:43,477 --> 01:26:45,536
I've given you
gallons of free will.

763
01:26:45,613 --> 01:26:48,139
You can do this one thing for me!

764
01:26:59,563 --> 01:27:01,656
I have to go to work now.

765
01:27:39,043 --> 01:27:41,979
Snake eyes!

766
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:47,546
Five!

767
01:28:18,223 --> 01:28:19,815
Boxcars!

768
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:36,968
Five!

769
01:28:38,581 --> 01:28:41,607
- Are you in for the convention?
- What?

770
01:29:24,368 --> 01:29:26,803
You're making me really hot.

771
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:30,510
Perhaps I could crash on the couch
for a few hours and then leave.

772
01:30:30,581 --> 01:30:32,139
Get out.

773
01:31:23,109 --> 01:31:26,637
I was wondering
how much it would cost?

774
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:28,647
Sorry, guys.
I don't know what you mean.

775
01:31:28,715 --> 01:31:32,152
- Anyway, I only date one guy at a time.
- Wait. We got money.

776
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,655
Show her the fucking money.

777
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:37,817
- How much are you willing to spend?
- How much do you want?

778
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:40,328
Two hundred for an hour?

779
01:31:40,397 --> 01:31:43,025
- Don't your friends talk?
- Sure.

780
01:31:52,511 --> 01:31:54,979
- Get this on camera.
- Smile.

781
01:32:00,486 --> 01:32:02,648
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

782
01:32:02,723 --> 01:32:05,954
- Do you want something to drink?
- I'm fine. Where's the money?

783
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,460
Money.

784
01:32:10,265 --> 01:32:12,029
Twenty, forty, sixty,
eighty, a hundred.

785
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:15,127
- Get it on camera, dude.
- Two hundred dollars.

786
01:32:18,175 --> 01:32:21,508
- All right, who's first?
- Hold on a second.

787
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:24,514
Miser! You've gotta get him
on camera when he comes out.

788
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:27,312
- Come on.
- Look, you two go downstairs.

789
01:32:27,385 --> 01:32:29,320
I'll be half an hour
and then...

790
01:32:29,388 --> 01:32:31,754
The only thing is,
we really wanna get him on tape.

791
01:32:31,824 --> 01:32:33,986
This is his first time.
Come on, Miser!

792
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,528
We just wanna see him.

793
01:32:47,943 --> 01:32:52,677
- Ask her the question, man.
- Ask her. Come on, ask her.

794
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:58,019
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Nobody's doing any of that.

795
01:32:58,088 --> 01:33:01,354
You're all going straight,
one at a time, and then I'm outta here.

796
01:33:01,426 --> 01:33:02,859
- You hear me?
- Ask again.

797
01:33:02,927 --> 01:33:06,364
- How much to fuck you up the butt?
- He said it again!

798
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,890
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Fuck one of your friends in the butt.

799
01:33:11,071 --> 01:33:15,030
- I'm outta here.
- Wait. What did she say?

800
01:33:15,108 --> 01:33:17,202
- Get out of my fuckin' way.
- What did you say? Hold on.

801
01:33:17,278 --> 01:33:20,645
- Get the fuck out of my way!
- Don't fuckin' push me!

802
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,548
What the fuck is your problem?

803
01:33:26,523 --> 01:33:29,959
Look, I'm really sorry, guys.
Let's just calm down.

804
01:33:30,026 --> 01:33:32,587
I'm sorry.
Just calm down.

805
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,001
- Fuck, Miser.
- Shit.

806
01:33:42,107 --> 01:33:43,575
- Shit.
- Fuck.

807
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:34,267
Where you headed?

808
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:36,828
421 Vista.

809
01:34:39,342 --> 01:34:43,336
I couldn't help but notice
you had a little trouble sittin' down.

810
01:34:43,413 --> 01:34:46,508
You get a back door delivery
you weren't expectin'?

811
01:34:49,921 --> 01:34:53,187
You gonna be able
to pay for this?

812
01:34:53,259 --> 01:34:57,196
I asked you a question.
You got money?

813
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:02,026
- I'll let you out here, sister.
- I have money.

814
01:35:02,102 --> 01:35:06,369
All right.
Don't take it out on me.

815
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,205
I'm just covering my ass.

816
01:35:09,278 --> 01:35:11,872
Somethin' maybe you should have
thought about doing.

817
01:35:27,966 --> 01:35:30,060
Get her, Miser.

818
01:35:30,136 --> 01:35:31,569
Here, I got her.

819
01:35:37,544 --> 01:35:39,171
Fuckin' bite me.

820
01:36:02,474 --> 01:36:05,136
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Van Houten.

821
01:36:14,021 --> 01:36:18,118
I am sorry, but we have to ask you
to be out by the end of the week.

822
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:48,932
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He hasn't checked back in.

823
01:38:10,893 --> 01:38:14,523
What is your problem?
You're on strike?

824
01:38:31,818 --> 01:38:33,251
Out.

825
01:38:34,654 --> 01:38:36,953
What's the problem?

826
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:40,756
We don't want you in here.
That's the problem.

827
01:38:40,829 --> 01:38:42,763
Come on. Let's go.

828
01:38:42,831 --> 01:38:46,768
Let go of my arm.
If you want me outta here...

829
01:38:46,836 --> 01:38:50,272
- I don't wanna be outta here.
- You're going out.

830
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:56,772
Next time it won't be
so fuckin' easy.

831
01:39:29,987 --> 01:39:34,687
It ain't none of my business,
but what in the hell happened to you?

832
01:39:34,759 --> 01:39:39,424
I had an argument.

833
01:39:39,499 --> 01:39:41,729
Must have been
a hell of an argument.

834
01:39:41,801 --> 01:39:44,133
If I was you, I'd leave him.

835
01:39:44,203 --> 01:39:46,104
A pretty,
young lady like you...

836
01:39:47,374 --> 01:39:51,038
You can get any man you want.
Don't you know that?

837
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:27,587
Where the fuck are you?

838
01:40:32,828 --> 01:40:35,262
Give me the address.

839
01:41:19,316 --> 01:41:21,410
It's so dark in here.

840
01:41:40,174 --> 01:41:43,008
You're so sick...

841
01:41:43,078 --> 01:41:44,773
so pale.

842
01:41:46,849 --> 01:41:48,784
My love.

843
01:41:50,019 --> 01:41:51,953
You're my love.

844
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,795
Do you want help?

845
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:07,305
Do you want my help?

846
01:42:11,378 --> 01:42:13,813
I want to see you.

847
01:42:16,885 --> 01:42:19,480
You're my angel.

848
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:22,924
I'm right here.

849
01:42:31,335 --> 01:42:33,269
What happened?

850
01:42:36,842 --> 01:42:41,280
Something went wrong,
but I'm okay.

851
01:42:44,851 --> 01:42:47,946
I'm sorry I put us asunder.

852
01:42:48,022 --> 01:42:49,455
It's okay.

853
01:43:29,171 --> 01:43:31,105
Let me do it.

854
01:43:36,346 --> 01:43:40,283
There. There you go.

855
01:43:49,194 --> 01:43:52,460
See how hard
you make me, angel?

856
01:44:31,177 --> 01:44:33,169
You know I love you.

857
01:44:40,021 --> 01:44:41,511
I know.

858
01:45:18,734 --> 01:45:20,669
I love you.

859
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,507
I think the thing is...

860
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:27,514
we both realized that
we didn't have that much time...

861
01:46:27,582 --> 01:46:30,518
and...

862
01:46:30,586 --> 01:46:35,684
I accepted him for who he was.

863
01:46:37,327 --> 01:46:40,491
I didn't expect him to change.

864
01:46:40,565 --> 01:46:45,229
I think he felt that for me too.

865
01:46:48,106 --> 01:46:50,233
I liked his drama.

866
01:46:53,446 --> 01:46:55,380
And he needed me.

867
01:46:58,886 --> 01:47:00,820
I loved him.

868
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:22,036
I really loved him.

869
01:47:23,305 --> 01:48:23,481

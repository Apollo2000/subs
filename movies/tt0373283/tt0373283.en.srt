Ahhhhh!

00:02:16,254 --> 00:02:19,421
Ahhh!

21
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,463
Ahh--Ahhh!

22
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:48,423
Ahh!

23
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:49,549
Stop crying!

24
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,009
You're making Dieter here
a little nervous.

25
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:53,922
Ahh! Ahhh!

26
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,045
I need that.

27
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,719
Okay, okay...

28
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,096
Thanks.

29
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:29,930
Ah, Zigaretten.

30
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,391
I hope you choke on it.

31
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,352
Lemon powder.

32
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,810
Meine Frau.

33
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,977
Du sprichst Deutsch?

34
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:17,017
Ya.

35
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,393
Hmm.

36
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,271
Bitte--

37
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:24,305
Hier.

38
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,395
Danke.

39
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,314
You must be living right, Deac.

40
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,731
Halt! Halt!

41
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,860
Come on!

42
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,277
Come on, this way!

43
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,696
Deacon.

44
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:44,195
Out!

45
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,074
Heraus! Jetzt!

46
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,773
No, don't shoot!

47
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,406
Nein shooten!
Nein shooten!

48
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,532
Shoot him!

49
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,156
Shoot him.

50
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,699
I surrender.

51
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:09,823
What are you waiting for?

52
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,866
Shut up!

53
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:13,907
Give me the gun!

54
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:14,907
No!

55
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,785
Hey, hey!

56
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:23,909
Why didn't you take that shot?

57
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,993
Do you know what you just did?

58
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,034
Shh!

59
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,952
Deac.

60
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,871
Come on.

61
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,244
Get down, get down low.

62
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,963
Oh!

63
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,920
What happened back there, Deac?

64
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:57,962
He had a Kraut in his sights
and he froze.

65
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,128
He's one of ours.

66
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,088
Yeah.

67
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:14,008
Get down!

68
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,172
Boy, am I glad to see you fellas.

69
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:17,588
Gould, I've been hit.

70
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,466
What in the Sam Hill
happened back there?

71
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,047
I'm Steven Gould.

72
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:23,882
This is Shirl Kendrick, 285th.

73
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:26,382
Gordon Gunderson,
Nathan Greer, 101st.

74
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,632
Kendrick, hold still.

75
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,591
It's just a graze,
I can fix you un right here.

76
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,799
We gotta get out of here

77
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,173
and find shelter
before it turns dark.

78
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:34,049
Due respect, Sarge,
but I didn't come to

79
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,632
the war to hide out.

80
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,717
Nobody asked you, Kendrick.

81
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,550
Look, we're behind
the enemy lines.

82
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,675
In a couple of days,

83
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:42,967
the bombers are gonna
drive these bastards

84
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:44,758
back to Berlin.

85
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,800
For now,
they're shooting prisoners,

86
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,009
and we got one Kraut rifle

87
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,802
with, what?

88
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:50,967
Sheesh.

89
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,176
Four rounds left in it.

90
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:53,802
Hell, I just wanna shoot me
some more Krauts.

91
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:56,636
We gotta get out of here.

92
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:58,052
Deacon, you gotta go point.

93
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:59,930
This way. Move it.

94
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,228
I don't see any weapons.

95
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:10,854
An ambulance.

96
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:15,063
They mowed down
a damn ambulance.

97
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,063
Deac...

98
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,814
Why don't you, uh, head up
the hill and keep watch.

99
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,856
I'm gonna see if we can find
some stuff we can use,

100
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,021
and then we'll get out of here.

101
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,690
All right?

102
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,691
I hate robbing the dead.

103
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,025
They're already been robbed.

104
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:51,442
Just grab whatever we can use.

105
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:11,404
Deac.

106
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:14,445
Put this on.

107
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:16,194
Put it on.

108
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:18,069
I need you at the road
checking stuff out.

109
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,947
Go on, get.

110
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,403
Damn.

111
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:32,857
What?

112
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,822
I found some K-rations.

113
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,530
And?

114
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,364
Some dummy took
all the cigarettes out.

115
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,622
How long has Deacon been gone?

116
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:33,745
Almost an hour.

117
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:35,412
That's a nice watch, Gould.

118
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,455
He's not gonna miss it, trust me.

119
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,662
If I catch a bullet,

120
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,705
you gonna take my personals too?

121
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:45,039
You don't have anything I want,
Kendrick.

122
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:46,746
Except maybe your flashlight.

123
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,579
Funny.

124
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Hey, Sarge,

125
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,956
what's the deal with Deacon?

126
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,873
He seems a little...jumpy.

127
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:56,873
Deacon's fine.

128
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:58,414
He's just a little on edge.

129
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:02,291
He seems like a nice enough
fella and all, just...

130
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:03,832
He's shell-shocked.

131
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,084
I've seen it a million times.

132
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,957
Don't worry about it.

133
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,166
Yeah, it's just a little
frightening.

134
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,999
We only have one weapon,
and he's holding it.

135
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,959
Yeah, we do have one weapon.

136
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,126
How did we get that weapon,
Gould?

137
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:20,125
Deacon saved my ass

138
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,085
more times that I care
to think about.

139
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:24,004
He's fine.

140
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,544
What'd ya find, Deac?

141
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:41,504
Home, sweet home.

142
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,170
Yeah, this will work

143
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:44,961
to hold up in for a couple of days.

144
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,296
Deac, I want you on first watch.

145
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:49,338
Let's see if we can get a fire going

146
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,374
in this thing.

147
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,838
Gould, you got any matches?

148
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,045
No.

149
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,464
I found the latrine.

150
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:59,881
Like I said--
home, sweet home.

151
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,341
Great, this thing's safe.

152
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:50,886
Hey, Gunderson.

153
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:52,846
What's the deal

154
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:53,887
with you and Deacon?

155
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,382
You guys separated at birth?

156
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,679
Cousins?

157
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:01,222
Deacon's the squarest guy
I know.

158
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,930
He's from some little
backwards town in Arizona.

159
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,806
Doesn't drink,

160
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:08,847
doesn't smoke.

161
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:10,430
He doesn't even like coffee.

162
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,723
That's why they call him
The Deacon.

163
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:16,308
My boys back
in the neighborhood--

164
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,973
if they knew my best buddy

165
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,308
was a good church boy like him,

166
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,227
they'd laugh their butts off.

167
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,183
I'll tel you something else
about Deacon--

168
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,309
he's the best shot
I've ever seen.

169
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:34,350
Where are you from, Sarge?

170
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,601
Chicago, south side.

171
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:39,101
Is that right?

172
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,101
How about you?

173
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:41,101
Louisiana.

174
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,852
Small town.

175
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:45,771
Really small.

176
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:48,976
How about you, Gould?

177
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:50,727
Where are you from?

178
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:53,061
New York.

179
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:57,020
What part of New York?

180
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,895
Brooklyn.

181
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:01,646
Heights.

182
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:05,021
I like Brooklyn.

183
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,940
Good jazz clubs.

184
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,855
Yeah, you want good jazz,
you gotta go to the Village.

185
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,981
You want great jazz,
you go to New Orleans.

186
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:17,398
That's a good place.

187
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,901
Father in Heaven,

188
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:48,401
forgive me for

189
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,110
the things I've done.

190
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,988
I just need--

191
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:59,402
Stop.

192
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:04,987
This is your card.

193
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,862
That's a pretty good trick,
Kendrick.

194
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:09,775
Got a jeep coming!

195
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:17,445
Keep going.

196
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,324
Keep going, keep going...

197
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:22,614
They're stopping.

198
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:28,325
Gunderson!

199
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:36,990
Hallo!

200
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,868
Jemand zu Hause?

201
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,165
Ach!

202
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,626
Ohh!

203
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:11,795
I-- I don't know.

204
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:12,959
Deac, what'd you get?

205
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,336
I couldn't hear 'eh very good.

206
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:16,377
Something about the
Meuse River

207
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,210
and the plane crashin'.

208
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,088
Shh.

209
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,795
Bloody, come on!

210
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:29,795
Stand back!

211
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:30,831
I think he's a Kraut.

212
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:31,962
Not a step closer!

213
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:32,962
Don't shoot him.

214
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,962
I've got a gun.

215
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:34,999
He's a Brit.

216
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,212
Kendrick, go help him down.

217
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:37,463
Stand back!

218
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:38,630
Go.

219
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:39,838
All right now,
just calm down.

220
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,838
No!

221
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,717
Here we go.
Come on.

222
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:46,380
Get back!

223
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,881
Whoa!

224
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,917
Hey, take it easy.

225
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:49,917
Drop it!

226
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:50,917
You drop it!

227
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:52,048
Keep it down!

228
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:53,048
We're Americans.

229
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,048
Prove it!

230
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,257
What?

231
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,090
Who was the third president
of the United States?

232
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:58,090
Just put the gun down.

233
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,591
Thomas Jefferson.

234
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:01,424
Who was the fourth?

235
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,174
Madison.
What's with this guy?

236
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:04,341
What's the capital of Vermont?

237
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,591
Hartford-- I--

238
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:06,758
Sarge!

239
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,008
Give me a break!
Nobody knows that.

240
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,887
You tell me!

241
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:14,470
Haven't the foggiest.

242
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,801
Sorry, boys.

243
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:19,094
Where's your command post?

244
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:26,470
Used to be that way.

245
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:27,802
Sorry for the trouble.

246
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,594
Thank you.

247
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,472
Montpelier.

248
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:36,261
About how far back?

249
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:39,679
About 10 to 15 miles.

250
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,428
Soldier, who are you?

251
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,013
Flight Sergeant,
Oberon Winley,

252
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:45,054
Royal Air Force.

253
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,674
Oberon...

254
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,598
Winley.

255
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,640
Look, I am in possession
of some crucial intelligence.

256
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,765
I need to get to
the nearest command center.

257
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:55,889
Buddy, you must have smashed

258
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,598
your head on a tree
coming down or something.

259
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,849
Or a bloody field phone at least.

260
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:04,724
There are no field phones,
and you will keep it down.

261
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,135
Can we shoot him now, Sarge?

262
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:07,556
Shut up!

263
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,017
Winley,
where do you think you're going?

264
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:13,017
I was intended to fly
back to Manhay.

265
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:14,308
Really?

266
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,434
Well, we've had a bit
of bad luck around here.

267
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,350
A Panzer division went
on a spoiling expedition,

268
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:19,767
and we are now
behind the enemy lines.

269
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,643
This isn't some little
spoiling expedition.

270
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,810
This is a major
German offensive.

271
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,685
After the Germans attacked,

272
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:30,221
we were ordered to fly

273
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,560
an emergency photo
re-con mission

274
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:35,644
to collect electronic
intelligence.

275
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:38,061
We were flying

276
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:40,978
under some--
some cloud cover and...

277
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,062
snapped some
rather revealing photos.

278
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,438
But by the time we realized
what we had,

279
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,146
a German fighter
had shot us down.

280
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,353
So you need to get
to intelligence?

281
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:51,812
Yes.

282
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:52,979
And it's damn critical

283
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,563
that I get there
as soon as possible.

284
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:01,063
They've punched through...

285
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,814
all along here...

286
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,940
right where we're thinnest.

287
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:07,606
Why would they do that?

288
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:08,606
If they punch through here,

289
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:09,935
they're exposing their flank.

290
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:11,773
That's right.

291
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:12,810
Unless, of course,

292
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:14,565
they hurry and make it
to the Meuse River

293
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,733
and cross over.

294
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:18,691
I don't get it.

295
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,276
Well, if they cross the Meuse,

296
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:22,316
then they can turn

297
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:23,983
and take Leige.

298
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:26,026
I went through there
on my way in.

299
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,567
It's got one of
the biggest ammo dumps

300
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,067
I've ever seen there.

301
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,485
It's one of the largest
in Europe.

302
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:34,026
And if the Krauts take Leige,
they take the ammo dump.

303
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,318
Or we have to destroy it.

304
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,151
Either way, it's a straight shot

305
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:40,235
for them to take back Antwerp.

306
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,443
What is this?
This ain't German.

307
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,945
Thank you.

308
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:47,445
I have got to get these

309
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,314
to there

310
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:52,904
before the Germans cross
the Meuse River.

311
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,362
It's over 20 miles.

312
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:58,655
As a crow flies, yes.

313
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:00,864
Thank you.

314
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:04,031
And we're supposed to outrun
an entire Panzer division,

315
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,196
on foot?

316
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,198
You know,
we could follow this rail line

317
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,115
along here

318
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,407
and then cut up through here

319
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:18,740
and shortcut them.

320
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:21,907
Could save a lot of troops.

321
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,291
Hey...

322
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,542
Where'd you learn
to speak German?

323
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:39,584
What?

324
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,751
Your German--
where'd you pick it up?

325
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,001
Oh, in Berlin.

326
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,291
What were you doing there?

327
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,709
Going to school or something?

328
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:51,002
No, I was a missionary.

329
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:53,502
That must have been neat.

330
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:56,710
Hanging out with a bunch
of Krauts talking about God.

331
00:24:56,752 --> 00:25:00,628
How is Adolf?

332
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,670
I loved it.

333
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:05,920
It was the best time of my life.

334
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:23,505
Hey, Deac.

335
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:24,505
Deac!

336
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:29,548
You wanna see
a good magic trick?

337
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:34,632
I need a smoke.

338
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,423
Hi.

339
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:40,301
So, Winley...

340
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:44,175
where'd you say
you were from, exactly?

341
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,882
What is it, Kendrick?

342
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:48,175
You want one of my fags,
is that what it is?

343
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:50,883
Well, uh...

344
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:51,961
That's...

345
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:55,927
Hmm.

346
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,468
Forget I asked.

347
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,551
No problem.

348
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,176
How long has it been

349
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:05,219
since you and Deacon have slept?

350
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:08,011
Me--two days.

351
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:10,969
Him--three or four.

352
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:12,260
The longer he goes

353
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:15,220
without sleep...

354
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:18,095
the more he's gonna lose it.

355
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:20,763
Thank you.

356
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:35,931
What is he doing?

357
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:36,966
He's making sure

358
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,844
all's clear.

359
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:45,681
Okay, let's go.

360
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:47,559
Move it.

361
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,432
All right, look,

362
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:55,640
we've gone about 12 miles.

363
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:56,640
We've gotta stop.

364
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,183
We gotta get some shut-eye.

365
00:26:58,184 --> 00:26:59,599
All right?

366
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,100
We're gonna get moving
in a hour.

367
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm gonna take first watch.

368
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,267
No, I got it, Sarge.

369
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,434
No, you don't.

370
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:06,225
You gotta get down there
and get some sleep.

371
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:09,393
All right?
Go. Move it.

372
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:11,685
Careful.

373
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:12,893
Hey, Kendrick,

374
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:15,519
that was, uh,
nice work really.

375
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,438
Thanks, Sarge.

376
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:25,020
Yes, thank you for protecting us
from the birdies.

377
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,934
Very decent of you.

378
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:32,146
"Very decent of you."

379
00:28:58,324 --> 00:29:00,201
I fell asleep.

380
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,032
Well, you're not the only one.

381
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:07,324
What about you?

382
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,075
No.

383
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:29,994
You sure you don't want
some coffee?

384
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,785
You sure you don't want
some hot lemonade?

385
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:44,037
What the hell are we
doing here, Deac?

386
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,829
This is crazy.

387
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,205
Yeah, you got that right.

388
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,996
I should be home right now.

389
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:57,581
Should be home playing
with my nephews,

390
00:29:57,622 --> 00:30:01,080
flirting with the girl
at my dad's store...

391
00:30:01,122 --> 00:30:03,456
What's her name?

392
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,832
I forgot her name.

393
00:30:11,874 --> 00:30:15,333
And you--
you should be doing...

394
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,293
whatever you do.

395
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,041
I should be helping my wife
get ready for the baby.

396
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,459
You didn't tell me
you were having a baby.

397
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:34,127
I got the letter on Thursday.

398
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:36,501
She says she knows
it's gonna be a girl.

399
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,877
Huh.

400
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:41,211
She must be due
pretty soon then, huh?

401
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,503
Yeah, January 18th.

402
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,377
That's my birthday.

403
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:47,295
I know.

404
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:50,712
Huh.

405
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:53,796
Hmm.

406
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:56,587
Thursday--that was
the day we hit Essendor.

407
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,796
You'll be all right, Deac.

408
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:11,047
We just gotta get
Winley to Manhay...

409
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:13,089
win the war, and go home.

410
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,638
Hey, Deac.

411
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,972
I got some
lemonade packets.

412
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:12,722
I'll trade you
for a couple of butts.

413
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:13,929
Kendrick, give it a rest.

414
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,098
Nobody has any smokes,
especially not him.

415
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:21,181
I just need a smoke.

416
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:24,265
I gotta figure out
where the hell we are.

417
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:36,308
So, Gould...

418
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:38,600
what's your secret?

419
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:39,766
My what?

420
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,641
You know, your big secret

421
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,976
you don't tell the other chaps
around the campfire.

422
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,433
I mean, we've all got them.

423
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:48,934
I'm sure Kendrick here
has 10 or 20.

424
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,976
Yeah, I don't have one of those.

425
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,227
Rubbish.

426
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:56,269
Look, even if I did...

427
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,935
why would I tell you?

428
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,185
You don't have to tell me,
of course.

429
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,227
It's-- It's just that

430
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,478
we're on this perilous
mission together.

431
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,852
And I've found that

432
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,560
when man can share
anything with each other,

433
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,270
anything,

434
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:10,644
well, it creates a certain...

435
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:12,979
Esprit de Corps, you follow?

436
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,480
Forget it.

437
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:22,397
Righty-o.
You can play as you want.

438
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:27,814
I never kissed my wife
'til the day we were married.

439
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:29,856
All right, Deacon.

440
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:33,148
You see,
I feel close already.

441
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,064
When I was 15,

442
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:36,148
I showed up at school

443
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:38,232
with a shiner and a bloody lip.

444
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:41,483
I told the guys I got it
plying stick ball,

445
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:42,732
but I actually got it

446
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,441
'cause I got beat up
by Alice Palisky.

447
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:48,066
Alice Palisky.
Good.

448
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:50,358
All right, all right, I got one.

449
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,359
One time when I was, uh,
in high school,

450
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,442
I was working
on my dad's truck.

451
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,484
And I had one
of them vacuum tubes--

452
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:58,692
you know what I'm talking about.

453
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,193
And, uh,
I figured out that if I held it

454
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:03,776
just so and sucked--

455
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,276
I could give myself hickeys.

456
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:09,486
So I had them
all over my neck.

457
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:11,110
And I told my buddies that,

458
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:13,695
uh, that I had a girl
from out of town.

459
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:15,987
But, truth be known,

460
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:20,487
I never kissed
a girl before, ever.

461
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:22,445
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:23,486
What's so funny?

463
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:25,195
Sorry, everyone.

464
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:29,363
It's just, well, hickeys, huh?

465
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,780
Guess we found
a new nickname for Kendrick.

466
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,862
Let's go.

467
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:36,697
We're making good time,

468
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:38,108
but we gotta keep moving.

469
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,573
So, Winsley,
what's your secret, huh?

470
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:43,157
Good grief,
you think I'd tell you chaps?

471
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:45,075
I've just barely met you.

472
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:05,159
Is all Brits
as charming as Winsley?

473
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:07,078
I don't know.

474
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:25,622
What the hell is he doing?

475
00:35:29,913 --> 00:35:31,536
No...

476
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:32,828
Deac!

477
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:34,032
No!

478
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:35,037
Deac!

479
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:37,746
No! No! No!
Don't kill me!

480
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:38,787
No, no!

481
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:39,871
Cover his mouth.

482
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:42,914
Come on, right here.

483
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:46,206
Deac, Deacon, Deacon, shh.

484
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:47,247
It's okay.

485
00:35:47,248 --> 00:35:48,913
Be quiet.

486
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,038
Can you do something for him?

487
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:51,247
He needs a warm place to sleep.

488
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:52,706
Yeah, we don't really
have that, do we, Gould?

489
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:53,914
What can you do for him here?

490
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:56,373
Deacon!

491
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,665
Deacon, listen to me!

492
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,456
Do not get us killed!

493
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,333
Look at me! Look at me!

494
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:04,251
Open your eyes.
Look at me.

495
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,250
Relax.

496
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,624
Breathe.

497
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,376
I'm going to take my hand
away from your mouth.

498
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:14,501
Don not scream, okay?

499
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:18,084
Okay. Shh.

500
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:21,752
Did you see 'em?

501
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:22,960
Tell me you saw 'em.

502
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:25,419
It's okay, Deacon.
It's okay, Deacon.

503
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:49,672
Talk to me.

504
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:52,922
All right.

505
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:54,422
Last Thursday,

506
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,213
we ran into some Krauts
in a little town

507
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,131
in the Elsenborn Ridge.

508
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,255
They were pulling out,

509
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:00,964
but this one little bastard

510
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:03,799
was holed-up inside a church.

511
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,257
I sent Deacon to take him out.

512
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:08,883
It was dark in there.

513
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:10,841
Somebody took a shot at him.

514
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:15,717
So he threw in a grenade,
sprayed the room.

515
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:18,176
Went up and took the guy out.

516
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:23,758
In the room...

517
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:29,385
was two women and six kids.

518
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:32,719
It was a mess.

519
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:36,260
When it was over,

520
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,179
Deac just...

521
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,546
flipped out.

522
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:42,345
Our C.O. gave me a jeep

523
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,803
to have him checked out
at St. Vith.

524
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,388
We got captured about an hour

525
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:51,555
before you guys run
into them at Malmedy.

526
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:59,931
You don't mention this to him.

527
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:02,222
Do you understand me, Gould?

528
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:08,638
All right, what do we do?

529
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,140
We keep him talking.

530
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:15,974
We don't let him
go off by himself.

531
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:20,266
And please, put that rifle
in somebody else's hands.

532
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:24,809
Yeah.

533
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:29,101
47, 48, 49, 50, 51...

534
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,310
C'mon. Damn.

535
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,102
What is that?
Some kind of code?

536
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:45,102
No, it's the way I write.

537
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:48,019
I hope somebody
can translate that.

538
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:51,645
Of course. I can.

539
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:54,353
Are you trying to tell me
you're the only person

540
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:55,436
that knows what that says?

541
00:38:55,437 --> 00:38:59,520
That more or less sums it up.

542
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:03,397
So us not letting you die
would be pretty important?

543
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:06,105
Yes.

544
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,147
Great.

545
00:39:08,188 --> 00:39:09,354
Kendrick.

546
00:39:09,355 --> 00:39:11,731
You got watch.

547
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,773
Gonna give you a gun.

548
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:15,397
I'm gonna scout a bit.

549
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:19,315
I'll be right back.

550
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,278
That is sick.

551
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:48,526
Yes, I'm sure you prefer
to use your fingers.

552
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,278
That's much better, Hickey.

553
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,069
Very distinguished.

554
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:00,235
That's better
than carrying it around

555
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:02,114
in your pocket all day.

556
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:14,613
That good reading?

557
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:25,865
Do you believe in a life
after this one?

558
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,447
Not a chance in hell.

559
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:31,240
When we first got there,

560
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:35,574
I was working on this kid.

561
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:37,824
He was shot up pretty bad.

562
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:40,991
He kept saying, "Please, God."

563
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:44,783
"Please, God," over and over...

564
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,451
like it meant something.

565
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:50,826
He was so sincere about it,

566
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:55,159
I thought it might work.

567
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:58,660
Then two minutes later
he was dead.

568
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:02,827
There wasn't a thing
I could do about it.

569
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:06,161
When I looked into his eyes...

570
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:09,203
there wasn't nothing there.

571
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:11,870
Nothing.

572
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:15,162
That's when I realized that...

573
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,579
this is it.

574
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,538
It's funny.

575
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,914
What can possibly be funny
about that?

576
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:29,914
No, I don't mean funny funny.

577
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:36,213
It's just that, uh...

578
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:43,416
We were just outside
Sainte-Mere-Englise.

579
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:47,750
We were getting pounded
pretty hard.

580
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,668
And I was holding this--

581
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:54,459
this kid on my lap, and...

582
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,043
he was shot up pretty good.

583
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:03,168
And I remember him praying.

584
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,669
And I was praying too.

585
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:10,919
Then all of a sudden, he--

586
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:16,337
he was gone.

587
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:18,545
And that was--
that was it, really.

588
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:22,212
That was the first time that I--

589
00:42:22,254 --> 00:42:27,630
that I really watched somebody die.

590
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,672
But right then,
I knew that he was--

591
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:36,048
he was in a better place than that.

592
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:39,839
How convenient for you.

593
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,839
Convenient?

594
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:44,382
Yeah, that's
what I was just thinking

595
00:42:44,424 --> 00:42:46,340
about what you said.

596
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:49,382
Funny, huh?

597
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:07,801
Where you from?

598
00:43:07,843 --> 00:43:08,842
Arizona.

599
00:43:08,843 --> 00:43:10,175
I know, Arizona.

600
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:13,718
Where in Arizona?

601
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,343
Snowflake.

602
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:18,969
Snowflake--
I never heard of it.

603
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,845
What do you do
in Snowflake for fun?

604
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,803
Hunting.

605
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,929
What do you hunt?

606
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,595
Whatever's in season.

607
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:36,596
So you like to shoot things?

608
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,639
Forget I asked.

609
00:43:42,347 --> 00:43:45,806
So why do you like
the Krauts so much?

610
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,598
'Cause I know 'em.

611
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,598
I know that most of 'em
are just like you and me.

612
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,681
They just wear
a different uniform.

613
00:43:53,723 --> 00:43:56,015
So Adolf Hitler is
a pretty nice fella?

614
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:57,265
Once you get to know him--

615
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,140
it's just a different uniform?

616
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:00,597
That's not what I said.

617
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,432
And those guys at
Malmedy--they're just like us,

618
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:04,015
except they got
different helmets on?

619
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,933
If it makes it easier
for you to hate 'em,

620
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:07,140
then go right ahead.

621
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:08,974
You know what,
if it weren't for them,

622
00:44:08,975 --> 00:44:10,975
I'd be finishing up med school
and putting a cast

623
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,891
on Billy's leg 'cause he broke
it on his bicycle.

624
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:13,892
But instead,

625
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:15,224
I'm taking lead

626
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:16,761
out of his 17-year-old
brother's gut,

627
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:18,266
'cause he wanted
to serve his country,

628
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:19,517
and he lied about his age.

629
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:21,434
And now he's spitting up blood,

630
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:23,268
lying in the dirt,

631
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:26,186
and asking God
to come and save him.

632
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:28,645
It's more than a different uniform.

633
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,482
Are they crossed by yet?

634
00:45:08,524 --> 00:45:10,816
They must be stalled
somewhere in here.

635
00:45:10,857 --> 00:45:13,317
Yeah, this weather can't be
helping them much.

636
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,816
How far is it to Manhay?

637
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:18,566
About 15 kilometers.

638
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:20,191
All right.

639
00:45:20,192 --> 00:45:22,317
This weather keeps up,
we should be able to beat 'em.

640
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:25,568
Get there by dark.
All right.

641
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:27,481
Let's move out.
Come on.

642
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:03,863
Ahhhh!

643
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:05,781
Kendrick!

644
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:18,115
Kendrick!

645
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:20,034
Okay, buddy? Okay?

646
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,075
Kendrick, can you hear me?

647
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,532
We can't do this here!

648
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:32,534
We gotta get out of this.

649
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:33,699
If we stop now,
there's no way

650
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,908
we're going
to make it in time.

651
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:36,786
If we can't move,
they can't move.

652
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,617
And we can't move!

653
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:40,744
Get him out of here.

654
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:41,910
Come on.

655
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:43,659
We're going, we're going.

656
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,538
Careful, careful.

657
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:13,579
Stand right there.

658
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,956
Do not move.

659
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:19,414
No, no.

660
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:20,456
You can't sit down.

661
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:22,081
You've gotta keep moving.
Get up.

662
00:47:22,082 --> 00:47:24,207
Get up.
Keep moving.

663
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:32,500
I'm gonna check it out.
Winley.

664
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:33,749
Give me your gun.

665
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,749
Just stand there,

666
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,627
keep your eyes open.

667
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,000
I'll go with ya.

668
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:44,250
I got it, Deac.

669
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:45,542
But, Sarge, I can--

670
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:50,002
Corporal!

671
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:51,585
Don't worry about it.

672
00:47:51,586 --> 00:47:53,463
Just open the door.

673
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:00,385
It's okay, okay.
It's okay.

674
00:49:00,386 --> 00:49:02,553
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay.

675
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:04,471
I'm American.

676
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:08,094
Put the knife down!

677
00:49:08,136 --> 00:49:10,013
Put it down!
I don't want--

678
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,389
Put it down!

679
00:49:14,887 --> 00:49:16,261
It's okay.

680
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:18,345
It's okay, look,
I'm putting the gun down.

681
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:19,553
Okay?

682
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:22,138
Put the knife down.

683
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,097
I'm an American, okay?

684
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,346
It's okay,

685
00:49:27,347 --> 00:49:28,971
it's okay.

686
00:49:28,972 --> 00:49:32,055
Okay, put it down.

687
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,014
American.

688
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:38,889
American.

689
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,182
Yeah.

690
00:49:45,724 --> 00:49:46,759
It's okay, fellas.

691
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,599
It's okay, uh...

692
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:51,683
This is, uh,
this is Madam Thearey.

693
00:49:51,724 --> 00:49:52,765
Catherine.

694
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:54,558
Catherine, Catherine.

695
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,476
Uh, and this is Sophie.

696
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,101
Bon jour.

697
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:05,101
Ah, yeah, yeah, we're all--
we're all Americans.

698
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,726
Uh, except for him.

699
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:08,604
He's, uh, he's British.
He's from, you know, England.

700
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:52,276
Bien.

701
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:01,525
Merci.

702
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,733
Merci, Catherine.

703
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:06,151
What did she just say?

704
00:51:06,192 --> 00:51:10,610
Goodbye...

705
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,610
in French.

706
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:06,533
Gunderson.

707
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:08,491
It's 15:00 hours.

708
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:34,078
We did everything we could,
Winley.

709
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,787
We certainly did.

710
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:42,911
Still...

711
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:48,455
here I sit
all nice and comfy, while...

712
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:59,081
You boys have been super.

713
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:03,873
But I'm figuring
I best get on with it.

714
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,040
Look, if I start now,

715
00:53:06,124 --> 00:53:07,998
I can probably get there
before morning.

716
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:10,124
Yeah.

717
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,415
You could try.

718
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,291
I just don't know
what your frozen dead body

719
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,833
is gonna do for anybody.

720
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,869
You can give these

721
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:26,375
to Kendrick if you want.

722
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:30,168
Cheerio.

723
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,087
Winley.

724
00:53:36,294 --> 00:53:39,586
You let him go.

725
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:44,086
He's not our prisoner, Gould.

726
00:53:44,128 --> 00:53:46,879
He's gonna die out there.

727
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,879
Yes, he is.

728
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:10,917
Catherine.

729
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,795
Bon jour.

730
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:14,964
Bread.

731
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:16,965
Thank you.

732
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,924
Winley?

733
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:21,049
Oh, Winley?

734
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,968
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

735
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:29,050
Deac?

736
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:30,969
We got company.

737
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:38,052
Oh, Sophie!

738
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:39,970
Catherine...

739
00:55:05,846 --> 00:55:09,180
No!

740
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,099
No, no!

741
00:55:13,097 --> 00:55:14,430
No!

742
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,972
Hands off!

743
00:55:26,265 --> 00:55:30,307
You gotta take him, Deac.

744
00:55:30,349 --> 00:55:32,226
Deac!

745
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:36,682
Deac, get the Luger!

746
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:39,517
We gotta catch him!

747
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,105
Damn!

748
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:04,189
You gotta be kidding me.

749
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:17,437
Did you get him?

750
00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:18,604
We lost him.

751
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:19,854
What happened to "dead eye"?

752
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:21,772
I don't know.
I just couldn't hit him.

753
00:56:21,814 --> 00:56:22,854
Couldn't or wouldn't?

754
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:24,021
Hey, I did not miss
on purpose!

755
00:56:24,022 --> 00:56:25,021
That's a lie!

756
00:56:25,023 --> 00:56:27,564
That's enough!

757
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,647
If Deacon says he just missed him,
he just missed him.

758
00:56:29,689 --> 00:56:30,688
We've got other things

759
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:32,566
to worry about right now.

760
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,649
Look what I found!

761
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,481
I heard gunshots,

762
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,607
so I started
back through the woods,

763
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:42,566
and I found
this little bugger...

764
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,817
kneeling down, praying
his little Gerry head off.

765
00:56:44,858 --> 00:56:46,149
I say we shoot him right now!

766
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,233
Shut up, Kendrick!

767
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:48,316
I'm with Kendrick.
Let's shoot him.

768
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:49,566
With his own gun!

769
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:50,602
We don't shoot prisoners, people.

770
00:56:50,603 --> 00:56:51,602
Yeah, but he does.

771
00:56:51,603 --> 00:56:52,602
Shoot him!

772
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:54,025
Shut up, Kendrick!

773
00:56:54,026 --> 00:56:55,067
What's wrong with you?
Shoot him!

774
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:57,360
Winley, put the gun down!

775
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:59,777
You will obey my orders!

776
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:01,943
Rudy?

777
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:13,154
What's going on?

778
00:57:15,737 --> 00:57:17,614
Deacon!

779
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:21,904
This is Rudolph Gertz
from Berlin.

780
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:27,614
When I was on my mission,
I taught his family, and I c--

781
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:34,823
I never miss.

782
00:57:34,864 --> 00:57:37,031
Gundy, I didn't hit him...

783
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:39,865
but I never miss.

784
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:03,825
Sergeant.

785
00:58:03,826 --> 00:58:05,117
Hmm.

786
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:08,285
Did you give my cigarettes to, uh...

787
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:15,662
Thanks.

788
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,952
No problem.

789
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:28,079
So, Winley,
why did you come back?

790
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:33,996
I heard gunshots,

791
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:36,830
and I realized I was probably
going to die out there.

792
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:39,581
I'm not proud of it.

793
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:41,623
You made a choice.

794
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:45,498
You're still alive.
That's good for you.

795
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:48,498
Yes, that's true.

796
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:51,331
It's midnight.

797
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:55,624
Gould, you're up.

798
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,250
I see our prisoners-of-war's
having fun.

799
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:06,250
What'd he say name was?

800
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,169
Adolf.

801
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:13,209
He gives me the creeps.

802
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:15,001
It's Rudolph.

803
00:59:15,002 --> 00:59:20,668
Whatever.

804
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:24,669
Hey, Winley,
I'll make you a deal.

805
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,712
You pick a card, any card,

806
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:31,503
the put it back in the deck.

807
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:36,087
If I can find your card
in this deck,

808
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:38,587
you give me one of them smokes.

809
00:59:38,624 --> 00:59:41,337
What do you say?

810
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:47,880
Deal.

811
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,173
Okay.

812
00:59:59,507 --> 01:00:02,049
Got it?

813
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:08,758
Okay, now,
you just tell me when to stop.

814
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:14,925
Stop.

815
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:17,259
This is your card.

816
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:20,383
Nope.

817
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,843
Sorry, Hickey.

818
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,677
This is your card.

819
01:00:45,804 --> 01:00:47,930
The French lady is coming.

820
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,804
Bon jour, Catherine.

821
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:52,346
Bon jour.

822
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:53,512
Thank you.

823
01:00:53,513 --> 01:00:56,680
Thank you all.

824
01:00:56,722 --> 01:01:00,555
Allez.

825
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:01,596
Joyeux Noel.

826
01:01:01,597 --> 01:01:04,806
Merci.

827
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:23,267
Frצhliche Weihnacht.

828
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:25,683
Frצhliche...

829
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:30,983
Deacon!

830
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:32,861
Where is he?

831
01:02:35,525 --> 01:02:38,318
Where's the Kraut, Deacon?

832
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,318
You let him go.
You let him go!

833
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,277
No, no, Deacon!

834
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:44,401
Off, off!

835
01:02:44,402 --> 01:02:45,734
Let's go, right now!

836
01:02:45,735 --> 01:02:49,319
Hey, who had watch, Gould?

837
01:02:49,361 --> 01:02:50,485
Who had watch?!

838
01:02:50,486 --> 01:02:52,528
I did.

839
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:54,151
But I fell asleep.

840
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:57,112
Then Deacon
didn't let anybody go.

841
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,112
Yes, I did.

842
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:02,612
What?

843
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:05,612
Come on,
what'd you wanna do, Gundy?

844
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:06,778
Take him with us?

845
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:10,322
No, I wanted to shoot him,
remember?!

846
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:12,780
What where you thinking?

847
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:16,405
I made a trade.

848
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:18,406
Rudy told me that the weather's

849
01:03:18,447 --> 01:03:20,324
pretty much shut down
all movement on either side.

850
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:21,613
And that Manhay is in the middle

851
01:03:21,614 --> 01:03:22,989
of some of the heaviest
fighting right now,

852
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,238
so we wouldn't be able to get

853
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:25,447
Winley through anyway.

854
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:26,781
But he also said
that an unknown number

855
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:28,281
of Germans are making a push toward

856
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:29,948
this little town, Longin.

857
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:32,241
That's less
than six kilometers away.

858
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:34,366
Right.

859
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:37,283
Those are our nearest boys.

860
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:39,283
I think we can make it
through to them.

861
01:03:39,325 --> 01:03:41,409
Yeah, sure.

862
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,367
Through a fully armed Kraut division.

863
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:45,951
We sneak through.

864
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:53,445
I like it.

865
01:03:53,446 --> 01:03:55,493
I don't love it, but I like it.

866
01:03:55,535 --> 01:03:58,618
And with our full arsenal of
two pistols and a bolt-action.

867
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,244
Kendrick...

868
01:04:01,286 --> 01:04:03,411
you check the back of that rig?

869
01:04:03,453 --> 01:04:06,453
It's not much,
but we gotta make it count.

870
01:04:09,287 --> 01:04:10,786
It's outta gas.
The tank's empty.

871
01:04:10,787 --> 01:04:12,746
All right.

872
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:16,247
Run it as far as you can
on fumes and then ditch it.

873
01:04:17,996 --> 01:04:19,874
Take some grenades.

874
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:33,123
What kind of name is Oberon?

875
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,206
It's from Shakespeare.

876
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,497
You ever heard of him?

877
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:40,083
Yeah.

878
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:41,539
What kind of a name is Shirl?

879
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:45,292
It's short for Shirley.

880
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,292
Shirley.

881
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:50,083
Yes, Shirley.

882
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,125
Don't get me wrong--

883
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,708
I love the name Shirley.

884
01:04:53,709 --> 01:04:55,959
In fact, it's my mother's name.

885
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,418
You trying to get us killed?

886
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,460
Is that what you think?

887
01:05:03,502 --> 01:05:05,543
Marching through enemy lines--

888
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:06,876
there's no danger there.

889
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:10,544
Yeah, well, it seems like
the right thing to do.

890
01:05:10,586 --> 01:05:12,169
We die trying.

891
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,419
Yeah, maybe.

892
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,668
Of course, if someone killed

893
01:05:14,669 --> 01:05:16,085
a bunch of innocent
women and children

894
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:18,629
this might be a real great way
to make up for it, right?

895
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:21,337
Is that what your
little Bible tells you?

896
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:22,503
Huh?

897
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:24,671
Is this your penance?

898
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:28,590
You know what?

899
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:31,671
Here.

900
01:05:31,672 --> 01:05:32,879
What?

901
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,672
Take it.
I can get another one.

902
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:37,714
I don't want your book.

903
01:05:37,756 --> 01:05:40,714
Really?

904
01:05:40,756 --> 01:05:43,215
'Cause with all your questions,
you seem awful curious.

905
01:05:43,257 --> 01:05:45,134
Get back in formation.

906
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:02,842
Let's take 'em.

907
01:06:02,884 --> 01:06:05,051
Or not.

908
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:06,509
We lay low,

909
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,592
keep moving.

910
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,802
That's good thinking, Kendrick.

911
01:06:10,844 --> 01:06:12,593
What are we,
about a mile from Longin?

912
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,469
Sounds about right.

913
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,886
All right, sun's starting
to peek through.

914
01:06:18,928 --> 01:06:20,805
Let's go, boys.

915
01:06:30,388 --> 01:06:31,923
How you doing?

916
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:33,801
All right.

917
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:41,305
You know, this really is
beautiful country.

918
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:44,514
Yeah, I knew you liked her.

919
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,140
I think I want to learn French.

920
01:06:54,432 --> 01:06:55,842
Gunderson!

921
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:58,307
No!

922
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,391
Stay with me, Gundy.

923
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,975
Gundy!

924
01:07:10,976 --> 01:07:14,101
Gundy, I'm comin'.

925
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:18,893
Breathe, breathe!

926
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:19,934
No...

927
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,934
Help him!

928
01:07:20,935 --> 01:07:21,934
He's dead.

929
01:07:21,935 --> 01:07:23,812
No, he's not.

930
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:27,727
Deac--

931
01:07:27,728 --> 01:07:29,185
He can't...

932
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:32,353
Look...he's gone.

933
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:34,144
Come on, we've gotta go.

934
01:07:34,145 --> 01:07:37,021
We've gotta go--now.

935
01:07:37,062 --> 01:07:38,312
All right, come on.

936
01:07:38,313 --> 01:07:40,729
Come on.

937
01:07:52,105 --> 01:07:54,397
C'mon, Winsley, let's go.

938
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:57,356
I can't.

939
01:08:12,024 --> 01:08:14,066
Kendrick, go see if we're
still being followed.

940
01:08:14,108 --> 01:08:15,107
Go to hell, Gould.

941
01:08:15,108 --> 01:08:16,107
Now!

942
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:17,357
You go!

943
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:19,149
Or you too worried
about saving your own skin?

944
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,191
I'll go.

945
01:08:20,192 --> 01:08:21,900
No, you're not going anywhere.

946
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:23,109
Deacon!

947
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:24,987
Deac!

948
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:49,778
They're still all over the place.

949
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:51,028
What do we do now?

950
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,279
We're gonna get shot out here.

951
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,447
We need to find a place
I can work on him.

952
01:08:54,488 --> 01:08:55,612
Can he move?

953
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:57,613
Yes.
Yes, I can move.

954
01:08:57,655 --> 01:08:59,532
All right, follow me.

955
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:07,739
Deacon.

956
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,739
Huh?

957
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,657
I need your help.

958
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:12,906
Put your fingers in here--

959
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:14,198
when I open the wound,

960
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:15,406
push the muscle aside.

961
01:09:15,407 --> 01:09:17,073
Don't scream.

962
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:18,489
Okay.

963
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:20,368
It's all right.

964
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:22,285
Doing all right, doing good.

965
01:09:23,741 --> 01:09:24,740
Open it a little further.

966
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:25,740
I'm trying.

967
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:27,366
I got it.

968
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:29,244
Come on. Almost done.

969
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:32,992
I got it.

970
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:34,784
Ugh. That's it.

971
01:09:34,785 --> 01:09:36,367
All right, I got it.
You're gonna be fine.

972
01:09:36,368 --> 01:09:37,701
Hold still, hold still.

973
01:09:37,702 --> 01:09:39,034
Hang in there, Winley.

974
01:09:39,035 --> 01:09:40,076
You're not gonna bleed to death.

975
01:09:40,077 --> 01:09:41,201
We'll take you to an aid station.

976
01:09:41,202 --> 01:09:44,244
Shhh!

977
01:09:44,286 --> 01:09:46,163
Krauts.

978
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,373
Let's go!

979
01:10:11,414 --> 01:10:12,413
Here.

980
01:10:12,414 --> 01:10:13,539
Heads up!

981
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,080
Come on! Move!

982
01:10:15,081 --> 01:10:17,165
Come on!

983
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,125
Triples on the right flank!

984
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,752
I've got it!

985
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:01,295
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

986
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:02,752
Kesndrick, get Winley outta here!

987
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:05,629
Yeah, go!

988
01:11:05,671 --> 01:11:07,503
All right, ready?

989
01:11:07,504 --> 01:11:09,381
Move, move!

990
01:11:19,173 --> 01:11:23,423
Grenade! Move, move, move!

991
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:35,424
C'mon!

992
01:11:35,466 --> 01:11:36,840
Come on.

993
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:39,341
I got him.

994
01:11:51,343 --> 01:11:53,175
Stay with me, stay with me.

995
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:56,677
We're gonna make it.

996
01:12:02,302 --> 01:12:04,511
Shhh...

997
01:12:07,428 --> 01:12:09,178
Get out. Go.

998
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,056
Fire in the hole.

999
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,140
Come on, Hickey. Hang on.

1000
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:37,931
Gould will be here in a second.

1001
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:38,967
Just hang on.

1002
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:40,845
Help...

1003
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:49,933
Just hang on, hang on!

1004
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:22,104
I'm sorry.

1005
01:13:30,646 --> 01:13:32,523
Go!

1006
01:13:50,607 --> 01:13:51,981
Where are they?

1007
01:13:51,982 --> 01:13:53,860
Right there.

1008
01:13:58,691 --> 01:14:00,568
Winley!

1009
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:11,902
Winley!

1010
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:19,278
Where is he?

1011
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:22,569
There.

1012
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,612
Winley! Winley!

1013
01:14:24,653 --> 01:14:25,694
Winley!

1014
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,945
Winley! Come on.

1015
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:33,362
Winley. Winley, hang on.

1016
01:14:33,404 --> 01:14:35,321
Winley, come on.

1017
01:14:35,362 --> 01:14:38,738
Say something!

1018
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:44,030
Right here.

1019
01:14:48,573 --> 01:14:51,657
I can't swim.

1020
01:14:51,698 --> 01:14:53,575
Is that your big secret?

1021
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,114
Where's Kendrick?

1022
01:14:57,115 --> 01:14:58,992
Kendrick's dead.

1023
01:15:51,789 --> 01:15:55,248
We gotta get these clothes off of him.

1024
01:16:00,914 --> 01:16:01,914
So what now?

1025
01:16:01,915 --> 01:16:03,623
I don't know.

1026
01:16:03,624 --> 01:16:05,957
How's your German?

1027
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:25,875
All right.

1028
01:16:25,876 --> 01:16:28,293
The German line's about
a half mile up that way.

1029
01:16:28,335 --> 01:16:31,835
This road will take us
straight through the clearing.

1030
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:34,002
Our boys are dug in on the other side.

1031
01:16:34,043 --> 01:16:35,209
We ready?

1032
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:37,836
We get Winley through...

1033
01:16:37,878 --> 01:16:40,128
save some lives.

1034
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:44,212
That's the idea.

1035
01:16:44,254 --> 01:16:45,253
I hid.

1036
01:16:45,254 --> 01:16:49,212
I didn't sign up.

1037
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:53,921
I tried to dodge the draft.

1038
01:16:53,962 --> 01:16:56,380
But my father came and found me.

1039
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,672
Is that your big secret?

1040
01:17:01,714 --> 01:17:03,546
Huh.

1041
01:17:03,547 --> 01:17:05,424
Did you get that, Winley?

1042
01:17:25,884 --> 01:17:28,759
Gould, cover up those weapons.

1043
01:17:30,425 --> 01:17:33,467
All right, Winley.
Look sick.

1044
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,267
Hang on.

1045
01:18:29,058 --> 01:18:30,935
Go! Go! Go!

1046
01:18:36,559 --> 01:18:38,433
What's going on?

1047
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:40,601
I can't tell.

1048
01:18:40,642 --> 01:18:42,976
I think they're trying to make a push.

1049
01:18:49,144 --> 01:18:50,642
There's a jeep coming
from right over there.

1050
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:51,893
Better get the Sarge on the radio.

1051
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,517
Let me see.

1052
01:18:53,518 --> 01:18:56,311
Foxtrot 2-9er calling Foxtrot 0-2.

1053
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:02,103
We got a jeep coming
from out of nowhere. Over.

1054
01:19:02,145 --> 01:19:03,853
Out.

1055
01:19:03,854 --> 01:19:06,228
That's one of our jeeps.

1056
01:19:06,265 --> 01:19:08,854
But that's a Gerry flag on the hood.

1057
01:19:08,896 --> 01:19:10,020
What are they trying to do?

1058
01:19:10,021 --> 01:19:11,980
I don't know what you
got in mind, Gerry.

1059
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:14,813
But it ain't gonna happen.

1060
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:16,062
The flag! Now!

1061
01:19:16,063 --> 01:19:18,439
Get it!

1062
01:19:20,105 --> 01:19:22,439
Hang on a second!

1063
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:26,481
American!

1064
01:19:26,523 --> 01:19:27,689
What is it?

1065
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,398
We got two Krauts coming in,
right there.

1066
01:19:45,275 --> 01:19:48,067
You okay?

1067
01:20:01,652 --> 01:20:04,736
They're shooting at each other.

1068
01:20:04,777 --> 01:20:07,778
You know what,
I think the boys are ours.

1069
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:09,027
Let's give them some cover fire.

1070
01:20:09,028 --> 01:20:10,361
Cover fire!

1071
01:20:10,362 --> 01:20:12,239
Into the trees, on me.

1072
01:20:17,154 --> 01:20:19,613
I'm out! I'm out!

1073
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:24,947
You take Winley and go,
and I'll cover you.

1074
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,988
No, I'm not going to leave you!

1075
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,024
You go now!

1076
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,903
No!

1077
01:20:34,323 --> 01:20:36,490
I'll be right behind you.

1078
01:24:41,894 --> 01:24:47,228
You saved my life.

1079
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:50,771
Be at peace, Deacon.

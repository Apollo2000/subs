00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,204
You feel strong.

3
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,081
You feel calm.

4
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,375
There is no fear in your heart.

5
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,918
Look across at your brothers...

6
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
and see me in their eyes.

7
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,468
You are all like sons to me.

8
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,938
I am with you.

9
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,071
God is with you.

10
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,530
Paradise awaits you.

11
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,610
God is great.

Taxi!

13
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:05,882
Taxi!

14
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,695
VT station. Quickly.

15
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,368
Cafe Lilopal, quick.

16
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,293
Yes, Brother.

17
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,871
We're leaving now.

18
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,840
You know the Taj Hotel?

19
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:36,873
Okay, okay.

20
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,316
Oh! Oh-yo!

21
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:51,888
Huh?

22
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:13,276
Oh. Shh, shh, shh.

23
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,161
Your sister didn't come. Again.

24
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,447
She's at home with the flu.

25
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,240
Sorry.

26
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,283
How late are you?

27
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,125
Very.

28
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,789
Get some rest and
I'll see you in the morning.

29
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,333
Bye.

30
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:39,002
Bye, Bubu.

31
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,735
Baba, good-bye.

32
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,705
Bye! Bye.

33
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,469
It's okay my darling.
It's okay.

34
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,601
Why are you crying?

35
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,813
Why are you crying?

36
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,668
Look around you, my brothers.

37
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,975
Look at all they've stolen...

38
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,012
From your fathers.

39
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,804
From your grandfathers.

40
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,477
Remember your training.

41
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,311
Don't draw
attention to yourselves.

42
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,397
Don't be late
to your destinations.

43
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,034
Timing is critical.

44
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,319
Start with the
train station first.

45
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,116
All other targets
within the next 30 minutes.

46
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,251
Remember, the whole
world will be watching.

47
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,102
More hot water.
Make it 48 degrees. Exactly 48.

48
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,838
- What is this?
- What?

49
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,441
Blue jumpsuit.
It's a boy. Blue! Blue!

50
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:28,209
Um, but Sanjay said
it's a girl.

51
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,845
The baby in 440. Boy or girl?

52
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,248
Zahra Kashani.
Did she have a boy or girl?

53
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,318
- Boy.
- Girl.

54
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:37,253
Put one of each.

55
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,900
Dilip. Dilip!

56
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:56,237
- Where am I tonight?
- Shamiana. Shamiana Restaurant.

57
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,407
Yeah, okay. Thank you very much.
I'll call. Bye.

58
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,176
Prahba, we have another
VIP guest on the way.

59
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,879
Mrs. Kashani's daughter's
arriving shortly.

60
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,414
<i>Zahra Kashani.</i>

61
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,449
<i>She's just had a child
with an American.</i>

62
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,384
- He's just sleepy.
- <i>David Duncan.</i>

63
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,521
- Hey, man, how far to the hotel?
- <i>He's an architect.</i>

64
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:14,955
- About two blocks, sir.
- Perfect. Thank you.

65
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:17,091
I think it's, like, 45 minutes.

66
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:19,563
<i>Their suite is ready,
so head to the main lobby and greet them.</i>

67
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,333
<i>They should be arriving
any minute now.</i>

68
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,001
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

69
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:29,537
<i>Congratulate them on the baby,</i>

70
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,605
<i>but do not mention the wedding.</i>

71
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:33,307
<i>They're not married?</i>

72
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,077
<i>They are,</i>
<i>but Zahra was already pregnant.</i>

73
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:38,379
<i>So the mother insisted
on a private ceremony.</i>

74
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:39,647
<i>No publicity.</i>

75
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,150
Oh, wow.

76
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,655
- Hello, how are you, Prahba?
- Namaste.

77
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,357
How splendid to have
you back with us again, Zahra.

78
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,058
- Thank you.
- Namaste.

79
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,560
And this is Sally, our nanny.

80
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,195
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

81
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,297
Namaste.

82
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,399
Congratulations.

83
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:01,035
- Thank you so much. Namaste.
- And welcome. Namaste.

84
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,405
- Thank you.
- This is cool.

85
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:05,339
We hope you have a good stay.

86
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,608
Thank you.
Thanks, Prahba.

87
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,344
And so, please,
if you'd follow me.

88
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,547
Everything that you ordered
has been placed,

89
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,015
but if you need anything else
please feel free to ask.

90
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:18,686
- <i>Prahba?</i>
- Nisha's just taking them up now, sir.

91
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,421
<i>Have you booked</i>
<i>their dinner reservations?</i>

92
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:22,256
Yes, sir. 9:00 p.m.
at the Shamiana.

93
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:24,558
<i>Just book a table</i>
<i>for them in all our restaurants.</i>

94
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,026
<i>If she changes her mind
and we don't have room,</i>

95
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,562
<i>her mother is gonna kill me.</i>

96
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:29,697
<i>Doing it now, sir.</i>

97
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,600
This way.

98
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:34,402
Welcome back to the Taj.

99
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,737
- Wow.
- We've drawn a bath just to your liking.

100
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:39,609
- Forty-eight degrees.
- Thank you, Jomon. That's too kind.

101
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,443
- Ah, look at that.
- Where's my little boy?

102
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:45,379
- Wanna go see Mum?
- Hello, my gorgeous boy. Yes.

103
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,016
Yes.

104
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:51,552
- Look at the champagne.
- Oh, my God. How cute is this?

105
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,423
I still think he's a bit warm.

106
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:56,257
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

107
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,992
- Shh, little boy.
- Hey, baby, where's the...

108
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,693
- Corner cupboard.
- Corner cupboard.

109
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:02,730
Shall I call a doctor
just to be on the safe side?

110
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:05,265
Yeah.
Just to be on the safe side.

111
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,768
And your 9:00 p.m.
reservation at the Shamiana?

112
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,503
I don't know. What do you think?

113
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:12,573
- You wanna get room service?
- Oh, no. You two should go.

114
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,742
You could always just
nip back up when he gets here.

115
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:18,412
I'll keep your reservation.
And you come at your convenience, or not.

116
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,349
- As you wish.
- Thank you, Jomon.

117
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,486
Let's go.

118
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,389
Come on, I'm gonna go change.
Let's go to dinner.

119
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,426
Naughty Daddy. Naughty.

120
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:35,463
- There's a whole other room back here.
- Oh, my gosh. What's going on?

121
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,220
Ajmal?

122
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,331
-Ajmal, where are you?
-I'm in the toilet come quickly.

123
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,269
Ajmal?

124
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,599
Coming! Coming!

125
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,735
Hands.

126
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:30,579
Very good.

127
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:34,482
Turn around.

128
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,253
Okay, good. Very good.

129
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:40,622
Show me your socks.

130
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:43,489
Mm.

131
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,559
Okay, relax.

132
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:48,461
You need a neat cut.
Not this stretching down.

133
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,196
Good. Nice.

134
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:51,767
Relax. Good.

135
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,745
Is this a joke?

136
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:07,548
Forgive me, sir.
I... I lost my shoes.

137
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,585
They must've fallen
from my bag.

138
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,354
Go home, Arjun.

139
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,854
Everyone else, let's move.

140
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:16,456
Sir. Sir, please.

141
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,757
Please what?

142
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,559
You look like a beggar.

143
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,628
Sir, please. I'll find some shoes.
I need this shift.

144
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,298
You need to leave.

145
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,166
Sir. Sir, please.

146
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,203
My wife's going to give birth
any day now.

147
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:30,605
Please.

148
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,745
There's an extra pair of shoes
in my room.

149
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:37,512
Under the desk.

150
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:39,613
Thank you, sir.

151
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:40,548

00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,387
We'll kill these fuckers.

164
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,389
All of them!

165
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,317
Let's go!

166
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,486
Kill the bastards!
Kill them all.

167
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:29,455
<i>The biggest
worry at this point in time is that...</i>

168
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:32,793
<i>there is a fear amongst the cops
who are still trying to figure out</i>

169
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:37,362
<i>the source of firing and if
a police car has been hijacked</i>

170
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:40,066
<i>by the perpetrators of this gun battle.</i>

171
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:43,369
<i>This is the biggest fear right
now in the minds of the police</i>

172
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,706
<i>because there was a point
where there... There came a gun...</i>

173
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,348
<i>Well, there you saw...
You saw a police van,</i>

174
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,852
<i>a police Toyota Qualis,</i>

175
00:15:58,586 --> 00:15:59,821
<i>being driven...</i>

176
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:02,290
<i>and indiscriminate fire.</i>

177
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,909
Sir, these are for the Sindhi
wedding in the Ocean Room.

178
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,509
The kimchis are for
the trade delegation in Wasabi.

179
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:27,013
The MPs are already at
the Harbour Bar, quite drunk.

180
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:27,949
Mm-hmm.

181
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:30,484
More lemongrass, sir?

182
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:32,419
Arjun...

183
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,987
stop limping.

184
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,858
- Yeah, more lemongrass.
- Thank you.

185
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:39,425
What about the Russian?

186
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:40,660
Booked into the Shamiana, sir.

187
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:42,630
He has party later.
He wants help.

188
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:44,997
Okay. Everyone.

189
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,632
Everyone, listen in, please.
Come on.

190
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:49,135
Leave that. Come on.
Come here. Come here. Yes.

191
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:51,604
Okay. Come on. Come, hurry up.

192
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:57,979
So...

193
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,682
<i>we have another VIP guest
dining at the Shamiana tonight.</i>

194
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,117
<i>Vasili Gordetsky.</i>

195
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,886
- Sir.
- <i>He can be difficult.</i>

196
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:08,421
Mr. Gordetsky,
so nice to see you again.

197
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:11,458
<i>Whatever he says,</i>
<i>just smile, be polite,</i>

198
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:13,027
<i>be courteous.</i>

199
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:15,897
Remember, always,
here at the Taj,

200
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,565
guest is God.

201
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:22,802
<i>Under no circumstances you are
to recommend seafood to him.</i>

202
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:24,739
<i>He's allergic to it.</i>

203
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:28,708
<i>Never, ever serve him drink
in a glass.</i>

204
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,943
<i>Always a bottle.</i>

205
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:34,048
<i>And make sure that you open the
bottle in front of him, directly.</i>

206
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,891
I'll take the one...

207
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,018
with curly hair.

208
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,324
Yes, she's sexy.

209
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,146
And...

210
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,454
also...

211
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,414
The tall one.

212
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,451
What did he say?
Give him the phone.

213
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:02,843
The tall one.
She has big nipples or small nipples?

214
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:07,081
Good. Okay, send them both.

215
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:09,851
Who speaks like that?

216
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:18,124
After dinner, Mr. Gordetsky is
having a private party in his suite.

217
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:21,227
He will need a waiter.
Of course, there will be large tips.

218
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,229
Sir, Olga speaks Russian.

219
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:27,533
No. Never a female staff.
We can't have a repeat of last time.

220
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:30,605
- Sir, I would be honored to serve...
- No thank you, Arjun.

221
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,139
Sir, please,
I will ensure that...

222
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:35,476
You will ensure that you arrive
in the proper footwear.

223
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:42,581
Sanjay, you will serve at
the Russian's party tonight.

224
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,751
Go to Elia's and get two
bottles of Vernier Dejeune.

225
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:48,520
- Wanjidon. Thank you, sir.
- What did you say?

226
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:50,091
"Wanjidon".
What is "Wanjidon"?

227
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,025
It's Vernier Dejeune.

228
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:54,126
Verdijan.

229
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,695
It is Vernier Dejeune.
With V.

230
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,230
V. Ver...

231
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,866
- It's with V. Vernier Dejeune.
- V. Ver...

232
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,269
- Don't repeat V. Just say Vernier Dejeune.
- V...

233
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,104
Not V! Vernier Dejeune!

234
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:06,571
Wanjidon.

235
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:09,241
Vernier Dejeune.

236
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:10,276
It's a cognac.

237
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:11,844
Go!

238
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,582
Werdijan. Werdijan.
Thank you, sir. Werdijan.

239
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:45,710
You won't believe the kind of
women he's got coming over tonight.

240
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:46,980
The Russian guy, yeah.

241
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:50,118
Ha. Aye, they're knockouts.

242
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,120
Ten out of ten, man.

243
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:54,120
Yeah.

244
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:56,755
Come in... in an hour. Yeah.

245
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,357
Oi!

246
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,990
Are you fucking blind?

247
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,292
You didn't see me coming?!
You didn't see?!

248
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:04,077
Who drives like this?!

249
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,580
You can't see straight!
You jumped in front of my car!

250
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,462
So what, you'd run me over?!

251
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,839
What are you looking at?

252
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:13,207
Go!

253
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:15,643
Go!

254
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,800
What's your problem?!

255
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,945
Check these dudes out.

256
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:21,247
He's going off. Look.

257
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:23,048
They are going nuts.

258
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,250
Look at him.
Look at the little angry butler.

259
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,851
Look at him.

260
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,254
- Babe. Babe. Hi. Eddie.
- Check him out.

261
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,155
I'm putting money
on the little butler man.

262
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:31,723
- Taj.
- Taj.

263
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,124
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go. All right.

264
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,360
Let's go.

265
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:36,295
We're going to the Taj.

266
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,663
- We're going to the Taj.
- We're going to the Taj.

267
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:41,269
Um, hang on. Let's go.
Uh, excuse me, sir.

268
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:45,204
- Namaste, mate.
- Namaste.

269
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,106
I think we've got
a little problem here

270
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:50,244
because, um, we...
we didn't order this pork thing.

271
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:52,579
Yes.

272
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,848
No, no, no.
I don't think so.

273
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,416
Because if you just look here,
we didn't actually...

274
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,093
Fuck! Bree, get down!

275
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:17,697
This way.

276
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:21,935
Come on, come on! Go! Go! Run!

277
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,005
Go, babe! Go!

278
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,739
Come on, go! Come on!

279
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:29,275
Come on!

280
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:31,379
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

281
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,291
If I may, uh...

282
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:47,492
2003 was a very good year
for Bordeaux

283
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,894
due to the exceptional
heat wave that year.

284
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:53,231
Uh, the Château Latour, there...

285
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:57,835
Amazing depth, powerful yet silky,
dark fruit, seamless finish.

286
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,204
It's a very good wine.

287
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,174
- Hm. Yeah.
- That sounds nice.

288
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:03,944
Um...

289
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,114
You know what? Why don't you
just bring me a JD and Diet Coke.

290
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,217
- Really?
- Yeah.

291
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:14,152
And you know what? Bring us a
cheeseburger for old times' sake.

292
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:15,853
Chicken or fish, sir?

293
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:17,491
No. Just a regular burger. Beef.

294
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:20,428
Oh. They don't have beef here.

295
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:24,165
- Yeah. They got everything here.
- Honey, cows are sacred in India.

296
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:28,369
- I am so sorry. I completely spaced. Uh...
- It's okay.

297
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,836
Okay, so what do you recommend?
What's...

298
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:34,139
- The lamb kofta is popular with Americans.
- Hi, Sally.

299
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,909
Hey, Zahra.

300
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:39,310
No. I've just checked in with reception.
They said the doctor's still on their way.

301
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,049
No, no. He's more than fine.

302
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,486
Yeah, he had a big feed
and I just put him down.

303
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:50,523
Sure, I'll call you then.

304
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,826
But, really, we're all good.

305
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:55,362
Okay.

306
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,297
Enjoy.

307
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,104
Thank you, sir. And how would
you like to make the payment?

308
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,366
There's
been an attack. Is the hotel safe?!

309
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,618
Yes, of course.

310
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,994
So everything is okay there?

311
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,786
Yes, sir. All okay here.

312
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:27,392
Good evening, Taj Palace Hotel.

313
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:29,795
Hi there.
Just checking about the doctor.

314
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:32,330
Okay. So, next trip,
I have an idea.

315
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,900
Let's go, just the two of us.

316
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,034
Yeah, I'd like that.

317
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:37,971
Christ! Go!

318
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,040
Come on!

319
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,042
Come on! Go!

320
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:43,810
Run!

321
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:49,113
Please, please, open.

322
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:03,362
...door, man.
Just fucking open the door!

323
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:05,366
My girlfriend's...
This is my girl...

324
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,535
Security.
Can we get security, now?

325
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,503
Dilip, look.

326
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:12,339
Eddie!

327
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:14,873
We've got a reservation, mate.

328
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:18,109
Let them in.
It's okay. Let them all in.

329
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:19,845
Bree, we're in.
Thank you. Thank you.

330
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:28,588
Bree, come on, babe.
Come on.

331
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:31,689
Excuse me.

332
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:33,026
- Eddie, let's go somewhere else.
- Lani, is it?

333
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,607
Ah. Wow, wow.

334
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,381
Have you ever seen such a place?

335
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,340
Imran...

336
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,842
It's just a hotel.

337
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,354
It looks like paradise.

338
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:02,982
Let's unpack here.

339
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,897
A bit further back.

340
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,613
The
girls are in my suite already?

341
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,528
Okay.

342
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,204
Start without me,
and I'll be up after dinner.

343
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,487
Sir,
I have no record of your booking.

344
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:37,457
Please, if we could just...

345
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:41,194
- Listen, would you please call our family?
- Sir.

346
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,251
Lights. Switch off the lights.

347
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:08,521
Down. Down. Everyone down. Down.

348
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:10,956
Please, under the tables.

349
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:15,962
Bree!

350
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:27,104
Under the tables.
Down, down, please, please!

351
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:29,207
Please, down.
Down, down, sir, please.

352
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:31,542
- Who are they? They have machine guns.
- Sir, down. You must hide.

353
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:33,544
- Where is security?
- Please, sir.

354
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:49,629
Hey.

355
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,478
Go.

356
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,161
It's okay. It's okay.

357
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,735
Pick up, Sally.

358
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:37,677
Hey.

359
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:45,522
Phase one is complete, Brother.

360
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,311
We're moving upstairs.

361
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:48,983
Well done,
you've done good work.

362
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,399
One thing...

363
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,574
Keep your
phone on at all times.

364
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,976
I want to hear their
cries with my own ears.

365
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:59,446
These animals have no humanity,
Abdullah, remember this.

366
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,658
Yes Brother.

367
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,991
None of them
deserve Allah's mercy.

368
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:04,907
Yes Brother. God is great.

369
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:06,707
God is great.

370
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:37,435
Hello?

371
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:40,203
Sir, sir, this is the reception.

372
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:41,441
This is the reception.

373
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:46,677
There's a security issue here. No.
Please, don't leave your room, sir.

374
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,214
I'll be in touch, sir.

375
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:49,782
Yes, sir. Yeah.

376
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,665
Room service.

377
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,701
Laundry.

378
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:12,905
Laundry.

379
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,363
Hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh.

380
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:40,865
You're okay. Come on, Cameron.

381
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:43,736
Coming.

382
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,339
- Hey, David.
- Sally, thank God. Where are you?

383
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,775
- <i>Where's Cameron? Where's Cameron?</i>
- Sorry, what?

384
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:53,643
- Where's Cameron?
- Where's Cameron?

385
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,845
The doctor's just here now.

386
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:57,580
Just a second.

387
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,551
Sorry, it keeps breaking up.
I can't quite hear you.

388
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:01,751
Don't answer the door.

389
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:03,388
<i>Sally!</i>

390
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,259
Oh, my God.

391
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:10,595
Zahra.

392
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:13,398
Zahra, this woman just...

393
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:17,935
Sally, what's happening?

394
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:30,583
Shh, shh, shh.

395
00:32:12,424 --> 00:32:14,292
Shh, shh, shh.

396
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,277
Where is she?

397
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,277
She's here somewhere.

398
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,649
I saw her come in.

399
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,800
- Houssam.
- Huh?

400
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:03,073
Come out.

401
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,375
- Come out.
- Imran.

402
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:49,527
Houssam?

403
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,241
Houssam, come here!
Look at this.

404
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,198
Look, they have a
machine to flush their shit.

405
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,415
Even shitting is fun.

406
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,078
Imran?

407
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,249
Oh...

408
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,416
Hello, Brother.

409
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,588
Imran! What's happening?

410
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,796
I've just finished
killing another woman.

411
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:08,628
Well done.

412
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,934
Now listen...
I have to tell you something.

413
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,220
Yes, Brother?

414
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,514
Stand them up in
a doorway next time.

415
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:18,390
So when the bullet goes through
their heads, it goes outside.

416
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,892
You don't want it ricocheting
back into the room.

417
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,352
Okay?

418
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:23,562
Okay, Brother. Okay.

419
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,814
There are a few
people gathered downstairs,

420
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,686
throw some grenades at them.

421
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,901
There's no harm in throwing
a few grenades, my brother.

422
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:30,694
Grenades?

423
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:31,895
Yes! Yes!

424
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:32,988
Yes, Brother.

425
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,656
We will give them a surprise.

426
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,066
Throw some grenades.

427
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,289
Okay, okay, Brother.

428
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,368
What did he say?

429
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,080
He said "Throw the grenades."

430
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:42,422
Yeah, we've got some.
Let's throw them.

431
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,133
Shh, shh, shh.

432
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:28,154
What is happening?
Where's Cameron?

433
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:32,622
There were men with guns. Just boys.
They... They came in, but we hid.

434
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:34,823
- <i>They came into the room?</i>
- <i>Oh, my God. David.</i>

435
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:40,029
There was a woman that came
in and they... they just shot her...

436
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:42,799
Okay, okay. You stay right where you are.
I'm coming there.

437
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,002
- I'm coming right now.
- Hey!

438
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:46,970
Shut your fucking mouth.

439
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,140
You'll get us all killed.

440
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,213
Look at me.
I need you to stay right here.

441
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:57,749
I need you to be strong, okay?

442
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,685
I love you so much.

443
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:04,887
We need the police,
right now. Right now.

444
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:07,058
We've called you five times.
Please, send someone.

445
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,626
- Sir, please, please.
- My kid is upstairs.

446
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,296
Sir, sir, listen, listen.

447
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:13,698
Please, please, sir.

448
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:15,767
Do you have a family?

449
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:18,801
Yes, and I hope
to stay alive and see them.

450
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:21,738
- I'm going out that door.
- No, no, no, sir...

451
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,974
- I need to piss. I need to piss.
- You can't.

452
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:30,949
I need to pee.

453
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:33,883
Use this. Okay?

454
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,051
- You piss in this. I'm not an animal.
- No, madam. Please.

455
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:36,888
Please. No, madam. Please.

456
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,995
Madam, this way. Hurry.

457
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:20,859
Rashid!

458
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,110
Try this.

459
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,944
What is it?

460
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,520
It's very tasty, try it.

461
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:25,625
You ate this?!

462
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,283
Go on, try it.

463
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,415
You moron!

464
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,412
This is pork, throw it away!

465
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:33,544
Spit! Spit! Spit!

466
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,501
Do you need water?

467
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,127
Take it, take it.

468
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,589
May Allah forgive you.

469
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,892
You dumbass, they're vegetables.

470
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:54,814
Watch.

471
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,615
Eat it.

472
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,315
Fucking asshole.

473
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,527
Why are you getting angry?

474
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:02,648
Go away.

475
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,944
Imran, I was just kidding!

476
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,263
Get fucked.

477
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,114
-We need to go upstairs!
-I'll go from the other end.

478
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,576
Imran, come back, buddy.

479
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:53,378
Sally.

480
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,518
Oh, God.

481
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,121
Thank God you're here.
Thank God.

482
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:17,198
Where's Cameron?
Where is he?

483
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:19,803
David.

484
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,604
Hey.

485
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:25,142
Hey. It's okay.

486
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,277
Hi.

487
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,017
It's okay.

488
00:41:37,988 --> 00:41:40,257
Thank you. Thank you.

489
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,260
Thank you. Thank you.

490
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:45,896
Who are these people?

491
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:49,132
What do they want with us?

492
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,034
Hey. Shh, shh.

493
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,070
Will you message Zahra for me?

494
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:55,038
Can you tell her
we made it okay?

495
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:57,507
Yeah.

496
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,478
It's okay.

497
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:05,215
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

498
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,517
It's gonna be okay.

499
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,326
<i>Mumbai under siege.</i>

500
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,494
<i>Chaos has erupted
in India's financial capital</i>

501
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,196
<i>with multiple bombings</i>

502
00:42:21,198 --> 00:42:23,567
<i>and reports of armed gunmen
rampaging though the city.</i>

503
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:28,298
Papa will come
home and we'll play together.

504
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,554
It's okay, Seva.

505
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,261
It's okay.

506
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:33,885
It's okay...

507
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,276
It's okay.

508
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,347
<i>...and
luxury hotels are all under attack.</i>

509
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:40,649
<i>Local police are simply
not trained or equipped</i>

510
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:44,353
<i>to deal with multiple military
grade attacks of this magnitude.</i>

511
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:48,556
<i>What you're seeing now is chaos
outside the celebrated Taj Hotel.</i>

512
00:42:48,558 --> 00:42:51,493
<i>Terrorists have laid siege
to the landmark property,</i>

513
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:56,233
<i>with as many as 1,000 guests and
over 500 staff trapped inside.</i>

514
00:42:57,567 --> 00:43:00,368
<i>Mumbai has no Special
Forces units of its own,</i>

515
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:05,075
<i>meaning tactical units must be sent
in from New Delhi over 800 miles away.</i>

516
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:08,209
<i>They are hours away
at the very least.</i>

517
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,248
<i>And it is bedlam here
on the ground at the Taj.</i>

518
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,452
Get them back!

519
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,315
Hey, cameras back! Go back!

520
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,811
Cameras get back! Get them back!
Get them back now!

521
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:38,742
I've got four men.

522
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:40,164
-Only four?
-Yes.

523
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,042
We have to do something.

524
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,581
Special Forces are hours away,
they're still in Delhi.

525
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,503
-Still in Delhi?!
-Yes.

526
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,842
And we have orders to
stand down until they arrive.

527
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,673
We have to do something...

528
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,634
The CCTV room is
on the second floor.

529
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:56,336
So?

530
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:57,467
So?!

531
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,313
We'll go up there!

532
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,596
We'll see their positions!
We can't just wait here.

533
00:44:04,568 --> 00:44:07,168
Help! Help me!

534
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,104
Help!

535
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,746
My girlfriend. My girlfriend.
She's still in there.

536
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:21,485
Bree. Bree! Bree!

537
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,286
If we just stand here...

538
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,173
there won't be anyone left.

539
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:32,462
Okay. Okay. CCTV room.

540
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:54,351
There's still shooting
downstairs and in the east wing.

541
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:57,387
Safest would be
go up to the Chambers Lounge.

542
00:44:58,088 --> 00:44:59,222
Yes, sixth floor.

543
00:45:00,457 --> 00:45:01,491
Okay, Arjun.

544
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:04,795
Okay. Call me
if you hear anything.

545
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,234
Service stairs are all clear.

546
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,506
But our guests are trapped
all through the hotel.

547
00:45:18,475 --> 00:45:20,544
I think we should try and gather
whoever we can...

548
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:25,813
and take them to the Chambers Lounge
and wait for the police to arrive.

549
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:27,684
Sir, Olga made it
through the back exit.

550
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:29,817
We can do the same.

551
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,655
Yes, but our guests can't.

552
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:33,356
Not all of them.

553
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:39,796
Sir, I have four kids at home.

554
00:45:40,764 --> 00:45:41,665
I know, Dilip.

555
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,634
Nobody is forcing you to stay.

556
00:45:47,804 --> 00:45:50,607
So, whoever wants to try
and make it out...

557
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:53,743
this is your time.

558
00:45:56,646 --> 00:45:57,580
I'm sorry, sir.

559
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,582
Don't apologize.

560
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:02,418
Go.

561
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:22,372
Many of you have wives,
parents, families at home.

562
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,342
There is no shame in leaving.

563
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,746
I've been here 35 years.
This is my home.

564
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:34,282
- I'm staying too.
- I'm staying too.

565
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:35,750
- I'm with you, sir.
- I'm with you, sir.

566
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:36,884
Me too.

567
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,121
Guest is God, sir.

568
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:44,895
Follow me.

569
00:46:53,302 --> 00:46:55,437
Here.
Wrap that around your head.

570
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,708
So they know
you are one of them.

571
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:00,844
I'm not one of them.

572
00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:06,681
Sir, madam.
I just spoke to my boss.

573
00:47:06,683 --> 00:47:08,683
He says we should come
upstairs to the Chambers Club.

574
00:47:08,685 --> 00:47:10,185
- We'll be safer there.
- Why?

575
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:11,655
You know something?

576
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:14,589
How many there are,
where they are?

577
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:17,425
I'm not sure, sir. But the Chambers, sir,
is the most secure place in the hotel...

578
00:47:17,427 --> 00:47:19,462
I know what
the fucking Chambers is.

579
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,864
- Is the passage clear?
- Yes, sir.

580
00:47:22,866 --> 00:47:26,436
We... We'll go via the service stairs.
We'll leave in a couple of minutes, okay?

581
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:34,307
<i>Survivors speak of
gunmen dressed in western clothes,</i>

582
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,243
<i>coolly and methodically</i>

583
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:38,445
<i>mowing down
commuters in cold blood.</i>

584
00:47:38,447 --> 00:47:40,313
<i>Bloodstains here.</i>

585
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,483
<i>These are the first pictures
of those bloodstains.</i>

586
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:47,287
<i>An unknown number of gunmen
now fully control the Taj Hotel.</i>

587
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:51,291
<i>And according to this witness,
are methodically executing hotel guests</i>

588
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:53,728
<i>floor by floor and room by room.</i>

589
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,530
<i>They had bombs.
There was a lot of smoke. And they...</i>

590
00:47:56,532 --> 00:48:00,367
Shh. Dad, you need to calm down.
I'm fine.

591
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:02,570
<i>...to fight urban warfare.</i>

592
00:48:02,572 --> 00:48:04,574
Well, I don't know what they're
saying, but I promise you, I'm okay.

593
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,812
No, I know. I'm safe
and I'm in the hotel room.

594
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:12,279
<i>They wanted anyone
with British or American passports.</i>

595
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:15,483
Look, the police are here now, so
I'm sure we'll be out of here any minute.

596
00:48:17,754 --> 00:48:18,855
The fourth floor.

597
00:48:23,592 --> 00:48:24,927
No. They haven't come up here.

598
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,831
They won't.

599
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:33,368
I gotta go, Dad.

600
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,304
I'll call you
when we're out, okay?

601
00:48:36,305 --> 00:48:38,705
<i>...inclusion of</i>
<i>Chabad house, a Jewish center,</i>

603

<i>that Muslim fundamentalists

604

Wait here.
I'll signal if it's safe, okay?

607
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,685
Come, come.

608
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:29,725
Come, come. Quiet.

00:49:33,629 --> 00:49:34,530
Come, come.

Come, come.

611
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,894
Mr. Oberoi, sir. Are you there?

612
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,562
Sir.

613
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:43,998
Sir. Sir, it's me,
Arjun from Shamiana.

614
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,932
Okay.

615
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:50,706
Arjun.

616
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:53,742
Please come. Come, come.

617
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,776
Nothing to fear. Please come.

618
00:50:56,778 --> 00:50:58,380
Yes. Please.

619
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:01,717
Hi.

620
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:03,518
How are we feeling?

621
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,020
Yeah, everything's fine.

622
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:07,122
Everything is fine.

623
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:17,833
Please, please. This way.
Take a seat. We have water...

624
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,568
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
- Jomon.

625
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,638
I'm so sorry. Everything will be fine now.
You're totally safe.

626
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,606
Sit anywhere you like, okay?

627
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,912
No problem. Please, please.

628
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:30,579
Welcome, sir.

629
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:34,683
- I would like a cognac. Vernier Dejeune.
- Of course. Of course, sir.

630
00:51:36,752 --> 00:51:37,853
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

631
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:40,454
Take a seat, sir.

632
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:58,807
Ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

633
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,508
Can you come closer?
Arjun, can you just help them?

634
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,977
Little further. I don't...
I don't want to speak loudly. Please.

635
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:06,780
Can you come closer, sir?
Sir, ma'am? Please.

636
00:52:06,782 --> 00:52:09,751
Sir, you can...
Can you come forward, please? Thank you.

637
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,457
Ladies and gentlemen...

638
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:20,462
I am Hemant Oberoi,
head chef here at the Taj.

639
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:24,933
We are all terribly sorry for everything
you've had to endure here tonight.

640
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:30,538
But please be rest assured
the worst is behind us now.

641
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:36,144
The Chambers is an exclusive club.
Very difficult to access.

642
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:39,646
As you can see,
there are no internal windows

643
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:42,217
and every entrance
has been secured.

644
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:46,920
We will be safe here until
police comes and fetches us.

645
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:48,822
When will that be?

646
00:52:48,824 --> 00:52:50,690
- What's taking them so long?
- Ma'am.

647
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:53,595
They're outside right now.
It's just a matter of time.

648
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:58,533
Yes, what's important
is that we remain calm and quiet

649
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:02,205
because we want our position
to remain a secret.

650
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:09,075
<i>The situation inside the
hotel is becoming utterly desperate.</i>

651
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:12,845
<i>Footage just in of this man forced
to flee on a rope improvised...</i>

652
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,515
Come on. We should get going.

653
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:17,185
Going? Where?

654
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:19,319
The staff's moving everybody up to the
Chambers Lounge on the sixth floor.

655
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,087
They said it'll be safer.

656
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:22,255
No way.

657
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:23,790
Sally. Come on.

658
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:25,526
You can go.
I'm not going anywhere.

659
00:53:27,362 --> 00:53:29,029
David. There are men
with guns out there

660
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,864
that are just killing people
in the hallway.

661
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:32,601
- There's no way that I'm going out there.
- I know.

662
00:53:33,602 --> 00:53:36,036
And Zahra's out there
and she's by herself.

663
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,673
They came in here.
They fucking shot her, David.

664
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,941
Like a fucking rabbit.
And if we move and if the baby wakes up,

665
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:44,246
- they're gonna shoot us too.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

666
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,948
I mean,
the cops are already outside.

667
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,053
Can't we just wait for them
to come and get us?

668
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,057
Yeah.

669
00:53:58,059 --> 00:53:58,959
Okay.

670
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:48,707
Kanu!

671
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:50,978
Kanu!

672
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,115
Kanu!

673
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,317
Kanu!

674
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:08,027
<i>It's been a night and
a morning of gun battles in Mumbai.</i>

675
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:12,465
<i>Perhaps never before has a city been
attacked in a coordinated yet random</i>

676
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:15,034
<i>and completely mindless manner.</i>

677
00:55:15,036 --> 00:55:18,138
<i>There have been hours and hours
of indiscriminate terror</i>

678
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,806
<i>on the streets of Mumbai</i>

679
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:23,109
<i>and we still don't seem to be
at the end of it.</i>

680
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,812
<i>Let's get you the big headlines
from Mumbai.</i>

681
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:29,816
<i>At least 78 people are dead
and nearly 200 injured</i>

682
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:32,152
<i>in a series of attacks
in south Mumbai.</i>

683
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:35,154
<i>Three five-star hotels,
a petrol pump in Colaba,</i>

684
00:55:35,156 --> 00:55:39,660
<i>the CST station, the Cama
Hospital, all come under attack.</i>

685
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:43,896
<i>Mumbai's majestic Taj Hotel
is still burning</i>

686
00:55:43,898 --> 00:55:47,799
<i>while gun battles continue between
security forces and terrorists.</i>

687
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:50,372
Would you like a drink?

688
00:55:51,273 --> 00:55:53,373
How much longer, Mr. Savanth?

689
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,807
You're the chief of police.
What's going on?

690
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:57,210
<i>The head of our terror squad</i>

691
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:59,379
<i>was gunned down
in his car tonight, Mr. Oberoi.</i>

692
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,915
<i>And Special Forces
are yet to leave Delhi.</i>

693
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,051
Still in Delhi?

694
00:56:04,419 --> 00:56:07,053
Then send somebody from here.
Use the police force for God's sake.

695
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:10,123
<i>We sent in a local squad an hour ago
but we haven't heard a word since.</i>

696
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,325
God is watching over you my child.

697
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,081
Close your eyes,
let's pray together.

698
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,398
Prayers?

699
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:19,344
What good have prayers
ever done us, Mother?

700
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:21,129
What can I say?

701
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:22,511
I'm worried about you.

702
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:24,238
I'm sorry.

703
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:27,839
I just wanna be home.

704
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,426
I love you. I'll pray for you.

705
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:32,933
I'll call you.

706
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,445
Okay, my dear.

707
00:56:39,153 --> 00:56:40,921
Who were you speaking with?

708
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:43,489
What?

709
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:45,291
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

710
00:56:45,293 --> 00:56:46,461
None of your business.

711
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:51,097
She's one of them.

712
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:53,799
- What are you trying to say?
- You're talking that language.

713
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:55,834
Are you calling me a terrorist?

714
00:56:55,836 --> 00:56:58,137
- What are you trying to say? Just say it.
- Why won't you answer?

715
00:56:58,139 --> 00:56:59,872
Why won't you tell me
who you were...

716
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,008
She's with me.

717
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,576
- I need you to tell me. She's one...
- Hey. Shut your mouth.

718
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:06,079
Shut up. Walk away.

719
00:57:06,081 --> 00:57:07,981
Your behavior
is disgraceful.

720
00:57:07,983 --> 00:57:09,481
- Go fuck yourself. Walk away.
- Shh. Shh.

721
00:57:09,483 --> 00:57:11,550
Madam, come. Come.
It's okay, sir. It's okay.

722
00:57:11,552 --> 00:57:13,285
I saw her.

723
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:14,587
With everything going on,
that's what she tells me?

724
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:16,021
- You're okay?
- No, seriously.

725
00:57:16,023 --> 00:57:17,222
Don't worry.
She's total bitch.

726
00:57:17,224 --> 00:57:18,257
Come, come.

727
00:57:18,259 --> 00:57:19,592
Look at that face.

728
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:21,762
She's not been fucked
for ten years.

729
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:23,063
Minimum.

730
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:27,134
- Hey.
- Thank you.

731
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:32,139
Is crazy situation
but we just have to wait.

732
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,541
We'll be fine.

733
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:47,555
Arjun. Arjun.

734
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:49,090
Sorry.

735
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,526
- Yes, sir.
- See the English woman over there?

736
00:57:53,528 --> 00:57:54,529
At the food station?

737
00:57:57,298 --> 00:57:58,198
Ha.

738
00:57:58,966 --> 00:58:00,234
She's worried about your beard.

739
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:02,970
- My beard.
- Uh-huh.

740
00:58:03,537 --> 00:58:05,072
Also your turban.

741
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,206
Hang back in the kitchen
for a little bit, huh?

742
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,109
Good boy.

743
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:23,922
Madam.

744
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:26,428
I'd like
to show you something.

745
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,130
This is my family.

746
00:58:33,435 --> 00:58:35,470
This is my... This is my child.

747
00:58:37,238 --> 00:58:38,206
Here's Seva.

748
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:44,478
That's my wife and her quite...
quite awful sister.

749
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:53,120
This is my...
This is my pagri.

750
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:57,524
To us Sikhs it is...
it is sacred.

751
00:58:59,426 --> 00:59:05,399
It's a... It's a symbol
of honor and courage.

752
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:15,477
Since I was a small boy,
I've never gone outside without it.

753
00:59:18,212 --> 00:59:21,148
To do so would...
It would bring shame to my family.

754
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,218
But...

755
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,088
while we are in this hotel,
you are my guest.

756
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:31,524
And I am your staff.

757
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,428
So, if it would make you feel
comfortable, I will take it off.

758
00:59:35,596 --> 00:59:36,497
Would you like that?

759
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:38,499
No.

760
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,567
No.

761
00:59:41,468 --> 00:59:42,903
I'm just scared.

762
00:59:43,637 --> 00:59:44,671
We all are.

763
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:47,408
But...

764
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:49,910
to get through this,
we must...

765
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,277
must stick together.

766
00:59:52,279 --> 00:59:53,180
Okay?

767
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,918
Yes. Indeed.

768
00:59:58,352 --> 01:00:00,051
Thank you.

769
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:01,989
- Thank you.
- I'll bring you some water. Okay?

770
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,490
Okay.

771
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,729
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

772
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,164
- Mrs. Watson.
- <i>Yes, yes?</i>

773
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:15,368
- This is Lani from the hotel reception.
- <i>Yes.</i>

774
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,237
Ma'am, the rescue team
is on your floor.

775
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,106
- <i>They are?</i>
- Yeah.

776
01:00:19,507 --> 01:00:21,740
- They're on their way, ma'am.
- <i>Thank God.</i>

777
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:25,777
<i>Yes, yes. I can hear them.
Alex. Alex, let them in.</i>

778
01:00:33,787 --> 01:00:35,012
Call 409.

779
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,675
Hurry up and call 409!

780
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:51,651
Call 409.

781
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:54,027
Call 409!

782
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,409
Call!

783
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:31,645
Sir.

784
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:35,782
Sir.

785
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,516
Sir, open the door.

786
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:39,819
Hey. What are you doing?

787
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,620
- Sir, open.
- Don't open that door. What, you're crazy?

788
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:43,257
- You're going to get us killed.
- Quiet.

789
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,393
Mr. Oberoi, sir. It's Prahba.

790
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:51,229
- It could be a trap.
- I know what I'm doing, sir.

791
01:01:54,702 --> 01:01:56,333
Oh, my God, Prahba.

792
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:58,639
It's not my blood. Come.

793
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:00,805
Shh.

794
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:01,608
Arjun, attention!

795
01:02:03,175 --> 01:02:05,242
It's okay.
Come, come. Please, come.

796
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:11,585
Please.

797
01:02:12,886 --> 01:02:14,286
Please, please.

798
01:02:14,288 --> 01:02:15,154
Be quiet.

799
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:18,790
Madam, it's okay. It's okay.

800
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,193
It's okay.

801
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:23,662
- Is there a doctor here, please?
- It's okay.

802
01:02:23,664 --> 01:02:25,764
- A doctor or a nurse?
- I'm an ophthalmologist.

803
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:27,632
- Please come.
- I'm not sure if there's much I can do,

804
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:28,769
- but I can try.
- It's okay.

805
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,105
I... I need to see the wound.

806
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:35,843
Hey, be quiet!

807
01:02:42,182 --> 01:02:44,515
We need to tape this hole shut and
then we make a sling for her arm.

808
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:48,185
- Elastoplast, Sellotape...
- First aid box.

809
01:02:48,187 --> 01:02:50,824
Come. Hold this. Hold tight here.

810
01:02:57,464 --> 01:02:58,863
It's not good.

811
01:02:58,865 --> 01:03:00,601
I think she's bleeding
into her chest cavity.

812
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:03,837
There's no way to save her
without getting her to a hospital.

813
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:07,439
- I'll take her.
- Too risky.

814
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:09,341
If she stays, she'll die.

815
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,851
Sir, please let me take her.

816
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:21,286
We go down the back stairs and
straight out the service exit.

817
01:03:21,288 --> 01:03:22,887
Arjun, if they find you,
they find us.

818
01:03:22,889 --> 01:03:24,957
But if I make it,
we'll have a way out.

819
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:26,627
Shh.

820
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,165
We can't just
let her die here.

821
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:35,434
Okay.

822
01:03:36,402 --> 01:03:37,436
Call me when you get out.

823
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,408
It's okay.

824
01:03:44,978 --> 01:03:47,681
Madam? Madam? Madam?

825
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:49,816
I'm going to get you
out of here, okay?

826
01:03:51,685 --> 01:03:54,454
But there are some stairs.
Do you think you can stand?

827
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,693
Yes? Okay. Come on.
Slowly. Come on.

828
01:04:00,861 --> 01:04:02,396
That's it.

829
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,797
- Ma'am, you will be fine.
- Okay.

830
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:07,768
You'll be fine.
Arjun is with you. Don't worry.

831
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:11,738
Everybody please settle down.
Everything will be fine.

832
01:05:11,964 --> 01:05:13,733
It's okay. It's okay.

833
01:05:15,468 --> 01:05:17,904
It's okay, madam.
It's okay. It's okay.

834
01:05:22,843 --> 01:05:23,743
It's okay.

835
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:30,715
It's okay.

836
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,502
Hands up.

837
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,026
Keep your hands up.

838
01:05:52,105 --> 01:05:53,972
Staff, staff.
Hotel staff. Please, please...

839
01:05:53,974 --> 01:05:55,367
Who are you?

840
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:57,619
Please, I have a family!

841
01:05:58,667 --> 01:05:59,537
He's clean.

842
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:00,876
We're police.

843
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,798
This area is not safe, go back.

844
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,682
CCTV room, where is it?!

845
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:08,299
Where is the CCTV room?

846
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,928
CCTV room? Tell me!

847
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:12,723
Tell me!

848
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:19,632
Go, go!

849
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:22,334
Move. Move. Move.

850
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,111
Hang on, Brother. I'll check.

851
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:34,295
Seems Chinese.

852
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:36,082
Could be Japanese.

853
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:39,206
But she's dressed
like an American.

854
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:42,628
Good, we want Americans.
But alive next time.

855
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,460
We need rich hostages.
Important hostages.

856
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,460
No passport, no wallet. Nothing.

857
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,139
Check her bra.

858
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:54,894
Put your hand in
her bra and check there.

859
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:07,606
No, I'm so sorry Brother...

860
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,741
I can't touch her there.

861
01:07:11,483 --> 01:07:13,783
She's an infidel.
It's not a sin.

862
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:15,158
Check.

863
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:24,093
Imran, check now.

864
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:26,432
<i>Imran?</i>

865
01:07:33,873 --> 01:07:35,040
Go, go, go.

866
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:39,945
David.

867
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:42,815
Open the door. Open the door.

868
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:54,061
Get Up! Up!

869
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,237
Hands up! Hands up!

870
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:57,867
Hands up! Hands up!

871
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,287
Turn around! Turn that way!

872
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:01,959
Turn that way!

873
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:05,633
Hurry up!

874
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,762
I've got a white boy.
Chinese girl's boyfriend.

875
01:08:11,744 --> 01:08:14,177
Well done, Imran.
Take him to the suite.

876
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:16,915
And find more hostages.
Important looking hostages.

877
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:18,312
This way, this way!

878
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,524
Inshallah, Brother.

879
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:23,603
Are you deaf, asshole?
I'll fuck you up!

880
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,003
Right! Right!

881
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,903
You don't understand
left and right?!

882
01:09:15,822 --> 01:09:17,992
Yes, I'm here. Open the door.

883
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,423
Stay quiet.

884
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,259
This way, this is the room.

885
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:37,715
Go.

886
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,260
Go!

887
01:10:08,293 --> 01:10:10,792
- They're just boys.
- Hello?

888
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,252
-Hello sir.
-Yes, Patel?

889
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:13,424
We've reached the CCTV room.

890
01:10:13,964 --> 01:10:15,714
There's only two of us left.

891
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:16,716
Send more men.

892
01:10:17,202 --> 01:10:20,507
I can't,
there's too many VIPs inside.

893
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,138
We've got orders to
wait for Special Forces.

894
01:10:23,675 --> 01:10:25,177
Okay, sir.

895
01:10:26,379 --> 01:10:27,642
Hey.

896
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:29,280
Where is this room?

897
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:31,050
- The front lobby here.
- Uh-huh.

898
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,254
Western entrance hall
or Ocean Room.

899
01:10:54,339 --> 01:10:56,641
There's still
some of the good stuff left.

900
01:10:57,943 --> 01:10:59,011
Single malt.

901
01:11:00,245 --> 01:11:01,280
Twenty years old.

902
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:23,066
What the hell was that?

903
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:28,138
Colaba Police.
Open up.

904
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,242
Stay here. Stay down.

905
01:11:32,043 --> 01:11:33,843
<i>It's chaos out here, sir.
We're doing all we can.</i>

906
01:11:33,845 --> 01:11:35,212
Have you sent the men in?

907
01:11:35,214 --> 01:11:37,347
- <i>I'm sorry, what men?</i>
- The rescue squad.

908
01:11:37,349 --> 01:11:39,682
<i>Yes, Mr. Oberoi.
We sent in a squad hours ago.</i>

909
01:11:39,684 --> 01:11:40,818
<i>But most were killed.</i>

910
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,061
Mohit Singh.

911
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:52,229
Colaba Police, open up.

912
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:57,234
Have you sent any Mohit Singh
as part of the squad?

913
01:11:57,236 --> 01:11:59,107
We are here to save you.

914
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,361
There's another one!

915
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:04,307
Main lobby.

916
01:12:04,309 --> 01:12:05,408
Shit.

917
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:08,449
There's the Chambers
Lounge, there are many people there.

918
01:12:09,815 --> 01:12:12,249
<i>Yes, Mr. Oberoi.
Mohit Singh was part of the squad.</i>

919
01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:13,817
- <i>We lost contact hours ago.</i>
- Okay.

920
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:15,388
- <i>We thought he was dead.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

921
01:12:22,494 --> 01:12:24,461
Arjun, I cannot...

922
01:12:24,463 --> 01:12:26,030
Don't open the door.
That's them!

923
01:12:43,814 --> 01:12:44,948
Sir?

924
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,751
Sir?

925
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:49,286
Open up, motherfuckers.

926
01:12:50,222 --> 01:12:52,055
Move!

927
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:52,958
Out!

928
01:12:53,492 --> 01:12:54,893
Out, out!

929
01:13:00,532 --> 01:13:02,297
How many people are in there?!

930
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,129
At least fifty,
could be more by now.

931
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:06,138
Fifty people?

932
01:13:16,481 --> 01:13:17,938
How many bullets do you have?

933
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,064
Six.

934
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:19,816
You?

935
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:21,322
Same.

936
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:22,280
Open up!

937
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:25,492
Open up, fuckers!

938
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:31,451
None of you will be spared!

939
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:35,332
Okay.

940
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:38,459
Stay here
and lock the door, okay?

941
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,972
Thank you.

942
01:14:02,093 --> 01:14:04,360
Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.

943
01:14:04,362 --> 01:14:05,828
Down, down, down.

944
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,798
Down. Down, down.

945
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:15,583
Open up, motherfuckers!

946
01:14:30,622 --> 01:14:33,104
It's just one guy. Get ready.

947
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:38,030
Abdullah?

948
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:40,689
Abdullah? What is it?

949
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,467
There's two more!

950
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:46,528
There are
people in there. I heard noises.

951
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,736
We've got to shoot them.

952
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:48,653
Kill them all.

953
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,030
No, no, no.

954
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:50,992
Shoot!

955
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:14,431
- They have gone this side.
- Houssam, be careful.

956
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:15,334
Houssam?

957
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,175
Are they behind us?!

958
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:20,062
I don't know.

959
01:15:20,305 --> 01:15:22,407
Shh, shh, shh.

960
01:15:25,577 --> 01:15:27,177
No, no.

961
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:29,014
Hey, hey. It's okay.

962
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:30,849
It's okay.

963
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,621
Doctor? We need a medic please.

964
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:40,091
<i>That was an explosion.
There's lots of firing inside the hotel.</i>

965
01:15:40,524 --> 01:15:43,292
<i>Here they come.
They're coming down the steps of the Taj.</i>

966
01:15:43,294 --> 01:15:46,897
<i>We're right here at the Taj
where this action is unfolding.</i>

967
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:54,972
Hey, Houssam...

968
01:15:56,431 --> 01:16:00,561
Do you believe the Bull will
give the money to our families?

969
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:08,146
Imran, we're in
service of Allah...

970
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,150
Nothing else matters.

971
01:16:13,057 --> 01:16:15,625
The Bull says we
need more hostages, let's go.

972
01:16:15,627 --> 01:16:18,428
His leg is hurt,
it's hard for him to walk.

973
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:19,753
What happened?

974
01:16:20,564 --> 01:16:22,961
It's just a scratch.
Houssam, you go too.

975
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:24,457
Take care.

976
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:25,629
Imran...

977
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:28,338
Keep an eye on
the American, okay?

978
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,377
Alright, good.

979
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:05,040
Hello?

980
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:06,611
Father! Father, it's Imran.

981
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:09,673
Imran? Thank God. Thank God.

982
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,760
Jamilla!
Jamilla, it's your brother.

983
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,349
How's your
training going, Imran?

984
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,890
Training is going well, Father.

985
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:24,192
Father, I called to say...

986
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:28,726
Father I love you so much,
I love you all so much...

987
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,821
We all love you very much.
Your mother misses you a lot.

988
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:37,316
You're making us
all proud, my son.

989
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:41,794
Father, I wanted to ask, did
they give you the money yet?

990
01:17:42,413 --> 01:17:44,663
No, not yet my child.

991
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,373
No money yet.

992
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,465
But don't worry, these
are very noble men of Allah.

993
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:51,708
Very good people.

994
01:17:52,357 --> 01:17:55,340
Father,
make sure you get the money from them.

995
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:58,432
They swore it on the Holy Quran.

996
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:01,304
Father, give my love
to Jamilla and Mother.

997
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:02,556
-Father.
-Imran?

998
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:06,018
-Father... Father... Father
-Imran, are you there? Imran?

999
01:18:06,237 --> 01:18:07,671
<i>Imran?</i>

1000
01:19:36,392 --> 01:19:37,828
<i>"My darling David.</i>

1001
01:19:39,496 --> 01:19:42,566
<i>As I write this letter,
I'm hoping you'll never have to read it.</i>

1002
01:19:44,267 --> 01:19:46,737
<i>That I get the chance to tell
you these words in person.</i>

1003
01:19:49,707 --> 01:19:51,508
<i>You said to me
when we first met,</i>

1004
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:54,511
<i>'If you're feeling scared,
just jump.</i>

1005
01:19:55,779 --> 01:19:59,650
<i>You might fall, but you might just fly.'"</i>

1006
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,285
<i>"And you were right.</i>

1007
01:20:03,187 --> 01:20:04,154
<i>And we did.</i>

1008
01:20:06,223 --> 01:20:09,193
<i>I don't know what kind of crazy
kismet made our worlds collide.</i>

1009
01:20:11,295 --> 01:20:15,666
<i>But if we worked, it was because of
you and your patience with my family.</i>

1010
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:21,237
<i>Your belief in us made me
feel as if anything is possible.</i>

1011
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:23,573
<i>Even now.</i>

1012
01:20:24,374 --> 01:20:25,743
<i>Even in this nightmare.</i>

1013
01:20:29,847 --> 01:20:32,516
<i>I know you'll raise our son
to be the man that you are.</i>

1014
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:36,520
<i>Please remind Cameron every day
how much I love him.</i>

1015
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,690
<i>And how much I love his father.</i>

1016
01:20:41,525 --> 01:20:42,526
<i>Forever.</i>

1017
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,361
<i>Zahra."</i>

1018
01:20:52,803 --> 01:20:55,470
Stop it. Stop it, Miss Kashani.

1019
01:20:55,472 --> 01:20:57,239
Miss Kashani, please stop. Stop.

1020
01:20:57,241 --> 01:20:59,241
- Open it.
- Please, come and sit here. Please.

1021
01:20:59,243 --> 01:21:01,576
I have to be with my family.
Open the door.

1022
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:04,013
I know it's hard, but
police are very near now.

1023
01:21:04,015 --> 01:21:05,249
No one's coming.

1024
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:09,552
We've been here six hours.
Six hours for what?

1025
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,621
No one's coming for us.

1026
01:21:13,556 --> 01:21:15,659
My baby's out there.
Please open the door.

1027
01:21:16,894 --> 01:21:17,961
She's right.

1028
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:19,795
Open the door.

1029
01:21:19,797 --> 01:21:20,862
I want to go.

1030
01:21:20,864 --> 01:21:22,531
- Me too.
- Please, please.

1031
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:24,432
We cannot evacuate everyone
without being detected.

1032
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:25,734
It's not everyone.

1033
01:21:25,736 --> 01:21:27,905
There are six people.
That's all.

1034
01:21:28,839 --> 01:21:30,371
We're going. Open the door.

1035
01:21:30,373 --> 01:21:34,745
Sir, if they hear us going,
we will all die.

1036
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:37,512
They know we are here.

1037
01:21:37,514 --> 01:21:40,382
If they come back, we all die.
If they bomb the building, we die.

1038
01:21:40,384 --> 01:21:42,720
If we leave, maybe we die.
We take our chances.

1039
01:21:44,455 --> 01:21:45,656
Open the fucking door.

1040
01:21:46,356 --> 01:21:47,257
Now.

1041
01:21:58,401 --> 01:21:59,302
Very well, sir.

1042
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:12,814
- We'll be praying for you, sir.
- Yeah, fuck your prayers.

1043
01:22:12,816 --> 01:22:14,450
That's what started this shit.

1044
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:33,437
Let's go.

1045
01:23:01,999 --> 01:23:02,900
Zahra!

1046
01:23:09,773 --> 01:23:11,505
Hey. This is stupid.

1047
01:23:11,507 --> 01:23:13,442
- Come. Let's go.
- I'm getting my baby.

1048
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,081
Run.

1049
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:20,851
Hey!

1050
01:23:23,378 --> 01:23:24,621
Go that way.

1051
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:25,958
Go that way!

1052
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:28,379
Go that way!

1053
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:30,638
Go back!

1054
01:23:33,563 --> 01:23:34,463
It's okay.

1055
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:39,167
They won't kill us.
They want us alive. It's okay.

1056
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:40,308
Hey!

1057
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,021
Shut up and move.

1058
01:23:45,942 --> 01:23:47,688
Rashid, what's going on?

1059
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,450
I got two more, Brother.
High rollers.

1060
01:23:51,148 --> 01:23:53,993
Good. Put them with the others.

1061
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:57,703
Later, you'll line
them up by the windows.

1062
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:01,289
And blow their brains out
for all the cameras below.

1063
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:18,108
Go!

1064
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:19,840
Get down!

1065
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,144
Get down!

1066
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:24,436
Stop! Get down!

1067
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:25,813
Get down!

1068
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:33,572
Tie him up.

1069
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,494
Where's Cameron?

1070
01:24:39,695 --> 01:24:41,999
You don't know me.

1071
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,304
Hands behind your back.

1072
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,906
Whoah. Gently, gently.
Just her hands...

1073
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:01,597
She look local?

1074
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:04,855
Indian? Huh?

1075
01:25:07,657 --> 01:25:08,591
Animals.

1076
01:25:13,162 --> 01:25:14,697
No, no! No!

1077
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:36,952
<i>These images</i>
<i>taken around 4:00 a.m.</i>

1078
01:25:36,954 --> 01:25:38,819
<i>show the moment security forces</i>

1079
01:25:38,821 --> 01:25:41,923
<i>and angry citizens
confronted the two gunmen,</i>

1080
01:25:41,925 --> 01:25:43,557
<i>beating them with sticks.</i>

1081
01:25:43,559 --> 01:25:46,161
<i>The gunmen had earlier hijacked
a police van</i>

1082
01:25:46,163 --> 01:25:49,665
<i>and are thought to have been
behind the CST station attack.</i>

1083
01:25:50,133 --> 01:25:53,868
<i>Both men suffered multiple bullet
wounds from which one died.</i>

1084
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:57,039
<i>While the other,
Ajmal Kasab, is now in custody.</i>

1085
01:25:58,841 --> 01:26:00,287
Who is Brother Bull?

1086
01:26:02,144 --> 01:26:04,159
You can do
whatever you want to me.

1087
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:06,215
I don't know.

1088
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:09,215
Brother Bull...

1089
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:11,548
..what did he ask you to do?

1090
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:14,593
He said...

1091
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:16,799
"You are Muslims."

1092
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,716
"The infidels defraud you."

1093
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,925
"They left you in poverty."

1094
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:25,481
"They left you behind,
as they went ahead."

1095
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:27,478
"Go."

1096
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:29,563
"Do Jihad."

1097
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:31,777
"Go and do Jihad."

1098
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:42,150
<i>At the moment, there are
still terrorists at loose in Mumbai.</i>

1099
01:26:42,152 --> 01:26:45,319
<i>The military seemed to have
worked out that they are...</i>

1100
01:26:53,062 --> 01:26:54,758
Call him again.

1101
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:41,469
What was your plan?
Where were you going next?

1102
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:43,563
We were going to die.

1103
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:59,825
His phone is off.

1104
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:16,304
Houssam and
I were just outside. We're here now.

1105
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:18,469
Yes, we already lit the fire.

1106
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:21,015
Okay, I'll ask.

1107
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:24,511
Oi.

1108
01:28:24,513 --> 01:28:25,813
What's your name?

1109
01:28:26,056 --> 01:28:27,266
What's your name?

1110
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,312
What? What's your name?

1111
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,060
Tell me! Speak!

1112
01:28:33,062 --> 01:28:34,928
- What's your name?
- I don't understand.

1113
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,320
What, asshole? What?

1114
01:28:36,322 --> 01:28:37,190
Abdullah...

1115
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:38,108
Yes?

1116
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,268
Ask him in English.

1117
01:28:39,903 --> 01:28:41,743
Ask him. "What is your name?"

1118
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:44,171
What?

1119
01:28:44,173 --> 01:28:46,039
- <i>What...</i>
- What...

1120
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,207
- <i>...is...</i>
- ...is...

1121
01:28:47,209 --> 01:28:48,408
- <i>...your...</i>
- ...your...

1122
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,410
- <i>...name?</i>
- ...name?

1123
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:51,157
Tell him.

1124
01:28:52,181 --> 01:28:55,684
I am nobody.
I am salesman. My name is Peter.

1125
01:28:56,453 --> 01:28:57,653
I'm nobody.

1126
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:00,323
Asshole.

1127
01:29:00,924 --> 01:29:04,514
I'm sorry Brother, I don't
understand. It's a long name.

1128
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:07,929
That's alright, Abdullah. Check
his pockets, check his wallet.

1129
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:11,057
Check everywhere,
you will find something.

1130
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:11,809
Okay, Brother.

1131
01:29:12,144 --> 01:29:12,944
Hold this.

1132
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,900
Check his pockets.

1133
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,110
What's all this?

1134
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,448
Yes sir, this is Houssam.

1135
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:29,383
Yes Houssam?

1136
01:29:29,385 --> 01:29:31,791
We found his
wallet and passport.

1137
01:29:32,121 --> 01:29:34,080
Send me a photo of it.

1138
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:35,222
Just a second.

1139
01:29:35,224 --> 01:29:37,459
Good,
we will run a check on him.

1140
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:38,551
Sending it now.

1141
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,329
Don't touch it.

1142
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:45,184
Fuck off!

1143
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:48,202
Fucking peasants.

1144
01:29:56,688 --> 01:29:57,562
You dog!

1145
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:58,563
Spit on me!

1146
01:29:58,565 --> 01:29:59,065
Spit on me!

1147
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,113
Just try, you dog!

1148
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:02,443
Spit on me!

1149
01:30:02,903 --> 01:30:03,533
Spit on me!

1150
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:06,453
You, stay down!

1151
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:11,545
Heads down! Heads down!

1152
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:15,539
- Houssam?
- Yes?

1153
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,538
What's that noise,
what's happening?

1154
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:21,055
Abdullah, he's gone mad!
He broke the Russian's ribs!

1155
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:24,007
-Put the Russian on.
-Okay, Okay.

1156
01:30:25,341 --> 01:30:27,743
Hey! Hey!

1157
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:28,968
Speak to him.

1158
01:30:30,346 --> 01:30:32,212
<i>Vasili Gordetsky?</i>

1159
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:35,349
You know who I am.

1160
01:30:35,351 --> 01:30:37,186
- <i>Vasili Gordetsky?</i>
- What?

1161
01:30:38,988 --> 01:30:41,955
<i>The president and co-founder
of NV Capital.</i>

1162
01:30:41,957 --> 01:30:44,359
<i>Former officer
in Soviet Special Forces.</i>

1163
01:30:46,294 --> 01:30:47,895
So fucking what?

1164
01:30:49,465 --> 01:30:51,099
You want money? Hmm?

1165
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:53,201
I can get you money.

1166
01:30:54,403 --> 01:30:56,869
<i>Your money
will not save you here.</i>

1167
01:30:56,871 --> 01:30:58,838
<i>You will die for what you did
in Afghanistan.</i>

1168
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,908
Oh, for God's sake.

1169
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:04,346
You know what
I did in Afghanistan?

1170
01:31:06,482 --> 01:31:08,315
I fucked your mother!

1171
01:31:08,317 --> 01:31:10,883
I fuck your sister,
you prick! I fu...

1172
01:31:15,457 --> 01:31:16,847
Put Abdullah on.

1173
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:20,937
Yes Brother?

1174
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:21,897
What are you doing?!

1175
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,690
He spat in my face, Okay?

1176
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:25,322
Abdullah, calm down.

1177
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,744
This is not the
time to get angry.

1178
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,530
These people are
not important anymore.

1179
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:35,787
CNN just showed that Special
Forces have landed in Mumbai.

1180
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:39,540
You should be clear-headed
about what to do next.

1181
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,752
-Understand?
-Yeah...

1182
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:44,419
-Yes, Brother!
-Yes! Yes, Brother Bull.

1183
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:46,549
Abdullah...

1184
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:48,382
It's time.

1185
01:31:48,967 --> 01:31:51,967
From Mumbai to Washington,
let them hear their screams...

1186
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:54,596
..as we've heard
our Muslim brothers scream.

1187
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:55,928
God is great, Brother.

1188
01:31:58,143 --> 01:31:59,142
Listen.

1189
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:01,354
Brother is saying, it's time.

1190
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:03,023
All praise to Allah!

1191
01:32:05,107 --> 01:32:07,234
Imran, you stay here.

1192
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:09,486
Keep an eye on them.
If anyone moves...

1193
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,991
Anyone moves,
you shoot them. Okay?

1194
01:32:20,488 --> 01:32:21,621
Stay down!

1195
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,417
Stay down!

1196
01:32:24,962 --> 01:32:27,262
Don't you understand?!
Get down or I'll shoot you!

1197
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,262
Please. Oh, no.

1198
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:19,395
Brother says we must
light every corner of the hotel.

1199
01:33:20,749 --> 01:33:23,482
Stop! Stop! Please, please! Stop!

1200
01:33:23,484 --> 01:33:25,719
I work here.
Please go down this way.

1201
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:29,023
Sir, please, they'll shoot you. Sir.
They'll shoot you. Please. This way.

1202
01:33:29,725 --> 01:33:32,759
Follow me. Follow me. Please.
Follow me, sir. Please, follow me.

1203
01:33:32,761 --> 01:33:33,928
Please follow me.

1204
01:33:52,013 --> 01:33:52,714
Come.

1205
01:33:55,149 --> 01:33:56,250
Shh, shh.

1206
01:34:29,685 --> 01:34:31,283
Sir.

1207
01:34:31,285 --> 01:34:32,521
Sir, open the door.

1208
01:34:34,255 --> 01:34:35,655
Sir. Sir, it's Arjun.

1209
01:34:35,657 --> 01:34:37,124
It's Arjun. Open the door.

1210
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:41,028
Oh, my God.

1211
01:34:42,129 --> 01:34:43,729
Please come. Please come this way.
Come, come, come.

1212
01:34:43,731 --> 01:34:45,464
This way, sir.

1213
01:34:45,466 --> 01:34:47,201
Please come, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1214
01:34:47,735 --> 01:34:49,468
Come. Come. It's okay.
Please come.

1215
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:51,405
Zahra? Zahra?

1216
01:34:52,473 --> 01:34:53,608
Please don't worry.

1217
01:34:59,814 --> 01:35:03,482
Sorry, sir. There was nowhere else to go.
They set fire to the hotel.

1218
01:35:03,484 --> 01:35:05,353
It's a baby.
What do you want me to do?

1219
01:35:30,177 --> 01:35:31,646
Sally has Cameron.

1220
01:35:32,547 --> 01:35:37,318
They're in a utility closet
next to room 415.

1221
01:35:38,486 --> 01:35:40,755
Four-one-five.

1222
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,291
No.

1223
01:35:45,793 --> 01:35:46,694
David.

1224
01:35:47,428 --> 01:35:48,329
David.

1225
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:55,462
Quiet!

1226
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:56,546
Quiet!

1227
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:57,378
Quiet!

1228
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:03,637
Be quiet, or I'll shoot you!

1229
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:04,349
Quiet!

1230
01:36:07,783 --> 01:36:09,716
- Please listen. Please listen.
- Shut that baby up.

1231
01:36:09,718 --> 01:36:12,217
- They're going to get us killed, Oberoi.
- Please listen, sir.

1232
01:36:12,219 --> 01:36:14,188
The central part of the hotel
is burning.

1233
01:36:14,823 --> 01:36:17,824
Security forces will not be here in time.

1234
01:36:17,826 --> 01:36:20,759
We must leave by the safety stairs
and out through the kitchens.

1235
01:36:20,761 --> 01:36:22,595
They'll find us,
then shoot us and kill us.

1236
01:36:22,597 --> 01:36:23,497
Sir...

1237
01:36:24,532 --> 01:36:27,833
Sir, the hotel is burning.
This is our only choice.

1238
01:36:27,835 --> 01:36:29,802
And everybody trusted you.

1239
01:36:29,804 --> 01:36:31,505
- Please keep... Sir, please keep quiet.
- We're not safe anymore.

1240
01:36:32,206 --> 01:36:34,907
Sir. So, please switch off
your mobile phones

1241
01:36:34,909 --> 01:36:36,775
and be as quiet as possible.

1242
01:36:36,777 --> 01:36:38,911
If we are together,
we'll be fine.

1243
01:36:38,913 --> 01:36:41,747
Mobile phones off, please.

1244
01:36:41,749 --> 01:36:43,882
Switch off your mobile phones
and keep quiet.

1245
01:36:43,884 --> 01:36:45,119
Mobile phones off.

1246
01:36:45,753 --> 01:36:46,885
Mobile phones off.

1247
01:36:46,887 --> 01:36:48,454
Sir. Sir!

1248
01:36:48,456 --> 01:36:50,322
<i>The fighting is still going on.</i>

1249
01:36:50,324 --> 01:36:52,959
<i>Let's speak to Pranav Sahni
who is on the ground at the Taj.</i>

1250
01:36:52,961 --> 01:36:55,194
<i>Pranav?</i>

1251
01:36:55,196 --> 01:36:56,328
<i>We have one of the trapped
guests on the line,</i>

1252
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,232
<i>RX Capital's Mr. Vijay Goswami.</i>

1253
01:36:59,266 --> 01:37:00,468
<i>Good to hear from you, sir.</i>

1254
01:37:01,602 --> 01:37:03,235
Listen to me. Nobody knows
what's going on here, okay?

1255
01:37:03,237 --> 01:37:05,605
We're in the Chambers Lounge, north wing.
There are many important people here...

1256
01:37:05,607 --> 01:37:07,438
- What are you doing?
- We have a serious problem here.

1257
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,907
We need help immediately.

1258
01:37:08,909 --> 01:37:11,275
What are you doing?
I was trying to get help!

1259
01:37:11,277 --> 01:37:13,712
- They'll find our location.
- You're supposed to be on my side! Hey!

1260
01:37:13,714 --> 01:37:15,714
<i>We've just been
informed of a daring escape</i>

1261
01:37:15,716 --> 01:37:17,616
<i>now underway at the Taj.</i>

1262
01:37:17,618 --> 01:37:19,217
<i>With reports of up to 100 guests</i>

1263
01:37:19,219 --> 01:37:21,687
<i>breaking out of the exclusive
Chambers Lounge</i>

1264
01:37:21,689 --> 01:37:24,757
<i>located deep inside
the burning hotel.</i>

1265
01:37:24,759 --> 01:37:26,467
Get to the Chambers lounge!

1266
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:28,388
A lot of people are escaping!

1267
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,890
Sisterfuckers, sons of pigs.

1268
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:30,807
Hurry, go now!

1269
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:32,309
Yes, Brother! Yes!

1270
01:37:32,686 --> 01:37:35,601
Go upstairs!
People are escaping!

1271
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:37,769
Yes, Brother.

1272
01:37:38,442 --> 01:37:40,272
Yes, understood. I'm going now.

1273
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:49,446
-Hello Brother.
-Imran.

1274
01:37:49,745 --> 01:37:51,369
Many people are escaping
from the Chambers Lounge.

1275
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:52,121
What?

1276
01:37:52,623 --> 01:37:53,753
Get to the Chambers
Lounge, right now.

1277
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,416
Chamber Lounge...

1278
01:37:56,418 --> 01:37:58,251
Okay, what about the hostages?

1279
01:37:58,253 --> 01:37:59,673
Kill them all.

1280
01:38:00,714 --> 01:38:01,674
Okay, Brother.

1281
01:38:28,489 --> 01:38:30,923
No! Please, sir, no.

1282
01:38:30,925 --> 01:38:33,360
I have kids that need me.

1283
01:38:44,905 --> 01:38:46,571
No, please!

1284
01:38:46,573 --> 01:38:47,672
No, please don't!

1285
01:39:21,075 --> 01:39:21,976
No.

1286
01:39:23,778 --> 01:39:25,377
I love you, Z...

1287
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:33,515
There is no God but Allah...

1288
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:36,813
Allah the kind,
Allah the gentle...

1289
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:38,424
Hey witch!

1290
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,227
How do you know this verse?!

1291
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:43,320
There is no God but Allah...

1292
01:39:47,905 --> 01:39:49,455
Shut up... Shut up...

1293
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:51,072
Shut up.

1294
01:39:51,074 --> 01:39:52,905
Shut up or I'll shoot you!

1295
01:39:56,409 --> 01:39:58,330
How do you know this verse?!

1296
01:39:58,332 --> 01:39:59,962
How do you know it?!

1297
01:40:02,044 --> 01:40:03,344
Shut up! Shut up!

1298
01:40:08,155 --> 01:40:09,377
Shut up!

1299
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:11,758
Shut up or I'll shoot you!
I will shoot you!

1300
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:13,179
I'll shoot you,
I'll shoot you...

1301
01:40:13,828 --> 01:40:15,639
Imran, talk to me.

1302
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:17,629
Is it done?
Have you killed them?

1303
01:40:17,631 --> 01:40:20,060
No Brother...
One of them is Muslim.

1304
01:40:20,062 --> 01:40:21,632
One of them is Muslim.

1305
01:40:21,634 --> 01:40:23,188
It's okay if he's Muslim.

1306
01:40:23,607 --> 01:40:24,769
Finish him off.

1307
01:40:26,439 --> 01:40:28,575
Focus on your mission.
Finish him off.

1308
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:33,573
It's a woman, she's performing
Salah. She's performing Salah!

1309
01:40:33,575 --> 01:40:35,485
Eyes down! Eyes down!

1310
01:40:38,152 --> 01:40:40,250
Shoot her, Imran. Shoot her!

1311
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:44,382
God willing this is also a
good deed. Just shoot her.

1312
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,758
Imran, shoot her!

1313
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,051
Close your eyes!
I'll kill you!

1314
01:40:53,053 --> 01:40:54,594
I'll kill you!
Close your eyes!

1315
01:40:54,596 --> 01:40:55,595
Eyes down!

1316
01:40:55,597 --> 01:40:56,347
Eyes down!

1317
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,350
Imran!?

1318
01:41:01,562 --> 01:41:02,402
Imran?

1319
01:41:15,488 --> 01:41:16,522
David.

1320
01:41:28,903 --> 01:41:29,802
David.

1321
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:42,883
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1322
01:41:43,851 --> 01:41:44,919
I'm sorry, sir.

1323
01:41:58,965 --> 01:42:00,131
Please come.

1324
01:42:00,133 --> 01:42:02,835
Come.

1325
01:42:12,578 --> 01:42:14,514
Shh, shh. Hey, darling.

1326
01:42:50,016 --> 01:42:50,950
Come.

1327
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,388
It's blocked.
Let's go further up.

1328
01:43:51,978 --> 01:43:54,027
This is it. This is it.

1329
01:43:55,903 --> 01:43:56,943
Abdullah!

1330
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,565
Get back. I'll teach them...

1331
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:00,653
Oi!

1332
01:44:04,391 --> 01:44:06,724
Go! Go!

1333
01:44:17,304 --> 01:44:18,971

01:44:31,017 --> 01:44:33,619
Go! Go! Move! Come on!

1335
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:37,155
Brothers!

1336
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:43,863
Go! Go!

1337
01:44:58,632 --> 01:45:00,382
-Rashid, get back!
-They've gone this way!

1338
01:45:39,419 --> 01:45:41,719
Sir!

1339
01:45:41,721 --> 01:45:43,189
Sir. Please.

1340
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:44,857
Sir!

1341
01:45:45,825 --> 01:45:47,760
Sir, please go! Go. Please go!

1342
01:45:48,161 --> 01:45:50,062
Sir! Come, come! Run!

1343
01:46:00,306 --> 01:46:01,340
Run!

1344
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:12,151
Run! Run!

1345
01:46:38,110 --> 01:46:39,444
Move!

1346
01:46:39,446 --> 01:46:40,947
Move! Go!

1347
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:43,913
Go! Move!

1348
01:48:05,598 --> 01:48:07,199
Help!

1349
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,135
Help!

1350
01:48:42,401 --> 01:48:43,369
Thank you.

1351
01:49:09,094 --> 01:49:10,028
Up, up.

1352
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:12,931
Okay, ma'am. Okay.

1353
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:31,567
Stop.

1354
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:34,616
Stop, or we'll shoot you!

1355
01:50:15,494 --> 01:50:17,824
Allah awaits you.

1356
01:50:17,826 --> 01:50:20,616
For Allah's sake,
you must not retreat.

1357
01:50:35,781 --> 01:50:36,801
Houssam?!

1358
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:37,803
Give me a magazine!

1359
01:50:38,388 --> 01:50:40,083
I'm out. I'm out.

1360
01:50:51,797 --> 01:50:53,902
Be brave, my lions.

1361
01:50:53,904 --> 01:50:56,071
The whole world is watching you.

1362
01:50:56,073 --> 01:50:58,373
Allah awaits you in paradise.

1363
01:50:59,117 --> 01:51:01,326
Keep your phones on...

1364
01:51:01,328 --> 01:51:04,618
..so the whole
world can hear you roar.

1365
01:51:19,012 --> 01:51:20,470
All glory to Allah!

1366
01:51:20,472 --> 01:51:21,312
God is great!

1367
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,802
Sally?

1368
01:52:05,103 --> 01:52:06,070

00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,942
<i>Think of your
heart as the drums.</i>

3
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>Your breathing as the bass.</i>

00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,622
Lisa!
Front bedroom.

5
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:21,494
Hi.

6
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:22,562
I'm Keith.

7
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:25,201
Half an hour, 100.
An hour, 150.

8
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:26,900
I just want to talk.

9
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,804
Let's get the money
out of the way.

10
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:32,975
Yeah.

11
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,929
What's your name?

12
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,530
Lisa.

13
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,901
Is that your real name?

14
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,237
My name's Lisa.

15
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,708
Unless you want it to be
something else.

16
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,912
- How about Stephanie?
- Sure.

17
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,057
Stephanie Patrick?

18
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,127
Your parents, they were on the
Northeastern Airlines flight

19
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:30,464
that crashed,
into the Atlantic three years ago

20
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,768
with your sister
and your brother.

21
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:35,204
I'm a journalist.

22
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,077
I'm writing an article.

23
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:46,280
Look, it wasn't an accident.
There was a bomb onboard.

24
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,950
Have you got
a cigarette?

25
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:50,884
No.

26
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,186
The bombmaker is here.
He's in London.

27
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,790
He's free. He's walking
the fucking streets.

28
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,331
I'll be back in a minute.

29
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:17,411
Up. Come on.

30
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,348
Get off me.
Get off me!

31
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,285
I just want to talk,
Stephanie.

32
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,190
- Go on. Get out, guv.
- All right, I'm going!

33
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:24,346
<i>You have
one saved message.</i>

34
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,582
<i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

35
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:32,152
<i>Uh, Dad left his wedding ring
on the counter.</i>

36
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:33,255
<i>Can you grab it?</i>

37
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,456
<i>See you at the airport.</i>

38
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,292
<i>We love you.</i>

39
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,024
What are you doing?

40
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:57,232
- Can you prove it?
- Just get in.

41
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,276
So where are we going?

42
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,346
You can't have sex with me.

43
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,382
That's a relief.

44
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,550
Fuck you.

45
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,526
Can you move?

46
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:42,444
You want a drink?

47
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,649
I'm gonna get a beer.

48
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:49,897
Is that the man
who killed my family?

49
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,264
That's Mohammed Reza.

50
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,733
He made the device.

51
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,634
- So he's a bombmaker.
- And the security services,

52
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:56,202
they've got him
under surveillance,

53
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:58,238
- but they won't bring him in.
- They know who made the bomb

54
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,576
and they won't
fucking bring him in?

55
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:02,578
No.

56
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,147
- Well, why not?
- I'm not sure yet.

57
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:09,850
Maybe they're worried
that if they do,

58
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,518
they might
lose his network.

59
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,120
Maybe they're also more scared
of who he might lead them to,

60
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,222
maybe one of our friends
in the Middle East.

61
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:19,060
Ramifications of that
could be huge.

62
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:23,030
Can you imagine
if this stuff gets out?

63
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:26,166
That they've let a known bomber
walk the streets of London?

64
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:27,969
That all of this,
all this...

65
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,636
The plane crash
was a cover-up?

66
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,978
The fallout would be
catastrophic.

67
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,748
How do you know all this?

68
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:41,716
Research.
And my source.

69
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,684
- And I'd prefer it...
- And you know your source...

70
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,920
- ...if you don't smoke, please.
- ...is telling the truth?

71
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:49,291
- How do you know?
- I'd prefer if you didn't smoke.

72
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,637
How do you know your source
is telling the truth?

73
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:05,574
He hasn't
steered me wrong yet.

74
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,678
So this source,
what does he need you for?

75
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,611
He can't do it himself.

76
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:13,783
He's part of
the intelligence community.

77
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,787
Ex-MI6, but he's still
an insider.

78
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,157
And he needs you
to help him.

79
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,258
Is that right?

80
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,295
I can help you.

81
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:34,436
You should have
left me alone.

82
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:37,138
But I didn't, did I?

83
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,875
'Cause I make
such a good headline.

84
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:42,642
Some tragic,
middle-class student.

85
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:44,177
I'm not that
kind of journalist.

86
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,947
And I'm not here
to sell papers.

87
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,749
You could have had
any life you wanted.

88
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,017
This is the life I want.

89
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,352
Instead of being the top
student at Oxford that you were?

90
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:53,954
I don't believe you.

91
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:55,657
Why did you come for me?

92
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,326
You're another victim.

93
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,863
You're just not dead yet.

94
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,671
Who was Martin Douglas?

95
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:13,373
The man in the seat
meant for me.

96
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,842
He was an architect.

97
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:16,879
From Uniondale, New York.

98
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:21,984
- Was he married?
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.

99
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,586
Did he have children?

100
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,889
Two.

101
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,859
B.

102
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:25,875
- Who else knows about all this?
- No one.

103
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,344
Well, what about
your source?

104
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:32,849
B.

105
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,617
Is that your source?

106
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:39,519
What's B stand for?

107
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:42,089
- Is B in Scotland?
- Leave it.

108
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:43,556
What's his name?

109
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,693
What's B stand for?

110
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,895
It doesn't matter.
You'll never find him.

111
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:51,499
I've got to go out.
I've got a meeting. So...

112
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:15,557
That's if you need anything,
and there's some keys.

113
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:22,062
I could disappear
and take your keys.

114
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,902
And I could
change the locks.

115
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:12,014
- That a new coat?
- No.

116
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,223
What do you think,
I'm a fucking Travelex, Lis?

117
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,491
What do you need,
one or two?

118
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,829
And a gun.

119
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:34,134
You? A shooter?

120
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:35,838
Do me a fucking favor, Lis.

121
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,174
I'll just find someone else.

122
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,593
Can I help you?

123
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:33,689
The bag.

124
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:40,062
Where's my bag?

125
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:39,208
Stop!

126
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:43,777
Hey. I need to go that way.

127
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,612
Sorry,
we're going into the town.

128
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,383
You'll just have to
make your own way.

129
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:34,890
Get the fuck off me!

130
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:39,928
Get the...

131
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:47,336
Let go of me!

132
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,606
Stop!

133
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:01,350
Take off your coat.

134
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,618
Take off your coat!

135
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,429
Empty the pockets.

136
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:22,870
- How long since your last hit?
- I'm not an addict.

137
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:24,671
- You're not an addict?
- I'm a user.

138
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:26,339
- This for me?
- No.

139
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:28,341
Huh? Is this for me?

140
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:29,811
You'd have to get
very close.

141
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,480
Close enough
to hit me with it.

142
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,551
It's not loaded.

143
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:42,357
Wait!

144
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:07,414
Stephanie.
That's your name, isn't it?

145
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:10,183
- Hmm.
- That's right.

146
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,688
Your parents would be proud.

147
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:14,020
Who else knows you're here?

148
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,358
- My parents are dead.
- I know.

149
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,393
Who else knows you're here?

150
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:22,498
- No one.
- I can't hear you.

151
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,099
No one.

152
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:29,571
No one knows. No one knows.
No one knows I'm here.

153
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,107
No one knows.

154
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:36,713
Why did you come here, then?

155
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:42,683
- I'm gonna kill Reza.
- Oh, God.

156
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:44,620
He must be terrified.

157
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:47,454
Help me find him.

158
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:50,223
You want to kill Mohammed Reza,
you need to hire a professional.

159
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,826
I don't have any money.

160
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:54,194
Oh.
Well, you have a job.

161
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:55,597
You're a prostitute,
aren't you?

162
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:02,003
You're...

163
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:04,739
You're B.
You're Proctor's source.

164
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,809
Sorry?

165
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:12,180
I could go to a newspaper

166
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,815
and they would...

167
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:18,318
They would want to hear about
you and Proctor, I'm sure.

168
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,354
They'd want to hear
about you for...

169
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,826
Was that the same Proctor
you managed to get killed?

170
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:35,304
You might as well
have shot him yourself.

171
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:40,342
Look at me.

172
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,512
Look at me!

173
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:50,417
You don't have a clue

174
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:54,389
about the scale of the mess
you've caused.

175
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,208
No!

176
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:47,576
Where is Reza?
Help me find him.

177
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:52,278
Why would I do that?

178
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,116
You spooked Reza
with your cafeteria stunt.

179
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:56,416
Thanks to you,
he's vanished.

180
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,686
- I need to kill him.
- You can't even walk.

181
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,155
Then help me walk.

182
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:31,788
Laces.

183
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,562
Fuck you.

184
00:33:57,212 --> 00:33:59,714
One second. One second.

185
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,648
Just one second, please.

186
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:16,931
<i>I'm gonna say this now,</i>
<i>so you never turn around to me</i>

187
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,565
<i>and say I didn't warn you.</i>

188
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:20,467
<i>You're not made for this.</i>

189
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,203
Can we talk about Reza?

190
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:23,940
<i>You're wasting your time.</i>

191
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:27,942
Hey.

192
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:30,376
<i>I can get you fit.</i>
<i>I can teach you survival.</i>

193
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,847
<i>But in the end,
you'll still be you.</i>

194
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:37,184
<i>It'll take longer
than you want.</i>

195
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,220
<i>It'll hurt
more than you think.</i>

196
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:41,256
Can we talk about Reza?

197
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,225
<i>Almost certainly,</i>
<i>you won't succeed.</i>

198
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,026
<i>But if by some miracle
you do succeed,</i>

199
00:34:46,028 --> 00:34:47,730
<i>this is what you'll discover:</i>

200
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:50,767
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

201
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,802
Come on.

202
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,035
Just stop it.

203
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:56,436
- Give me a minute!
- Oy.

204
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:58,908
Don't treat me like
I'm fucking worthless.

205
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:02,777
All right,
take off your clothes.

206
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:04,646
- Fuck off.
- Take off your clothes.

207
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,787
You won't run?
You can swim. Swim home.

208
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,558
I can't... I can't swim.
It's fucking freezing.

209
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,027
I mean it, I can't swim.
I'll fucking drown.

210
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:21,394
Is there anything
you can do?

211
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:22,999
You don't even know
what I've been through.

212
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:29,437
Drugs. Prostitution.
That's not a tragedy.

213
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:31,671
It's a cliche.

214
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,811
You're a cliche.
You don't have what it takes.

215
00:35:35,878 --> 00:35:36,879
So drown.

216
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:39,414
Or quit.

217
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:41,918
I don't care.

218
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:47,669
I've got nothing to lose,
so fucking try me.

219
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:53,843
- What about your life?
- What about it?

220
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,229
My family weren't
supposed to be on that flight.

221
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,004
They changed their plans
so I could join them.

222
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,207
But I didn't.

223
00:40:01,544 --> 00:40:03,611
Not because I couldn't.
Because I...

224
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,048
Because I didn't want to.

225
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:12,721
So they flew without me.

226
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,036
All right.

227
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:31,140
Reza is an errand boy.

228
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:36,577
The man who greenlit
the attack on that plane

229
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,378
was a radical Islamist cleric

230
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,349
representing
a hardline government.

231
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:45,888
And he paid U17
to get the job done.

232
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:49,490
- What's U17?
- "Who," not "what."

233
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:52,593
U17 is code
for an unidentified person.

234
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:55,362
CIA classification
for a terrorist suspect

235
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,833
with no confirmed root name.

236
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,601
U17 could be anybody.

237
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,736
And what about the cleric?
Where's he?

238
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:05,806
Cleric was killed in a drone
strike two years ago.

239
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:08,711
Reza is our direct link
to U17.

240
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:16,886
You want Reza,
you're gonna want U17, too.

241
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:19,889
I want 'em all.

242
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:24,126
So this is Abdul Kaif.

243
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,594
He was an activist.
A visionary.

244
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:28,996
I read about him
at Proctor's.

245
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:31,865
Considered a massive threat
because he was a reformer,

246
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,201
from a region
terrified of reform.

247
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,803
They killed 239 people
just to get to a man

248
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:38,105
they could have shot
coming out of Harrods?

249
00:41:38,107 --> 00:41:41,408
It was a message specifically
addressed to reformers:

250
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,943
We can get you anywhere

251
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:46,182
and there is nothing
we are not prepared to do.

252
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:52,019
Abdul died
fighting intolerance

253
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,720
and extremism.

254
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:57,393
Everyone else was
collateral damage.

255
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:03,997
Abdul's father, Suleman Kaif,
suspected as much.

256
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:06,934
He wasn't afraid to find out
who was behind this.

257
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:09,405
He financed Proctor.

258
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,383
Stop.

259
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:24,051
<i>You got to get
your breathing sorted.</i>

260
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:27,988
Don't panic.
Be calm. Be still.

261
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,023
<i>You got to get your
rhythm section under control,</i>

262
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:32,125
<i>like in music, remember?</i>

263
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,628
Think of your heart
as the drums.

264
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,897
- Yeah.
- Your breathing as the bass.

265
00:42:36,899 --> 00:42:39,068
<i>You get those sorted
and you're sorted.</i>

266
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:48,875
<i>Your heart as the drums.</i>

267
00:42:48,877 --> 00:42:51,144
<i>Your breathing as the bass.</i>

268
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,153
Put another one in.
Never less than two.

269
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,194
Good.

270
00:43:07,196 --> 00:43:09,531
- That's the easy part.
- What's the hard part?

271
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,134
Living with it.

272
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:29,251
<i>You're gonna</i>
<i>have to be someone else.</i>

273
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:30,817
<i>Petra.</i>

274
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,086
- Petra Reuter.
- Who's that?

275
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:35,422
- She was an assassin.
- Was?

276
00:43:35,424 --> 00:43:37,359
- She's dead.
- Well, how's that gonna work?

277
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:42,398
Her body was never recovered,
so it's gonna work great.

278
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,479
Christ.

279
00:43:58,547 --> 00:44:00,414
What the...

280
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,287
Fuck off.

281
00:44:21,236 --> 00:44:23,305
You've fucked the car
and now you're dead.

282
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:26,375
You're fucking crazy.

283
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:30,546
Nice job.

284
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,215
Enjoy the walk home!

285
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,627
Enjoy the walk home!

286
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:03,610
Is this your wife?

287
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,880
Uh-huh.

288
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:08,417
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah, she was.

289
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:18,127
When are you gonna
teach me to fight?

290
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:24,299
We should probably
go over that, no?

291
00:45:28,404 --> 00:45:31,204
Find something sharp.
Go for ears, eyes.

292
00:45:31,206 --> 00:45:33,308
If they've got balls,
go for those.

293
00:45:38,882 --> 00:45:40,082
That's it?

294
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:45,287
We need to concentrate on
the abilities that you have.

295
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,023
Like languages.

296
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:56,098
This because
I'm a woman?

297
00:45:57,266 --> 00:45:59,901
There are plenty of women
out there just as good as men.

298
00:45:59,903 --> 00:46:01,470
So, make me one of them.

299
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:05,007
- It would take too long.
- How long?

300
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,277
How long?

301
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:10,379
It's been months.

302
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:13,881
I said, how long?

303
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:16,452
Your menopause would be
a distant memory.

304
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,120
Fuck.

305
00:46:57,993 --> 00:46:59,194
Stop it.

306
00:47:01,263 --> 00:47:02,329
No.

307
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,010
Go ahead.

308
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:24,344
Calm yourself.

309
00:48:24,346 --> 00:48:25,947
Calm yourself.

310
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:28,751
Stop moving.

311
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,323
That's a good start.

312
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:50,707
Want some tea?

313
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:54,176
Hey.

314
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:56,578
Are you MI6?

315
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,348
Proctor said you were.

316
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:00,850
Not at the moment.

317
00:49:01,617 --> 00:49:02,950
What does that mean?

318
00:49:02,952 --> 00:49:05,452
That means I messed up.

319
00:49:05,454 --> 00:49:06,455
How?

320
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,791
I killed Petra Reuter.

321
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:10,893
Deliberately?

322
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:14,563
Yeah.

323
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:17,566
I didn't kill her
by accident.

324
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:24,874
That's Petra.

325
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:26,573
How old would she be now?

326
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:28,510
Older than you,
but manageable.

327
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:31,914
Those three men
she's with there...

328
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:35,350
She killed all of them.

329
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:43,158
This is the nine-millimeter
hollow-point.

330
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:45,225
<i>When that impacts soft tissue,</i>

331
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:46,929
it flowers up to about
three times the size.

332
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,263
Creates a larger
wound channel,

333
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:52,700
severing arteries,
cutting nerves.

334
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:55,468
Massive blood loss,
hypovolemic shock.

335
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,072
You hit someone
in the sternum with that,

336
00:49:58,074 --> 00:50:01,142
the bone shatters,
bullet enters the heart...

337
00:50:01,144 --> 00:50:02,208
The heart blows out.

338
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,812
- Shoot me.
- What?

339
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:07,014
- Right here.
- Are you out of your mind?

340
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:08,650
Shut up. Just do it.

341
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,271
<i>Think of your heart</i>
<i>as the drums.</i>

342
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:33,776
<i>Your breathing as the bass.</i>

343
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,880
<i>Massive blood loss...
Clean through the body...</i>

344
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:42,549
<i>Hypovolemic shock...
When that impacts soft tissue,</i>

345
00:50:42,551 --> 00:50:44,250
<i>it flowers up to about
three times the size.</i>

346
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:45,922
<i>You hit someone
in the sternum with that...</i>

347
00:50:47,355 --> 00:50:50,559
<i>...the bone shatters,
bullet enters the heart...</i>

348
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:52,995
<i>...the heart blows out.</i>

349
00:50:57,299 --> 00:50:58,968
I'm putting you
out in the field.

350
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:09,677
<i>I received
counterintelligence information</i>

351
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:12,980
<i>that Reza's making
a new device for U17.</i>

352
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:15,381
Word is
it'll be a major event.

353
00:51:15,383 --> 00:51:17,517
So you're going to Madrid.

354
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,255
It's where Marc Serra lives.

355
00:51:23,793 --> 00:51:27,293
That's Serra.
He's an information broker.

356
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:28,361
Used to work for the CIA,

357
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:29,629
now he trades
on the open market.

358
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,700
We use Serra to get to U17.

359
00:51:32,702 --> 00:51:35,035
You're gonna have
to get close to Serra

360
00:51:35,037 --> 00:51:36,939
to convince him
you're Petra.

361
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:43,445
- Who's gonna pay for all this?
- Fucked if I know.

362
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,483
You serious?

363
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,318
What about Abdul's father?

364
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
Suleman Kaif.
He financed Proctor.

365
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:56,857
- Good idea.
- Yeah, it is.

366
00:51:56,859 --> 00:51:58,694
Go get us some money.

367
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:36,398
How did you get in here?

368
00:52:39,434 --> 00:52:41,235
Far too easily.

369
00:52:41,237 --> 00:52:42,437
What do you want?

370
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:46,273
- What do you want?
- Your son was on flight 147.

371
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:47,540
Get out of my house.

372
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,044
You tried to prove
that the crash was terrorism,

373
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:50,978
not mechanical failure,

374
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,346
but no one believed you
except Proctor.

375
00:52:53,348 --> 00:52:54,917
- You know Proctor?
- Yes.

376
00:52:57,153 --> 00:53:00,388
If you want to talk to me,
get that gun out of my face.

377
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,968
Proctor promised to find out
the truth for me.

378
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,537
Instead, he stole my money
and disappeared.

379
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:19,505
- He's a fraud.
- No.

380
00:53:19,507 --> 00:53:21,342
- He's a thief.
- No.

381
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:22,678
He's dead.

382
00:53:23,312 --> 00:53:24,613
He was murdered.

383
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:27,582
So why are you here?

384
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,518
To offer you closure.

385
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:32,822
And how would you do that?

386
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,490
Violently.

387
00:53:37,793 --> 00:53:41,527
And, uh, what do you
want me to do exactly?

388
00:53:41,529 --> 00:53:44,798
Just...
Just expenses, that's all.

389
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,968
Just expenses.

390
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:51,007
- That's all.
- That's all.

391
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:53,809
How did I guess?

392
00:53:56,245 --> 00:53:58,446
Please, leave my house.

393
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:00,883
No.

394
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:10,492
On the inside.

395
00:54:12,695 --> 00:54:14,529
My family's seat numbers.

396
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:31,679
People have gone to far greater
lengths than this to cheat me.

397
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:34,516
- I'm not cheating you.
- I don't know who you are,

398
00:54:35,151 --> 00:54:36,350
but I'll find out.

399
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:40,387
Now, please leave my house.

400
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:42,122
How do you know
Proctor was murdered?

401
00:54:42,124 --> 00:54:45,025
- Ah, she is leaving.
- Because I found him.

402
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:46,961
It was my fault.

403
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:48,696
He was the first person
in three years

404
00:54:48,698 --> 00:54:50,097
to treat me
like a human being.

405
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,068
- Come on, get out.
- He wasn't a fraud.

406
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:01,075
You've made a mistake.

407
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:03,713
Alia, leave it.
This doesn't concern you.

408
00:55:04,814 --> 00:55:09,316
My son is dead.
And it doesn't concern me?

409
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:10,718
You know
as well as I do

410
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,753
that it is far more
complicated than that.

411
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:14,288
She has no idea
what's she's talking about.

412
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,624
- But I do.
- Alia, be quiet.

413
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,492
I will not be silenced.

414
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:21,496
You stay silent
if you want to.

415
00:55:22,898 --> 00:55:25,366
You were right about the
flight and you know it.

416
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:27,236
Proctor showed me everything.

417
00:55:28,904 --> 00:55:30,603
Whoever did it,
I'll find them

418
00:55:30,605 --> 00:55:32,139
and I'll kill
every last one of them.

419
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:34,008
I can do it. I will.

420
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,644
But there will be
no public vindication for you.

421
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:40,481
Killing the guilty
will not heal us.

422
00:55:40,483 --> 00:55:42,251
I'm not looking
to get healed.

423
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:48,090
I will help you.
I will give you the money.

424
00:55:49,825 --> 00:55:50,860
Here.

425
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:52,895
Your ring.

426
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:57,900
No, no. Keep it.

427
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:00,635
Keep it for me.

428
00:57:03,899 --> 00:57:06,233
<i>Got your
first contract for you.</i>

429
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:09,870
<i>Name of Lehmans.
He's a piece of shit, this guy.</i>

430
00:57:09,872 --> 00:57:13,207
<i>Deals in arms, guns,
drugs, blood diamonds.</i>

431
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:16,278
<i>If anyone can find him,
it's Serra.</i>

432
00:57:21,117 --> 00:57:22,850
<i>Why do I
have to kill him?</i>

433
00:57:22,852 --> 00:57:25,919
<i>Lehmans is the one</i>
<i>who led me to Petra.</i>

434
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:28,889
<i>And she wasn't
the forgiving type.</i>

435
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:31,225
<i>There's something else
you should know.</i>

436
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:34,230
<i>He arranged for the bomb
to be on that plane.</i>

437
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:47,574
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Hello, Marc?

438
00:57:47,576 --> 00:57:48,641
<i>Who is this?</i>

439
00:57:48,643 --> 00:57:50,379
I need you to find
Eric Lehmans for me.

440
00:57:51,447 --> 00:57:53,614
<i>Eric Lehmans, huh?</i>

441
00:57:53,616 --> 00:57:55,249
<i>Never heard of him.</i>

442
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:58,886
What about Petra Reuter?
You heard of her?

443
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:01,622
<i>Uh, now I'm definitely
not interested.</i>

444
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:02,689
<i>But I'll tell you something.</i>

445
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,525
<i>You can have
this one for free.</i>

446
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:06,729
<i>Petra Reuter is dead.</i>

447
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:08,998
I get that a lot.

448
00:58:09,899 --> 00:58:12,067
<i>Whoever you are,
you're not her.</i>

449
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:15,068
Can you find him or not?

450
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,071
<i>Let me...</i>

451
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:18,305
<i>Let me think about it.</i>

452
00:58:18,307 --> 00:58:20,776
Sure. Why don't you call me
when you finish your espresso.

453
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:25,981
<i>Why are you
looking for Lehmans?</i>

454
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:28,515
What?

455
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:30,252
<i>Why are you
looking for Lehmans?</i>

456
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,186
Never mind.

457
00:58:32,188 --> 00:58:34,421
If you don't know why,
I'm wasting my time.

458
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:35,824
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>

459
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:39,895
- How much?
- <i>How much what?</i>

460
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:43,530
- How much will it cost?
- <i>I'll let you know.</i>

461
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:45,632
- Call me on this number.
- <i>No.</i>

462
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:47,834
<i>We'll meet tomorrow.
Face to face.</i>

463
00:58:47,836 --> 00:58:50,306
- Okay, where?
- <i>I'll text you.</i>

464
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:26,909
Always figured you
for a blonde.

465
00:59:28,744 --> 00:59:30,079
Did you find him or not?

466
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:33,148
The fee is 200,000 euros.

467
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:36,016
It includes a risk premium.

468
00:59:36,018 --> 00:59:37,317
You must have
a low opinion of me.

469
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:39,453
I don't have
any opinion of you yet.

470
00:59:39,455 --> 00:59:41,323
Payable by wire, no cash.

471
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,294
That works for me.

472
00:59:53,235 --> 00:59:56,003
Lehmans has an air-transport
company based in Belgrade,

473
00:59:56,005 --> 00:59:57,804
but he keeps his distance.

474
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,840
He's changed his name
and lives alone

475
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:03,176
in Tangier, in his apartment
and rarely goes out.

476
01:00:03,178 --> 01:00:04,544
Have fun.

477
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:18,954
Who sent you?

478
01:01:24,526 --> 01:01:26,862
Your outline's unclear to me.

479
01:01:29,932 --> 01:01:32,065
Ah.

480
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:34,303
But you smell like a woman.

481
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:38,207
It's Petra Reuter.

482
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:54,822
If it was,
I'd be dead already.

483
01:01:54,824 --> 01:01:56,189
You are.

484
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:59,395
Petra had a reason to kill me.
What's yours?

485
01:02:00,462 --> 01:02:01,463
Stay.

486
01:02:02,998 --> 01:02:04,366
Three years ago.

487
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,135
Ah...

488
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,239
Flight 147.

489
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:04,426
No, get off me!

490
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:46,823
Hey.

491
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:49,324
Hey.

492
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:51,593
Hey, you!

493
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:55,631
Whoa.

494
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:57,432
Back up!

495
01:05:59,134 --> 01:06:00,335
Get the fuck back.

496
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:03,169
Fairuz!

497
01:06:03,171 --> 01:06:05,840
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!

498
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:08,377
<i>A genoux! A genoux!</i>

499
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:11,848
Hey!

500
01:06:12,547 --> 01:06:13,548
Hey!

501
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:39,408
Go!

502
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,541
Fuck.

503
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:43,478
Go!

504
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:48,885
Move! Fucking get out!

505
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,347
No. Fuck!

506
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:01,654
Shit. Shit. Shit!

507
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:17,639
Fuck!

508
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:23,904
You really left your mark
on Tangier.

509
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:25,773
You never told me
about his protection.

510
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:28,876
Lehmans made too many
enemies not to have 'em.

511
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:31,681
I'm surprised you didn't
know that... Petra.

512
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:35,348
- I got a proposition for you.
- What?

513
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,718
An American financier
named Leon Giler.

514
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,088
He's being investigated
by the authorities in the US.

515
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,091
My client's concerned he may
be tempted to cut a deal,

516
01:09:44,093 --> 01:09:46,526
save his own skin.

517
01:09:46,528 --> 01:09:48,494
Why is he being investigated?

518
01:09:48,496 --> 01:09:51,198
He got greedy with
other people's money.

519
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,035
And it's time-sensitive,
I'm afraid.

520
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:57,137
If you need more time
to think about it,

521
01:09:57,139 --> 01:09:58,471
we can meet up again later.

522
01:09:58,473 --> 01:09:59,775
If you're around.

523
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:02,712
Strictly business,
of course.

524
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,054
What else would it be?

525
01:10:20,696 --> 01:10:22,096
<i>What's up?</i>

526
01:10:22,098 --> 01:10:23,563
It's Serra,
he wants me to take a contract.

527
01:10:23,565 --> 01:10:26,867
Some businessman in New York
named Leon Giler?

528
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,135
<i>Take the contract.</i>

529
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:31,238
<i>Giler is suspected of having
financial dealings with U17.</i>

530
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:35,475
<i>It's believed he funded the cell
that brought down the plane.</i>

531
01:10:35,477 --> 01:10:37,711
<i>One more thing. Serra.</i>

532
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:40,014
<i>When it comes to the money,
make it hurt.</i>

533
01:10:40,016 --> 01:10:41,882
<i>Petra always did.</i>

534
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:46,552
I'll do it
for two million cash.

535
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:48,456
- You're shitting me.
- No.

536
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:51,859
I imagine
for whatever problem

537
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:53,827
your client has with Giler,
that's gonna feel cheap.

538
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:58,598
And then I still owe you 200,000
for finding me Lehmans, so...

539
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,566
It's really only
1.8 plus expenses.

540
01:11:00,568 --> 01:11:02,535
That's not reasonable at all.

541
01:11:02,537 --> 01:11:05,473
Well, this isn't a
reasonable business, is it?

542
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,646
So where exactly have you been
for the past few years?

543
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:15,885
You're the information
broker, Marc.

544
01:11:23,525 --> 01:11:25,826
- What?
- I don't know.

545
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,064
You're much more human than
I thought you'd be, Petra.

546
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:30,199
Then it's a good disguise.

547
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:33,067
Yes, it is.

548
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:37,438
So, what's your story?
You're from Munich, right?

549
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,605
I think you know
I'm from Berlin.

550
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:41,909
Ah, Berlin,
that's right. My bad.

551
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:44,747
It's just you don't speak with
a trace of a German accent.

552
01:11:47,283 --> 01:11:50,384
- How long have you lived here?
- About six years now.

553
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:51,921
Since you left the CIA?

554
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:58,459
You know,
there's a lot of people

555
01:11:58,461 --> 01:11:59,994
that think that you're dead,

556
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:02,329
who would love to know
that you're not.

557
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:04,033
Why not just disappear?

558
01:12:07,203 --> 01:12:08,771
We are what we are.

559
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:12,574
Right?

560
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:20,714
Giler. One million dollars.

561
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,550
The price is two million.

562
01:12:57,053 --> 01:12:58,921
<i>Why did you kill Petra?</i>

563
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,896
She murdered
an MI6 colleague of mine.

564
01:13:09,564 --> 01:13:12,101
I found myself in a position
to return the favor.

565
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,703
So what was the problem?

566
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:18,640
I was ordered
to stand down.

567
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:20,407
I did it anyway.

568
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:22,577
MI6 ordered you
to stand down?

569
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:27,850
No.

570
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,651
CIA.

571
01:13:31,653 --> 01:13:35,257
CIA hired Petra
to track and kill U17.

572
01:13:36,658 --> 01:13:38,727
Anyway, I shot her.

573
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:43,299
CIA got very upset,
MI6 had to do something.

574
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:51,505
Petra was meant to kill U17

575
01:13:51,507 --> 01:13:53,976
before my family's
plane went down.

576
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:56,944
So that's why I'm here.

577
01:13:56,946 --> 01:13:59,315
To finish the mission
you fucked up.

578
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:04,186
Was your wife
the MI6 colleague?

579
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,995
Any regrets then?

580
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,863
You told me revenge
is never worth it.

581
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:18,734
So I'm asking you,
any regrets?

582
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:48,495
Giler's security is tight.

583
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:49,796
No gun will get through,

584
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:51,532
- not the way you're going in.
- Which is how?

585
01:14:51,534 --> 01:14:53,600
He owns a penthouse
on Central Park West.

586
01:14:53,602 --> 01:14:54,968
Not his family home.

587
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,173
- A mistress?
- Call girls.

588
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,775
Gas him first.
Square in the face, okay?

589
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:03,110
- Are you listening?
- Mmm.

590
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:04,180
When he goes down,

591
01:15:05,514 --> 01:15:06,847
cut his throat.

592
01:15:06,849 --> 01:15:09,752
You go in deep, you go in hard.
Ear to ear.

593
01:15:10,252 --> 01:15:11,451
Gas him first,

594
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:14,023
or you won't manage.
And wait until you're undressed.

595
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:18,525
- You got a better idea?
- I don't have a worse one.

596
01:15:18,527 --> 01:15:19,860
You have to walk out,
not run out,

597
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:21,764
and you can't do that
covered in blood.

598
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,969
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

599
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:35,442
I never thought
you'd get this far.

600
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:54,129
Penthouse.

601
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:00,469
One moment. Guys?

602
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:04,406
I'll take that.

603
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:10,813
Hands out.

604
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:16,416
"Salbadal..."

605
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:18,387
Salbutamol. I'm asthmatic.

606
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,523
All that heavy breathing, huh?

607
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:24,760
Showtime.

608
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,806
He's just such
a petty motherfucker.

609
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:41,208
No, no, no.

610
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:42,909
No, Terry. No, no.

611
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:45,247
You tell him
I don't give a flying fuck.

612
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:47,848
I'll just pull
the fucking plug.

613
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,383
I'll pull the plug right now.

614
01:16:49,385 --> 01:16:52,687
- No, no, you tell him what I said the first time.
- Hold on. Hold on.

615
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:54,823
- Who the hell are you?
- Lisa.

616
01:16:55,557 --> 01:16:56,758
- Who?
- Lisa.

617
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,927
- Where the fuck is Madeleine?
- She's off sick.

618
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:02,496
She's off sick?

619
01:17:02,498 --> 01:17:04,699
- Nobody told me that.
- I'm sorry, is there a problem?

620
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:06,066
Yeah, a big fucking problem.

621
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:07,567
Not less than
forty fucking inches.

622
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:08,802
They should know that by now.

623
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:11,805
What are you, 36, max?

624
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,141
I can't work
with this shit, come on!

625
01:17:14,143 --> 01:17:16,512
- It's never been done.
- Oh, it's been done plenty.

626
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,846
You do all the shit
Maddie does?

627
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:21,948
- With her tits and all?
- Oh, I can do a lot more.

628
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,884
- Yeah?
- I think you'll be surprised

629
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:25,519
by what I do for you.

630
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,889
Oh, wow.

631
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:31,525
All right, I guess
it's my lucky day.

632
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:32,961
Where's the bathroom?

633
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:35,295
- You got to use the bathroom?
- Yes.

634
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:36,163
Come on.

635
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:37,364
It's right behind you,
it's on the left.

636
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:40,169
Make it quick.
I got to call Tokyo in an hour.

637
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:20,242
The fuck you doing
in there? Let's go!

638
01:18:23,011 --> 01:18:24,611
What are you doing
in there, Cinderella?

639
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:35,322
Put your head down on my cock.

640
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:36,325
Head down.

641
01:18:40,062 --> 01:18:42,531
Close your eyes.

642
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:51,640
Please don't.
Please don't.

643
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:54,975
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

644
01:18:54,977 --> 01:18:56,943
Don't kill me, please.
I have children.

645
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:59,615
A little girl.
She's only nine years old.

646
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:31,947
I couldn't.

647
01:19:32,715 --> 01:19:34,082
I just couldn't.

648
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:01,341
<i>NYPD sources
have now confirmed</i>

649
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:03,577
<i>the identities
of the four fatalities</i>

650
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:06,079
<i>in the car explosion
earlier this afternoon.</i>

651
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:08,749
<i>Leon Giler,
his chauffeur Adam Ross,</i>

652
01:20:08,751 --> 01:20:10,183
<i>and Giler's two children:</i>

653
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:13,220
<i>Michael, aged eleven,
and Melissa, aged nine.</i>

654
01:21:15,852 --> 01:21:18,220
That wasn't Plan A.
You were.

655
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:23,356
I saw the target
get into the vehicle.

656
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:25,760
I didn't know
the children were in there.

657
01:21:25,762 --> 01:21:28,497
I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

658
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:38,775
Where are you going?

659
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:43,345
Away from you.

660
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:06,435
<i>Stephanie.</i>

661
01:22:07,837 --> 01:22:10,103
<i>Stephanie, are you there?</i>

662
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:14,775
<i>Look, that bomb
that Reza's making for U17,</i>

663
01:22:14,777 --> 01:22:17,243
<i>there's still no intelligence
on the target or the place...</i>

664
01:22:17,245 --> 01:22:18,848
I've got
my own plan, Boyd.

665
01:22:19,782 --> 01:22:21,416
I'm gonna do this my way.

666
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:31,286
What happened?

667
01:23:32,722 --> 01:23:35,424
I don't know if I can be
who I was before.

668
01:23:58,981 --> 01:24:00,783
You need some sleep.

669
01:24:45,494 --> 01:24:47,797
Why did you leave
the CIA, Marc?

670
01:24:49,232 --> 01:24:51,098
Okay.

671
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,565
<i>The things they asked me to do</i>

672
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:54,802
went way beyond
the call of duty.

673
01:24:54,804 --> 01:24:55,836
You do that once,

674
01:24:55,838 --> 01:24:57,572
you know it's wrong,
but you get over it.

675
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,941
And so you do it again.

676
01:25:00,943 --> 01:25:03,276
And again. And again.

677
01:25:03,278 --> 01:25:07,683
Until eventually,
you feel nothing at all.

678
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:11,752
<i>So that's why
you're doing this now?</i>

679
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:13,788
I was out on my own
and I had only one skillset

680
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:16,924
that had any value,
so I exploited it.

681
01:25:16,926 --> 01:25:20,460
Then it was because
I needed to. Now it's...

682
01:25:20,462 --> 01:25:22,631
It's just the thing I do.

683
01:25:25,067 --> 01:25:26,601
Are you happy?

684
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,337
Are you?

685
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:34,208
If you would've told me
when I was fifteen

686
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:36,078
this is where I'd be now...

687
01:25:38,346 --> 01:25:40,413
I can't even imagine
how I would've reacted,

688
01:25:40,415 --> 01:25:42,082
apart from being angry.

689
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:44,285
- Angry teenager, huh?
- Mmm.

690
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:46,689
<i>With the whole world.
All the time.</i>

691
01:25:58,734 --> 01:26:00,002
I'm sure.

692
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,674
- <i>Hey.</i>
- What is it?

693
01:26:40,676 --> 01:26:44,680
<i>U17 is the one who hired Serra
to take care of Giler.</i>

694
01:26:46,215 --> 01:26:48,749
- <i>Stephanie?</i>
- How did you find out?

695
01:26:48,751 --> 01:26:50,317
<i>Yeah, don't worry
about that right now.</i>

696
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:51,921
- <i>Just listen.</i>
- Hey...

697
01:26:52,554 --> 01:26:54,021
Who told you this?

698
01:26:54,023 --> 01:26:56,422
<i>What you need to know
is U17 is now eliminating</i>

699
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:58,094
<i>all connections to him.</i>

700
01:26:58,761 --> 01:27:01,429
<i>So Serra is clearly next.</i>

701
01:27:02,098 --> 01:27:03,498
<i>And so are you.</i>

702
01:27:06,568 --> 01:27:07,904
<i>I have
another contract.</i>

703
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,909
- Who?
- U17.

704
01:27:14,243 --> 01:27:15,978
- Who is the client?
- You are.

705
01:27:17,046 --> 01:27:21,048
I just found out U17 used you
to take out Giler.

706
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,584
That means you're next.

707
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:25,620
So what do you know?

708
01:27:28,357 --> 01:27:30,126
Right.
Talk to you later.

709
01:27:40,303 --> 01:27:42,104
U17's gonna be
in Marseille.

710
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:46,108
When?

711
01:27:49,312 --> 01:27:52,112
At a peace march.
He's making a device.

712
01:27:52,114 --> 01:27:54,116
- Who is?
- U17.

713
01:27:56,252 --> 01:27:57,887
He's not even a believer.

714
01:27:58,553 --> 01:28:00,788
He's got no faith at all.

715
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:03,159
Everything he does,
he does for profit.

716
01:28:04,427 --> 01:28:06,894
Not for the Prophet.

717
01:28:06,896 --> 01:28:08,329
You know his name?

718
01:28:08,331 --> 01:28:09,964
Mohammed Reza.

719
01:28:09,966 --> 01:28:12,700
- He's a bombmaker.
- I know who Reza is.

720
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:14,802
I used to think
that's all he was.

721
01:28:14,804 --> 01:28:16,671
We didn't realize
that he could've been both.

722
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:29,185
You sure it's him?

723
01:28:30,518 --> 01:28:31,885
Are you sure
you want to do this?

724
01:28:31,887 --> 01:28:32,886
I'm sure.

725
01:28:32,888 --> 01:28:35,124
- Because if something goes...
- I'm sure.

726
01:31:18,988 --> 01:31:20,187
Why don't
use the phone?

727
01:31:20,189 --> 01:31:21,722
You just don't
need the phone.

728
01:31:21,724 --> 01:31:23,025
You just don't need it.

729
01:31:29,074 --> 01:31:30,038
I'm with you.

730
01:31:31,715 --> 01:31:32,984
Samira, we're in this together.

731
01:31:32,986 --> 01:31:35,987
But he said to use the phone. That was the plan.

732
01:33:26,115 --> 01:33:27,447
Fuck.

733
01:33:27,449 --> 01:33:28,450
Fuck.

734
01:33:29,518 --> 01:33:30,519
Shit.

735
01:34:03,472 --> 01:34:04,753
Open the doors.

736
01:34:04,755 --> 01:34:06,849
I can't let you off here, sir.

737
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:07,544
Why?

738
01:34:07,546 --> 01:34:09,301
The demonstration is right outside.

739
01:34:09,303 --> 01:34:10,826
Where's the detonator?

740
01:34:12,561 --> 01:34:14,294
Reza...

741
01:34:14,296 --> 01:34:16,463
I'm gonna shoot you
through the fucking spine.

742
01:34:16,465 --> 01:34:17,699
Where's the detonator?

743
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:19,468
If you shoot me,
everyone dies.

744
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,096
Open the doors... Now!

745
01:34:26,815 --> 01:34:27,903
Everyone get out!!

746
01:34:28,595 --> 01:34:29,509
Everyone get out!!

747
01:34:29,511 --> 01:34:30,600
It's not working.

748
01:34:30,602 --> 01:34:31,900
There's a bomb!

749
01:34:32,662 --> 01:34:34,044
The detonator's not working!

750
01:35:50,292 --> 01:35:51,360
Who are you?

751
01:35:56,766 --> 01:35:58,367
You killed my family.

752
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:04,440
Serra sent you.
He'll kill you, too.

753
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,241
I know.

754
01:36:07,069 --> 01:36:09,971
It's a timer. It's a timer!! It's a timer!!

755
01:36:11,687 --> 01:36:12,408
You coward!

756
01:36:13,582 --> 01:36:14,583
Go.

757
01:36:18,554 --> 01:36:20,320
Go!

758
01:38:15,705 --> 01:38:18,538
Well, just let me know
when you know for sure...

759
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,676
Yeah. Call you back.

760
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:27,380
- Hey.
- I have something to tell you.

761
01:38:27,382 --> 01:38:29,585
I lost my family
three years ago.

762
01:38:41,998 --> 01:38:43,332
They were killed...

763
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:48,370
...on the flight that exploded
over the Atlantic.

764
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:52,775
Flight 147.

765
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,821
What was that?

766
01:39:06,756 --> 01:39:07,890
You know what it was.

767
01:39:09,257 --> 01:39:10,559
I've been dying
for three years.

768
01:39:12,394 --> 01:39:14,129
For you,
it'll be a few minutes.

769
01:39:19,601 --> 01:39:20,636
What's it feel like?

770
01:39:21,738 --> 01:39:22,970
Hmm?

771
01:39:22,972 --> 01:39:24,172
How does it feel?

772
01:39:27,442 --> 01:39:29,810
You shouldn't have
told me Reza was U17.

773
01:39:29,812 --> 01:39:31,480
He's a fucking nobody.

774
01:39:32,915 --> 01:39:35,417
Sending me to kill
U17's connections.

775
01:39:38,021 --> 01:39:40,322
That's when I knew
it was you. So...

776
01:39:41,356 --> 01:39:42,925
Probably shouldn't
have done that.

777
01:39:46,561 --> 01:39:49,531
You thought I wouldn't
want to believe it, hmm?

778
01:39:52,567 --> 01:39:55,270
We were both pretending
to be someone else.

779
01:40:04,312 --> 01:40:06,381
I just fucking did it better.

780
01:41:19,387 --> 01:41:20,757
There's no one left.

781
01:41:44,013 --> 01:41:45,014
Stephanie?

782
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:50,585
Are you Stephanie?

783
01:42:27,156 --> 01:42:28,490
Whoever you are...

784
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:31,861
...thank you.

785
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:36,431
Don't mention it.

786
01:42:37,099 --> 01:42:38,100
Ever.

787
01:43:09,832 --> 01:43:11,732
Back in MI6?

788
01:43:11,734 --> 01:43:13,200
I could be.

789
01:43:13,202 --> 01:43:14,937
One sharp twist.

790
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:20,508
Petra needs to disappear.

791
01:43:21,944 --> 01:43:23,145
My name's Stephanie.

792
01:43:41,463 --> 01:43:43,398
I hope I never
see you again.

793
01:43:46,702 --> 01:43:47,703
Do you?

794
01:44:33,174 --> 01:44:38,174

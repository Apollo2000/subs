In one incredibIe week,
shares of KZI are down 52%.

308
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,841
STAN:
l know where the stock is.
l have it in front of me.

309
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,010
What you got to do
right now is relax,
take a deep breath.

310
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,970
Tell your banks
not to sell the stock.

311
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,223
The stock is overreacting
right now and. . .

312
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,724
Hey, what financial
stock isn't, right?

313
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,227
Listen, three months
from now we're going to
look back on this and laugh.

314
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,478
You're angry? l'm angry.

315
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,646
Okay! We're okay.

316
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,980
Relax.
AUDREY: Relax.

317
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,650
Jesus Christ.

318
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,568
ROBBY: I've known you
your whole life, Jake.

319
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,779
And l know when
you're lying to yourself.

320
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,741
Robby, listen to me.
Keller Zabel's been
around a long time.

321
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,577
All right?
lt's one of the great names
in investment banking.

322
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,162
A month, a year,
it doesn't matter.

323
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,789
We'll be back to 65/70,
and l'll be fine.

324
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,374
You just gotta hold it, okay?

325
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,209
You're gonna owe, you know.

326
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,753
Not just the buck,
but the margin, too.
We're talking another. . .

327
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,088
Tell me.

328
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,882
(EXHALES) You don't
want to hear this today.

329
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,217
Robby.

330
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,635
How much?

331
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,053
At least another
half a buck.

332
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,974
Give me the okay
to sell, buddy.

333
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,643
Right now.

334
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,980
Sell. Sell!

335
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,482
Robby,
l got to call you later.

336
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,651
Have you seen Zabel?

337
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,370
Annica, where's Lou?

338
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,331
Not in.
Not answering.

339
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,001
Not happy.

340
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,925
Hey.

341
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,344
Lou.

342
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,684
Hey, Lou.
How's your day going, huh?

343
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,022
l told you.
Good day, l'm okay.
Bad day, l'm okay.

344
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,108
Stop bugging me
on my feelings.
They're irrelevant.

345
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,903
l wanted to come
see you face to face

346
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,404
and talk about
these rumors,
you know.

347
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,072
Because it's getting crazy.
lt's out of control now.

348
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,324
l'm hearing it
from all ends.

349
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,450
Our world is all bullshit.

350
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:43,413
Some TV bubblehead,
he gets up there
like he knows something.

351
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,041
He sells fear, panic.

352
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,460
And morons, they love it.

353
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,213
They want it to end
because it sells.

354
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,465
There's no limits anymore.

355
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,302
Muriel knows how
to walk this thing.
lt's her damn dog.

356
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,387
Lou, l can help.
l can get to the bottom
of these derivatives.

357
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,889
You just got to tell me.

358
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,474
There's so much
you don't know, Jacob.

359
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,352
What? What about
the bonus thing? Why now?

360
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,397
Because l know you.
You're holding out
for something better.

361
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,943
Well, don't. Spend it.
Use the money.

362
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,986
Because one day,
you're gonna wake up
and you're gonna be dead.

363
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,780
Lou, you got to
get yourself together,
all right?

364
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,073
We're gonna be fine.

365
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,366
No matter how bad
this thing gets,

366
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,992
we have real equity
in this company.

367
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,285
We're gonna get through this.

368
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,829
Marry Gekko's daughter.

369
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,914
Make some kids with her.

370
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,624
And you spend
as much time as you can

371
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,042
with those kids
when they're young

372
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,169
because everything changes.
Everything.

373
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,214
l cannot help you
if l don't understand
what you are talking about.

374
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,050
There's 1 5,000 jobs
on the line right now.

375
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,386
Somebody's after us,
right? Somebody's
trying to hurt us.

376
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,722
There's a reason
this is happening.
l need to know how and why.

377
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,182
You know that
dream you got about

378
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,142
that little energy company
in California?

379
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,354
You may not get there,
but you hold on to that.

380
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,939
Because everything else
is just noise.

381
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,859
lt's not just noise.
There's 1 5,000 jobs
on the line.

382
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,528
Fifteen thousand people here.
That's not noise.

383
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,696
Are we going under?

384
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,738
l never liked this damn dog.

385
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,824
Louis, are we going under?

386
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,662
You're asking
the wrong question, Jacob.

387
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,330
What's the right question?

388
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,082
Who isn't?

389
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,463
(CHlLDREN LAUGHlNG)

390
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,990
ZABEL: China's out.

391
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,783
BlLL: You said. . .

392
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,869
ZABEL: l know
what l said, Bill.

393
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,414
Two months we negotiated
with these pikers.

394
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,749
They pulled out
at 7:00 p.m.

395
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,627
So what's new?
They're Chinese.

396
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,630
And while
they were negotiating,
we lost the Koreans.

397
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,423
BlLL: So you're saying
you don't have an out.

398
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,052
No, l'm saying,
just give me one week.

399
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,097
We're still
talking to the British.
And the Arabs are back in,

400
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,099
and this time it's for real.

401
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,310
PAUL ON SPEAKER: Lou,
we've heard this before.

402
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,356
Jesus. Paul,
we lost billions this week.

403
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,442
lf the markets don't
roll over our paper
Sunday night,

404
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,818
before Asia opens,

405
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,780
Keller Zabel
cannot do business
on Monday.

406
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,700
Tuesday,
1 5,000 people are gonna be
out of a job, worldwide!

407
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,537
BlLL: Lou,
you understated the scale
of your bad loans.

408
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,998
Your valuations
are no longer believable.

409
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,461
After all these years,

410
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,214
you say this to me?

411
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,257
Me?

412
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,179
Three-quarters
of the banking houses
at this table

413
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,058
are holding the same paper,
and you're gonna
let Keller Zabel fail?

414
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,355
You're all
committing suicide.

415
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,987
What do you say, Harry?
Will you come in on this?

416
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,864
Look, if you want us
to bail out Keller Zabel,

417
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,616
all of us
will have to participate.

418
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,827
Like Long-Term Capital, '98.

419
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,247
And we will need
substantial guarantees
from the US Treasury.

420
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,335
Bill, l think
we should talk privately.

421
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,587
PAUL: I think that's
a good idea, Bill.

422
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,464
BlLL: Gentlemen,
give us a minute.

423
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,883
What about
moral hazard, Jack?

424
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,970
We bail out Keller Zabel,
who's to say

425
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,264
it's not gonna
happen again and again?

426
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,227
You vindictive bastard.

427
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,773
Who are you to talk
about moral hazard?

428
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,899
BRETTON: l'm sorry, Lou.

429
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,360
The Street needs
to make a statement
here to the world.

430
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,987
ZABEL:
lt was eight years ago!

431
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,781
You just can't let it go,
can you, Bretton?

432
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,825
BlLL: All right, Lou,
knock it off.

433
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,124
l'd like to
speak with you,
Bill. Jack.

434
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,127
And Lou.

435
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,254
Separately.

436
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,174
BRETTON: Thirty
of our people

437
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,760
have been through
the Keller Zabel books
for the last three days.

438
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,180
And they still say
it's impossible to get to
the bottom of this.

439
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,391
This could be
a 1 0-billion dollar
hole for us.

440
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,894
Or it could be
a 200-billion dollar hole

441
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,729
and there's no way
we can risk that money

442
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,981
without a backstop
from Treasury or the Fed.

443
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,150
You started this,
didn't you, Bretton?

444
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,361
l said knock it off, Lou.
Or this meeting is over,
you hear me?

445
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,573
You're asking us
to take a large
risk here, Bretton.

446
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,699
What are you offering?

447
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,286
Under these conditions,
and assuming

448
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,415
you refine your guarantee,

449
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,752
Jack, Julie and l,
and our partners
who have been consulted,

450
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,048
are prepared to
risk $2 a share.

451
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,676
Two bucks?

452
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,680
(LAUGHS) Jesus.
You're out of your mind.

453
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,935
The stock was trading
at 79 a month ago!

454
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,772
Our building alone
is worth more than
two bucks a share.

455
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,273
Julie.

456
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,735
lf only we had
more time, Lou.

457
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,945
ZABEL: My board will
never accept this.

458
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,073
There is no way

Yeah, but l'm in the middle

after hours is okay,

Your balls actually
attempted it, and
your skill pulled it off.

And frankly,

1012
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,529

beat the crap out of you

Fair enough?

That's pretty rare.

lf l were you,
l'd think seriously
about it.

1016

Because you'll have
a hard time elsewhere,

1017
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,962
now that you've
captured our attention.

Your number.

1026
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,192
The amount of money
you would need

to just walk away from it
and live.

everybody has a number,

an exact number.

1030

No. l'm okay, thanks.

1036
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,112
GORDON: Brett,
as l called him
in the old days,

1037
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,322
used to run trades
through me.

1038
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,533
We used to piggyback
off each other's ideas.

1039
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,619
Then we had
a little discrepancy.

1040
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,955
l won't bother you
with the details.

1041
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,458
Just to tell you that
it cost me 200,000 bucks,

1042
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,794
which was
a lot of money
back then.

1043
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,379
So when l got hot
in the '80s,

1044
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,048
and l started giving
tastes to my friends,

1045
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,177
l didn't invite James in,
and he didn't
like that very much.

1046
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,804
So?

1047
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,099
GORDON: So
it's no big deal.

1048
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,478
But when you're in prison,
you got a lot
of time to think.

1049
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:22,235
ln fact,
the best memory
that l know is hurt.

1050
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,863
l did eight years, pal.
Five years before that
in court.

1051
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:29,993
Nobody does eight years.
They give murderers five.

1052
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:34,247
l thought it was
the kid with the airline
that gave you up.

1053
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,708
Blue Star?
Stock Watch?
What was it?

1054
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,334
Who, Bud Fox?
Bud Fox.

1055
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:39,919
No, no, no.
He got a wire on him.

1056
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,504
He got me for
insider trading.

1057
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,257
But that's
1 2, 1 3 months, max.

1058
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,717
After the first charges,

1059
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,345
it was
one of my co-conspirators
who tipped off the Feds.

1060
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,850
And that pious piranha,
Bretton James,

1061
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,936
he had just enough
information to sink me.

1062
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,647
You know, of course,
l'm never going to
know it for sure.

1063
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,442
He offered me a job.

1064
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:10,742
Well, you just rocketed
into the center of
the universe, pal.

1065
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:14,620
l think my daughter's future
is looking
a hell of a lot better.

1066
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,914
l never made any money
shorting Hydra.

1067
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,292
You're kidding me.
You didn't trade it?

1068
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,420
That would've
been insider trading,
Mr. Gekko.

1069
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,505
Remember,
your daughter and l
are engaged.

1070
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,507
You wouldn't want to
soil her name, right?

1071
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,509
Well,
you may not have traded,

1072
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,721
but you try telling the Feds
you didn't commit a felony.

1073
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,847
What do you mean?

1074
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,348
You know exactly
what l mean.

1075
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:39,187
You induced others
to trade on information
that you knew to be false.

1076
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,111
Hard to prove that.

1077
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,701
A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

1078
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,625
l think you ought to
start calling me Gordon.

1079
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,169
Well, l promised
you this,

1080
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,296
Gordon.

1081
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,464
Makes us even.

1082
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,591
There she is.

1083
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,301
But keep this
between us, though.

1084
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,511
(EXHALES)

1085
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,180
How is that lefty
website of hers doing?

1086
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,681
Frozen Truth?
Yeah.

1087
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,768
lt's doing well, actually.
They get about
50,000 hits a day.

1088
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,353
lt's building.
Mmm.

1089
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:21,687
(LAUGHS)

1090
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,023
She was such a pisser.

1091
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,277
Relationships,
they're like bubbles.

1092
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,197
They're fragile.
lt's like these tulips.

1093
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,784
This is
the greatest bubble story
of all time.

1094
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,995
Back in the 1 600s, the Dutch,
they get speculation fever

1095
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,039
to the point
that you could buy

1096
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,625
a beautiful house
on a canal in Amsterdam,

1097
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,711
for the price of one bulb.

1098
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,881
They called it
"Tulip Mania."

1099
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,424
Then it collapsed.

1100
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,218
You could buy
1 0 bulbs for $2.

1101
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,555
People got wiped out,
but, you know,
who remembers?

1102
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,807
What would you do
with your money?

1103
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,810
Me? Switzerland.
Still the best.

1104
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,147
Got a healthy distrust
for a big government.

1105
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,649
ls that where
you keep it?

1106
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,319
Yes, l did. Now l don't got
that kind of cash anymore.

1107
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,073
But you do have money.

1108
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,286
This is a rental.

1109
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,747
l'm pretty sure
James has invested

1110
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,083
in an offshore fund
in the Caymans.

1111
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,960
Your time,
you ever do anything

1112
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,753
with some company
called Locust Fund?

1113
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,507
Locust Fund.
l never heard of it,
but it's possible. Yeah.

1114
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,010
James wants to build
his alternative energy
sector.

1115
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,178
Sounds serious.

1116
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,762
l think l can get him
to put real capital

1117
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,306
behind this company
l told you about.

1118
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,099
United Fusion.

1119
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:43,603
James would
probably want to polish
his resume a little green.

1120
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,146
He's in pole position
to be top dog

1121
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,023
when Julie Steinhardt
kicks the bucket,

1122
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,150
which, l hear,
could be any day now.

1123
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,361
This company could change
not just the energy market,
Gordon, but the world.

1124
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,364
ldealism. ldealism,
pal, it kills every deal.

1125
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,867
The thing you got to
know about James is,
he's a gambler.

1126
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,035
You know, like me.

1127
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,247
He's got an ego
the size of Antarctica.
(LAUGHS) Like me.

1128
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,083
So now you got his attention.

1129
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,877
How are you going to shine
sitting on his sun?

1130
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,299
Make him money
and melt his ass.

1131
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:18,804
Just like the old days.
We slaughtered men
for payback.

1132
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:24,310
Maybe it's time for us
to do our second trade?

1133
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,023
All right.
l'll dig around on James
and this Locust Fund,

1134
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,733
and you see what
you can do about

1135
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,693
getting Winnie and me
back together again.

1136
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:36,322
Well, l never guaranteed
she'd forgive you, Gordon.

1137
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,867
Why don't we just start
with her agreeing to have
dinner with you first, huh?

1138
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:43,788
Well, at my age,
l'll take anything
l can get.

1139
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,709
l had two
beautiful children.

1140
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:53,881
And then l went away,
and l didn't see them much.

1141
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,009
My ex made sure of that.

1142
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,055
And then when we lost Rudy,

1143
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:06,644
Winnie just
shut down on me.

1144

the exceedingly precious

01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,618
and depreciating
asset of time.

1147

You understand that?

1148
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,832
l'll try, Gordon.

1149
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:32,878
Well, try harder.
Then you both
can have a father.

The ginger-garlic lobster.

They spin a sexy story

with these super-thin
cadmium
telluride semiconductors,

We've been over this,

forefront of developing
thin film technology

to incorporate solar cells
into pliable plastic sheets.

1226
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,057
Thin film technology
is the breakthrough here.

1227
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,851
And in 201 0,

1228
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,230
thin film is going to
surpass crystalline silicon.

1235
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,999

an important part
of our portfolio.

But truthfully, we have
seen similar technology
from another firm.

JAKE: The simple of it is,

1262
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,121
it's using the intense energy
of some 200 laser beams

1263
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,999
focused on a single target
the size of
a few grains of rice

1264
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,668
filled with hydrogen fuel.

1265
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:48,128
So the idea being that
when that target combusts

1266
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,589
it produces more energy
than it took in.

1267
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,050
All the tests
they've done indicate

1268
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,593
that they can use
this ignition process

1269
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,429
to turn simple seawater
into energy.

they've gotten
200,000 hits a day.

1374
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:03,962
ls it expensive to run?

1375
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:05,630
Not really.
lt's a shoestring budget.

1376
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,092
Maybe Jake can find ways
to raise you some money

1377
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:10,635
flip it to the public?

1378
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,721
(LAUGHS)
We don't really want
to go public.

1379
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,139
lt would affect
our credibility.

1380
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,640
We want to stay non-profit.

1381
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,018
Non-profit? What is that?
l don't know what that is.

1382
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,561
l've heard the term before,
"non-profit."

1383
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,729
That's very funny.

1384
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,440
You know what it is?
lsn't that when you
came out of school

1385
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,691
and you had to
do something
for the government,

1386
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:25,859
like it was mandatory?

1387
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:26,943
WlNNlE: Very funny.

1388
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:28,278
lt was called the draft.

1389
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,654
JAKE: lt was
called the draft.
lt's called the draft.

1390
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,531
GORDON: So one day, Brett,
Churchill Schwartz

1391
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,493
is going to buy every table
at this jackal's ball.

1392
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,329
They're going to call it
"a religious revival."

1393
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,583
Winn, you don't have to
leave on my behalf.

1394
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,210
l'm only going to be here
a couple of seconds.

1395
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,087
No. Stay. l'm just
going to get some air.

1396
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,005
(GUESTS APPLAUDlNG)

1397
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,726
lf somebody took
this place out tonight,

1398
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:01,895
there'd be nobody left
to rule the world.

1399
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:08,110
But, Brett, congratulations.
l know how hard
you worked for all of this.

1400
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:10,737
l go by "Bretton"
these days.

1401
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,783
lt's a beneficiary
of a few bull markets.
That's all it takes.

1402
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,119
So easy,
even a caveman
can do it, right?

1403
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,453
That's right.

1404
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:21,873
You make modesty
a virtue, Bretton.

1405
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:26,419
The truth is, nobody needs
inside information
anymore to get rich.

1406
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,966
All you have to do
is stay out of jail.

1407
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,301
MAN: Glad to
be here, Bretton.
Herb.

1408
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:37,639
Actually,
jail was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1409
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,765
Oh, yeah?

1410
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,850
Got me to think.

1411
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,102
lt centers a man.

1412
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,814
l probably should thank
whoever put me in there.

1413
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,611
BRETTON: You know,
l saw you on television
the other night.

1414
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,573
You are quite the bear.

1415
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,575
You be careful, you know.

1416
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,327
Your daughter's
financial health
is now in our hands.

1417
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,830
So it is, so it is.
Yeah, it is.

1418
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,916
But your firm knows
sub-primes are crap.

1419
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,337
The way you keep
buying Bernie's
insurance swaps lately,

1420
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,425
l mean, l gotta worry
about my grandchildren's
college education.

1421
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,844
We like insurance.

1422
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,137
What's not to like?

1423
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:20,682
Easy selling crack to kids
in a school playground.

1424
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,434
Credit default swap
is a good idea.

1425
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,186
lt's the execution
that isn't.

1426
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,688
Well, you know
what they say.

1427
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,940
Bulls make money,
bears make money,

1428
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,193
and the pigs,
they get slaughtered.

1429
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,987
l thought this was
a charity event, Gordon.

1430
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,448
Why don't you go find some?

1431
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,452
Tell you what.
l'll make you a deal,
Bretton.

1432
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,163
You stop
telling lies about me,

1433
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,373
l'll stop telling
the truth about you.

1434
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,551
That's sad.

1435
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,553
lsn't it?

1436
01:15:58,638 --> 01:15:59,596
WOMAN: lt's pathetic.

1437
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,973
That he can't
just take his ball
and go home.

1438
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,476
He has to piss
on the whole game.

1439
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,936
(LAUGHlNG)

1440
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,438
l'm going to go find Winnie.

1441
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,357
Oh, look, by the way,

1442
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,068
l talked to Wang today.

1443
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:18,490
l think the Chinese
are close. Very close.

1444
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,826
ln any case,
l want to talk to you
about the future,

1445
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,912
about how we're going to
bring this over the top.

1446
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,247
Sure.
Okay?

1447
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,082
Tomorrow?
Possibly tomorrow.

1448
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,500
Okay. Okay.
All right.

1449
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:36,925
GORDON: Hi.

1450
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,102
He's a good kid.

1451
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,604
He came from nothing.

1452
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:51,815
Hustler, like me.

1453
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,071
You think he's
the one for you, Winn?

1454
01:16:58,739 --> 01:16:59,823
Yep.

1455
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,035
Well, just make sure
he's worthy of you

1456
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,747
because,
whether you like it or not,
you're still a Gekko.

1457
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,544
And whether
you like it or not

1458
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,338
that name doesn't mean
anything anymore.

1459
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,052
Why do you say
something like that?

1460
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:23,680
We had an agreement.

1461
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:27,100
You remember?
Last time you
came down to see me?

1462
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,311
We were going to
take a little trip.

1463
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,564
When l got out,
you remember that?
To Switzerland?

1464
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,316
Yeah.

1465
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,192
That was before Rudy.

1466
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,242
Some of the things
that came out
after you went away,

1467
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,080
things you were
recorded saying,
the affairs?

1468
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,209
That wasn't you.
That wasn't my father.
lt was some sociopath.

1469
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,919
lt was nine years ago.
So?

1470
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,588
When are you going to stop?

1471
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,722
You got no idea
what hell l went
through in there.

1472
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,350
Hell, for you?
lt was hell for you?

1473
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,018
Do you know what
you did to Rudy?

1474
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,354
To all of us?
You drove Mom mad.

1475
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,480
Winnie,

1476
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:16,066
he was my only son.

1477
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,780
l tried everything.
l put him in
the 1 2-step deal.

1478
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,824
l never told you,
l borrowed money
from hardcore guys.

1479
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,702
Tens of thousands of dollars,
which l didn't have.

1480
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,539
l gave it to
the best therapist
l could find.

1481
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,125
l even tried to pay off
one scumbag dealer

1482
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,628
not to sell any more
to my boy!

1483
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,715
But if you'd
been there, Dad. . .

1484
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,970
lf you hadn't been in prison,

1485
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,306
it would've been different.

1486
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:52,894
Winnie, you got no idea

1487
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,772
how much l beat myself up,

1488
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,483
how many mistakes
l made as a father.

1489
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,152
Rudy. . .

1490
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,155
He was a victim, you know.
Like, he had cancer.

1491
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,990
You cannot blame me.

1492
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,036
And you gotta stop
blaming yourself.

1493
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,133
You're all
l got left, honey.

1494
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,469
Nothing else

1495
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:28,972
matters.

1496
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,020
l cannot make it right again,
but l can make things better.

1497
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,858
l'm your dad.

1498
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,696
And whatever you say
till the day that l die,

1499
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,615
you're my gal.

1500
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,202
You're the only one.

1501
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,705
You're my baby.

1502
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,211
Please.

1503
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,883
Winnie,
just try to forgive me.

1504
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,065
Dad.

1505
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,877
JAKE: lt's done, Doc.

1506
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,296
Look, you're an older guy,
so l don't want you
to have a heart attack.

1507
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,508
But Bretton James
just said we're gonna
get a $1 00 million !

1508
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,634
DR. MASTERS:
Are you serious, my boy?

1509
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:48,676
Yes!

1510
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,595
Bretton says
the Chinese are close!

1511
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,097
But look, you get
some sleep, all right?
You deserve it.

1512
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,557
Thank you, Jacob.

1513
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:55,975

if more and more people
are insane at the same time?

was the Cambrian Explosion.

And it happened by chance
over 500 million years ago.

it was unprecedented,

01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:53,102
it happened in a flash.

2142
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:57,773
And from it,

2143
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,443
suddenly the world had
millions of new species.

authorities in 1 988

of one Gordon Gekko began.

They lean out the herd.

2165

But they never die.

2166
02:00:58,001 --> 02:01:00,419
They just come back
in different forms.

2167

When they burst,

2168
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:14,308
they give birth to a new day.

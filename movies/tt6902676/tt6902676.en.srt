<i>But instead I grew up to be
a nobody.</i>

57
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:34,557
<i>Flicking through the same
three apps on my phone</i>

00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,433
<i>I used to work

61
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,837

64
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:57,680
<i>The one place

65
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,884
<i>was behind my keyboard.</i>

66
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:01,717
<i>Trolling the trolls.</i>

67
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,090
Oh, shit.

00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,798
Um?

69
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:23,007
Hey.

70
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,676

73
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,650

- No. No, no, no. Just, uh...

74
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:37,487
- just checking some stuff.
- Hey, uh...

75
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,688
can you sign
this going away card?

76
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,758
Uh, yeah.

77
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,959
Oops.

78
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,564
Uh, wait.
What... What is this?

79
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,102
We're currently downsizing
personnel.

80
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,503
- What? By how many?
- Just one.

81
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,706
- I didn't... But...
- Hey, relax, <i>hombre.</i>

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,008
It's a joke!

83
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,108
I'm just fucking with you!

84
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,044
Oh, okay.

85
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:03,881
Oh, my God your face.
Punk'd!

86
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,152
But if I catch you
jerking around again...

87
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,857
next card will be real.
Got that, <i>amigo?</i>

88

<i>Si.</i> Yes.

89
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,596
Seriously can I...
Can I borrow a pen?

90
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:22,733
- Fuck you.
- Whoa!

91
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:33,010
<i>And then one night,
I hit the jackpot.</i>

92
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,812
<i>Skizm.</i>

- Skizm...

95
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,018
<i>Skizm picked random
psychos, weirdos, and criminals</i>

96
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,788
<i>and made them fight each other
to the death.</i>

97
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,759
<i>It was twisted and disgusting.</i>

98
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:52,562
<i>Lee wins.</i>

99
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,265

<i>In real life,
I couldn't hurt a fly.</i>

104
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,351
<i>But behind the keys,
I was the fucking Terminator.</i>

105
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:18,656
<i>I was the ultimate
troll hunter.</i>

106

<i>I know I should have just
let it go,</i>

107

160
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,935
Hi, I... I think
you have the wrong apartment.

161
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,809
What the fuck.
Who the fuck are you?

162
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,247
Well, there he is. Big Man.

163
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,016
You scared yet?

164
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,318
Oh, fuck. What, that comment?
No. No. Shit, no.

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,020
That... That...
That was just a very dumb joke

166
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,455
that I... I... I did not mean.

167
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:15,390
Uh, can we just, like,
forget about it?

168
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:18,293
Oh, sheesh.
This is insane, right?

169
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,429
We're being, like,
total dicks here.

170
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,931
Why don't I just head off

171
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,434
and you... you have a pleasant
evening, dude.

172
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,568
Oh, what, really?

173
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,106
Oh, God. Just out of warranty.

174
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:32,343
Whoops-a-daisy.
Butterfingers.

175
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:36,044
Now, your busy little hands

176
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,512
they need to be taught a lesson.

177
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,581
No, no, no, no, no!
Please don't smash my hands.

178
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,783
No, no,
I really like using them.

179
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,952
No, relax, Miles. We didn't come
here to smash your hands.

180
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:47,391
Why did you tell me to bring
a hand smashing-hammer then?

181
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,427
I got something
even better planned for you.

182
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,330
Knock his ass out.

183
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,231
Wait, no, no. Seriously guys,

184
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,333
you don't need to do this to me.
I... I'm...

185

Shit!

186
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,339

and you can stop
destroying my things.

00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:09,479
Or just, like, shoot around

00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:11,716
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

275
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:13,017
Take a few minutes.

276
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:16,085
- Breathe. Relax.
- Okay.

277
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,821
And then go take a shit
because there's nothing worse

278
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,322
than shooting
a poop-filled corpse.

279
00:22:20,324 --> 00:22:21,890
It's like a hitting
a turd piñata.

280

After, I'll just sit you down

299
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:03,926

00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,136
No, sir.
Oh, God.

317
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:26,343
Are you... Are you okay?

318
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:28,877
Oh, God no you're not.

319
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,412
- Whoa, fuck. Fuck.
- No, no, no, no.

320
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,014
These... These...
These are just my hands.

321
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:33,749
You're fine. You're fine.
I'm not going to do

322
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:35,083
anything else to you.
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:37,252
Just try...
Just lie and hold that, okay?

324
00:25:37,254 --> 00:25:39,421
Okay. I'm sure they're coming
for you right now.

325
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:42,257
Oh, yeah they are.
Okay, I have to go now.

326
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:43,694
- Bye. Bye-bye.
- Shit.

327
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,320
Sorry, sorry.

328
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,791
Nova. Oh, no.

329
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:17,159
Oh, no, no, no.

330
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,330
Nova, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

331
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:32,209
No.

332
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:36,280
Nova. Nova.

333
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:38,048
Holy shit.

334
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,217
- Hey.
- Miles?

335
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,353
Oh. Oh, God.

336
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:47,925
I'm sorry I'm late.
Alarms and stuff.

337
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:50,794
Shit.

338
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,329
- Go. Drive now.
- Relax. Relax.

339
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:57,099
- You have to drive.
- I'm not driving anywhere

340
00:26:57,101 --> 00:26:58,836
until you chill.

341
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,807
Okay, cool. I'm cool.

342
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:20,391
Go to 7th and Shadwell,
give me Miles.

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,001
So...

344
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,970
Unsure how to broach this,
I can't help but notice

345
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,874
you aren't wearing pants.

346
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,607
Oh, yes. Yeah.

347
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:42,878
No there was a fire alarm
at my apartment.

348
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,080
I got locked out of my building.
Mondays, right?

349
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,150
I feel ya!
It's actually Thursday, though.

350
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,552
Do you still have
one of my spare inhalers?

351
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:53,355
Uh, maybe. Check my handbag.
Down there.

352
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:55,457
Uh, could you just
grab it for me?

353
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:57,961
I was up all night, last night
coding. I have terrible RSI.

354
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:01,163
Right. Some vigorous coding.

355
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,166
Yeah.

356
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,975
- Here.
- Oh, I'm sorry, could you do it?

357
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:13,477
- Right.
- Thanks.

358
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,682
Oh, shit, thank you.

359
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:21,051
- Okay?
- Yeah.

360
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,288
- Why don't you hold onto that.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

361
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:30,660
- It's really good to see you.
- This was a mistake.

362
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:34,298
- Oh. Okay.
- I shouldn't have messaged you.

363
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:37,667
- I'll drop you home.
- No. No. Please don't.

364
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:40,202
I can't go back there right now,
it's very crazy for me.

365
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:42,003
How about we just hang
at your place?

366
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:44,208
No. Miles,
You just need to move on.

367
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,607
- Oh.
- I mean,

368
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:49,044
why don't you just meet
someone new, I don't know.

369
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:51,081
Okay, I mean...

370
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,249
Here's the thing.
I kind of did meet somebody new.

371
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:56,686
- Oh? Do... Do I know her?
- Uh...

372
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:58,086
- What's her name?
- Her name is Nix

373
00:28:58,088 --> 00:28:59,488
and she's actually trying
to kill me.

374
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,057
So, these guys from Skizm
came to my house last night,

375
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,525
they're making me fight her.

376
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:05,193
- Skizm?
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:07,195
- Miles, you joined Skizm?
- Yes...

378
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:09,398
- No. No. No way.
- What is wrong with you?

379
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,465
I did not join.

380
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,635
Are you out of your
freaking mind?

381
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:13,669
No, no, no. I did not join.
They're forcing... Okay, um...

382
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:16,371
Can I...
Can I show you something?

383
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:19,042
But you have to promise me
to be cool with it.

384
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,978
Sure.

385
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:23,445
Okay, just be prepared,
all right? Don't freak.

386
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,048
Do I look like I'm freaking?

387
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,985
Okay, this is fair warning.
Okay.

388
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:33,691
What the fuck, Miles?

389
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:35,658
Oh, God. Oh, God.

390
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,059
- Fuck!
- What's wrong with you?

391
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:40,297
I said don't freak out!
God!

392
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,665
Put me through
to the police.

393
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,001
Nova!

394
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,504
Nova!

395
00:29:59,283 --> 00:30:01,483
<i>I've never seen
anything like this</i>

396
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:02,553
<i>in the history of Skizm.</i>

397
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,054
<i>Look, Miles Harris just jumped
into a fucking clothes bin!</i>

398
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,991
<i>This guy is absolute trash.</i>

399
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:14,162
<i>I really like this,
this is fucking unbelievable.</i>

400
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:15,698
<i>Keep those comments coming
in everybody,</i>

401
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,568
<i>let us know what you
think's gonna happen next.</i>

402
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:26,041
That's enough,
cut to camera four.

403
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:28,510
- Cutting to four.
- Stay on Miles.

404
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:30,746
It's an inanimate fucking
clothing bin.

405
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:32,214
Hardly must-see TV.

406
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:34,485
Can you just let me do my job?

407
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,654
I'm directing here.

408
00:30:40,057 --> 00:30:42,725
- Do what he says.
- How do you even breathe

409
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:44,827
with that stupid gimp mask on?

410
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,062
Whoa, don't make ol' Fuckface
take his mask off,

411
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:49,231
you might not sleep so well
afterwards.

412
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:52,634
Look, just let me do my thing.
Okay?

413
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:54,037
You do yours.

414
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:57,606
Stand around looking like
end-level bosses

415
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,808
from <i>Streets of Rage.</i>

416
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:04,747
You couldn't direct my cock
into a top hat,

417
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:06,448
you talentless piece of shit.

418
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,619
Having trouble
breathing?

419
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,386
This is good, get a camera.

420
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:13,221
Get this on camera.
This is good.

421
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:14,790
Hurry up and get
a fucking camera!

422
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,327
Is this on panorama?
How do we get it back to video?

423
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:18,629
Swipe at the bottom.

424
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,496
- Oh, shit the app just crashed.
- Hurry the fuck up.

425
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:23,365
- Jesus, Dane!
- This is great!

426
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:31,341
Go to seven.

427
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:35,778
Well, either he'll run and die,

428
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,414
he'll fight and die,

429
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,215
or he'll puss out and die.

430
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:43,755
Just as long as the viewers
enjoy the show.

431
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:46,590
Oh, Miles.

432
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,793
We know you're in there.

433
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:21,258
Fuck.

434
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:25,162
Fuck! Fuck this!

435
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:26,831
Fuck everything.

436
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,707
I wouldn't do
that if I was you.

437
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:41,311
- Why shouldn't I?
- Huh?

438
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:46,617
- Why shouldn't I?
- Well, the angle's all wrong.

439
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,283
You won't hit your brain.

440
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:50,454
You'll just end up blowing
your damn face off.

441
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,557
Oh. Okay, thanks.

442
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,392
And then you'll still
be depressed.

443
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:57,729
Even more depressed probably,
because of your fucked-up face.

444
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:01,598
Try and angle it right
to the rear, base of the head.

445
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:03,166
Okay.

446
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:06,336
Okay, you know way too much
about this.

447
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:08,205
Just trying to be helpful, man.

448
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:11,539
Hey, look this is going to sound
really fucking weird,

449
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,608
but could you help dress me?

450
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,479
I have guns bolted to my hands.

451
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,147
This whole deal.

452
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,618
Yeah, you're right. That does
sound pretty fucking weird.

453
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:34,164
Oh, sorry.

454
00:33:38,502 --> 00:33:40,705
Turn it off. I've seen enough.

455
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:42,838
Seems like
your boyfriend's got himself

456
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,908
into some pretty deep shit.

457
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:48,245
None of this makes sense.
I mean, this isn't Miles.

458
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:53,248
That's all Nova,
you're free to go.

459
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,784
- That's it?
- Well, obviously

460
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:57,753
if he calls you, you get in
touch with us right away, okay?

461
00:33:57,755 --> 00:34:01,926
Look, Miles has issues
but he's a good guy.

462
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,862
Just bring him in alive, okay?

463
00:34:05,262 --> 00:34:06,530
Well, we'll do our best.

464
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,675
Hack her phone.
Have her followed 24/7.

465
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:20,477
Oh, come on.

466
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,246
You really think
he's gonna make contact?

467
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:26,884
Nix is after this guy,
we need to get to him first.

468
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:48,303
You want a double bow
on that buddy or?

469
00:34:48,305 --> 00:34:49,807
Uh, that should be fine,
thanks.

470
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:53,541
Fuck, brother, it sounds like
you're in some deep shit.

471
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:55,878
Yeah, I just...
I... I can't face violence.

472
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,849
You know, not...
not in real life.

473
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:00,584
Hey, you don't have anything
to eat, do you?

474
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:02,486
Well, let's have a look
at the pantry.

475
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:06,621
Oh, here we go.
Half a cold hotdog.

476
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:10,993
Um, you don't have a vegetarian
option, do you?

477
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:13,696
So, you don't believe
in violence

478
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:17,066
- or eating meat.
- I don't like, uh,

479
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:19,869
contributing to the suffering
in the world, I guess.

480
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:21,704
Well, that's a great
philosophy man.

481
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:22,938
But most people in the world,

482
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,907
they just eat whatever
they can get.

483
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:27,011
And it's one thing to say
you can't face violence.

484
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:29,981
But when it faces you,
you better be ready.

485
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:34,349
- You a Citrus Hill fan?
- Who?

486

488
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:40,024
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

489
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:44,461
Okay, fuck it. Can you just
push it into my mouth?

490
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:48,731
Seriously?
I just fucking dressed you,

491
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,398
now you want me to feed you?

492
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,435
What's next, you want me
to wipe your arse?

493
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,137
- That could be really useful...
- Don't even talk about it.

494
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,339
Okay.

495
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:08,052
- Ah! Fuck!
- Ah! So close.

496
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:14,657
That's still you know,
10 second rule.

497
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:16,093
Yup. Okay.

498
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,865
That's it, yeah.

499
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:23,567
Yeah, channel your animal side.

500
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:25,468
You're gonna need it.

501
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:27,772
Cause it's a dog eat
dog world out here.

502
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:30,708
What kind of meat did they make
that from?

503
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:33,441
I don't know but it's been
in here for 8 months.

504
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,579
Good to finally get rid of it.

505
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:39,480
Hey, you don't happen
to know anything

506
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:40,850
about GPS tracking, do you?

507
00:36:40,852 --> 00:36:42,051
Pretty sure I'm being bugged.

508
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:43,620
Oh, I see how it is.

509
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,689
You assume because I'm homeless,
I don't know nothing

510
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:49,624
about dumb stupid GPS tracking
bullshit.

511
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,559
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

512
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,896
For all you know, I could be
a savant programmer

513
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:56,531
who got screwed after my startup
went bust.

514
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,435
I'm so sorry. Are you?

515
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:00,403
What? No!

516
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:03,205
I spend all of my time getting
fucked up on a bunch of crack.

517
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:06,543
- Oh. Good for you.
- Wanna smoke some crack?

518
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,509
- Ahh...
- Yes.

519
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:11,082
I'm good. The...
The hotdog was... was enough.

520
00:37:38,743 --> 00:37:40,745
Hey. Watch it, asshole.

521
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:44,882
Shit. Fuck it's you.

522
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:47,752
Hey, why don't you stop running,
Edward Gun-hands?

523
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,735
Psst. Hey.

524
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:07,903
Fuck, dude. What the hell?

525
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:09,772
Where've you been all day?
Zander is pissed.

526
00:38:09,774 --> 00:38:12,007
I'm in some trouble, man.
I think I'm being tracked.

527
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,275
- By?
- Don't worry about that.

528
00:38:13,277 --> 00:38:16,145
Just... If you were gonna stalk
someone, how would you do it?

529
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:17,780
Okay, who told you
I was stalking them?

530
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,183
Was it Laura?
Because she's a liar.

531
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:22,153
No, no, no. No. Dude, focus.
How would you track me?

532
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:25,921
Easiest way, malware on your
cell, you could do it remotely.

533
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,890
- You have it on you?
- Ah, yeah.

534
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:30,993
Yeah, I do, I just... Um, yeah,
it's in my front jeans pocket.

535
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:33,062
- Can you just grab it?
- No. Fuck, no.

536
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,229
- Just pass the phone dude.
- I can't.

537
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,533
I just... There was a...
I...

538
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:40,537
glued my hands
inside my jacket.

539
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:43,105
You did both of your hands.

540
00:38:43,107 --> 00:38:44,840
- Mm-hmm.
- How is that possible?

541
00:38:44,842 --> 00:38:47,542
No, I know. It was...
It was really complicated.

542
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,278
There were holes in the inside
of my pockets,

543
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,914
so I just glued them together
and then I put the jacket on

544
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,816
and I forgot and I got drunk
and I fell asleep

545
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:56,153
with my hands in my pockets.
And now, here we are.

546
00:38:56,754 --> 00:38:58,120
- Just...
- No, no, no. I'm not... no.

547
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:00,089
- I don't want to.
- Stop being a dick about it,

548
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:01,790
just stick your fingers
in there. Come on.

549
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:02,927

550
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:05,830
Oh, God, it's deep in there.

551
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,965
It's so tight. Oh, man.

552

This is not Hackers dude, okay?

556
00:39:20,144 --> 00:39:24,046
This search will take a while.
Hours, you know, maybe...

557
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:26,583
- <i>Malware found.</i>
- Oh, it's done.

558
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:29,186
- This is some advanced shit.
- Okay, can you delete it?

559
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:31,720
Of course I can. Unless you want
to able to reactivate it later?

560
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:33,822
We could set up a quick app
so you could flick it on.

561
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:35,292
No. No. Just get rid of it.
Um...

562
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,195
Okay, yeah, no, that could be
handy, do that one.

Stop shooting at me!

628
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:47,111
Go on!
Fucking yeah!

629
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,489

631
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,360

What're you doing?

632
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,868
No. Jesus, that's not...
No!

633
00:44:17,107 --> 00:44:19,176
Oh, Jesus Christ!

634
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:24,148
Shit.

635
00:44:47,571 --> 00:44:48,839
Did I win?

636
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,030
Uh, Jesus.

637
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:18,001
Stop running,
you little chicken shit.

638
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:23,941
Fuck!

639
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:26,577
Think you're fucking fast,
ain't ya?

640
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:31,213
- Fuck.
- Well that shot was pathetic.

641
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:33,281
All right, I'm just saying this
because I'm honestly

642
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,083
so fucking
embarrassed for you,

643
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:38,688
relax your damn arms, elbow
slightly bent nearly straight.

644
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,355
- Shut up.
- And those two little

645
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:42,124
sight things on the barrel

646
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:43,726
aren't just for decoration
you know.

647
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:45,961
Shut up. Stop trying to help me.

648
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,966
Oh, fuck.

649
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:53,101
Congratulations.
I think you've just discovered

650
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:55,237
a whole new level
of retardation.

651
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:56,505
That word is not okay.

652
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,340
It's okay
if you shoot like one.

653
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:00,509
Fuck off.
Please. Just leave me alone.

654
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,310
Okay, I haven't done anything
to you.

655
00:46:02,312 --> 00:46:03,979
I gotta kill you.
Every cop in the country

656
00:46:03,981 --> 00:46:07,048
- is looking to end me, so...
- Yeah, that's not my fault!

657
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,117
Skizm said they would wipe
my slate clean

658
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,553
- after I bury your ass.
- Oh, that's what they told you?

659
00:46:11,555 --> 00:46:13,288
What, so you're just like
their minion?

660
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,225
What, like those yellow butt
plug things from the movies?

661
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:21,263
No. No, I mean you're like
their... their lackey.

662
00:46:21,265 --> 00:46:22,966
I'm no one's lackey.

663
00:46:25,335 --> 00:46:26,336
God damn you.

664
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,009
Fuck.

665
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:25,062
Hey.

666
00:47:25,395 --> 00:47:27,564
Hey, sir! Madam! Ma'am!
Fuck.

667
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:31,500
Hey! Excuse me, please!

668
00:47:31,502 --> 00:47:33,203
No, no, no!

669
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:36,507
I mean, I get it.

670
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:56,726
- <i>Miles?</i>

674
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:05,701
They bolted these things
to my hands,

675
00:48:05,703 --> 00:48:07,235
is what I was trying
to tell you.

676
00:48:07,237 --> 00:48:08,871
<i>"Bolted"?
What do you mean "bolted"?</i>

677
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:10,773
I mean like they went to town
on my hands

678
00:48:10,775 --> 00:48:11,941
with some Home Depot supplies.

679
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:14,244
<i>Oh, fuck, you were trying
to tell me in the car.</i>

680
00:48:14,578 --> 00:48:16,113
Yeah. Yeah I did.

681
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,613

682

683
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:22,584
- <i>They'll protect you.</i>
- I can't.

684
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:24,419
I'm actually...
I'm just leaving town.

685
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:25,721
I just called to say, goodbye

686
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:29,259
- and, uh... thanks.
- <i>Thanks?</i>

687
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:34,498

a much better person.

689

00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:16,747
<i>I just killed this fucking guy.</i>

784
00:53:57,855 --> 00:53:59,556
- Those things, they hurt?
- What do you think?

785
00:53:59,991 --> 00:54:01,623
Skizm do that?

786
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:04,159
Yes, Skizm did that,
you think I did this to myself?

787
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:07,229
I guess drilling the second one
in would be a little difficult.

788
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,498
How do we proceed?

789
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,034
Oh, you know what,
I got an idea about that.

790
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,005
How about we take these
fucking things off my hands!

791
00:54:15,006 --> 00:54:17,106
Look, they have my girlfriend,
okay?

792
00:54:17,108 --> 00:54:18,741
My ex... ex-girlfriend.

793
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:21,846
Whatever.
Just let me help you, please.

794
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:24,514
Okay, thank you.

795
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:29,617
Oh, uh, detective,
you missed the turn off.

796
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:31,754
We ain't headed
to the hospital anymore.

797
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:32,823
What? Why not?

798
00:54:34,158 --> 00:54:35,927
Nix is after you, right?

799
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:37,895
We're after Nix.

800
00:54:38,495 --> 00:54:40,029
Change of plan, sweetheart.

801
00:54:40,031 --> 00:54:42,031
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
So I'm just bait now?

802
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,632
That seems very not legal
for police officers.

803
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:47,169
Miles I want to tell you
a story about my wife.

804
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:49,004
Ah, I don't give a shit
about your wife.

805
00:54:49,006 --> 00:54:51,539
Sorry, dude, can we get these
fucking things off my hands?

806
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,742
Sixteen years ago,
I'm chasing this gang.

807
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:55,880
Right? I bust 'em.

808
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:59,580
Their leader was this
psychopathic little dirt bag

809
00:54:59,582 --> 00:55:00,783
covered in tattoos.

810
00:55:00,785 --> 00:55:02,687
Went by the name of Riktor.

811
00:55:03,154 --> 00:55:05,921
Now I gots the bad guys,
that's my job, I'm a cop.

812
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:06,891
But Riktor...

813
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:10,593
he takes it very personally.

814
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:15,532
He makes bail,
they track my wife and kids...

815
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:26,075
Yeah, that's it.

816
00:55:26,077 --> 00:55:27,544
Burn, baby, burn.

817
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:33,483
I managed to get
my daughter out.

818
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:37,722
My wife and son were gone.

819
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,925
Nix was gone too
in a different way.

820
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:44,862
Wait, Nix is your daughter?

821
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:47,530
Tried to get her the help
she needed.

822
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:50,201
But it was never enough.

823
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:54,739
She's my flesh and blood,
I have to stop her.

824
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:00,109
<i>Uh-oh, looks like
Miles has been taken away</i>

825
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:01,112
<i>by the pigs.</i>

826
00:56:02,313 --> 00:56:03,848
<i>I mean, seriously, generally
such a disappointment.</i>

827
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:05,850
Hey!

828
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,851
You look like a fighter.
Hmm?

829
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:10,688
Maybe you could be
our next player.

830
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:14,624
The cops are watching my house,
idiot.

831
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:17,259
They would have followed you,
they probably have the place

832
00:56:17,261 --> 00:56:18,295
surrounded already!

833
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:20,863
- The cops?
- Yeah.

834
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:21,966
Surrounded?

835
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,270
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna do
a poo-poo in my pantaloons!

836
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:28,237
The actual cops?

837
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:30,508
Oh, my God! The cops!

838
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:36,013
Who the fuck do you think
owns the fucking cops?

839
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:39,048
- What?
- Dane, kill the drones.

840
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:40,115
Yes, boss!

841
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:41,252
We need to keep our cover.

842
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,121
<i>Hang on,
I think we just lost the stream</i>

843
00:56:46,123 --> 00:56:47,756
- <i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>
- <i>Yeah,</i>

844
00:56:47,758 --> 00:56:49,693
<i>we're gonna get this back.
We're gonna get this back.</i>

845
00:56:52,163 --> 00:56:54,096
Hey, Stanton,
where the fuck are we?

846
00:56:54,098 --> 00:56:55,731
Fuck!

847
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:57,099
Fuck!
Holy shit, dude!

848
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:58,903
What the actual fuck?

849
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,605
Is that look supposed
to fucking explain something?

850
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:10,045
People keep fucking dying on me!

851
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:11,947
What the...
Okay, fuck.

852
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:13,749
Yes!
Okay.

853
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:17,319
Stop your whining,
you millennial piece of shit!

854
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:19,023
What the fuck are you doing?

855
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:22,658
<i>Hey there, big guy!</i>

856
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,727
<i>Rule number 1.
Do not, I repeat do not,</i>

857
00:57:25,729 --> 00:57:29,198
<i>under any circumstances
talk to the fucking pigs!</i>

858
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,201
<i>You got that?</i>

859
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:33,202
<i>Now we should get Stanton there
to give you an extreme makeover</i>

860
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:34,403
<i>with the butt of his Glock!</i>

861
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:36,905
<i>But I see something
in you, Miles, you know?</i>

862
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:38,175
<i>Potential.</i>

863
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:40,344
<i>So I've decided to give you...</i>

864
00:57:40,845 --> 00:57:42,179
<i>another chance.</i>

865
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:44,146
Fuck you!
Where's Nova?

866
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:46,415
- It's pre-recorded asshole!
- Oh!

867
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:50,986
<i>Welcome to the
lightening round!</i>

868
00:57:50,988 --> 00:57:53,856
<i>Somewhere in this city,
we've got your bitch!</i>

869
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:57,226
<i>You've got 30 minutes,
that is 30 minutes to kill Nix.</i>

870
00:57:57,228 --> 00:58:01,230
<i>Or we take Nova apart
piece by fucking piece!</i>

871
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:02,331
No!

872
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,233
<i>Put a filter on that,
make me look good.</i>

873
00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:06,235
<i>It might have been a bit
over the top.</i>

874
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:08,939
Fuck!

875
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:11,709
Nova...

876
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:25,956
Boom.

877
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:28,125
Happy hunting, shit head.

878
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,744
Huh, bullet proof vest.

879
00:58:48,746 --> 00:58:50,948
It did not help much.

880
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,860
Hey!

881
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:14,236
Password is telefrak.
Uh, T-E-L-E-F-R-A... yeah, K,

882
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:15,439
you got it.

883
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,776
Yeah, click there,
Nova's iPhone.

884
00:59:21,345 --> 00:59:23,178
Girlfriend know
you're stalking her?

885
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,115
Ex, actually, and it's none
of your business.

886
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:29,451
Okay, Warwick and 7th.

887
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:30,955
Great, thank you.

888
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,360
- Oh, shit!
- What?

889
00:59:36,794 --> 00:59:38,062
You're him, right?

890
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:39,930
Guns Akimbo dude!

891
00:59:40,397 --> 00:59:41,932
You're famous!

892
00:59:49,073 --> 00:59:50,709
Look at those numbers!

893
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,308
Seven million viewers
and counting!

894
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,911
You're the most watched
Skizm contestant ever!

895
00:59:55,913 --> 00:59:57,846
That many people
are watching me?

896
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,548
I've never seen
anything like it!

897
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,785
- Hey, can I get a selfie?
- Yeah, sure.

898
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:18,335
Let her go!

899
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:22,840
I'll fight Nix!
Just please, let her go!

900
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,476
No!

901
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:32,981
Quit your running
and fight, or you're next.

902
01:00:32,983 --> 01:00:34,285
Whoo!

903
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:36,954
Shit!

904
01:00:37,388 --> 01:00:38,489
<i>Nova.</i>

905
01:00:39,123 --> 01:00:40,190
<i>My ex.</i>

906
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:42,960
<i>She dyed her hair
to look like a sunrise.</i>

907
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,294
<i>Always somehow
smelled of incense</i>

908
01:00:45,296 --> 01:00:47,531
<i>and freshly opened
packs of gum.</i>

909
01:00:51,168 --> 01:00:53,003
Oh, shit, Hadley.

910
01:00:55,406 --> 01:00:57,072
<i>The list of people
I've let down</i>

911
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:58,509
<i>is getting longer
by the minute.</i>

912
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:01,945
<i>Suddenly, I knew what to do.</i>

913
01:01:03,013 --> 01:01:05,482
<i>Now I could end this
once and for all.</i>

914
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:13,223
<i>Activated.</i>

915
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:47,925
Your tracker's back on.

916
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,394
Neat location, by the way.

917
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:53,328
What, you couldn't find
a classic rooftop

918
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,964
for your final showdown,
fuckboy?

919
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:57,599
God!
Stop calling me fuckboy, okay?

920
01:01:57,601 --> 01:01:59,067
I don't even know
what that means!

921
01:01:59,069 --> 01:01:59,970
Whoa...

922
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:02,206
I thought we were going
to talk it out for a bit?

923
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,475
Exchange some banter.

924
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:08,510
Some obligatory
pre-gunfight foreplay.

925
01:02:08,512 --> 01:02:10,479
You want to get straight
to the shooting?

926
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:13,281
No. No, look I need your help.

927
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:14,518
My help?

928
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:16,954
Skizm is going to kill us both!

929
01:02:17,454 --> 01:02:19,623
Together we might have a chance.

930
01:02:20,124 --> 01:02:22,692
You know, let's...
Let's team up.

931
01:02:22,694 --> 01:02:24,626
I got a much better chance
if I'm with you.

932
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:26,997
I know that.
So, you in?

933
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:29,166
Um...

934
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:32,903
well, no.

935
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,040
Yes! Yes!

936
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:40,976
Yabba-dabba-do!

937
01:02:40,978 --> 01:02:42,644
Fuck yeah!

938
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:44,747
Guns Akimbo dude was here.

939
01:02:44,749 --> 01:02:46,214
I met him!

940
01:02:50,254 --> 01:02:52,322
Oh!

941
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:54,122
No!

942
01:02:54,124 --> 01:02:55,691
This is so unfair!

943
01:02:55,693 --> 01:02:58,295
It's just a game, bro.
It's just a game.

944
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:00,663
Yes! Serves you right, asshole!

945
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:03,133
<i>And that is Miles
out of the game.</i>

946
01:03:07,571 --> 01:03:09,540
Well that took longer
than I thought.

947
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:14,044
Let's go get some cocaine!

948
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:16,011
<i>Miles Harris...</i>

949
01:03:16,013 --> 01:03:17,612
- <i>I'm not happy!</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

950
01:03:17,614 --> 01:03:18,714
<i>That's some bullshit,</i>

951
01:03:18,716 --> 01:03:20,683
<i>I'm sorry but that's
fucking bullshit!</i>

952
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:22,584
<i>No, that's the game
of Skizm, man!</i>

953
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:24,486
<i>No, no. I really started
to like the fucking guy!</i>

954
01:03:24,488 --> 01:03:26,254
<i>Fuck the game! God damn it!</i>

955
01:03:26,256 --> 01:03:28,256
<i>That's Skizm for you. Miles...</i>

956
01:03:28,258 --> 01:03:30,294
Get a cleanup squad
on Miles's body.

957
01:03:30,662 --> 01:03:32,329
Get a squad on Nix too!

958
01:03:32,697 --> 01:03:34,331
Ice that fucking bitch!

959
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:38,335
Oh!

960
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:41,436
I know!

961
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:47,745
He did his best.

962
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:49,681
But you know...

963
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,181
sometimes, even when
you do your best,

964
01:03:53,183 --> 01:03:55,687
it's just not good enough.

965
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:02,792
Just pitching here, but, uh,
chainsaws or nail guns?

966
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:04,428
Which way were you leaning, huh?

967
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:48,270
- Any plans tonight?
- Finally gonna catch up

968
01:04:48,272 --> 01:04:50,107
- on <i>The Walking Dead.</i>
- <i>The Walking Dead?</i>

969
01:04:50,507 --> 01:04:52,541
Can't stand that.
Just too violent.

970
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:54,710
Man,
you kill people for a living.

971
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:56,578
So what? You think
a cook goes home

972
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,646
and watches <i>Master Chef?</i>

973
01:05:38,923 --> 01:05:41,824
If you want to walk out
of here, with all of your limbs,

974
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:44,561
you should stop pointing
guns at me!

975
01:05:45,295 --> 01:05:46,764
This was your idea, fuck boy!

976
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:50,666
- Nice! Gotta love that Kevlar!
- Not nice!

977
01:05:50,668 --> 01:05:52,269
That hurts like shit!

978
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:55,639
You only had to shoot me once!
Remember?

979
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:11,823
Don't shoot me,
I know who killed your family.

980
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:15,626
What the fuck did you just say?

981
01:06:15,827 --> 01:06:18,495
He's the head of Skizm.
Okay, his name is Riktor.

982
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:23,200
Bald guy, covered in tattoos.
That was him, right?

983
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:28,203
Okay so my... my theory is he saw
you escape from prison

984
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:29,471
and decided to put you
in the game

985
01:06:29,473 --> 01:06:30,842
in case you tried to get
revenge.

986
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,344
You're full of shit!

987
01:06:35,913 --> 01:06:37,481
They killed your dad, too.

988
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:39,216
He's right there.

989
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,481
You stubborn old bastard.

990
01:07:15,585 --> 01:07:18,020
So, um, hi...

991
01:07:18,022 --> 01:07:19,822
Sorry, don't know why
I said it like that.

992
01:07:19,824 --> 01:07:23,491
Look if you're not going
to shoot yourself, or me,

993
01:07:23,493 --> 01:07:25,895
then I have a plan,
It is kinda fucked up

994
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:27,763
and totally suicidal,
but it might work.

995
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:30,432
You get to kill Riktor,
I find Nova.

996
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:33,403
But we have to work together.

997
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,238
All right?

998
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,375
I like that you're not
pointing that at me anymore.

999
01:07:40,377 --> 01:07:41,677
That's a good...
Okay...

1000
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:42,878
We can work on that.

1001
01:07:50,755 --> 01:07:53,555
You only need to shoot me
one time!

1002
01:07:53,557 --> 01:07:55,457
Really important.
Just one...

1003
01:07:55,459 --> 01:07:56,894
right in the...

1004
01:07:57,527 --> 01:07:59,494
Once.
Okay, you got that?

1005
01:07:59,496 --> 01:08:01,296
I don't feel like
you're listening to me.

1006
01:08:01,298 --> 01:08:02,430
Just one.

1007
01:08:02,432 --> 01:08:05,366
One shot.

1008
01:08:07,437 --> 01:08:08,838
I think my ribs are broken.

1009
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,438
Definitely have internal
bleeding.

1010
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,742
Cool, um, do you wanna
sit here and cry about it?

1011
01:08:12,744 --> 01:08:13,845
Like a little bitch?

1012
01:08:14,979 --> 01:08:15,945
Or do you wanna go shoot
a bunch of people in the face?

1013
01:08:15,947 --> 01:08:17,447
Oh, hell yes.

1014
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:20,816
The face shooting one, not the...
not the crying.

1015
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:22,019
Right on.
Right on.

1016
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,919
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

1017
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:29,992
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1018
01:08:29,994 --> 01:08:31,561
Just go. Come on, look.

1019
01:08:31,996 --> 01:08:33,729
Me? Why do I have to go first?

1020
01:08:33,731 --> 01:08:35,698
- Open the fucking door.
- I'm not exactly great

1021
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,632
- at opening doors right now.
- Go on.

1022
01:08:37,634 --> 01:08:39,334
Honestly
I still don't trust you.

1023
01:08:39,336 --> 01:08:40,470
You might shoot me in the back.

1024
01:08:41,605 --> 01:08:43,404
I promise that when I do
shoot you it'll be in the front.

1025
01:08:43,406 --> 01:08:45,808
You have already shot me
like a dozen times.

1026
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,943
I feel bullets rattling
inside me when I walk.

1027
01:08:47,945 --> 01:08:49,646
- Well...

Hey, sir!
It's Miles and Nix!

1041
01:09:42,465 --> 01:09:44,532
They're in the building!
It's a clusterfuck!

1042
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:46,401
Yeah, and? What the fuck
you telling me for?

1043
01:09:46,403 --> 01:09:47,569
Get the dead squad on it!

1044
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:49,073
- I can't.
- Well why not?

1045
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:51,709
- They're dead.
- They're dead?

1046
01:09:53,044 --> 01:09:54,444
Well that's not ideal.

1047
01:09:57,748 --> 01:09:59,148
Patch the monitor feeds
to the security cameras now!

1048
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:03,955
This is not happening.

1049
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:06,691
Oh, my God,
it's back on!

1050
01:10:07,658 --> 01:10:08,824
It's going down.

1051
01:10:10,695 --> 01:10:12,096
Oh, fantastic.

1052
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:15,430
I'm gonna lose
my fucking temper, this is...

1053
01:10:15,432 --> 01:10:17,768
Effie! Dane!
Do your thing!

1054
01:10:18,102 --> 01:10:19,434
Fuck them up!

1055
01:10:19,436 --> 01:10:21,737
Nix and Miles!
They need to die!

1056
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:23,504
They need to fucking die!

1057
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:31,983
Suck on this, bitch!

1058
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:33,918
Really, another dick shot?

1059
01:10:34,919 --> 01:10:36,852
Oh, God damn it, please.

1060
01:10:36,854 --> 01:10:38,220
Why do you have to
keep doing that?

1061
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:39,788
What, I would have shot you
in the dick

1062
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,522
if the target wasn't so small!

1063
01:10:41,524 --> 01:10:42,892
It just seems
a little excessive.

1064
01:10:42,894 --> 01:10:44,660
You know, you could go
dick shot, then head shot,

1065
01:10:44,662 --> 01:10:46,695
then dick shot. Just mix it up
a little, something.

1066
01:10:46,697 --> 01:10:47,999
It's basically a public service.

1067
01:10:50,134 --> 01:10:51,734
Oh!
Don't do it again! God.

1068
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:53,568
Uh, you know, I don't...
I don't like it,

1069
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:55,470
- I don't like it.
- It's just some dick blood.

1070
01:10:55,472 --> 01:10:56,571
Miles?

1071
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,763
- What was he thinking?
- Yeah,

1072
01:11:20,765 --> 01:11:23,100
never bring
a spork to a gun fight, man.

1073
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,270
What are you doing?

1074
01:11:28,272 --> 01:11:29,907
Trying to find where
they're holding Nova.

1075
01:11:35,645 --> 01:11:37,647
Oh, God damn,
this comment section.

1076
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:39,516
It's like YouTube but worse.

1077
01:11:40,918 --> 01:11:42,153
No, it's about the same.

1078
01:11:43,854 --> 01:11:45,921
"I hope someone ices
that Nix bitch

1079
01:11:45,923 --> 01:11:47,191
and tea bags her corpse."

1080
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:51,727
That settles that,
I'm going to find every last

1081
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:53,796
one of those little trolls
and beat them to death

1082
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:55,731
- with their keyboards.
- You are fucking animals,

1083
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:56,734
you know that right.

1084
01:11:58,002 --> 01:11:58,834
<i>You like this, you like
watching people suffer?</i>

1085
01:11:58,836 --> 01:11:59,768
You like watching people
get hunted?

1086
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:02,570
If you didn't watch
they wouldn't exist

1087
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:05,810
<i>you pathetic sick fuck!</i>

1088
01:12:06,609 --> 01:12:08,545
Fuck you, dude.

1089
01:12:10,281 --> 01:12:12,915
Who the fuck is this guy, huh?
What the fuck.

1090
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:15,052
Hear, hear.
Good, good.

1091
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,154
Wish you had more volume.

1092
01:12:17,755 --> 01:12:19,589
Intense.
Feel better now?

1093
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:21,558
You got that out of your system?

1094
01:12:26,097 --> 01:12:28,065
- Whoa, holy shit.
- What?

1095
01:12:28,966 --> 01:12:31,266
Look, Riktor,
he's trying to expand Skizm.

1096
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,838
He's like building it into
a global franchise.

1097
01:12:38,743 --> 01:12:41,609
Can you actually just
like, send this to my Gmail?

1098
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:43,979
- It's funnier watching.
- Oh, God.

1099
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:45,816
Fuck you, man.

1100
01:12:51,122 --> 01:12:54,990
Oh, holy shit!
Damn, nice AA-12!

1101
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:57,092
- Fuck.
- These things?

1102
01:12:57,094 --> 01:12:58,861
- Yes!
- Yeah, I shelled out

1103
01:12:58,863 --> 01:13:00,595
for the deep black PVD coating.

1104
01:13:00,597 --> 01:13:04,199
But, now I kinda regret not
going with the UCP style camo.

1105
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,135
Oh, no you're crazy.
She's crazy.

1106
01:13:06,137 --> 01:13:08,871
You totally own it.
Seriously.

1107
01:13:08,873 --> 01:13:11,073
Thank you.
Yeah, you know your weapons.

1108
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:14,577
You know, shooting dip shits
in the head is life.

1109
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:17,780
Well, um, I better, you know.

1110
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:19,984
Right, yeah. Do your thing.
It was nice to meet you.

1111
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:23,687
Go! Go!

1112
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:35,299
Woo!

1113
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,901
Watch the last step!
It's a doozie!

1114
01:13:38,903 --> 01:13:40,004
Whoo.

1115
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:44,039
Oh.

1116
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,843
Someone
didn't skip leg day.

1117
01:13:48,913 --> 01:13:50,647
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1118
01:13:51,015 --> 01:13:53,851
Don't pull my hair.

1119
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:07,765
Whoa! Whoo!

1120
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:19,143
Fuck!

1121
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:24,213
Friday night just got
really lonely!

1122
01:14:33,457 --> 01:14:36,225
Just stay still and die,
you fucking coward.

1123
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:37,860
I really don't want to though.

1124
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:42,900
Fuck!

1125
01:14:53,043 --> 01:14:54,812
Oh, shit!

1126
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,825
Whoo!

1127
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:11,393
Didn't even hurt.

1128
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:13,397
Stop!
Hammer time!

1129
01:15:20,905 --> 01:15:22,104
A bullet proof vest

1130
01:15:22,106 --> 01:15:24,041
isn't gonna save you
from a head shot.

1131
01:15:30,347 --> 01:15:32,149
Do you know
what your problem is?

1132
01:15:35,286 --> 01:15:37,021
You need to smile more.

1133
01:15:41,892 --> 01:15:43,794
Let's give you a nice...

1134
01:15:44,195 --> 01:15:45,196
wide...

1135
01:15:45,396 --> 01:15:46,897
juicy grin.

1136
01:15:52,369 --> 01:15:56,538
I have the power!

1137
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:08,250
It's time to realign
your chakras.

1138
01:16:08,252 --> 01:16:10,187
<i>♪ She's a very kinky girl ♪</i>

1139
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:13,490
<i>♪ The kind you don't take home
to mother ♪</i>

1140
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:16,961
Enough.

1141
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:26,337
I think I just heard a ball pop.

1142
01:16:26,937 --> 01:16:28,305
Are they meant to pop?

1143
01:16:32,076 --> 01:16:33,942
You don't like fire?

1144
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:35,145
Do ya, huh?

1145
01:16:35,546 --> 01:16:38,080
Let's burn together, baby!

1146
01:16:38,082 --> 01:16:39,147
Whoo!

1147
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:54,398
Fool!

1148
01:16:58,569 --> 01:17:00,104
Don't shoot him!

1149
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:08,243
Yeah.
Chopper on the roof.

1150
01:17:08,245 --> 01:17:09,980
No. Just two seats.

1151
01:17:11,248 --> 01:17:14,051
No, everyone else is dead.

1152
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:20,424
Why does everything have to be
so fucking stressful, hmm?

1153
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:25,861
You know, they say that
sometimes a nice little stroll

1154
01:17:25,863 --> 01:17:27,798
can help to clear the head.

1155
01:17:29,867 --> 01:17:31,802
- Come on, let's go.
- Get off me!

1156
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,003
That's it, that's it.

1157
01:17:35,005 --> 01:17:36,106
Fuck!

1158
01:17:39,276 --> 01:17:40,277
Hey.

1159
01:17:41,879 --> 01:17:42,880
You good?

1160
01:17:45,282 --> 01:17:49,520
Did you not hear me say

1161
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:51,353
don't shoot?

1162
01:17:51,355 --> 01:17:53,090
Woah...

1163
01:17:53,557 --> 01:17:57,027
Yeah, you pull off the Rocky
look real well at least.

1164
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:01,463
What?
What is that?

1165
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:02,998
- What are you trying to do?
- Shit!

1166
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:09,638
Oh right...

1167
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,406
Hey, no, no, no.
You gotta put that on ice.

1168
01:18:11,408 --> 01:18:13,043
Come on, we gotta fix this.

1169
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:18,415
Oh, shit.

1170
01:18:19,016 --> 01:18:21,016
I wasted all my bullets
on Sid Dickless.

1171
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:22,918
Riktor's got Nova somewhere,
I can't find her.

1172
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,589
Have you learned
nothing from video games?

1173
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:27,925
If you see enemies...

1174
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:30,594
You jump on their heads
and they give you coins?

1175
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:32,928
No, fuck wad!
It means we're going

1176
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,496
the right way.
Come on let's find some more

1177
01:18:34,498 --> 01:18:36,467
- bad guys to shoot.
- Okay.

1178
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:42,504
Hey!

1179
01:18:42,506 --> 01:18:44,339
Where the fuck are you
going, asshole?

1180
01:18:44,341 --> 01:18:45,675
The action's back this way!

1181
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:47,142
Wait, you want me to go
out there

1182
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:47,976
and get my face shot off?

1183
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:49,378
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1184
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,179
Cops will be swarming
this place!

1185
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:52,381
This shit is over!

1186
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:56,017
It's not over until I say
it's over, you fucking traitor!

1187
01:18:56,019 --> 01:18:57,119
Traitor?

1188
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:58,954
Without me,
you would be nothing!

1189
01:18:58,956 --> 01:18:59,990
I mean, look at you!

1190
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:01,990
You look like someone
tried to paint a worn-out dildo

1191
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:04,126
- with a fucking Sharpie!
- Ah, that hurts.

1192
01:19:04,128 --> 01:19:06,563
Face it, Riktor.
This is the end.

1193
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:14,638
Look at him go!
He's like a wounded deer.

1194
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:17,975
Go Bambi's mom, go!

1195
01:19:27,251 --> 01:19:28,519
Kill them!

1196
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,458
Was this the right way?

1197
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,059
No we fucked up!

1198
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:39,930
- Far too many bad guys!
- Oh, God.

1199
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:42,700
Fuck.

1200
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:45,066
Oh, shit.

1201
01:19:45,068 --> 01:19:46,535
What the hell
are we going to do?

1202
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:49,137
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

1203
01:19:49,139 --> 01:19:51,408
Come on, get it.

1204
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:53,277
Hey! Hey!

1205
01:19:53,678 --> 01:19:55,243
You want to know a secret?

1206
01:19:55,245 --> 01:19:56,645
Fuck you!

1207
01:19:56,647 --> 01:19:58,549
This was never about the money.

1208
01:19:59,616 --> 01:20:01,151
This is about art.

1209
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,152
Murder is art.

1210
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,692
This one...

1211
01:20:09,694 --> 01:20:11,628
This is a Jackson Pollock.

1212
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:13,464
Ah!

1213
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:18,435
Overcompensating much?

1214
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:22,707
Where the fuck are you going?

1215
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:25,207
Get up!

1216
01:20:25,209 --> 01:20:26,711
Get the fuck up!

1217
01:20:28,312 --> 01:20:31,079
You know, you really need
to cheer the fuck up.

1218
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:32,782
Are you not even
a little bit excited

1219
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:35,152
about going in
a chopper with me?

1220
01:20:45,195 --> 01:20:46,729
You wanna know
how I survived this long?

1221
01:20:46,731 --> 01:20:48,999
I don't know, Nix,
by being crazy as fuck?

1222
01:20:50,133 --> 01:20:53,203
I didn't want to give any fucker
the satisfaction...

1223
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:55,205
of killing me.

1224
01:20:57,341 --> 01:20:59,109
Just kill Riktor for me.

1225
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:00,678
Okay, mouse?

1226
01:21:01,746 --> 01:21:03,078
Get the fuck out here
so I can shoot you!

1227
01:21:04,314 --> 01:21:05,616
Wait. No, wait!

1228
01:21:25,602 --> 01:21:26,637
No!

1229
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:39,649
Nix!

1230
01:22:02,272 --> 01:22:04,274
Fuck.

1231
01:22:05,409 --> 01:22:06,410
Come back here.

1232
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:08,312
Where'd you think you're going?

1233
01:22:10,581 --> 01:22:13,515
Get up there.
Come on.

1234
01:22:57,527 --> 01:22:58,763
Oh, shit!
Oh...

1235
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:12,542
Fuck! Nova!

1236
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:18,248
Nova!

1237
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,615
Miles! Miles!

1238
01:23:20,617 --> 01:23:21,753
"Miles!"

1239
01:23:23,721 --> 01:23:24,889
There you are.

1240
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:28,358
What took you so long, hmm?

1241
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:31,794
You made it all this way.

1242
01:23:31,796 --> 01:23:34,529
I even got you a rooftop
for the showdown!

1243
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:36,899
Nix is dead, it's over!

1244
01:23:36,901 --> 01:23:38,366
Let Nova go!

1245
01:23:41,706 --> 01:23:43,005
Oh, finally!

1246
01:23:43,007 --> 01:23:44,774
I should have ordered
a fucking Uber!

1247
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:46,608
<i>Okay, okay and we're back.</i>

1248
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,510
<i>We've got our stream back,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1249
01:23:48,512 --> 01:23:49,544
<i>Oh, thank fuck!</i>

1250
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:51,379
<i>Let's just see how this ends,
I guess.</i>

1251
01:23:51,381 --> 01:23:52,382
Oh, yeah.

1252
01:23:56,788 --> 01:23:59,689
Ten million concurrent viewers,
Miles.

1253
01:23:59,691 --> 01:24:02,725
You have just made
Skizm history!

1254
01:24:02,727 --> 01:24:04,526
You are somebody!

1255
01:24:04,528 --> 01:24:05,763
I took...

1256
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:09,934
a worthless piece of shit
and I molded it into steel!

1257
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:11,667
I made you, Miles.

1258
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:14,837
You should be down on

Oh, fuck you man!

1260
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,474
All you did was ruin my hands,
and give me a criminal record.

1261
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:21,276
I never wanted any of this!

1262

Hey?

1265
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:32,957
Admit it, you wanted
to feel something.

1266
01:24:33,423 --> 01:24:35,725
You wanted to... to...
to hunt like a man.

1267
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:37,827
You wanted to be somebody!

1268
01:24:37,829 --> 01:24:39,895
Yesterday
you were fucking miserable!

1269
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:41,699
Now, look at yourself.

1270
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:43,735
You're alive!

1271

1272
01:24:47,905 --> 01:24:49,707

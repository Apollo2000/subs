00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:14,338
<i>The British Empire</i>

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,439
<i>and the French Republic,</i>

4
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:17,673
<i>linked together

5
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:21,205
<i>We shall never surrender.</i>

6
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:33,305
<i>Men and
women of the United States,</i>

7
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:36,872
<i>this is a momentous hour
in world history.</i>

8
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:40,506
<i>Soldiers, sailors and airmen</i>

9
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,538
<i>of the Allied Expeditionary
Force,</i>

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,141
<i>you are about to embark
upon the Great Crusade.</i>

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,304
<i>You will bring about
the destruction</i>

12
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,271
<i>of the German war machine.</i>

13
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:54,738
<i>The elimination
of Nazi tyranny</i>

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,604
<i>over the oppressed peoples
of Europe.</i>

15
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:01,339
<i>I have full confidence
in your skill in battle.</i>

16
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,408
<i>The eyes of the world
are upon you.</i>

17
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:19,172
Hitler's already dead.

18
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:21,139
Short train ride
from Paris to Berlin,

19
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,240
and I get there
with this baby...

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,272
Pow!

21
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:28,139
We all go home.

22
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,941
That's a lot of boats!

23
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,540
I think I'd rather be up here.

24
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:52,439
Some Kraut bomber spots them

25
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,507
all squeezed together
like that,

26
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:58,139
take out 20 at a time.

27
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,271
Tougher to shoot down
a plane.

28
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:01,670
Hey, Rosenfeld!

29
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:05,105
More GIs die in planes
than boats. That's a fact.

30
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:09,271
Don't listen to Tibbet, Rosenfeld.
He's full of shit.

31
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:10,771
Hey, Grunauer!

32
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:13,338
How do you say "full of shit"
in German again?

33
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:17,606
I love that.

34
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:27,938
Hey.

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,506
Morton Chase.

36
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,604
I'm a photographer.

37
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:37,171
I heard the Sergeant say that
you were in Italy before this?

38
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,172
It's a great frame.
You mind if I snap

39
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:40,771
a couple pictures of you
looking out the window?

40
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:42,404
You know what I wouldn't mind,
Morton Chase,

41
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:44,738
is you taking your ass
back to your seat.

42
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,372
You making friends
already, pretty boy?

43
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,204
- You know that guy?
- No.

44
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,971
Corporal
from Baker Company.

45
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,238
Last minute transfer.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,638
I heard he got put in with us
for popping a captain.

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,738
He pops his C.O.
and gets a ride with us, huh?

48
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,637
So, what did we do wrong?

49
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,641
Uh, Boyce. Gum?

50
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:09,971
What the fuck is this?
What's this, for luck?

51
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:10,872
Come on, man.

52
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,271
Shit, you're gonna need
more than that

53
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:13,338
when we hit the ground.

54
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,604
Can you give me
my chain, please?

55
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:15,904
Ain't gonna be nothing
like boot camp,

56
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:18,538
not with those Jerries
firing real ammo.

57
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,138
And, hell, Boyce, you hardly
made it out of boot alive.

58
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,071
No lucky charm in the world

59
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:27,072
is gonna turn you
into a soldier.

60
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,204
Are you finished?

61
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,766
Are you gonna give me
the fucking chain?

62
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:33,438
- I'm screwing with you.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:41,938
Where's our drop zone, Nez?

64
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,370
The village of Cielblanc,
France, Sergeant!

65
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:46,470
And what is our target,
Grunauer?

66
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:48,205
Radio-jamming tower
on top of the church

67
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,738
near the town center,
Sergeant!

68
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,105
And why would the Nazis
put a radio-jamming tower

69
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,075
on top of a church,
Private Boyce?

70
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,438
Because they...

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,774
Good Christ Almighty, Boyce.

72
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:03,872
They put it
on a church because

73
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:06,437
the Nazis are
rotten sons of bitches.

74
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,037
And rotten sons of bitches
will do anything they have to

75
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,104
to destroy everything
that is good in this world!

76
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:15,438
That is why we have to be
just as rotten as they are.

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,671
Am I clear?

78
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,338
Yes, Sergeant!

79
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,838
There are gonna be over
120,000 Allied soldiers

80
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,471
fighting their way
onto a French beach

81
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,538
in the name
of all that is good

82
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,674
and pure in this world.

83
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:31,804
Those men are gonna need
air support!

84
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,537
That support will not make it
through Jerry's defenses

85
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:38,204
if we do not get
that tower down by 0600.

86
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,871
So what do you have to do?

87
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:42,005
Our goddamn job, Sergeant!

88
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,470
That's right.

89
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:45,737
Your goddamn job.

90
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:48,938
Corporal Ford here has joined
as our explosives expert.

91
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,638
You are lucky to have him.

92
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,605
You will obey his commands
as if you heard

93
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,172
my own beautiful voice
coming from his lips.

94
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,507
Our drop is 90 minutes out.

95
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,706
- Coo-ree!
- Coo-ree!

96
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,937
We must be
getting close.

97
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,738
Hope nothing goes wrong.

98
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,971
We miss our drop and land

99
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,404
in the middle of
a German squad or something...

100
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,537
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

101
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,637
Because we both know
what the Nazis

102
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,804
are gonna do to a guy
named Rosenfeld.

103
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,437
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

104
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,304
It's just a little
Kraut hello, ladies.

105
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:19,605
Hold your seat and stay calm.

106
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:21,108
We jump
when the light tells us.

107
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,004
Isn't this fun, ladies?

108
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:36,304
Oh, shit!

109
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:37,637
Too much flak!

110
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,237
We're gonna have to drop
a couple of clicks south.

111
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,837
Copy that.

112
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,637
Didn't I tell you,
ladies,

113
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,573
I'd show you a good time?

114
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,705
We're gonna fucking die!

115
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:10,638
We're gonna fucking die!

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,107
Sarge, you got...

117
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:14,771
- Murphy!
- Medic!

118
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,571
Settle down!
This is why we're here.

119
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,170
This is the job.

120
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,237
Grunauer, sit down!

121
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,938
Goddamn it, sit down!

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,938
I can save him!
I can save him!

123
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,570
He's dead! Sit down!
Everybody sit down!

124
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,741
Oh, shit!

125
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,041
Red level! Stand up.

126
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,840
Hook up.

127
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,273
Square up that line!

128
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,972
Wait for green.

129
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:52,904
Oh, shit.

130
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,706
- See you on the ground.
- I'll be right behind you.

131
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:57,937
Jacob!

132
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,605
- I'll be right behind you.
- Okay.

133
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,207
Manual deploy!

134
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:24,140
Tibbet, go!

135
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,707
Rosenfeld!

136
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,273
Go!

137
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,770
Fuck.

138
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:23,040
Jacob?

139
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,774
Jacob?

140
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:53,140
Jacob?

141
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:05,804
Sarge.

142
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:10,804
Any of you Krauts
got a cigarette?

143
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:15,170
You got to be
shitting me. None of you?

144
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:25,207
Well, that's goddamn...

145
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:39,538
Shut up. It's over.

146
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,438
You just let him die.

147
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,738
He was dead
before he hit the ground.

148
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,837
He fucking knew that.

149
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,270
What are you talking about?
We could've...

150
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:45,505
Done shit.

151
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:46,370
There were ten of them,

152
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:48,338
and I've seen how you hold
that rifle.

153
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,870
The Sergeant
wasn't the mission.

154
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:54,406
We got to get that tower down
by 0600. Let's go.

155
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:11,371
Another click north,

156
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,638
we reach the rally point
at Cielblanc.

157
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,971
That's if the others
even made it.

158
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:19,506
- Did you see anyone?
- No, just you.

159
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,971
And Sergeant Rensin.

160
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,670
Boyce, you keep worrying
about dead bodies,

161
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,903
you're gonna be one.

162
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,906
Well, Corporal, I had
friends on that plane.

163
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,570
Yeah.

164
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:32,239
Well, friends die.

165
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,173
Corporal.

166
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:46,404
Flash.

167
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,704
Thunder.

168
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,337
Welcome to France.

169
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:54,304
Hey, fellas!

170
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:56,004
- Shh.
- Oh, sorry.

171
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,537
I was afraid it was just
gonna be us three.

172
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,871
He was afraid.

173
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,505
I was about to end it
if I had to listen

174
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,370
to Annie Oakley over here
for another minute.

175
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,471
Tibbet, how you doing
on explosives?

176
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:06,670
I'm good.

177
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:09,673
Please tell me you got more
than just Boyce with you.

178
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,870
Goddamn it. Sorry.

179
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:15,670
- You got your camera.
- Oh, jeez. Huh?

180
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:16,870
- You brought your camera.
- Yes.

181
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,138
- That made the jump?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,371
Wow, that's well-made.

183
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,004
- Thank you.
- You get scenic shots with it?

184
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,171
Uh, well, I think

185
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:23,970
they want me to take
some more of the action,

186
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:26,303
maybe get some scenes
from the frontline.

187
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:29,637
Can I see that?
I can use that.

188
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,238
Just be careful with this.
You know, it's a fragile...

189
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,174
It's like wearing a
spotlight around your neck.

190
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,972
Sorry, man.

191
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,171
Any sign of Rosenfeld?

192
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,438
Saw Grunauer
about a mile east.

193
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,438
The Krauts had shot him
all to hell.

194
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,904
Shit. Not gonna be
nobody left to rally with.

195
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,605
Just keep smiling
through it, Tibbet.

196
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,804
Fuck France.

197
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:55,370
I bet you wish you were back
at Italy, huh, Corporal?

198
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,871
How'd you even end up
with us?

199
00:14:57,873 --> 00:14:59,736
I don't know, Tibbet.

200
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:01,837
Why do you talk so much?

201
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,604
Some questions
don't have good answers.

202
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:07,273
I'm gonna put that
in my book, Corporal Ford.

203
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:10,071
Your book?

204
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:12,470
Yeah. I've been writing it
since we got stationed.

205
00:15:12,472 --> 00:15:14,404
Is that what you're
always scribbling about?

206
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,204
Jesus, Dawson, I didn't
think a hick like you

207
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,071
knew enough letters
to make a sentence,

208
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:20,403
much less a fucking book.

209
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:23,036
My mama writes her cookbooks
for the church back home.

210
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,437
I figured
I'd try it over here.

211
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,971
All the stuff regular folks
don't know.

212
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,703
What goes on
from basic to here.

213
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:32,004
Sounds thrilling. Bet you'll
sell a million copies.

214
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,274
I'd buy one.

215
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,370
Thanks, buddy.

216
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,404
And, Chase, I was thinking
maybe me and you

217
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,470
could team up, use some
of your pictures in it.

218
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,072
That way, you get a cut
of the profits...

219
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,207
Boyce!

220
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:12,340
Boyce...
Boyce, walk on a line to me!

221
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,240
Boyce!

222
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:19,737
Where's Dawson?

223
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,736
- Where's Dawson?
- There is no Dawson.

224
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:25,440
Walk to me on a line like
you're on a fucking tightrope.

225
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,537
Fix your bayonet

226
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,605
and probe to my line.

227
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:37,104
Come on. We got to go!

228
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,839
Chase,
get right on his tracks.

229
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:46,240
Move it, keep coming.

230
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:55,303
Hey, hey, hey, get up.
Point your weapon that way.

231
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,371
Anyone want to come
over here and get me?

232
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,836
Use your rifle.
Light taps.

233
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:02,103
Not hard enough
to set off a mine.

234
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,107
Exactly how hard
is too hard?

235
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:06,174
You'll know.

236
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:10,407
Move it. We need to get
to the tree line.

237
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:46,840
He was there

238
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:50,573
and then he wasn't.

239
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,773
But you still are.

240
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,773
So get your head right.
We got a job to do.

241
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,104
What the hell is this?

242
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:05,103
A dog, maybe?

243
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:07,470
Oh. Smells like shit.

244
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:10,037
- What is that on it?
- Looks like an eyeball.

245
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,203
That's not normal.

246
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,737
Hey, turn off
the fucking light.

247
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,071
Jesus, sorry.

248
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:16,407
Goddamn it, doesn't matter
what it...

249
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,271
What it is.

250
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,740
That's not a dog.

251
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:23,536
Kind of looks
like a jackal.

252
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:26,239
- A jackal?
- Yeah, you know, Satan's dogs?

253
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,138
Patrol hell.

254
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,670
Rip the spirit
right out of your body

255
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,270
and take it straight
to the devil.

256
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:33,004
Where do you come up
with this shit?

257
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,203
What do you mean?

258
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,138
How do these things
pop into your head?

259
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,338
The Bible.

260
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,437
The Bible.

261
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,270
How many jackals
have you seen with a hoof?

262
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:41,537
That's exactly
my point.

263
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,270
This is not
your average jackal.

264
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,672
Hey!

265
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,171
Corporal,
what do we do?

266
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,171
She can't let anyone
know we're here.

267
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:03,706
Grab her. Grab her.

268
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,337
Easy. Easy, easy. Easy.

269
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,905
You're safe.

270
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,972
It's O.K.

271
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,799
It's over.

272
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:39,639
Boyce, official translator.
All right.

273
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:46,470
Our girl's a scavenger.

274
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,972
Cielblanc?
Is that your village?

275
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:51,672
Cielblanc?

276
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,439
Germans? Many Germans?

277
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,840
Here.

278
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:15,705
Boyce, tell her
to lead the way.

279
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,440
Can you...

280
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,219
take us?

281
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,123
The bag.

282
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,238
This?

283
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,440
Here.

284
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,972
Fucking Nazis.

285
00:21:25,106 --> 00:21:26,572
That's my home.

286
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,661
That's my home.
But you can't be seen.

287
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,537
Corporal? This is it.

288
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,405
What are we gonna find
in there?

289
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:37,064
Do you live by yourself?

290
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,288
With my brother.

291
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,698
With my brother.
He's eight. And our Aunt.

292
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:42,703
Just an
aunt and kid brother.

293
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,871
Okay. We're gonna find out
if she's telling the truth.

294
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:47,603
Boyce, you stay here.

295
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,736
If she runs, shoot her.

296
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,238
Let's go.

297
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,880
You and I wait here.

298
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,530
He's just going to look That's all.

299
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:12,670
No. No.

300
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,432
Who's down there?

301
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:16,118
I said who's down there?

302
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,511
Hide yourself.

303
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,375
Mrs. Lesner...

304
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,981
It's just me, Chloe.

305
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,875
You shouldn't be out.

306
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,493
I'll tell the Captain.

307
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,386
- No, no
- I'm going home.

308
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,324
- No, no - I'm going home.
- He'll take you to the Church!

309
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,348
I'm going home.

310
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,057
No, stop!

311
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,442
This girl is out past curfew!

312
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,248
- This girl is out past curfew!
- I'm going home!

313
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,340
All is good.

314
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,537
Girl tip them off?

315
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,369
No. I don't think
she likes the Germans

316
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:07,804
any more than we do.

317
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:10,570
Because they're pigs.

318
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:12,773
I needed to make sure
you weren't as well.

319
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:15,740
This way.

320
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,937
Oh, man,
that's beautiful.

321
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,803
<i>Ooh la la la. Oui, oui.</i>
Oh, you know,

322
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:25,673
we go to Eiffel Tower and all that shit.

323
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:45,436
What the hell is that?

324
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:47,639
My aunt. She's sick.

325
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:03,538
- Be quiet.
- Me?

326
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,369
Tell this kid not to do
creepy shit like that.

327
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:14,191
Is she gonna be a problem?

328
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:16,173
No.

329
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,238
She's very sick.

330
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:28,940
<i>Bonjour.</i>

331
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,669
A lot of Krauts
moving around out there.

332
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,537
Two buzzsaws by my count.

333
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,004
And that wall
is well fortified, too.

334
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,070
Everybody de-rig.

335
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:48,402
All the explosives and timers
on this table,

336
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:49,939
and I need a count.

337
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,670
Ma'am.

338
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:54,202
Have you been inside
that compound?

339
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,336
No.

340
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:56,769
The trucks go in and out,

341
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,437
but we are shot
if we go near it.

342
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,302
We'll have to clock their
patrols and scale it in a gap.

343
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:03,136
Oh, and hope that
there's not a firing squad

344
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:04,636
waiting for us
behind that wall?

345
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,004
We just need
enough time to place

346
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:07,637
the explosives on that tower.

347
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,637
Tibbet, if we could put you
in a good position,

348
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:10,971
you think you could keep
those buzzsaws off

349
00:26:10,973 --> 00:26:12,971
Chase and I if they see us
dropping over?

350
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:13,837
Wait, what?

351
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,437
I mean, I can
buy you some time,

352
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,035
but once I start popping,
they're gonna be coming out

353
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,570
of every door.
I can't cover that.

354
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:20,069
Well, what if I...

355
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:21,170
I'm not sure that I'm the best
person to climb the tower.

356
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:22,537
Maybe I could go.

357
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:35,769
What are
they doing with them?

358
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,439
What they've done to so many.

359
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,139
To my parents.

360
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:46,302
- Oh, shit!
- Jesus Christ.

361
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,603
You can't stay here.

362
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,803
They patrol all night,
inspecting houses,

363
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:51,138
doing whatever they like.

364
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,537
We just need to stay here
till that tower comes down

365
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,870
in less than four hours.

366
00:26:58,872 --> 00:27:00,205
Don't worry, sweetheart.

367
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:03,937
Oh, Jesus!

368
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,337
We got to put a bell on this
little fucker, or something.

369
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,269
There's a lot of
soldiers out there

370
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:12,105
and there's only four of us.

371
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:13,440
So,

372
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:15,837
maybe we should wait.

373
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,302
See if more of our guys
show up first.

374
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,369
Pretty boy, you finally said
something smart.

375
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,670
- Thank you.
- Corporal, there is no sense

376
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:24,003
committing suicide
over some tower.

377
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:25,469
We all heard the Sergeant.

378
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,403
The planes can't provide
air support

379
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:29,769
to the beaches unless
we take the tower out.

380
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:31,769
- Oh, listen to you!
- Right?

381
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:32,936
All of a sudden

382
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:34,437
talking like a real soldier
there, Boyce.

383
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:36,679
And what are you prepared to
do to take out those Krauts?

384
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:39,269
Whatever I have to.

385
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,203
Whatever you have to.

386
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:41,871
And what is that exactly?
Tell me more.

387
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:42,969
What's your point, Tibbet?

388
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:45,005
My point is you couldn't
even kill a mouse,

389
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:46,970
could you?

390
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:48,703
Corporal, you've got to
hear this.

391
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,202
We had this mouse, he
gets in the barracks

392
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,102
back at base, right?

393
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,769
The thing's shitting
all over the place,

394
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,503
so Sarge, he orders
somebody to kill it.

395
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,337
So Boyce here,
he catches the thing

396
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:58,935
in his boot and he sets it
loose in a field.

397
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:01,003
But the mouse comes back
the next night,

398
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:03,137
and it's crapping all over
Sarge's pillow.

399
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,736
So Sarge, he has us
running up hills

400
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:06,406
all morning for that shit.

401
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:15,338
You're not built
for this, Boyce.

402
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,637
Even if you were, there's
10 Krauts to every one of us.

403
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,003
Tibbet, enough!

404
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:23,770
And go see if anyone else
made it to the rally point.

405
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:26,103
- Take Chase with you.
- Oh, goddamn it.

406
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,469
Chase, go. And be back here
at 0300.

407
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,592
What?

408
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:32,837
What?

409
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:35,803
It's all pops and clicks.

410
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:37,069
I don't understand
what you're saying.

411
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,604
He asked if
you wanted to play.

412
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:40,603
He thinks all Americans
play baseball.

413
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:42,903
Yeah, well, not this one.

414
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:44,869
Tell him to get a pool cue
and five bucks

415
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:46,369
and we'll be in business.

416
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,439
Chase, move it!

417
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:51,006
Ma'am?

418
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,506
Thank you.

419
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,436
I need you to go downstairs and
make sure everything stays clear.

420
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,670
Right, but Tibbet and Chase,
they probably need a little...

421
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,073
Boyce, go.

422
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:12,305
I told you my aunt was sick.

423
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:21,473
What happened to her?

424
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,439
I don't know.

425
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,170
Ask the Germans.

426
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:33,339
She hasn't spoken since I
got her back from the church.

427
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,372
I need to clean that.

428
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:02,205
Let's go!

429
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:14,972
I liked the story
about the mouse.

430
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:18,337
Your English is good.

431
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:21,202
I went
to university in London

432
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:23,272
to be a veterinarian.

433
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,540
Then the war came,

434
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:28,273
and everything changed.

435
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,205
That's Paul.

436
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:33,072
And I'm Chloe.

437
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,439
I'm Ed.

438
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,305
Reminds me of home.

439
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,570
Your French
has a different sound.

440
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:07,470
My grandmother taught me.
She was from Haiti.

441
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:11,668
But she moved to the States.
She was in Louisiana.

442
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,005
I don't know Louisiana.

443
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,472
It's hot.

444
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:22,073
It's hot.

445
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:25,339
And, um,

446
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:28,072
there is no war there?

447
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:30,506
Not like this.

448
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:43,503
You said before that, um,

449
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,704
the Germans, they took
your parents?

450
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,440
Our father first.

451
00:32:50,372 --> 00:32:52,970
A few weeks later
they come for our mother.

452
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,002
The German doctor,

453
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,569
he believes the tar
in the ground

454
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,038
has some kind of a power.

455
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:02,139
He calls it his science.

456
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:06,569
But it's just an excuse
to kill us.

457
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:51,938
Good evening, Miss Laurent.

458
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,082
May I come in?

459
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,825
Another miserable night...

460
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,330
Looking for volunteers.

461
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,610
Alas...

462
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:35,757
Such is life.

463
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,335
What are you doing?

464
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,593
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

465
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,792
That's strange...

466
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,691
No rabbit tonight?

467
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,203
You didn't cook anything?

468
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,298
I was busy.

469
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:34,716
Doing what?

470
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,417
Helping my aunt.

471
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,064
OK.

472
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,169
Do you have a moment for us?

473
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:50,906
Hmm?

474
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,043
Not tonight...

475
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,321
Please...

476
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,739
Must we always go through this?

477
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,053
Need I remind you of our agreement?

478
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,077
I'm sorry, I don't feel well.

479
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:25,572
I don't have time for this tonight, Chloe.

480
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,084
I don't have time tonight.

481
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:34,576
Where's Paul?

482
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,850
He's sleeping.

483
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,233
He sleeps in the attic?

484
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:47,622
Stay here, Chloe.

485
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:49,205
It's just a kid with a ball.

486
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,763
So he can't sleep, am I right?

487
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,360
Perhaps the doctor can
help him with that...

488
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,330
...like he helped your Aunt.

489
00:38:04,671 --> 00:38:05,806
Hmm?

490
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,404
Shall we take him there?

491
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,182
Or shall I stay?

492
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:27,847
Stay.

493
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,184
I'm so glad.

494
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,338
Thank you.

495
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,097
Yes, boss.

496
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,723
Let's move.

497
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:47,571
Get up, you piece of shit.

498
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:51,272
Someone's been unfaithful...

499
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:56,472
You okay?

500
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:03,006
She is for now.

501
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,769
But none of you will be
for very long.

502
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:15,668
Don't worry about us, Franz.

503
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,539
I like our odds a whole lot
better than yours right now.

504
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,072
This is very nice.

505
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:37,969
Did your boss give this
to you

506
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:40,171
for hitting
your execution quota?

507
00:40:57,505 --> 00:41:00,736
I need some kind of sack.

508
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:03,468
Boyce, you just put the whole
fucking mission at risk.

509
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,635
Corporal, we couldn't just
let her...

510
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:07,136
Shut up.
Go get Tibbet and Chase.

511
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:10,539
We got to move on that tower.

512
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:36,735
Oh, fuck!

513
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,271
Help me, please.

514
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,969
Shit!

515
00:51:34,503 --> 00:51:35,634
Jacob?

516
00:51:44,937 --> 00:51:46,638
Shh. Be quiet.

517
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:41,603
We got to get
the hell out of here.

518
00:52:50,238 --> 00:52:51,567
No, wait.

519
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:55,371
I'm sorry. Listen to me!
I have to pull it out, okay?

520
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:58,304
This might hurt. Sorry.

521
00:52:59,836 --> 00:53:01,337
Come on. Come on.

522
00:53:34,537 --> 00:53:35,735
What now?

523
00:53:39,138 --> 00:53:40,670
Yeah, here.

524
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,403
Here. Cover us.

525
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:02,937
Hurry.

526
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:19,604
Come on.

527
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,702
It's been too long.

528
00:54:55,704 --> 00:54:58,371
Ten bucks says
Boyce got himself grabbed.

529
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:13,071
Don't you got yourself a dog
to play with or something?

530
00:55:24,503 --> 00:55:26,904
Jesus, Chase.
Enough with the camera.

531
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:40,467
No luck?

532
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:41,701
I sent him to you.

533
00:55:41,703 --> 00:55:43,835
So it's my fault
Boyce didn't show up?

534
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:46,334
You said wait at the bridge.
I waited.

535
00:55:46,336 --> 00:55:48,034
It's a miracle I even
kept Jughead here alive.

536
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:49,770
Hey! Some help!

537
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:54,768
What happened to him?

538
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,968
I found him
inside the church.

539
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,400
Krauts grabbed me
as soon as I hit the ground.

540
00:55:58,402 --> 00:56:00,335
Woke up with all kinds of
shit stuck in me.

541
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:03,534
Inside the church? How did
you get inside the church?

542
00:56:03,536 --> 00:56:05,135
On dead bodies.

543
00:56:05,137 --> 00:56:06,334
Slow down. Slow down.

544
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:08,801
Listen to me. They're doing
experiments on them in there.

545
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:10,535
They're doing experiments
on the villagers!

546
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:11,934
- What?
- Just like her aunt.

547
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:13,501
They're burning people
with these flamethrowers,

548
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,935
and they're still moving,
the bodies...

549
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:16,501
And they're pumping tar
from the ground

550
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:17,767
into these cocoon things...

551
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:20,200
Breathe. Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?

552
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:21,667
She doesn't have a body

553
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,136
and she's still talking,
and I saw Rosenfeld...

554
00:56:24,138 --> 00:56:25,534
Boyce!

555
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:28,105
Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?

556
00:56:32,504 --> 00:56:34,670
- The tower base...
- Yeah.

557
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:36,934
...is below the ground.

558
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:38,735
But there's more than that
down there.

559
00:56:38,737 --> 00:56:40,237
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Look.

560
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:50,638
What the hell is that?

561
00:56:58,138 --> 00:56:59,671
What is this shit?

562
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,167
What is that, German?

563
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:05,567
I don't understand German.
Do you understand German?

564
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,002
I don't speak German.

565
00:57:07,004 --> 00:57:10,268
I'm simply
an officer for the <i>Fuhrer.</i>

566
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,468
I know nothing
of what the doctor does.

567
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,738
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

568
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:21,801
Well, I don't think that the, uh, private
here, I don't think he believes you.

569
00:57:21,803 --> 00:57:24,868
I saw your men and the doctor
burn those people.

570
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,001
This is war, <i>ja?</i>

571
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:32,005
People die
in many unfortunate ways.

572
00:57:32,402 --> 00:57:33,935
I'm sure your

573
00:57:33,937 --> 00:57:36,604
corporal has killed
many people.

574
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:43,771
Oh, yeah. Hey.

575
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,735
Stay focused.

576
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:46,935
I'm on the clock here, Franz,

577
00:57:46,937 --> 00:57:48,268
so if you don't tell me
what I need to know,

578
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,868
the private here is gonna
paint this room with you.

579
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,501
What do you do
with those people

580
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:56,304
that you take
into that church?

581
00:58:00,836 --> 00:58:03,703
They have been given
a purpose.

582
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:16,201
For once in their pathetic
lives they have value...

583
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:20,700
Like your Aunt, the blood and
the bodies of this village...

584
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:24,332
will contribute in ways
you can hardly imagine.

585
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:29,568
Get her off!

586
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,805
Get her the fuck
out of here.

587
00:58:37,603 --> 00:58:39,136
Ugh.

588
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,071
Sorry about that.

589
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:46,534
Now,

590
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:47,635
we don't need this

591
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:49,704
because it's got nothing
to do with us.

592
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:53,604
Fuck you.

593
00:59:05,302 --> 00:59:06,303
Get him up.

594
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,702
- What are we doing now?
- Hoist him up.

595
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:22,904
- What?
- Hoist him up.

596
00:59:25,737 --> 00:59:26,868
<i>Nein. Nein.</i>

597
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,502
Corporal, why do we need
to hoist him up for?

598
00:59:28,504 --> 00:59:30,902
We know he's not gonna talk.
You said we have to move.

599
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:32,771
We have a mission, right?

600
00:59:34,936 --> 00:59:36,234
Right?

601
00:59:41,637 --> 00:59:43,304
You know
what I need to know.

602
00:59:48,636 --> 00:59:50,702
What's inside that
compound wall of yours?

603
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:52,805
Men, weapons, everything.

604
00:59:54,003 --> 00:59:55,170
Hmm?

605
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:58,071
Fuck you.

606
01:00:00,504 --> 01:00:01,704
Hey, Franz...

607
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:07,204
I'm gonna win this one.

608
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:22,201
You're gonna fucking talk.
You're gonna fucking talk.

609
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:30,235
Ford!

610
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:32,438
- What?
- What the hell are we doing?

611
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:36,368
You think this asshole
deserves better?

612
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,768
We're not him!

613
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,668
You want to beat them,

614
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,901
you play just as dirty
as they do.

615
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:43,838
Now get the fuck back.

616
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:55,933
How many men you have
behind that wall?

617
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,470
How many troops
inside that compound?

618
01:01:07,336 --> 01:01:09,136
Get the fuck out of here.

619
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:52,004
I don't recognize myself anymore.

620
01:01:58,169 --> 01:02:00,634
Three months ago, I was

621
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:03,368
cutting grass
in my front yard

622
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,304
and the mailman shows up
with a letter from the Army.

623
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:08,437
Now I'm here.

624
01:02:15,337 --> 01:02:17,904
With no idea of where
I'm gonna end up.

625
01:02:35,637 --> 01:02:37,868
If we can believe him,

626
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,134
they got at least
40 men inside the wall.

627
01:02:40,136 --> 01:02:44,101
Forty? Well,
definitely that's too many.

628
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:45,201
Right? It's too many.

629
01:02:45,203 --> 01:02:47,100
It'll make it tough
to slip by.

630
01:02:47,102 --> 01:02:48,767
Tibbet'll have to keep them
busy long enough

631
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,503
for you and me
to rig that tower.

632
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:53,501
You still going
with that plan?

633
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,834
It's all we got.

634
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:55,967
You know,
there might be access

635
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:57,168
to the tower from inside.

636
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:58,768
I mean, I saw some kind of
operations room

637
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,367
when I was down there.

638
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:02,135
So we gotta fight our way
into the church

639
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,634
and then
fight our way out? No.

640
01:03:03,636 --> 01:03:05,100
It's better to stay outside.

641
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:07,003
Sixty minutes until
they hit the beach.

642
01:03:08,637 --> 01:03:11,235
You got a vehicle we can use?
You won't get it back.

643
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:13,037
My father kept one
in the garage.

644
01:03:14,203 --> 01:03:16,867
Chase, go get the Kraut
ready to travel.

645
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:19,003
We're gonna use him
to draw a crowd.

646
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,271
Show me this garage.

647
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:36,404
Hey. Time to move.

648
01:04:02,402 --> 01:04:04,370
Hey. Fella.

649
01:04:06,303 --> 01:04:07,438
Wake up.

650
01:04:12,703 --> 01:04:14,504
I think I'm gonna need
some help...

651
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:19,667
No! No! Stop it! Stop!
Let go! No!

652
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:21,070
Help!

653
01:04:23,303 --> 01:04:24,304
Chase!

654
01:04:35,604 --> 01:04:36,638
Hey, hey, hey.

655
01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:41,535
Chase, Chase, Chase.

656
01:04:41,537 --> 01:04:43,004
He was asleep.

657
01:04:44,703 --> 01:04:46,635
He was asleep.

658
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:47,767
Goddamn it.

659
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:49,367
Shut up.
It's not your fault.

660
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:51,766
- Put pressure on it.
- Yeah, put pressure.

661
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,401
Is it bad? Is it bad?

662
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:55,468
Shh. Just look at me.
You're fine. You're fine.

663
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,301
- How's he doing?
- Chase.

664
01:04:57,303 --> 01:04:59,867
Open your mouth, huh.
There you go.

665
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:02,168
Hey, Ed?
Don't let me die, okay?

666
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,701
You're not gonna die.
You're all right.

667
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:05,801
You're all right.

668
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:07,168
Pressure, put pressure.

669
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,833
Come on, Chase.
It's gonna be okay, son.

670
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,701
I don't feel good.

671
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:13,800
Stay down, stay down.

672
01:05:13,802 --> 01:05:16,235
Chase, relax, relax, relax.

673
01:05:16,237 --> 01:05:18,267
You're all right.

674
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:20,200
You're all right, Chase.
Just stay with us.

675
01:05:20,202 --> 01:05:21,867
Look at me, Chase,
look at me.

676
01:05:21,869 --> 01:05:23,801
Chase. Chase.

677
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:25,271
Where's my camera?

678
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,434
It's right here.

679
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:28,702
It's your camera.

680
01:05:31,403 --> 01:05:32,538
Chase.

681
01:05:36,402 --> 01:05:37,867
Chase.

682
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:45,503
Chase.

683
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:55,200
Let me put a bullet
in his fat Kraut face!

684
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,300
No, no, no, no,
we still need him.

685
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:57,604
I'll get you another one!

686
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,438
What are you doing?

687
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:28,100
Boyce, he's dead.

688
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:31,100
Rosenfeld, get these explosives
off the table. We need to move.

689
01:06:31,102 --> 01:06:33,033
If they haven't heard us
by now, they just did.

690
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:34,370
Move it!

691
01:06:34,935 --> 01:06:37,000
Keep moving. Move!

692
01:06:37,002 --> 01:06:40,135
Boyce, explosives, now.

693
01:06:40,137 --> 01:06:42,334
Come on. Air support
can't cover that beach

694
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:44,468
as long as that tower's
still up.

695
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:46,467
What are you
smiling at, buddy?

696
01:06:51,169 --> 01:06:52,769
Holy Christ.

697
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:54,736
Uh...

698
01:06:57,469 --> 01:07:00,737
You asked what the
serum was, Corporal.

699
01:07:04,035 --> 01:07:05,170
I'm thirsty.

700
01:07:07,137 --> 01:07:09,537
How do you...
How do you feel?

701
01:07:17,568 --> 01:07:19,437
I feel really good.

702
01:07:25,036 --> 01:07:26,769
Doesn't even hurt.

703
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:31,403
Not as bad
as it looks, I guess.

704
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:38,100
That's weird.

705
01:07:38,102 --> 01:07:40,104
Add it to the list.

706
01:07:42,635 --> 01:07:44,171
- Chase?
- Huh?

707
01:07:45,003 --> 01:07:46,471
Can you stand up?

708
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:47,933
Yeah.

709
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:50,336
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

710
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,403
Is it hot in here?

711
01:07:56,336 --> 01:07:58,403
I feel hot.

712
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:04,467
- Chase.
- Chase.

713
01:08:04,469 --> 01:08:07,204
- Maybe you should sit down.
- My head hurts.

714
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:21,437
What the fuck?

715
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:23,703
Ed?

716
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,437
- Chase?
- Oh, my God.

717
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:30,702
- Shit.
- Jesus.

718
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:33,404
My head hurts.

719
01:08:34,036 --> 01:08:35,937
Whoa, Chase.

720
01:08:36,702 --> 01:08:37,668
Chase, sit down.

721
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,800
Jesus Christ, Chase!
Jesus Christ!

722
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:42,667
What's wrong with him?

723
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:43,900
I don't know.

724
01:08:48,903 --> 01:08:49,904
Chase.

725
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,637
I'm gonna
fucking shoot him.

726
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:01,634
Corporal,
no, please.

727
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:03,670
Corporal, relax, please.
Chase.

728
01:09:04,202 --> 01:09:05,267
Hey, pal.

729
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:06,404
Hey, Chase?

730
01:09:09,202 --> 01:09:11,500
What did you do to me, Ed?

731
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:14,536
- What did you do?
- Chase, stop!

732
01:09:40,768 --> 01:09:42,303
What just happened?

733
01:09:43,402 --> 01:09:45,004
A Thousand-Year Reich

734
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,371
needs thousand-year soldiers.

735
01:09:56,003 --> 01:09:58,271
You got to be
shitting me.

736
01:10:12,803 --> 01:10:13,804
Boyce.

737
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:16,134
Boyce!

738
01:10:16,136 --> 01:10:18,268
Hey. Hey.
It's over. It's over!

739
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:21,334
It's over! It wasn't him.
That was not Chase.

740
01:10:21,336 --> 01:10:23,601
You hear me? It wasn't Chase.

741
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:25,134
Holy shit.

742
01:10:25,136 --> 01:10:26,334
Does somebody want to tell me

743
01:10:26,336 --> 01:10:28,537
what the fuck
is going on here?

744
01:10:41,469 --> 01:10:43,437
- Paul.
- Goddamn it!

745
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:46,702
Chloe!

746
01:10:47,469 --> 01:10:49,703
Chloe!

747
01:11:02,668 --> 01:11:03,804
Fuck!

748
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:18,870
Get down!

749
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,235
No! Paul! Paul!

750
01:11:40,237 --> 01:11:42,103
Chloe!

751
01:11:43,003 --> 01:11:44,101
Fuck!

752
01:11:44,103 --> 01:11:45,469
Paul!

753
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,567
Damn it!

754
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:50,434
We got to move. We take down
that tower right now.

755
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:52,201
Boyce, you and I are
climbing it.

756
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:53,366
Tibbet and Rosenfeld
will cover us.

757
01:11:53,368 --> 01:11:54,467
Corporal, wait,
what about the kid?

758
01:11:54,469 --> 01:11:55,634
Come on, we got to move!
Goddamn it!

759
01:11:55,636 --> 01:11:58,734
They grabbed him
because of us. Wait, wait.

760
01:11:58,736 --> 01:12:00,867
And the labs? The shit
they're doing down there?

761
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:02,801
That doesn't matter!
They're not our mission.

762
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:04,600
We take out the tower,
troops come in

763
01:12:04,602 --> 01:12:06,334
and deal with whatever's
below ground later.

764
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:07,833
Her brother will be dead
by then.

765
01:12:07,835 --> 01:12:09,501
You forget
what your job is, Private?

766
01:12:09,503 --> 01:12:10,834
It's about more than
that now, Corporal!

767
01:12:10,836 --> 01:12:12,967
Do I have to drag your ass
up that fucking tower?

768
01:12:12,969 --> 01:12:15,467
Yes, you do. Because I'm not
leaving him down there.

769
01:12:15,469 --> 01:12:16,937
I gave you an order!

770
01:12:32,003 --> 01:12:33,004
No.

771
01:12:34,902 --> 01:12:35,904
No.

772
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:39,436
No. No!

773
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:42,034
We have to do this!

774
01:12:42,036 --> 01:12:44,137
You know we have to do this,
Corporal.

775
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,299
I can get us inside.

776
01:12:47,301 --> 01:12:50,233
I can. I can get us inside!

777
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:51,633
We can blow the tower
from below.

778
01:12:51,635 --> 01:12:53,770
We can destroy
their fucking labs!

779
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:59,137
We could grab the kid
as a bonus. Kill two birds.

780
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:09,168
If we do this,

781
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:10,734
our odds of walking
out of here

782
01:13:10,736 --> 01:13:13,000
go down to nearly zero.

783
01:13:13,002 --> 01:13:14,801
If we pull it off,
that walk back's

784
01:13:14,803 --> 01:13:16,901
gonna feel a hell
of a lot sweeter.

785
01:13:16,903 --> 01:13:18,769
And I can lead us
straight there.

786
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:23,670
Okay.

787
01:13:25,137 --> 01:13:26,869
Tell me while we move.

788
01:13:40,269 --> 01:13:41,734
No, don't!

789
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,671
The serum is still unstable.

790
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,808
It needs more testing - no!

791
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:56,314
We've never tried it on the living!

792
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,568
Wafner, don't!

793
01:14:37,136 --> 01:14:39,601
There's an old drainage
line just east of the church.

794
01:14:39,603 --> 01:14:41,634
The tunnel entrance
is down the slope.

795
01:14:41,636 --> 01:14:43,534
- Right.
- And over here is the church.

796
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:45,968
Make sure you can
cover that entrance.

797
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,433
Here should give you
a good angle

798
01:14:47,435 --> 01:14:48,833
on our bait
and those two buzzsaws.

799
01:14:48,835 --> 01:14:50,399
You got to keep those
from getting wound up.

800
01:14:50,401 --> 01:14:53,067
Be nice to have a friend to
keep any loose Krauts off me.

801
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:55,389
Yeah, I can cover
him while Boyce sneaks you in.

802
01:14:56,301 --> 01:14:57,367
Okay.

803
01:14:57,369 --> 01:14:58,567
You got to make sure
it feels like

804
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:00,099
the entire 101st is
laying down on them.

805
01:15:00,101 --> 01:15:02,199
We need to pull as
many outside as we can.

806
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:04,299
The more they're bunched up
for us, the better.

807
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:06,969
- I'll take care of that.
- And be careful.

808
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:12,901
Gonna catch on at some
point it's just two guys.

809
01:15:12,903 --> 01:15:15,566
Just buy us enough time down
below to get the ordnance set.

810
01:15:15,568 --> 01:15:17,433
Then we'll rescue the kid.

811
01:15:17,435 --> 01:15:20,100
- I think we can manage that.
- Yeah.

812
01:15:20,102 --> 01:15:22,099
Good luck.

813
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,534
You keep your head down.

814
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:24,970
- You too, Ed.
- Yeah.

815
01:15:25,902 --> 01:15:26,904
Hey.

816
01:15:28,635 --> 01:15:29,833
Woulda made a hell
of a chapter

817
01:15:29,835 --> 01:15:31,467
in Dawson's book, huh?

818
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,454
She's mine.

819
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,687
Take care of the Aunt!

820
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:54,827
Please...

821
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,436
I was just looking for my brother.

822
01:18:22,201 --> 01:18:24,561
- Reloading!
- Hurry up, Rosenfeld, I need you!

823
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,103
Shit!

824
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:29,302
Come on, you fucker!

825
01:18:30,736 --> 01:18:32,536
Door! Get the door!
Get the door!

826
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:38,967
Sounds like the package
did its job.

827
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:41,437
Hopefully those two
can pull the rest away.

828
01:19:00,835 --> 01:19:02,100
Don't stop shooting.

829
01:19:02,102 --> 01:19:04,403
It's a two-person gun,
you bastard!

830
01:19:05,469 --> 01:19:07,335
Shit! Goddamn it!

831
01:19:09,769 --> 01:19:11,199
Let's move.

832
01:19:11,201 --> 01:19:12,270
Move!

833
01:19:19,402 --> 01:19:21,367
Okay, where now?

834
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:22,900
I think the tower room
is down this way.

835
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:24,366
What about Paul?

836
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:27,000
We rig this place,
then we find your brother.

837
01:19:27,002 --> 01:19:29,234
Listen, we'll find him.
Don't worry.

838
01:19:29,236 --> 01:19:31,600
No. I don't have time
for that.

839
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:33,069
Chloe. Chloe!

840
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:36,102
She was never gonna wait.

841
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:49,510
My brother.

842
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,470
Where is he?

843
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,041
Where?!

844
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:58,635
How should we know?

845
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:07,149
Do you know where my brother is?

846
01:20:36,568 --> 01:20:39,299
Boyce, go get started
on those labs that you saw.

847
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,300
Boats on the beach
in 20 minutes.

848
01:20:41,302 --> 01:20:43,032
I'm setting these timers
for 18.

849
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:45,370
Anybody still down here after
that is not making it out.

850
01:20:45,735 --> 01:20:46,936
Go.

851
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:09,969
Paul?

852
01:21:20,635 --> 01:21:21,637
Paul?

853
01:21:26,702 --> 01:21:28,433
He said Paul was in there.

854
01:21:28,435 --> 01:21:29,755
Hey. Paul's not in there.
Come on!

855
01:21:35,035 --> 01:21:36,866
Come on. Come on!

856
01:21:52,935 --> 01:21:55,403
- Tibbet!
- Oh, shit.

857
01:22:00,035 --> 01:22:02,437
Move it! Move that ass! Go!

858
01:22:09,035 --> 01:22:11,102
This is where they had Jacob.

859
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:16,436
Slow, slow, slow.

860
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:37,933
Paul?

861
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:41,300
- Paul?
- Chloe!

862
01:22:41,302 --> 01:22:43,169
- Paul?
- Chloe!

863
01:22:52,269 --> 01:22:55,536
Let's go. Let's go!
Hurry and get him up.

864
01:22:58,001 --> 01:22:59,199
Let's go.

865
01:22:59,201 --> 01:23:01,067
- Hurry up and get him out.
- No.

866
01:23:01,069 --> 01:23:04,666
I have to finish this.
I have to finish this!

867
01:23:04,668 --> 01:23:05,736
I'll catch up.

868
01:23:06,536 --> 01:23:08,070
I'll catch up.

869
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:12,135
Be careful.

870
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:15,203
Go.

871
01:23:38,202 --> 01:23:40,337
Look here, go.

872
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,094
You've gotta go through here.

873
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,631
This way, this way!

874
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:50,659
Don't worry.

875
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:52,093
Okay. It's very simple.

876
01:23:58,136 --> 01:24:00,467
Chloe!

877
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:03,270
Go, Paul, go!

878
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:02,502
Hello, Corporal.

879
01:26:57,435 --> 01:26:59,502
I had so hoped

880
01:27:00,802 --> 01:27:02,469
to see you again,

881
01:27:03,734 --> 01:27:05,003
Corporal.

882
01:27:07,768 --> 01:27:09,800
I wanted to thank you...

883
01:27:12,202 --> 01:27:14,336
...for helping me

884
01:27:15,467 --> 01:27:17,968
become the man that I am.

885
01:27:23,135 --> 01:27:25,469
This one, Corporal,

886
01:27:26,269 --> 01:27:28,536
I'm going to win.

887
01:28:27,934 --> 01:28:29,069
Shit.

888
01:28:29,869 --> 01:28:31,070
Cover me!

889
01:28:37,202 --> 01:28:38,932
Get down!

890
01:28:38,934 --> 01:28:39,800
Stay down! Stay down!

891
01:28:39,802 --> 01:28:42,003
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

892
01:28:45,335 --> 01:28:47,666
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay, all right?

893
01:28:47,668 --> 01:28:50,003
What do you think you are,
Stan Musial or something?

894
01:28:52,634 --> 01:28:54,298
All right, look at me.

895
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,033
Hold onto me.

896
01:28:56,035 --> 01:28:57,569
Rosenfeld, go!

897
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:03,465
Shit.

898
01:29:03,467 --> 01:29:04,733
Rosenfeld!

899
01:29:04,735 --> 01:29:07,032
Somebody's got to put
a fucking leash on this...

900
01:29:12,168 --> 01:29:15,035
- Tibbet! Tibbet!
- Paul! Paul!

901
01:29:16,301 --> 01:29:17,502
Chloe!

902
01:29:19,235 --> 01:29:20,833
Come on, buddy.

903
01:29:20,835 --> 01:29:23,733
Is the kid okay?

904
01:29:23,735 --> 01:29:25,999
No more running around
for you, all right, kid?

905
01:29:26,001 --> 01:29:28,203
Chloe, you see Ed or Ford?

906
01:29:45,701 --> 01:29:48,768
I'm afraid I don't have
any of your rope.

907
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:52,568
But...

908
01:30:17,601 --> 01:30:19,669
Where were we?

909
01:30:20,268 --> 01:30:21,736
Oh, yes.

910
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:33,268
What's behind those walls?

911
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:37,432
Me.

912
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:39,003
Fuck you.

913
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:43,100
You know,

914
01:30:43,102 --> 01:30:44,569
Corporal,

915
01:30:45,301 --> 01:30:48,066
all that power in the tar...

916
01:30:49,635 --> 01:30:53,832
...running beneath
French feet for centuries,

917
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:57,102
it just needed to be refined
by their bodies.

918
01:30:58,034 --> 01:31:00,835
But they lacked
the vision to do it.

919
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,999
I am a god,

920
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:10,265
Corporal.

921
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,835
Germany will have
an invincible army.

922
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:31,800
This Reich, Hitler's
Thousand-Year Empire,

923
01:32:31,802 --> 01:32:34,202
is going to
take over the world.

924
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:59,168
You like her, sweet Chloe?

925
01:33:00,734 --> 01:33:02,968
I'll tell her goodbye for you.

926
01:33:47,435 --> 01:33:49,333
How does it feel,

927
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:52,936
the blood of eternity
flowing through your veins?

928
01:33:55,834 --> 01:33:58,900
Not so fucking great.

929
01:34:53,134 --> 01:34:54,135
Boyce.

930
01:35:20,067 --> 01:35:21,069
Ford.

931
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,202
Okay.

932
01:35:31,867 --> 01:35:34,132
Let's get you up. Come on.

933
01:35:34,134 --> 01:35:35,999
- We got to move.
- I'm good.

934
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:38,469
- You're good?
- I'm good, I'm good.

935
01:35:41,234 --> 01:35:43,765
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Ford!

936
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:44,832
No, Ford, open the gate!

937
01:35:44,834 --> 01:35:46,699
Listen to me.
Look at me. Ford. Hey.

938
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:47,831
Ford, look at me.

939
01:35:50,067 --> 01:35:51,134
Ford.

940
01:35:52,334 --> 01:35:53,566
Open the gate.

941
01:35:53,568 --> 01:35:54,998
Open the gate,
we can fix it.

942
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,533
I didn't get the timer set
at the tower.

943
01:35:59,535 --> 01:36:02,133
- You got to go take it down.
- I'll take it down, okay.

944
01:36:02,135 --> 01:36:03,865
You just need
to open the gate.

945
01:36:03,867 --> 01:36:05,965
Ford.

946
01:36:05,967 --> 01:36:08,102
Ford, look at me.
Please open the gate.

947
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:14,436
Open the gate!

948
01:36:17,968 --> 01:36:20,369
I was never getting back.

949
01:36:22,567 --> 01:36:24,366
And this shit,

950
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:26,902
our side shouldn't
have it either.

951
01:36:28,967 --> 01:36:32,834
It'll have to stay buried
down here with me.

952
01:36:33,968 --> 01:36:37,099
You got to finish
the job, Boyce,

953
01:36:37,101 --> 01:36:39,432
and blow this
whole fucking place up.

954
01:36:43,068 --> 01:36:44,333
Go!

955
01:36:44,335 --> 01:36:45,799
Ford, open the gate.

956
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:48,469
Ford, please!
There's still time! Ford!

957
01:36:52,468 --> 01:36:54,334
Open the gate!

958
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,401
Ford! Ford, come on!

959
01:36:58,801 --> 01:37:01,469
The tower, Private Boyce.

960
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:18,635
I think I'm done with this.

961
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:22,269
Thanks.

962

01:39:44,101 --> 01:39:46,199
<i>They unleashed the attack
side by side</i>

985
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:47,802
<i>with the British Tommies...</i>

986
01:39:58,135 --> 01:39:59,402
Ford?

987
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,465
You had plenty of explosive to
take the tower out above ground,

988
01:40:20,467 --> 01:40:22,731
but you went below
to set the charges.

989
01:40:22,733 --> 01:40:24,532
Yes, sir.

990
01:40:24,534 --> 01:40:27,266
Why would you do something
like that, Private?

991
01:40:27,268 --> 01:40:30,098
Corporal Ford thought
it was best.

992
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:33,631
The number of
enemy troops, he...

993
01:40:33,633 --> 01:40:37,302
He didn't feel we'd be able to hold
them off long enough outside, sir.

994
01:40:38,567 --> 01:40:41,764
Well, your corporal
made a hell of a good call.

995
01:40:41,766 --> 01:40:44,232
I just wish he were here
for me to tell him that.

996
01:40:44,234 --> 01:40:45,564
So do I, sir.

997
01:40:45,566 --> 01:40:46,532
Go catch a breath.

998
01:40:46,534 --> 01:40:48,269
We're gonna fold you
into Charlie Company.

999
01:40:49,268 --> 01:40:50,601
At ease, Private.

1000
01:40:53,968 --> 01:40:55,369
Oh, Private?

1001
01:41:00,368 --> 01:41:03,032
Did you see anything else
when you were down there?

1002
01:41:03,034 --> 01:41:06,634
There's talk about
some kind of Kraut lab.

1003
01:41:07,401 --> 01:41:08,698
So if there's anything
down there

1004
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,601
that's worth us digging
through all that rubble,

1005
01:41:12,667 --> 01:41:14,267
you'd let us know, right?

1006
01:41:17,334 --> 01:41:19,402
Just the tower control room.

1007
01:41:20,534 --> 01:41:22,802
But there's nothing
left of that, sir.

1008
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:27,066
That's what I figured.

1009
01:41:27,068 --> 01:41:29,266
Good job, soldier.
You and your squad.

1010
01:41:29,268 --> 01:41:30,735
Thank you, sir.

1011
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:34,298
No wilds.

1012
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,433
Matchsticks, five.
Buttons, ten.

1013
01:41:36,435 --> 01:41:39,665
Are you ready? Ante up.
Including you, kid.

1014
01:41:42,201 --> 01:41:45,133
He throws two,
and I calls me that...

1015
01:41:45,135 --> 01:41:46,598
Finally got yourself a friend.

1016
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,465
Hey!

1017
01:41:47,467 --> 01:41:49,302
Kid's bugging the hell
out of me.

1018
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:53,099
All right. Two to you.

1019
01:41:53,101 --> 01:41:54,632
- You look better.
- Thanks.

1020
01:41:54,634 --> 01:41:56,098
Now I just got to
convince somebody

1021
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,732
how I helped save the war.

1022
01:41:57,734 --> 01:42:00,699
Save the war?
All I saw was you missing

1023
01:42:00,701 --> 01:42:02,499
a bunch of Germans
with a machine gun.

1024
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:04,365
Are you kidding?
I saved your ass out there.

1025
01:42:04,367 --> 01:42:06,298
Is that what happened?
I don't remember that.

1026
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,734
Do you remember that?

1027
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,065
No? That's what I thought.

1028
01:42:10,067 --> 01:42:11,166
Did you get your orders?

1029
01:42:11,168 --> 01:42:12,499
Yeah, they're putting us
in C Company.

1030
01:42:12,501 --> 01:42:14,698
Jesus Christ,
after all that?

1031
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,701
I thought they would just
send us the fuck home.

1032
01:42:17,701 --> 01:42:18,699
Got a job to finish.

1033
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:20,968
We got to get
Tibbet to Hitler.

1034
01:42:22,567 --> 01:42:23,998
And then pop!

1035
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,467
We all go home.

1036
01:42:39,136 --> 01:42:44,136

<i>I have paper... a summons.</i>

3
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:07,583
<i>That way, sir.</i>

4
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,440
<i>Can you tell us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?</i>

5
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:34,028
Can you tell us your concrete
reasons for wanting a divorce?

6
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,655
<i>Concrete?</i>

7
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,492
<i>Yes, concrete.</i>

8
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,170
<i>Our marriage wasn't consummated.</i>

9
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:50,133
Our marriage wasn't consummated.

10
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,810
<i>Is your wife's testimony
faithful to the facts?</i>

11
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:08,031
<i>In a manner of speaking.</i>

12
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,838
<i>But when we met in Poland,</i>

13
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,135
<i>and even here, at the beginning,
I think I gave my wife pleasure.</i>

14
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:27,765
<i>It's only afterwards...</i>

15
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,617
<i>We haven't made love
since we're married.</i>

16
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:47,081
<i>We stopped... I stopped being
able to. It's just temporary.</i>

17
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:56,676
<i>Where's the equality?</i>

18
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:04,896
<i>Is my not speaking French
a reason for the court to refuse</i>

19
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,648
<i>to hear my case?</i>

20
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,566
<i>What is it</i>

21
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:08,859
<i>that you want?</i>

22
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,621
<i>I need time, Your Honor.</i>

23
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:25,923
<i>I want to save our marriage.</i>

24
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,635
<i>I don't believe
the love is gone.</i>

25
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:39,440
<i>One night, I was ready to...</i>

26
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:44,280
<i>Was the marriage consummated
that night?</i>

27
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:56,754
<i>No.</i>

28
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,696
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

29
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,574
<i>Do you love your husband?</i>

30
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,496
<i>I used to.</i>

31
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:27,752
<i>And now?</i>

32
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:35,096
<i>No.</i>

33
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,475
<i>I don't love him anymore.</i>

34
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,982
My God!

35
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,098
<i>That's all.</i>

36
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,574

<i>Yes. Your card cannot be used.</i>

<i>Police?</i>

48
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,310
<i>No, no...</i>

49
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,229
<i>Please.</i>

50
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:31,675
<i>Well?</i>

51
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:34,930
<i>Excuse me.</i>

52
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,560
<i>Come to Poland with me.</i>

53
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:41,980
<i>I'll never go with you.</i>

54
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,068
<i>I'll win...</i>

55
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,153
<i>every trial.</i>

56
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:50,282
<i>The divorce,
property settlement...</i>

57
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,748
<i>You never understood a thing.</i>

58
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,669
<i>I understand.</i>

59
00:13:59,169 --> 00:13:59,795
<i>No.</i>

60
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:06,428
<i>If I say I love you,
you don't understand.</i>

61
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,266
<i>And if I say I hate you,
you still don't understand.</i>

62
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,731
<i>You don't understand
that I want you,</i>

63
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,775
<i>that I need you.</i>

64
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:18,945
<i>Do you understand?</i>

65
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:22,658
<i>Do you understand?</i>

66
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:23,700
<i>No.</i>

67
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:28,290
<i>And now I scare you?</i>

68
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:31,293
<i>Do I scare you?</i>

69
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:32,546
<i>I don't know.</i>

70
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:36,884
<i>You don't know.</i>

71
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,599
<i>Watch this, now.</i>

72
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:44,811
<i>Take a good look.</i>

73
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,323
<i>You were out for revenge.</i>

74
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,452
<i>You set the place on fire.</i>

75
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:00,623
<i>That's what happened.</i>

76
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:08,091
<i>Soon every cop in Paris
will be after you.</i>

77
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:13,098
<i>The keys!</i>

78
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,904
Your fly is open.

79
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,036
I'm sorry.

80
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,249
How could you tell
I'm Polish?

81
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,169
I know that song.

82
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,088
What about this one?

83
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,096
I don't like it.

84
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,270
Do you live off that comb?

85
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,356
I try.
Times are tough.

86
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,109
What's that?

87
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:00,362
Diplomas.

88
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,540
Hairdresser?

89
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,294
Not a bad job.

90
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,840
I've won competitions.

91
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:19,803
Sofia, Budapest, Warsaw.

92
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,931
Here too.

93
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,269
Where do you sleep?

94
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,481
In your suitcase?

95
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,195
Excuse me.

96
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:35,991
Mikolaj.

97
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,662
Karol.

98
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,417
There's an alcove...

99
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:09,242
Can I sit with you
for a while?

100
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:33,231
You do card tricks?

101
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,193
Pick thirteen cards.

102
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,794
Spades: 3, 4, Queen, King.

103
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,716
Diamonds: 2, 5, Ace.

104
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,636
Clubs: 3, 5, King.

105
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,099
Hearts are weak: 2 and 4.

106
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,146
What counts in bridge
is memory.

107
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,400
And mine is excellent.

108
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,659
I've played bridge here
for a few years.

109
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:16,788
Now I'm going home.
What about you?

110
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:25,549
I want to get out of here.

111
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:31,473
I'll take you back.

112
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,644
Tomorrow morning.

113
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,651
I think I doubt it.

114
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,868
I lost my passport. I have
no money. The police are after me.

115
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:50,623
I'm down on my luck.

116
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:57,048
I'll make enough to buy a fake
passport near the Polish church.

117
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,883
They're rip-off artists.

118
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:00,177
Rip-off artists.

119
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,971
And not very serious.

120
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:06,811
I offered one of them a job.
He took the money and ran.

121
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:09,856
Maybe you'd like it.

122
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:10,982
A good job?

123
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:14,529
Very good, but unpleasant.

124
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,366
I'm a hairdresser.

125
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,578
You have to kill someone.

126
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,671
He won't do it himself.

127
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:30,842
He doesn't want to go on living.

128
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,096
A Pole.

129
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:39,018
He'll pay well.
Enough to live on for 6 months.

130
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:45,443
No, no... not that.

131
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,739
Why can't he do it himself?

132
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,034
He wants to, but he can't.

133
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:55,540
He has a wife and children
who love him.

134
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,295
Imagine how they would feel.

135
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:02,340
This way, someone kills him
and it's over.

136
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:06,137
He has a wife, children, money...
and wants to die?

137
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,476
What can I say?

138
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:15,149
My wife threw me out
with one suitcase.

139
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,734
And here I am.

140
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,906
I still love her.

141
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,827
Even more than before.

142
00:21:25,078 --> 00:21:27,457
After all she did,
I still love her.

143
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:29,500
Is she pretty?

144
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,299
Beautiful.

145
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:40,556
I first saw her
at the Budapest competition.

146
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:42,309
I won that one.

147
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,604
A friend was doing her hair.

148
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,983
She looked at me.

149
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,326
I'll show you.

150
00:21:56,494 --> 00:21:57,411
Where?

151
00:21:57,662 --> 00:21:59,206
Come on.

152
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:08,885
Brigitte Bardot?

153
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,178
Beautiful.

154
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:12,139
A bit over the hill, no?

155
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:13,390
There.

156
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:27,952
She's going to sleep.

157
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:37,963
You think so?

158
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,347
<i>It's me.</i>

159
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,227
<i>Perfect timing. Listen.</i>

160
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,625
<i>Dominique, I love you.</i>

161
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,018
<i>It stole two francs.</i>

162
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,064
<i>Your telephone stole two francs.</i>

163
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:29,316
<i>So what?</i>

164
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,320
<i>Give me back my stolen money.</i>

165
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:34,740
<i>Give it back!</i>

166
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,646
You're taking me to Poland.

167
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,316
I know how.

168
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:03,486
How?

169
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:05,613
Move your arm.

170
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:28,267
For air.

171
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,482
Can you last four hours?

172
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,318
I'll last.

173
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,780
I have one thing to do.

174
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:39,073
What?

175
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:41,660
Steal something.

176
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:47,614
Nothing else from Paris?

177
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:49,241
No, why?

178
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,790
Can I help you?

179
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,296
My suitcase is missing.

180
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:00,339
Ticket, please.

181
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:01,298
Excuse me?

182
00:28:01,423 --> 00:28:03,510
Your ticket, please.

183
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:09,768
The Paris flight?

184
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,730
What was in it?

185
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:14,440
Personal belongings.

186
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:16,235
Clothes, shirts...

187
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:18,612
165 pounds?

188
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,331
To tell the truth,
my friend was in it.

189
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:15,602
We'll divide it in 5 equal parts:
2 for me.

190
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:16,812
What?

191
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,940
Handling charges.

192
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,822
Fuck! It's alive!

193
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:26,157
What the fuck?

194
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:27,910
Get him out!

195
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:42,596
Made in Russia! Fuck!

196
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,975
Stop it!
He may have a wallet.

197
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:58,700
Two francs! Shit!

198
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,243
Give that back!

199
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,164
Careful! He has scissors!

200
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:19,894
The asshole's broke.

201
00:30:20,144 --> 00:30:21,396
Let's split!

202
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,037
Jesus...

203
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:09,041
home at last.

204
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:18,046
Jesus!

205
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:19,424
You're back.

206
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:21,884
What happened?

207
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,887
You bought a neon sign.

208
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:25,764
This is Europe now.

209
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,436
Too bad
you missed Christmas.

210
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:31,439
Too bad.

211
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:38,031
Just a minute, please.

212
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,126
Jurek...

213
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:48,753
I heard Karol's back.

214
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:49,921
Well...

215
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:51,840
he is.

216
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,986
So?

217
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,116
They're asking for you.

218
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,493
The ladies.

219
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,537
Give me a few days.

220
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,499
I brought you some broth.

221
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:27,511
Sleep.

222
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,976
Sleep, sleep...

223
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:08,475
Karol, remember you have
an appointment today.

224
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:10,227
Thank you.

225
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:15,985
What's up?

226
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:21,741
What is it?

227
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:23,661
It's payday.

228
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,915
You have clients waiting.

229
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,377
I can't today.
You do them.

230
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,921
They don't want me anymore.

231
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,192
The door!

232
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:51,822
Sorry.

233
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:52,991
What is it?

234
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:56,954
I have an appointment.
Jadwiga told me...

235
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,122
You do her hair?

236
00:35:58,748 --> 00:35:59,750
Yes.

237
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,126
Is that all?

238
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:06,175
Okay.

239
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,593
What do you want?

240
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:12,140
I'd like to get
into the money business.

241
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,186
In my line,
it takes years to get ahead.

242
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:16,355
I'll say!

243
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:20,651
I heard about
how you got out of Paris.

244
00:36:23,363 --> 00:36:25,240
You're inconspicuous.

245
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:30,081
That's good.
I need a guard.

246
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:34,002
Relax.
It just shoots tear-gas.

247
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:40,761
Go wander around outside.

248
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,782
<i>Present perfect.</i>

249
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:32,411
<i>I have eaten. You have eaten.
He has eaten.</i>

250
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:37,167
<i>We have eaten. You have eaten.
They have eaten.</i>

251
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:39,169
<i>Repeat:</i>

252
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,048
<i>Would that I had eaten!</i>

253
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,094
<i>Would that you had eaten...</i>

254
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,736
<i>The verb "to sleep".</i>

255
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,071
<i>Repeat:</i>

256
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:02,241
<i>Would that I had slept!</i>

257
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,661
<i>Would that you had slept...</i>

258
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:16,801
<i>The verb "to leave".</i>

259
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,137
<i>Repeat:</i>

260
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,723
<i>Would that I had left!</i>

261
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:22,684
<i>Would that you had left...</i>

262
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:35,242
<i>The verb "to please".
Repeat:</i>

263
00:38:35,492 --> 00:38:36,827
<i>Would that I had pleased!</i>

264
00:38:50,178 --> 00:38:52,264
How about a gas mask?

265
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:56,061
What?

266
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:58,522
- Someone's watching us.
- Let him.

267
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:01,108
A big guy. Just standing there.

268
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:05,948
Where?

269
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:17,922
Hide me.

270
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:18,673
What?

271
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,550
Hide me!

272
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:26,642
Are you happy here?

273
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:28,393
In the bathroom?

274
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,813
No, in general.

275
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:33,317
Yes. Why?

276
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:35,904
You can stay as long
as you like,

277
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:39,116
but we have to settle things first.

278
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:40,701
I can pay you.

279
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:41,953
No.

280
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,458
I'd like you
to do some hair.

281
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:47,710
Ten heads.

282
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:50,339
A week.

283
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:52,926
Five.

284
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:55,805
Okay. Seven.

285
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:00,477
Someone was looking for you.

286
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,855
Not too tall. Fortyish.

287
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,233
Sad looking.

288
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,151
Mikolaj?

289
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:12,033
He brought me back
from Paris.

290
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:15,121
He was glad to know
you're alive.

291
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,332
No phone number?

292
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,586
No, he just said to say hi.

293
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,380
Then he left.

294
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,261
Hi.

295
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:44,867
In Gdansk,
we exchange at 30.

296
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,038
In Torun, twice that.
Put it in a bank

297
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:49,248
and get a loan.

298
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:52,836
You have to turn here.

299
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:56,758
It's up the hill.

300
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,888
Only 7%.

301
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:04,101
But if we triple the investment...

302
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:06,270
That's pretty smart.

303
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,287
Is that clod sleeping?

304
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:31,178
It's here.

305
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:33,013
Hartwig and Ikea

306
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:35,475
want to build warehouses.

307
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:43,151
And these bumpkins

308
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,320
don't know.

309
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:46,447
No one does.

310
00:41:47,365 --> 00:41:48,742
I'm not breathing a word.

311
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,828
30% profit.

312
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,211
We'll see.

313
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,421
Okay.

314
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:07,934
Don't sleep!

315
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,477
You'll get robbed.

316
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:16,527
Can you exchange this?

317
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:18,530
For dollars?

318
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:21,076
That's some nest egg.

319
00:42:21,826 --> 00:42:22,911
I work.

320
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,721
A bottle of vodka.

321
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,809
The most expensive.

322
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:44,146
Wrap it up please.

323
00:43:08,554 --> 00:43:09,388
Hello.

324
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:14,269
I'm here on business.

325
00:43:16,814 --> 00:43:17,898
Official?

326
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:20,694
No, I wanted to talk business.

327
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,073
Can I come in?

328
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:56,115
It must be a good piece of land.

329
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:57,867
Move in with your son!

330
00:43:58,033 --> 00:43:58,784
I wanted to.

331
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,786
Then do it!

332
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:02,415
Buy a car, a TV.

333
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,168
What for? I never watch it.

334
00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:07,254
Always the same crap.

335
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:13,137
Or else...

336
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,347
I could bury the money...

337
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:17,601
put it in a little jar.

338
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:18,852
Sure!

339
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,856
That would be nice.

340
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,942
1000 dollars down.

341
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,157
4000 more
when we close the deal.

342
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,029
I have to go.

343
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,114
What?

344
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,783
It's the last train.

345
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,911
You're wandering around
at night?

346
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:07,082
You'll get mugged.
They'll steal your briefcase.

347
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,834
Sleep here.
There's a bed upstairs.

348
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:13,172
It's your bed now.

349
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:21,881
Hello.

350
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,175
Hello.

351
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:26,428
You're alive.

352
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:29,265
They stole me with the trunk.

353
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,684
Your brother told me.

354
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:33,228
I was looking for you.

355
00:47:33,771 --> 00:47:35,273
Me too.

356
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:39,528
Well...

357
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:42,324
What's up?

358
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:48,498
In the metro,
you mentioned a guy...

359
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,751
Remember?

360
00:47:52,754 --> 00:47:55,508
Can you get in touch with him?

361
00:47:56,091 --> 00:47:57,092
Yes, I can.

362
00:47:57,635 --> 00:48:01,765
When someone asks for help,
you have to help him. Right?

363
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:05,228
Except...

364
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,064
he's back in Warsaw.

365
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:11,236
He doesn't want to anymore?

366
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:16,493
He does.

367
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:19,079
More than ever.

368
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,196
So?

369
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:53,242
He changed his mind?

370
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,245
No.

371
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,705
It's me.

372
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:01,086
Does it make a difference?

373
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:04,591
No...

374
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,218
but it's you.

375
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:08,179
How?

376
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:20,068
These days

377
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,821
you can buy anything.

378
00:50:24,115 --> 00:50:26,243
The envelope is in my pocket.

379
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,042
Take it afterwards.

380
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:38,676
Go on.

381
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:46,603
Are you sure?

382
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,793
That was a blank.

383
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:42,509
The next one is real.

384
00:51:46,764 --> 00:51:47,682
Are you sure?

385
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:55,609
Are you sure?

386
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:04,954
Not any more.

387
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:25,982
Tell me why.

388
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,451
Mikolaj,

389
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,539
we all know pain.

390
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:41,668
Yes, but...

391
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,546
I wanted

392
00:52:43,754 --> 00:52:45,131
less of it.

393
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:54,393
The deal stands.

394
00:52:57,105 --> 00:52:57,647
Take it.

395
00:52:58,398 --> 00:53:00,109
You've earned it.

396
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,407
I did earn it.

397
00:53:07,368 --> 00:53:09,370
But consider it a loan.

398
00:53:10,664 --> 00:53:12,374
How about a drink?

399
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,335
I feel like a kid again!

400
00:53:48,797 --> 00:53:50,215
Me too.

401
00:53:54,471 --> 00:53:56,515
Everything is possible.

402
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,924
You beat us to it.

403
00:55:28,174 --> 00:55:29,594
You bought the land.

404
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,032
Strangle him.

405
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,419
You spied!

406
00:55:59,257 --> 00:56:00,842
I did.

407
00:56:01,676 --> 00:56:03,971
I have a will.

408
00:56:06,224 --> 00:56:09,187
And it's airtight.

409
00:56:10,688 --> 00:56:13,150
What do you mean "airtight"?

410
00:56:14,234 --> 00:56:16,780
If I die,
everything goes to the church.

411
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:20,117
Jesus!

412
00:56:20,951 --> 00:56:22,412
To the church.

413
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:27,126
We're screwed.
Let him go.

414
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,886
You're lucky
the stove's not lit.

415
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:47,611
Let's talk.

416
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,249
Are you selling?

417
00:57:00,294 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm selling.

418
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:04,341
He's selling.

419
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:06,427
How much?

420
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:09,723
Ten times what I paid.

421
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:11,975
50,000 dollars.

422
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:20,987
Excuse me while I change.

423
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:28,247
What a low-life.

424
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,857
What the hell is going on?

425
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,694
I'll be able to pay you back.

426
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:53,780
The stove?

427
00:57:58,494 --> 00:58:00,162
Should I light the stove?

428
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:01,665
Later.

429
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:05,336
This may interest you.

430
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:07,590
I have a plot here.

431
00:58:08,507 --> 00:58:10,134
Here... and here.

432
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,220
Right in the middle!

433
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:13,555
Exactly.

434
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:16,267
Here, I couldn't resist.
A beautiful spot.

435
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,186
With birch saplings.

436
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,397
Which means?

437
00:58:21,316 --> 00:58:23,526
Same thing:
10 times as much.

438
00:58:23,693 --> 00:58:26,238
I have everything:
bills, contracts...

439
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,949
That's the way it is.

440
00:58:30,201 --> 00:58:31,287
For the time being.

441
00:58:32,872 --> 00:58:33,956
It's a deal.

442
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,171
You're a son of a bitch.

443
00:58:38,296 --> 00:58:40,256
No, I just need the money.

444
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,260
Excuse me.
Should I light the stove?

445
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:45,513
Yeah, I'm cold.

446
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:49,560
Karol...

447
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:54,316
can you do Jadwiga's hair today?

448
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:55,902
Today?

449
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:58,947
Why not? I have some time.

450
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,363
Should I cut the engine, boss?

451
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:33,116
No, keep the car warm.

452
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:46,967
Hello.

453
00:59:48,678 --> 00:59:50,305
You bought the whole store!

454
00:59:50,555 --> 00:59:51,556
Presents.

455
00:59:52,225 --> 00:59:53,226
Come in.

456
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:55,019
I'll just be a second.

457
00:59:57,314 --> 00:59:58,691
I'm starting a company.

458
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:00,944
Big time.

459
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:05,492
30% of the capital
comes from the money you gave me.

460
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:09,956
Like it or not,
you're my partner.

461
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,707
I'd like you

462
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,418
to run it with me.

463
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,630
Serious?

464
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:18,049
Serious.

465
01:00:20,886 --> 01:00:22,137
Volvo?

466
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:24,766
Volvo.

467
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,602
Burgundy?

468
01:00:28,396 --> 01:00:30,774
Burgundy. Company car.

469
01:00:33,778 --> 01:00:35,697
Can I think it over?

470
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:40,662
Merry Christmas.

471
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,668
Ideal place for the secretary.

472
01:01:21,465 --> 01:01:23,301
Here is a second office.

473
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:24,927
Spacious, isn't it?

474
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:30,518
The view is rather attractive.

475
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:34,607
Computer and satellite hook-ups.

476
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,235
We need two faxes.

477
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,196
Where do we plug them in?

478
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,741
You have three telephone lines.

479
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,869
Oh, the telephone.

480
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:45,078
Yes.

481
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,956
Okay, I think...

482
01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:49,751
we'll take everything.

483
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:51,128
Wonderful.

484
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:53,172
Step into my office.

485
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:55,216
Just one minute.

486
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:02,726
Do you have a handkerchief?

487
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,049
Nice.

488
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:31,222
Warsaw at our feet.

489
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:32,765
What's that?

490
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:34,601
From the Complaint Department.

491
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,102
- Bananas?
- Yes.

492
01:02:36,394 --> 01:02:39,732
Cold storage!
Wait for the price to go up.

493
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:45,281
There's a fax coming in.

494
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:52,499
Electronic equipment.
Thailand to Russia.

495
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,750
Sell it here.

496
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:56,045
My experts say
it's good stuff.

497
01:02:57,672 --> 01:02:59,967
It looks like good work.

498
01:03:02,637 --> 01:03:04,347
How thick should that wall be?

499
01:03:04,598 --> 01:03:06,225
50 centimeters.

500
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:08,311
Measure it.

501
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,274
46.

502
01:03:12,483 --> 01:03:14,861
Have those 4 centimeters added.

503
01:03:15,153 --> 01:03:17,114
But we'd have to knock it down!

504
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:19,742
I guess so...
Goodbye.

505
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,977
Dominique!

506
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:17,817
<i>Hello?</i>

507
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:18,860
<i>Dominique?</i>

508
01:04:21,322 --> 01:04:24,034
<i>It's Karol.
I'm calling from Warsaw.</i>

509
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:26,495
<i>From Poland.</i>

510
01:04:32,795 --> 01:04:35,757
<i>I'm sorry.
I wanted to hear your voice.</i>

511
01:04:39,053 --> 01:04:40,764
<i>Say something.</i>

512
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,311
<i>Anything.</i>

513
01:05:22,817 --> 01:05:25,988
"I hereby annul
my previous will and testament.

514
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,659
"I resolve that... "

515
01:05:29,117 --> 01:05:32,038
That in the case of my death...

516
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,334
Death.

517
01:05:36,795 --> 01:05:39,339
...all my personal belongings

518
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:42,802
and property

519
01:05:45,222 --> 01:05:47,767
as well as any sums...

520
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:49,352
of money...

521
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,981
Of money in my bank accounts

522
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:58,322
will be left
to my ex-wife, Dominique.

523
01:06:03,662 --> 01:06:06,457
Dominique has a "q-u-e"
at the end.

524
01:06:06,874 --> 01:06:09,169
I know how to spell Dominique.

525
01:06:33,617 --> 01:06:35,453
What are we doing out here?

526
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:40,042
I'm afraid
the office may be bugged.

527
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:41,086
By whom?

528
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,133
Who knows?
I wanted to tell you something.

529
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:47,636
Go ahead.

530
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:54,645
Don't be surprised to see
my obituaries in the paper.

531
01:06:55,688 --> 01:06:57,481
One will be signed by you.

532
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:00,861
Okay.

533
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:07,161
My lawyer has my will.
You're the executor.

534
01:07:07,411 --> 01:07:09,247
Here are the names.

535
01:07:13,169 --> 01:07:15,297
You want me to drag her
from Paris?

536
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:17,591
Will she come?

537
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,594
She'll come.

538
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,889
It's a lot of money.

539
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:27,270
You don't want to know why?

540
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:28,439
No.

541
01:07:30,983 --> 01:07:33,236
You'll need a passport again.

542
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:04,526
Now you can have
the death certificate.

543
01:08:04,568 --> 01:08:06,613
My condolences.

544
01:08:20,172 --> 01:08:22,258
Here.
Everything is in order.

545
01:08:30,268 --> 01:08:30,727
You know

546
01:08:30,977 --> 01:08:32,062
what's next?

547
01:08:32,397 --> 01:08:32,897
What?

548
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:38,529
We need someone

549
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:39,864
to bury.

550
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,449
A corpse?

551
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,453
You don't plan on?

552
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:46,665
No.

553
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,503
We'll buy one.
These days...

554
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:52,505
you can buy anything.

555
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:53,549
You think so?

556
01:08:54,842 --> 01:08:58,513
Would you mind
a Russian import, boss?

557
01:09:17,246 --> 01:09:18,122
Thank you.

558
01:09:18,372 --> 01:09:19,623
<i>Thank you.</i>

559
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:21,668
<i>Let's go.</i>

560
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,398
It couldn't be better, boss.

561
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:41,694
He's impossible to identify.

562
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:43,739
What happened?

563
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:46,491
His head got crushed.

564
01:09:46,743 --> 01:09:47,910
He leaned too far

565
01:09:48,244 --> 01:09:49,412
out a train window.

566
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:53,000
Let's close it.

567
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,348
I'll manage.

568
01:10:05,224 --> 01:10:08,645
Okay. Goodnight, boss.

569
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,024
I'll close up.

570
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,782
You scared me.

571
01:10:50,074 --> 01:10:52,327
Why?
You knew I was coming.

572
01:10:52,452 --> 01:10:53,787
I don't know...

573
01:10:54,455 --> 01:10:56,582
Afraid of what will happen?

574
01:11:00,587 --> 01:11:02,215
Here's your passport.

575
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:05,177
Your ticket to Hong Kong.

576
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:08,181
Your address.
I rented you a nice house.

577
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:12,561
Are you sure?

578
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:20,613
Don't be late for the plane.

579
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:23,867
At 10 o'clock,
I'll call the police.

580
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:27,330
They'll be there
a half hour later.

581
01:11:27,872 --> 01:11:28,958
At 10:30,

582
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,709
you'll be in the air.

583
01:11:31,293 --> 01:11:32,879
Easy, isn't it?

584
01:11:33,129 --> 01:11:34,589
Easy.

585
01:11:39,388 --> 01:11:40,138
Mikolaj...

586
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,515
So long.

587
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:21,764
<i>I wanted you to come.</i>

588
01:14:23,934 --> 01:14:25,018
<i>I wanted to be sure.</i>

589
01:14:26,645 --> 01:14:29,399
<i>I didn’t want to have
to ask anymore.</i>

590
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:31,860
<i>Karol...</i>

591
01:14:35,782 --> 01:14:37,743
<i>You cried at my funeral.</i>

592
01:14:39,412 --> 01:14:40,663
<i>Why?</i>

593
01:14:42,457 --> 01:14:44,000
<i>Because you were dead.</i>

594
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,302
<i>Can I touch your hand?</i>

595
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,779
<i>Sit down.</i>

596
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:14,666
<i>Can I lay my head here?</i>

597
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:31,479
<i>I've wanted to lay my head here
for such a long time.</i>

598
01:16:58,132 --> 01:17:00,511
<i>You moaned louder
than on the phone.</i>

599
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:02,429
<i>Yes.</i>

600
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,856
<i>You won't look at me?</i>

601
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,077
<i>Karol?</i>

602
01:19:30,621 --> 01:19:31,873
<i>Mikolaj, please.
It's Dominique.</i>

603
01:19:36,253 --> 01:19:38,130
<i>It's Dominique.
Where's Karol?</i>

604
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:38,799
<i>He's dead.</i>

605
01:19:39,091 --> 01:19:40,175
<i>He is not. I saw him...</i>

606
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:42,470
<i>You were at his funeral.</i>

607
01:19:43,096 --> 01:19:46,100
<i>I was not at his funeral.
He's alive.</i>

608
01:19:46,391 --> 01:19:47,476
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

609
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:50,688
<i>You have to help me find him.</i>

610
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,441
<i>I love him.</i>

611
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:57,364
<i>Of course. It's row 23.
Tomb 10675.</i>

612
01:19:57,656 --> 01:20:00,868
<i>The name of the cemetery
is Powazkowski.</i>

613
01:20:02,496 --> 01:20:03,664
<i>He's back!</i>

614
01:20:03,956 --> 01:20:04,790
<i>I think I doubt that.</i>

615
01:20:05,165 --> 01:20:07,085
<i>I have to hang up.</i>

616
01:20:12,133 --> 01:20:13,051
<i>Dominique Vidal?</i>

617
01:20:13,343 --> 01:20:14,094
<i>Yes?</i>

618
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:15,930
Police.

619
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:18,767
<i>Passport, please.</i>

620
01:20:19,017 --> 01:20:20,686
<i>It's at the front desk.</i>

621
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:23,815
<i>Call downstairs.</i>

622
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,293
<i>We have a search warrant.</i>

623
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,837
<i>Can I get dressed?</i>

624
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:44,174
<i>I'm a French citizen.</i>

625
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:49,265
<i>Someone from the consulate
is coming.</i>

626
01:20:52,476 --> 01:20:54,271
<i>You have the right
to remain silent</i>

627
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:55,439
<i>until he comes.</i>

628
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:56,941
<i>I have nothing to hide.</i>

629
01:20:58,359 --> 01:20:59,820
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

630
01:21:05,577 --> 01:21:08,414
<i>Have you begun executing the will?</i>

631
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:09,749
<i>Yes. So?</i>

632
01:21:13,421 --> 01:21:15,631
<i>Your ex-husband was wealthy.</i>

633
01:21:15,923 --> 01:21:16,675
<i>Yes.</i>

634
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,807
That's all, thank you.

635
01:21:34,948 --> 01:21:38,494
<i>We don't believe your husband died
a natural death.</i>

636
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,205
<i>What?</i>

637
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,711
<i>He was helped.</i>

638
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:54,390
<i>We have proof you were here
"the day he died.</i>

639
01:21:57,353 --> 01:21:59,730
<i>The stamp is in your passport.</i>

640
01:22:00,231 --> 01:22:00,982
<i>How is that?</i>

641
01:22:01,232 --> 01:22:03,359
<i>He's not dead. He's alive.</i>

642
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:05,654
<i>Who?</i>

643
01:22:05,946 --> 01:22:07,032
<i>My husband.</i>

644
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:17,295
<i>Who was buried yesterday
at 11:30?</i>

645
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,131
<i>Him.</i>

646
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:24,346
<i>So who's alive?</i>

647
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:29,310
<i>No one.</i>

648
01:22:33,357 --> 01:22:36,778
<i>Hello. I'm Monsieur Le Gac
from the consulate.</i>

649
01:24:12,652 --> 01:24:14,529
What's new?

650
01:24:15,573 --> 01:24:18,034
Don't stand in the window.

651
01:24:18,284 --> 01:24:20,454
Someone will see you.

652
01:24:22,874 --> 01:24:24,125
It's ready.

653
01:24:34,346 --> 01:24:35,264
What?

654
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:41,481
I remember identifying you
after the exhumation.

655
01:24:41,773 --> 01:24:43,734
Boy, did we identify you!

656
01:24:44,109 --> 01:24:46,112
Mikolaj puked.

657
01:24:47,238 --> 01:24:50,743
Good thing you didn't
turn yourself in. We'd be in jail.

658
01:24:50,993 --> 01:24:55,290
You, me, Mikolaj, the driver
and some others.

659
01:24:59,045 --> 01:25:02,884
I made some cherry jam.
Do you want it?

660
01:25:05,386 --> 01:25:08,515
Someday I'll cook the snails
in the garden.

661
01:25:09,099 --> 01:25:10,352
I'll make a stew.

662
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:13,397
The lawyer?

663
01:25:14,106 --> 01:25:17,110
He came by. He's expensive.

664
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:18,779
He said...

665
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:24,912
What?

666
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:31,671
That he sees a little light
at the end of the tunnel.

667
01:25:32,305 --> 01:26:32,250

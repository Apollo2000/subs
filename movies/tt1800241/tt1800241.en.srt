No, you're not dressed like him.

No.

Hey, look,

59
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,599
I never laid a hand on her, all right?
Is that what this is about?

Well, technically, that's not true.

What'd I do?

63

Oh, yeah.

67

That bothers you?
Yes.

68

really wanted to fucking bother you,

70

this is what I'd do.

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,205
If I was trying to bother you,
that's what I would do.

72
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,290
You shouldn't
have done that.

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,203
How's that?
You bothered now?

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
All right,
don't make a thing of it.

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,359
You shouldn't touch him,
he doesn't like that.

Oh, my God, fix his hair.
No, you really shouldn't.

don't make a thing of it.

No, the...
It's for the mayor.

98

I didn't want to do
this in the first place.

Now, go get him so he takes

That's the whole plan, Irving.

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,999
You understand that he has...

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,759
<i>and I did some art
dealing on the side.</i>

152
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,839
<i>Stolen or forged art.</i>

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,159
Your host! Enjoy, enjoy.

154
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,600
Enjoy.
Come on.

155
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,239
So, one January,

156
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,966
<i>I go to my friend's
pool party in Long Island.</i>

157
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,999
Is that Duke Ellington
on your bracelet?

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,719
Yeah,
as a matter of fact, it is.

159
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,079
He died this year, you know?

160
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
I know.

161
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,479
I doubt anyone else here
knows or cares about it.

162
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,839
Well, I care about it.

163
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,168
He saved my life many times.

164
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,799
Mine, too.

165
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,445
Which one?

166
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,446
<i>Jeep's Blues.</i>

167
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,359
<i>Jeep's Blues.</i>

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,999
Mmm-hmm. <i>Jeep's Blues.</i>

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,119
Oh, yeah.

170
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,319
Yeah.

171
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,239
You...
You want to hear it?

172
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,319
Right now?

173
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,363
Yeah.
Sure.

174
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,520
Who starts a song like that?

175
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,205
It's magic.

176
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,723
It's magic.

177
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,079
<i>He wasn't necessarily
in good shape,</i>

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,365
<i>and he had this comb-over
that was rather elaborate.</i>

179
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,599
<i>He had this air about him,</i>

180
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,770
<i>and he had this confidence
that drew me to him.</i>

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,729
<i>He was who he was.</i>

182
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,090
<i>He didn't care.</i>

183
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,085
<i>I mean, she was a very
particular person.</i>

184
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,159
<i>Like me,
she had come from a place</i>

185
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,930
<i>where her options were limited.</i>

186
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,610
<i>It actually can feel
kind of sexy sometimes.</i>

187
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,204
<i>There's a boldness in it.</i>

188
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,606
<i>But where would
that boldness take me?</i>

189
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,485
<i>I didn't know.</i>

190
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,363
<i>But I was gonna find out.</i>

191
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,479
<i>Like me, she learned to
survive and reinvent herself.</i>

192
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,604
<i>She knew she had to reinvent
her life and her identity.</i>

193
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,883
<i>And like me, she envisioned a
better, elegant future for herself.</i>

194
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,724
<i>Like me, she knew
you had to have a vision.</i>

195
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,479
<i>She came to New York,
she envisioned it,</i>

196
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,599
<i>and just like that...</i>

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,439
<i>she applied for a job
at Cosmopolitan magazine.</i>

198
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,519
<i>Well, you're obviously
here for a reason, let's get to it.</i>

199
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,519
All right.
Our cover story
right now is on cunnilingus.

200
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,051
What do you think about that?

201
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,126
I like it.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,283
Do you have any clerical skills?
Can you type?

203
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,399
<i>She was unlike anybody I ever knew.</i>

204
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,599
<i>She was smart.</i>

205
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,119
<i>She saw through
people in situations,</i>

206
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,079
<i>and she knew how to live
with passion and style.</i>

207
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,567
<i>She understood Duke Ellington.</i>

208
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,487
<i>I was broke, fearless,
with nothing to lose,</i>

209
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,959
<i>and my dream,
more than anything,</i>

210
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,731
<i>was to become anyone else
other than who I was.</i>

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,808
<i>He had a chain
of dry cleaning stores.</i>

212
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,639
Enter. Yeah, I got
two in the Bronx,

213
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,719
and three in Manhattan.

214
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,319
Hey, Byron, how you doing?
This is Sydney.

215
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,439
Right here, come through here.
Hi.

216
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,759
<i>He asked me if I wanted to
come in and upgrade my wardrobe.</i>

217
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,759
<i>He said he had
a lot of nice things</i>

218
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,199
<i>that got left behind by people
and forgotten over the years.</i>

219
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,719
Man, you wouldn't believe the shit

220
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,839
that people leave behind here.
Unbelievable.

221
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,319
People leave stuff here?
Come back here.

222
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,999
Oh, yeah,
they go out for the night,

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,919
you know, they drink,

224
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,399
come here in the morning,

225
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,079
put their clothes in
and then they forget.

226
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,439
They got no idea
where they left it.

227
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,999
Look at that sequin thing.
It's beautiful.

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,359
I don't know, is that nice or not?

229
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,839
I mean, some of it... Some
of it's been here for years.

230
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,599
They're not picking it up.

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,199
No one's picking it up.
People just leave...

232
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,079
You like it?
I love it.

233
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,566
Sydney, it's yours.

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,123
You want it, it's yours.

235
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,406
Whoo!

236
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,199
I like it.

237
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,050
You look fantastic.

238
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,919
You're a knockout.

239
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,999
Oh, my God.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,359
I could only dream about...

241
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,403
These dresses are beautiful.
Oh!

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,719
This...
That's... I'm...

243
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,959
No, it's beautiful.
Put it on.

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,639
Come on.

245
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,879
Come on, look at that.
Please?

246
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,039
Perfect for you.

247
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,241
I don't feel...

248
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,879
Really?

249
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,161
Love it.

250
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,359
This is for you.

251
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,359
<i>I felt like we had a secret,
just the two of us,</i>

252
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,239
<i>you know, like that thing
when you just want to be</i>

253
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,719
<i>with the one person
the whole time and</i>

254
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,999
<i>you feel like the two of you
understand something</i>

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,929
<i>that nobody else gets.</i>

256
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,321
<i>I could just tell her
everything about myself.</i>

257
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,281
<i>And I'd never had anybody
like that in my life before,</i>

258
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,799
<i>and it felt like, finally,</i>

259
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,919
<i>I could truly be myself</i>

260
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,959
<i>without being ashamed,</i>

261
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,119
<i>without being embarrassed.</i>

262
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,479
What is this place?

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,159
Do you sell art here?

264
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,599
Yeah, sometimes.

265
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,399
It's my office.

266
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,079
Well, I know it's your office,

267
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,839
but you have all
these other places,

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,804
so what's this for?

269
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,769
Why'd you bring me here?

270
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,639
This is getting to be my...
My main business,

271
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,239
my growing business.

272
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,851
I, uh...

273
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,839
I help get loans for guys
who can't get loans.

274
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,279
You know, I'm their last resort.

275
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,766
You're their last resort?

276
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,679
'Cause interest rates are north
of 12% and heading to 18%.

277
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,559
That's right, smarty pants.

278
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
Fucking Jimmy Carter.
Fucking Jimmy Carter.

279
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,599
Well, fucking Nixon, really,

280
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,959
and the war and the deficit
and all of that shit, but...

281
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,889
I fucking love you,
you're so smart.

282
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,599
You are.

283
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,962
Thanks, kid, but how do you
get them the money?

284
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,839
Well...

285
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,690
You don't, do you?

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,125
You don't.

287
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,879
These guys are
lousy risks, you know?

288
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,319
I can't get them a loan,

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,522
but I get my fee, $5,000.

290
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,639
$5,000?

291
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,199
You take $5,000 and you
don't give them anything.

292
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,479
All right, these are
bad guys, you know?

293
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,159
They got bad divorces,
gambling habits,

294
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,362
embezzling, all that shit,
you know what I mean?

295
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,959
Everybody at the bottom
crosses paths eventually

296
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,883
in a pool of desperation
and you're waiting for them.

297
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,689
How about "we"?

298
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,285
"We"?
Mmm-hmm.

299
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,890
How about it?

300
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,599
Sydney, Sydney, I'm sorry.

301
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
That was too much, I went too far.

302
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,599
I didn't want to upset you.
Sydney, please, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,928
I know it ain't for everybody.

304
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,079
Oh, God!

305
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,044
I loved getting to know you!

306
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,199
All right.
Why did <i>I</i> tell the truth?

307
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,243
Why'd I tell her the truth?

308
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,759
What did I do that for?

309
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,531
What did I do that for?
I fucked it up.

310
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,799
I should never tell a woman the
truth, but she's so smart.

311
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,570
She's different.

312
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,559
She's different.

313
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,921
God.

314
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,279
You said it was nice knowing me.

315
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,847
You said it was nice to meet me.

316
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,321
Yeah.

317
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,048
Would you like to meet...

318
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,085
Lady Edith Greensly?

319
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,126
I have royal banking
connections in London.

320
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,439
I'd love to help
you with your loan,

321
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,239
but, of course,
I have to be very selective.

322
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,599
Yeah.

323
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,165
Yes.

324
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,448
That was fucking fantastic.

325
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,279
Thank you. Did you like it?

326
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,599
I liked it.

327
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,723
I didn't think you
were coming back.

328
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,319
Thank God you came back.

329
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,599
I wasn't going anywhere.

330
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,245
I fucking love you.

331
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,079
You have me.

332
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,559
<i>And so Irving and I began our
partnership in love and commerce.</i>

333
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,919
Rebecca, hold on.

334
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,079
<i>He told me to tell my friends I
had London banking connections.</i>

335
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,119
Listen, she told me you can
get me a line of credit.

336
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,839
I heard you have banking
connections in London, England.

337
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,479
<i>And after that, say "no" a lot
until the guy is hooked.</i>

338
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,159
Rebecca, get me that meeting, huh?
No!

339
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,279
Listen, tell her.
No.

340
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,164
I have never missed a check.
No.

341
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,079
<i>It was almost scary
how easy it could be</i>

342
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,248
<i>to take money from
desperate people.</i>

343
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,519
Lady Edith Greensly.
It's so good to see you again.

344
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,479
Lady... Your Ladyship.
Thank you. Again.

345
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,239
<i>These are the roles
that we were meant to play.</i>

346
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,639
We're very selective.

347
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,479
You got a strong application.
We'll talk about it.

348
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,839
I don't take a deal
that I can't close.

349
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,999
You're not being aggressive
enough in putting up your assets.

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,159
You ever been to Great Neck?

351
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,719
Everybody knows my dealerships.

352
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,719
5,000 gets me 50, right?

353
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,039
Five'll get me 35, is that right?

354
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,319
Five grand gets me 50?

355
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,959
5,000 gets me 50, right?

356
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,759
<i>I was doing so much
more business with her.</i>

357
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,399
<i>It doubled, then it tripled.</i>

358
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,399
<i>And I never met anyone,
man or woman, in business,</i>

359
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,919
<i>who was so careful and
precise about everything,</i>

360
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,679
<i>every stylistic detail.</i>

361
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,199
Congratulations.

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
<i>We kept selling art together, too.</i>

363
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,479
genre painting, which is
really rare for the time.

364
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,639
It's a boy and his dog.

365
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,919
It's a non-religious painting...

366
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,719
16...
...55.

367
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,839
Golden Age Dutch painting.

368
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,519
Paul Klee. Expressionism.
Bauhaus Movement.

369
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,439
Before we go any further,
is this legit?

370
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,079
Let's just say, you know, it's missing
from Spain, leave it at that.

371
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,089
Don't show any Spanish friends.

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,359
<i>I mean, it just took off.
We got a better office,</i>

373
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,803
<i>we called it "London
Associates," for her accent.</i>

374
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,399
<i>When I was around her,
I felt joy,</i>

375
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,931
<i>fucking joy!</i>

376
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,442
<i>And love, that's what I felt.</i>

377

<i>As far as I could see,</i>

387
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,479
<i>people were always conning each
other to get what they wanted.</i>

388
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,205
<i>We even con ourselves.</i>

389
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,119
<i>We talk ourselves
into things, you know.</i>

390
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,719
<i>We sell ourselves things we
maybe don't even need or want,</i>

391
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,999
<i>you know, by dressing them up.</i>

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,329
<i>We leave out the risk,
we leave out the ugly truth.</i>

<i>Pay attention to that</i>

394
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,399
<i>'cause we're all conning
ourselves in one way or another,</i>

395
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,807
<i>just to get through life.</i>

396
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,291
<i>He was married and he had a son.</i>

397
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,610
Daddy!

398
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,759
<i>He had adopted her son.</i>

399
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,519
You're just such an artist!
Look at that!

400
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,559
<i>He was a really good dad.</i>

401
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,999
<i>I respected him for that.</i>

402
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,359
Proud! You should be so proud!

403
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,961
<i>It was a tough
situation for everyone.</i>

404
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,639
What'd you do today?

405
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,399
That kid Donovan
is being mean to me.

406
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,759
That big kid?

407
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,519
I thought Mommy was picking you up,

408
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,239
so he couldn't bother you.

409
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,599
She was late.

410
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,199
And then after we put out the fire,

411
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,319
Mommy said stay in my room
with my baseball cards.

412
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
What fire?

413
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,841
Did you know they made a lamp
that has the sun in it?

414
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,879
Mommy got the lamp,
she made her special drink,

415
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,082
and the lamp made a fire.

416
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,289
I put out the fire.

417
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,970
The fire is out.

418
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,719
First time in my life,
I do the right thing.

419
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,679
Oh, shut up. Shut up.
No, no, no...

420
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,168
I save a young
single mother and a kid.

421
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,199
I marry her, I adopt him...

422
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,399
You fell in love! Don't you
dare forget that part!

423
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,799
We fell madly in love.

424
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,999
Yes, I fell in love.

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,479
My God, I fell in love.
But you know what?

426
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,999
I thought you were
mysterious, like my mother,

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,399
until it turned
out that "mysterious"

428
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,599
just meant "depressed," all right?
"Hard to reach."

429
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,199
I mean, I'm dying here.

430
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,919
And you need somebody
who's gonna be quiet,

431
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,159
who's gonna be shy,

432
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,079
you're young, you're beautiful,
you gotta find somebody else.

433
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,759
You gotta go out and get
some friends, all right?

434
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,359
I don't like going out.
You know that

435
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,519
I get anxiety when I
have to meet people.

436
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,599
You know how hard that is.

437
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,719
You cannot just stay in the
house with a fucking sun lamp.

438
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,879
All right?

439
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,199
And I can't... I mean, look, I can't
trust you with Danny when you...

440
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,399
That fire and everything...

441
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,559
I can't trust to leave you alone.

442
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,599
I put the fire out, Irving.

443
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,599
There is no fire.
Maybe if you were here more,

444
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,439
then there wouldn't have been
a fire in the first place.

445
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,319
Oh, what, there wouldn't have
been a fire if I was here?

446
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,119
Just stop with the whole fire thing!
God! It was a mistake!

447
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,839
I'm sure a million people
do that, all the time.

448
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,479
Those sun lamps are dangerous.

449
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,001
Shouldn't even have them
in the house, really.

450
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,569
I bet that happens all the time.

451
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,683
This was nothing.

452
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,968
We're not happy, all right?

453
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,359
You know that I could take Danny,

454
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,079
you know that most of
your work is illegal,

455
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,959
and you know that if you tried
to divorce me, you know that...

456
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,999
I'm not saying that I would,
but I'm saying that I could,

457
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,119
and I'm saying that that is why
I don't like divorce, Irving.

458
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,559
Women do that in divorces.

459
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,650
Women get the children and then
the fathers never see them.

460
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,399
My mother never got divorced.

461
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,879
My grandmother never got divorced.

462
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,479
There are no divorces in my family.

463
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,279
I am not getting a divorce.

464
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,479
Come on, what are we doing here?

465
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,599
We fight and we fuck and that's what we do.
That's our thing.

466
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
<i>She was the Picasso
of passive-aggressive karate.</i>

467
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,199
Come here. Come here.

468
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,199
<i>She was better than any con
artist I ever met, including myself,</i>

469
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,721
<i>and she had me
like nobody had me.</i>

470
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,079
Irving, come to mama, come on.

471
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,999
<i>You might say she was my karma</i>

472
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,679
<i>for how I took
advantage of people.</i>

473
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,881
Irving...

474
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,879
Oh, my God.

475
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
Come here. Come on.

476
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,679
Get into bed.

477
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,759
All right.

478
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,679
Baby, there's such good stuff here.

479
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,199
<i>I did not want to
leave the kid behind.</i>

480
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,925
<i>He was my son!</i>

481
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,490
<i>She had me. I was her mark.</i>

482
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,239
Now, I can't assure you that
your loan will be approved,

483
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,559
but I can tell you that
any deal I take, I close.

484
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,039
However, my fee is nonrefundable,

485
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,765
just like my time.

486
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,039
I want to thank you very
much, Irving, for seeing me.

487
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,844
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

488
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,090
Is that...
Am I not buttoned?

489
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,569
I just got to say, Mr. Rosenfeld,
that Lady Edith was

490
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,079
very adamant that
you were top-notch.

491
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,359
That's correct.

492
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,925
I really need your help,
I'm desperate.

493
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,039
I mean, I got the Audis

494
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,159
and two boats,
and I forgot to mention

495
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,319
that I have a little piece
of real estate in Long Island.

496
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,479
No, you didn't mention that.

497
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,808
Two lunches and you
never mentioned that.

498
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,919
I was gonna mention it, then the
guy with the hat walked in.

499
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,199
The hat?
You remember that?

500
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,880
I forgot, I totally...
I do remember.

501
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,799
It was the second
time we had lunch.

502
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,119
Yes.

503
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,799
I thought he was...
You couldn't see his eyes.

504
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,359
It was like he had no eyes.

505
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,999
Do they sell hats like that?
I don't know.

506
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,559
It's like he made it.
Where do they come from?

507
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,599
He's a great milliner.
Actually, I went to the store.

508
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,919
I saw a hat store down the street.

509
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,079
I thought maybe he bought it there,

510
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,119
and I was gonna get you one,
as, like, a memento.

511
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,079
- Two lunches?
- Yes.

512
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,519
Really?
It's two lunches.

513
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,399
What's the big deal?
That's unusual.

514
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,439
I was trying to get him
to be more aggressive.

515
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,599
On his loan, that is.

516
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,199
You showed me a whole new side of
the city I'd never seen before.

517
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,319
Yeah, it's...

518
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,599
You're welcome.

519
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,768
No. Thank you.

520
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,999
Yeah, right.
Should I take you there?

521
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,559
Yeah, it's nice.
You liked it?

522
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,239
All right, should I
take you there twice?

523
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,805
Stop.

524
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,439
What are you doing?
What?

525
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,439
You like this guy?
Yes, I like this guy.

526
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,799
Is this messing with your judgment?

527
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,079
No, it's not
messing with my judgment.

528
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,879
Don't be stupid.
Hey, hey, hey.

529
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,999
Look at me.

530
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,645
Play your part.

531
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,319
Fine, you play your part.

532
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,959
Well, take it to
your people in London.

533
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,162
Please, take it to them.

534
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,288
I got the cashier's
check right here.

535
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,359
I give you five, and you
give me 50 back, right?

536
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,800
Please.

537
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,766
Please don't reject me.

538
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,330
Give a guy a chance.

539
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,722
Zurich?
You got an office in Zurich?

540
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,959
Paris? I can call Paris.

541
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,999
Excuse me for a second.

542
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,079
Yeah, take your time.
Excuse me.

543
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,359
Yeah. It's...
Just be one moment.

544
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,050
Do whatever you need to do.

545
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,080
Go ahead, take your time.

546
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,161
Stick around for a little bit.

547
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,319
See my friend over here?

548
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,559
I'm not moving anywhere, all right?

549
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,399
You got the wrong office,
you're gonna be embarrassed.

550
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,599
I don't think so.

551
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,119
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
go easy on her.

552
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,279
I may not have you, Irving,
but I have her on fraud.

553
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,959
Impersonating another individual.
On fraud?

554
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,599
On fraud? What is that?
Yeah, she may not be...

555
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,679
Identity fraud?

556
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,039
You may be from England,
but you're not royal,

557
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,359
and you have no
banking connections,

558
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,039
and that's a felony.
You don't have to cuff me up.

559
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,279
How long is that?
That's three to five years.

560
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,999
Hey, not so...
Oh, really?

561
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,519
That's interesting.
I don't even know your name.

562
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,802
Richie DiMaso, FBI.
Nice to meet you.

563
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,089
You got to get away from this guy.

564
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,079
<i>He wouldn't let me
see her for three days.</i>

565
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,282
<i>Even managed to
delay her lawyer.</i>

566
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,764
<i>She couldn't handle it.</i>

567
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,479
How come the fluorescents are on?
Can we kill that, please?

568
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,399
Jesus Christ,
I put this lamp here for you

569
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,759
'cause I thought it
would be better for you.

570
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,079
There's a wire here, they're scared

571
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,399
because people hang themselves,

572
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,399
but I know you're
too smart for that.

573
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,959
Where's the table and chair?
There's no bed here?

574
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,439
It's like a fucking asylum.
Joe, is everybody off today?

575
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,999
Jesus Christ, it's scary.

576
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,519
Maybe I wanted to scare
you, I don't know.

577
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,759
Maybe it was my idea.

578
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,759
Maybe I'm a little
off the beaten path.

579
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,119
You know, I don't know, maybe.

580
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,359
Hey, you look dehydrated.

581
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,599
Here,
you want to have some tea?

582
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,529
Yeah, your lips are all chapped.

583
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,570
It's herbal.

584
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,611
It's my favorite.

585
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,479
I know you think... Look at me.

586
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,650
Hey, Edith, I know
you think Irv loves you.

587
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,529
I know you think you know him.

588
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,399
You think that he sees the world
as this cold, dark place,

589
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,479
and he cares about nobody but a
very few people on a short list.

590
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
His son,
his father, Rosalyn and you.

591
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,010
And you think you're
on the top of that list.

592
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,639
What if you're not? What if
you're not on that list?

593
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,161
What if you're not
even on that list at all?

594
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,319
He'd be in here right now
if he took the check,

595
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,170
but no, you did.

596
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,839
God, it's so clear to me.

597
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,639
It's so... It's clear to me,
but it's not clear to you.

598
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,039
He uses you,
Edith, to protect himself,

599
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,971
to protect his son
and his wife in Long Island.

600
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,639
No? Yes,
he put a ring on her finger.

601
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
He adopted her son.

602
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,919
They have a huge house,
they have two cars.

603
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,839
What does she do all day?
I'll tell you what she does.

604
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,479
She plays with her nails,
she watches TV,

605
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,569
and she spends your money,
the money that you make.

606
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,599
I don't like that you're in
jail while he's going free.

607
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,360
I don't like any of that.
I want to help you.

608
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,319
All the razzle-dazzle that he does,

609
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,359
it's not good, it's not real,
it's fake, it's not real.

610
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,159
Who you are is who you are,
between you and God,

611
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,479
you and your soul.
That's what matters.

612
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,479
That's what counts,
that's what I'm about,

613
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,719
and that's what I see in you.

614
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,759
Tell me you didn't feel it the
first time we saw each other.

615
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,849
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

616
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,279
I'm not supposed
to be talking like this,

617
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,528
but I don't care,
I'll break the rules.

618
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,959
Okay, Edith, Edith,
I want to help you.

619
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,400
I like you.

620
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,130
I like you.

621
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,685
I like you.

622
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,083
Been in there three days.

623
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,799
Hasn't been so good for her.

624
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,601
How's that make you feel,
her in there?

625
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,719
That check was for you, right?

626
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,729
But you knew something was off.

627
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,399
It's 'cause you're good. You're,
like, the best at what you do

628
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,329
in the whole country, aren't you?

629
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,919
But you know what,
if the country were run

630
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,279
by people like you,
Irving Rosenfeld,

631
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,999
we'd be living in Eastern
Europe or Guatemala.

632
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,399
You ever been to Guatemala? You
ever been in jail in Guatemala?

633
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,599
You ever try to get a telephone or
a permit or anything in Guatemala?

634
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,759
That's what this
country would be like

635
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,167
if we let people that are liars
like you run this country.

636
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,679
Who made you God and judge, huh?

637
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,479
My grandmother lived to be 93 years
old, never lied in her life.

638
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,719
Congratulations.

639
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,839
Thank you.

640
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,759
I'm proud of that, too.

641
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,839
Does that make her
not a good person?

642
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,239
Is that not
something to strive for?

643
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,399
Why you breaking my balls, huh?

644
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,647
Get to the point.

645
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,079
I see something in you, Irving.
I get very excited.

646
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,439
I think that we have
a lot of potential here.

647
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,519
Now, look, I came up with the idea.

648
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,519
It's all from me,
I want to change things.

649
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,119
I want to go after
white-collar crime.

650
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,079
Irving, you're very skilled,

651
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
and I want you to teach me,
and we can do this.

652
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,559
I want four people
that do what you do.

653
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,119
Fraudulent investments,
fake certificates of deposit,

654
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,279
stolen art, fake art.

655
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,439
You get me four people,
and you're off the hook.

656
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,005
Four busts,

657
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,959
and you leave us alone?

658
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,879
We don't have to testify?

659
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,321
You're good, you're done.
Anything you want.

660
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,799
But if you run,
then your life's over.

661
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,479
You're gonna be hunted, and
it's gonna be very difficult

662
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,400
for Rosalyn and your kid
to live in this country.

663
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,039
We need to leave. We need
to run, and we need to do it now.

664
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,319
Right, we'll go to Estonia
or Romania, I don't care,

665
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,559
but we'll take
the cash from the bed,

666
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,839
and get out of here, all right?

667
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,119
We've talked about it 100 times.

668
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,679
What about Danny?

669
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,359
I adopted him, I gave him my name.

670
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,839
I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn.

671
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,559
She's unstable.
That is a manipulation.

672
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,079
Rosalyn will never let you go.

673
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,439
She'll use Danny
against you because

674
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,120
she's too messed
up to let you leave.

675
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,527
I can't leave him.
I love him, all right?

676
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,686
He's my son.

677
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,159
Richie said you would say that.

678
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,519
Richie?
Yeah.

679
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,719
What, the cop? You're on a
first-name basis with him?

680
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,039
Yes, I am. I'm not
even on your list, am I?

681
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,359
What list?

682
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,599
Your list, your short list, your long list.
I'm not even on any one

683
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,679
of your fucking lists.
I don't know what you're talking about.

684
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,719
I thought you loved me.
I love you.

685
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,919
I thought that we had something.

686
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,119
We do have something, it's perfect.

687
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,199
What are you saying?

688
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,599
We're gonna go to Romania,
we're gonna take Danny.

689
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,679
Yes.
Is that what you're saying?

690
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,039
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

691
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,969
You, me, Danny, yes.
Really?

692
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,999
Well, you never said that before.
Well, I'm saying it now.

693
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,559
We're us, we can make it
an adventure like we did.

694
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,359
We can make it an adventure like
we make everything, all right?

695
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,959
All right.
Okay?

696
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,279
We have to go now, all right?

697
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,209
Trust me,
we have to leave right now.

698
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,159
I can't leave Danny,
I'll lose custody.

699
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,399
No, you have to take me away.

700
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,719
I can't.
We have to leave.

701
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,999
No, what are you saying?
What are you doing?

702
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,043
What are you saying?
Please!

703
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,159
Oh, my God.
Will you pull it together?

704
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,119
I can't believe this is happening.

705
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,923
Don't say I don't love you.
That's bullshit.

706
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,559
This is bullshit.

707
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,762
We are bullshit.

708
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,605
You are bullshit.

709
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,759
You are bullshit.

710
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,450
Please don't do this.

711
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,369
I just never thought
that you were conning me.

712
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,079
I could never con you.

713
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,611
I love you.

714
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,764
Please don't say this.

715
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,965
Babe.

716
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,131
No, I'm done.

717
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,885
Don't say that.

718
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,079
I'm gonna do these four busts,
these four cons,

719
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,284
to get us out of this,
not just me, but us.

720
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,960
And I'm gonna get really close
with Richie the cop

721
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,689
in case we need to use him,
if we need another move.

722
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,559
We don't need another move.

723
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,759
We need four busts,

724
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,119
then we're done.

725
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,599
We are gonna need another move.

726
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,928
Trust me, and you're
gonna be thanking me.

727
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,279
The key
to people is what they believe

728
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,159
and what they want to believe.

729
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,679
So I want to believe that we were real.
We are real.

730
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,559
And I want to believe
that a man could want me,

731
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,519
and I'm gonna take
all of that heartbreak

732
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,639
and all of that sorrow,
and I am going to use it,

733
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,039
and I am going to make Richie think

734
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,799
that I want him

735
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,809
and that I like him.

736
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,005
And I'm gonna be very,
very convincing.

737
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,879
And I'm pissed at you.

738
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,684
'Cause I am pissed at you.

739
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,449
Maybe I do like him.

740
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,043
Maybe I like him a lot.

741
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,204
From the feet up, right?

742
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,526
Baby.

743
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,879
Quit your bellyaching and
come up with something

744
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,559
to get us out of this.

745
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,599
And you're right, I'm in no
state to deal with this.

746
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,246
So what's it gonna be,
Mr. Mastermind?

747
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,087
<i>An Arab sheik?</i>

748
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,645
<i>What do we want
an Arab sheik for?</i>

749
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,839
Well, how do you
think this works, stupid?

750
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,439
If you could not call him
stupid, which he isn't.

751
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,879
He's smarter than you.

752
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,519
Last time I checked, he's in
control and we work for him now,

753
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,404
so be nice, okay?

754
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,045
Okay.

755
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,804
To set this up,
to bust the con artist,

756
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,050
we need to make the honeypot
to attract the bees.

757
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,481
To attract the bees,
we need to offer them

758
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,399
a wealthy individual who
they can take advantage of.

759
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,080
Someone special, someone
new, someone amazing.

760
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,879
And those guys
are going to want to sell

761
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,399
fake bank CDs to that guy.

762
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,399
Take the sheik's money, you see?

763
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,119
Only they can't get into his
money unless they know someone,

764
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,719
and that someone is us.
Oh, that's good.

765
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,159
So, if you want
to get somebody like

766
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,359
your con artist friend, Carl Elway,

767
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,639
you get him to
want to buy or sell...

768
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,919
Keep your voice down.

769
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,439
Sell fake art or stolen art
or fake certificates of deposit,

770
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,399
he needs, who does he need?
He needs a rich sheik-guy,

771
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,679
and there you go, we can pinch him.

772
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,759
That's right, that's right,
but I don't tell Elway shit.

773
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,919
I wait for him to call me.

774
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,519
The art world is a small world,

775
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,406
and one of Elway's acquaintances
is clocking us right now.

776
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,688
Where?
Don't look. Don't look.

777
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,210
You have a good look?

778
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,325
How do you know the sheik?

779
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,648
This is my friend Al, from Queens.

780
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,650
I do aluminum siding and roofing.

781
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,891
I want to show
you something.

782
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,164
This Rembrandt here,

783
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,649
people come from all over
the world to see this.

784
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,125
Yeah, he's good. Yeah.

785
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,999
It's a fake.

786
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,884
What? What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

787
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,319
People believe what
they want to believe.

788
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,879
'Cause the guy who
made this was so good

789
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,686
that it's real to everybody.

790
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,764
Now, who's the master?

791
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,407
The painter or the forger?

792
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,206
That's a fake?

793
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,529
That's the way the world works.

794
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,962
Not black-and-white, like you say.

795
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,204
Extremely gray.

796
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,839
Irving, could I...

797
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,319
Arthur, how many
times I got to tell you?

798
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,559
You can't meet the sheik,
all right?

799
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,639
Could I please meet him sometime?
Carl can't meet him.

800
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,959
Not yet. Another time.

801
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,999
Arthur. Hi.
Come on.

802
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,319
Edith.
Edith, hi.

803
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,439
Yes, I wanted to introduce
you to Robert Spencer.

804
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,529
We're advising the sheik together.

805
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,319
Thank you.
Robert Spencer.

806
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,124
Advisor to the sheik.
Yeah.

807
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,479
What's this about a goddamn sheik?

808
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,759
Why are you leaving
me out of this? Huh?

809
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,559
I got to hear it from my friends?

810
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,399
It ain't for you, Carl.
What do you mean, it ain't for me?

811
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,799
Nah, it ain't for you.
What are you talking about?

812
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,519
We got to do
certificates of deposit.

813
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,679
I can print as many as you need.

814
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,079
I got my associates here.
What do you mean, guys?

815
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,839
Come on. This is not
a one-man operation.

816
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,839
Look, I can get other guys. What
are you talking about, Irving?

817
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,399
I can get other guys. You're
telling me that you can

818
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,359
get four guys to sell
fake certificates of deposit

819
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,879
to my investor
within a week?

820
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,519
Yes, I can make that happen.

821
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,959
Carl Elway can do
what he says he's going to do.

822
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,359
That's interesting, but, you know,

823
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,847
I got other guys lined up.
I got a meeting.

824
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,999
Here, look, these are my associates.
I got to run.

825
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,319
- Carl, his associates are here.
- Don't go.

826
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,119
He's got a meeting he's got to go to.
Listen, don't go...

827
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,719
I got to run. No, don't go...
No, don't go.

828
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,919
<i>Crazy thing about people,</i>

829
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,599
<i>the more you say no, the more
they want in on something.</i>

830
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,719
<i>Yeah, they're so stupid.</i>

831
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,879
I got to run. Come on.

832
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,799
I'll tell them. Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll tell...

833
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,559
Hey, you know what
Carl just told me?

834
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,559
He said he could do this whole thing
with four guys within a week.

835
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,079
Or we could do something much bigger.
All right.

836
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,559
Something bigger?
Yeah, my guy deals

837
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,799
with hundreds of
millions of dollars.

838
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,199
How much bigger?
Hundreds of...

839
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,079
I knew you were
holding out on me, Irving!

840
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,479
Hundreds of millions of dollars?
Like, much bigger.

841
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,399
Like, I'm talking about, we could
say never the fuck mind the CDs,

842
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,519
and we could have some complete
access to something huge.

843
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,839
Huge? Like what?

844
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,559
Robert Spencer.
I'm advisor to the sheik.

845
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,079
Carl Elway.

846
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,919
I want you to think of
the most undervalued asset

847
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,043
in the state of New Jersey today.

848
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,006
The rebuilding of Atlantic City.

849
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,519
Look, maybe they... Maybe
they legalized gambling

850
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,679
a year ago...
Wow.

851
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,079
and nothing's happening.

852
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,759
Hey.
No licenses, no permits.

853
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,279
Quit while you're ahead, Carl.

854
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,919
I know the guy...
I know the right people

855
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,439
who are going to help you out.
Who's the guy?

856
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
The guy is Carmine Polito.

857
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,959
Who's Carmine Polito?

858
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,286
<i>Carmine Polito?</i>

859
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,119
Carmine Polito, no.

860
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,599
<i>My boss, Stoddard,
proceeded to tell me</i>

861
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,599
<i>that Carmine Polito was the
most quietly powerful person</i>

862
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,079
<i>in the state of New Jersey.</i>

863
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,119
<i>A lifetime native of the
very racially mixed Camden,</i>

864
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,799
<i>which had become a ghetto.</i>

865
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,039
<i>And where he had been
mayor for ten years.</i>

866
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,879
<i>A very beloved guy.</i>

867
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,889
<i>A guy who never
gave up on his people.</i>

868
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,086
<i>His father had emigrated from
Italy and had stoked coal.</i>

869
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,399
<i>A big family guy
with five kids.</i>

870
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,399
<i>They even adopted some
other kid, a black kid</i>

871
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,479
<i>from the Boys and Girls Club
who'd lost his family.</i>

872
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,399
<i>I mean, his household
was a joyous place.</i>

873
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,649
<i>And his wife, Dolly, well,
she was the apple of his eye.</i>

874
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
<i>And the center
of the household.</i>

875
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,800
<i>I mean,
everyone loved this guy.</i>

876
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,203
<i>And he had a huge heart.</i>

877
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,959
The WPA employed craftsmen
to paint this during the Depression.

878
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,599
Why can't we employ people today

879
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,479
to do work like this
in rebuilding Atlantic City?

880
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,159
<i>He worked with all the unions,</i>

881
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,959
<i>he was the leader of
the State Assembly,</i>

882
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,599
<i>and he had just
gotten gambling legalized</i>

883
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,679
<i>in New Jersey to create jobs.</i>

884
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,724
<i>But he couldn't get the funds
to rebuild Atlantic City.</i>

885
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,079
<i>And that was his problem.</i>

886
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,599
<i>So, with our help,
he was about to have his hand</i>

887
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,599
<i>in the wrong pocket
at the wrong time.</i>

888
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,962
<i>And to me, that meant corrupt.</i>

889
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,399
You said grifters, con artists.

890
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
We're not going
after some politician.

891
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,239
This is a bad idea, Richard.

892
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,959
Look, it's really simple.

893
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,639
All you need is to put two
million in a Chase account...

894
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,439
What?
...under the sheik's name.

895
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,879
Whose $2 million?

896
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,839
Just listen.

897
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,439
$2 million under the sheik's name

898
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,759
in a Chase account that we control.

899
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,239
Carmine calls up on the telephone,

900
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,199
calls the bank and he sees
that the sheik is real

901
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,759
and he has a real account.

902
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,559
Five days.

903
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,599
I'm not taking $2 million
of the taxpayers' money,

904
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,679
putting it anywhere for five days.

905
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,239
I don't care if we
control it the whole time.

906
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,239
Stoddard, let us do what we need
to do to rule out corruption

907
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,439
and to get rid of the payoff guys

908
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,559
that are ruining this country.
That's my dream.

909
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,359
Don't smother it, please.
You know, Richard,

910
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,719
I understand your eagerness.

911
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,399
I really do.

912
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,199
You know I'm from Michigan,
right?

913
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,679
Let me tell you a story

914
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,839
about me and my dad and my brother.

915
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,039
We used to go ice
fishing every November.

916
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,239
Ice fishing, that's all anybody...

917
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,519
That's what we lived for.

918
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,079
Holy shit.
Just listen to me.

919
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,759
It's beautiful.
You have a little stove.

920
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,759
You huddle around,
you keep each other warm.

921
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,199
You drop a line and you just wait.

922
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,239
One year, my brother says,

923
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,599
"Let's go in October."

924
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,239
He wants to go
ice fishing in October.

925
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,159
My dad says,
"No, the ice is too thin."

926
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
My brother says,
I love my brother, he says...

927
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,519
I understand. Your brother
went out on the ice,

928
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,079
the ice was too thin,
he fell through the ice,

929
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,879
he went in the water
'cause he was too eager,

930
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,639
and you're saying I'm too eager.
That's what you're saying?

931
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,919
No, that's not what I'm saying.

932
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,359
What are you saying?

933
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,759
You know,
we'll finish the ice story

934
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,959
another time, young man.

935
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,119
For now, no Carmine Polito.

936
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,959
Go do your job.

937
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,399
<i>Stoddard shot the
whole thing down.</i>

938
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,011
Boring.

939
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,439
<i>But Edith was a genius.</i>

940
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,199
Yeah, you take me to Brenda.

941
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,919
<i>She somehow found this woman
who controlled the wire room.</i>

942
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,359
<i>A woman I'd never even heard of.</i>

943
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,959
She's amazing. She's in charge
of all the wire transfers.

944
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,079
<i>Way back in a warren
buried in the Bureau.</i>

945
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,559
She likes cats.

946
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,039
<i>This cat lady no one
ever even talked to.</i>

947
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,439
<i>And Edith met her in the ladies'
room and became friends with her.</i>

948
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,239
Brenda? Hi.

949
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,879
Hello.
How are you?

950
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,559
<i>This lady handled all the wires,</i>

951
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,959
<i>and now she was
working with us.</i>

952
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,559
<i>She was excited to be
included in an operation</i>

953
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,079
<i>instead of just being
on the other end of a memo.</i>

954
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,559
You said you liked
exotic booze, so...

955
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,799
<i>It was beautiful.</i>
That's from England.

956
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,439
This is from England?
Yeah.

957
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,239
That's right. And I brought
you some tea as well.

958
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,599
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, nobody

959
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,319
ever talks to me.
I know.

960
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,679
I mean, they just say, "Brenda,
do the clerical wiring stuff

961
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,279
"and don't ask questions."

962
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,799
You need to tell
Richie about your cats.

963
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,959
Oh, my cats?
He loves cats.

964
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,199
Oh, my cats?
Yeah.

965
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,359
Well, that's Harry.

966
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,599
Look at him standing up!
Isn't that sweet?

967
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,279
And that's Wendy.
She's a rascal.

968
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,359
But Barnaby, that's another story.

969
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,279
Barnaby plays the piano.

970
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,399
That's impressive.

971
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,039
<i>We got her to wire $2 million into
an FBI-controlled account at Chase.</i>

972
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,559
<i>It'd be there for five days,
and if Polito called,</i>

973
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,399
<i>he'd see that
the sheik was real.</i>

974
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,279
<i>And by the time
Stoddard caught up to us,</i>

975
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,999
<i>Edith made sure his boss
was impressed by my idea.</i>

976
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,719
<i>So, before he even
knew it was happening,</i>

977
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,559
<i>his boss was calling
to congratulate him.</i>

978
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,888
The sheik with the money
in the bank is a...

979
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,799
<i>Anthony Amado. He had a major
hard-on to make a name for himself.</i>

980
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,759
<i>I mean, this guy loved the
idea of being famous.</i>

981
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,159
Don't be modest.

982
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,999
<i>And Stoddard had to say</i>

983
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,719
<i>it was his own idea or he'd look
stupid in front of his boss.</i>

984
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,279
You made me accept praise
from my boss for thanking me

985
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,879
for something that
never should have happened,

986
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,479
something that I didn't approve.

987
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,199
You should be happy.

988
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,319
There's imaginative things
happening in this office.

989
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,639
All right? We're not
just working in a box.

990
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,999
<i>We got the $2 million to put
Carmine and the sheik together.</i>

991
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,279
Punk.

992
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,559
<i>I liked being on
this side of the line.</i>

993
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,399
<i>But someone had been left out.</i>

994
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,399
We succeeded because
we stayed small.

995
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,079
I got you Carl Elway.

996
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,119
He bought stolen art,
sold fake bank CD's.

997
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,759
That's enough.
That's one.

998
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,919
I get you three more, no politicians.

999
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,399
You're going to do this

1000
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,759
because you got no choice,
you work for me.

1001
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,479
Now, you keep changing the rules.

1002
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,799
You know, you're getting
a little power-drunk, Richard.

1003
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,679
You want to tell him, Edith?
You want to wake him up?

1004
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
Oh, no. I said we shouldn't
do any of it, Irving,

1005
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,919
you know I said that,
so now I support Richie.

1006
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,039
He's got vision.
Do it heavy or don't do it.

1007
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,519
Wait. What does that mean?

1008
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,079
I mean, he's the one
ruining America, not me.

1009
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,759
How the fuck am I ruining America?

1010
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,319
Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, all right,

1011
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,679
and you're going to shit all
over politicians again?

1012
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,839
And just because you want to be
a big shot, get a promotion.

1013
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,919
No. I'm thinking big, all right?

1014
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,359
This is going to be fantastic.

1015
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,599
We're doing video surveillance.

1016
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,279
I'm doing this from the feet up.

1017
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,719
You will never do it properly

1018
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,279
because you got too much
government attitude

1019
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,799
to be small and sleek.

1020
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,799
I'm like the fucking
Vietcong, man, all right?

1021
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,079
I'm in and I'm out.

1022
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,399
I was there the whole time.

1023
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,119
You don't know it, all right?

1024
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,279
That's the fucking
art of becoming somebody

1025
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,279
who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on.

1026
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,289
And you can't do it.

1027
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,119
How about a suite
at the Sheraton Hotel?

1028
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,639
For Carmine Polito

1029
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,239
and rebuilding Atlantic City...
Why not?

1030
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,479
you need a luxury hotel for the sheik.
Oh, come on.

1031
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,799
Carmine does backdoor dealings all the time.
We don't have a...

1032
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,559
We don't got
a budget for that, Irving.

1033
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,799
You got to knock the mayor,

1034
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,479
the speaker of the State Assembly,

1035
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,279
you got to knock him off of
his fucking feet, all right?

1036
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,879
He's got to feel like
he's out of his league.

1037
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,799
What you're offering, this deal,

1038
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,319
I mean, this is unheard of
in the state of New Jersey,

1039
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,079
maybe even the whole
fucking country, all right?

1040
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,439
A sheik with hundreds
of millions of dollars

1041
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
to rebuild Atlantic City,
are you fucking kidding me?

1042
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,999
That's gigantic, all right?

1043
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,159
And the mayor, he's going
to want to see cash,

1044
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,239
he's going to want to
see it in an account,

1045
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,999
he's going to want to see it
right now, and he will check.

1046
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,759
And that's why this
meeting isn't happening.

1047
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,726
Because to get millions,
you need millions.

1048
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,562
We already did it.

1049
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,479
What?

1050
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,919
We got the Bureau to park
$2 million for three days.

1051
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,248
We've got the account numbers.

1052
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,799
"We" meaning you and him?

1053
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,199
Yeah, we did it.

1054
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,879
Really?

1055
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,199
Yeah, me and that guy.

1056
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,519
She showed me.

1057
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,199
You showed him our thing?

1058
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,799
You did that without me?

1059
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,679
Are you kidding?

1060
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,087
What are you going to do?

1061
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,722
You playing me?

1062
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,759
Are you doing this?
You playing him?

1063
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,199
It'd be very bad for
you if you're playing me.

1064
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,119
You're going to have to
decide for yourself, kid.

1065
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,721
I just laid everything
out on the table.

1066
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,687
It's all very exciting.

1067
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,600
I didn't know life
could be like this.

1068
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,682
You're pretty wild.

1069
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,206
You know, we're taking down a...

1070
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,599
A very important politician.

1071
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,131
Mmm-hmm.

1072
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,730
<i>This is Agent Richard DiMaso.</i>

1073
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,559
<i>I'm placing
$75, 000 in this briefcase</i>

1074
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,439
<i>for Mayor Carmine Polito
to procure casino license</i>

1075
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,484
<i>and building permits
for Atlantic City.</i>

1076
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,599
<i>What is this? What...</i>

1077
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,759
<i>Look, I don't know you.
Excuse me, I don't...</i>

1078
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,279
<i>I don't know what that is,
but this is very weird to me.</i>

1079
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,239
This is very weird. I don't know
what the fuck that is, but...

1080
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,839
Go out there and get him now.

1081
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,679
Mr. Mayor!

1082
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,119
Please stop. Listen.

1083
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,999
I apologize if that
prick offended you.

1084
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,799
I really apologize. Hey,
I'm all right, thank you.

1085
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,519
I'm okay.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm fucking embarrassed

1086
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,359
to be associated with that guy at all.
It's okay.

1087
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,159
Can I just say
something to you, please?

1088
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,679
Don't lose this opportunity
to fucking Florida, all right,

1089
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,519
because of some bullshit

1090
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,799
from that punk advisor, all right,

1091
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,479
with his "diploma," all right,

1092
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,039
who could never get into
the school that we come from.

1093
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,402
Don't lose that opportunity.

1094
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,359
Where you from?

1095
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,399
I'm from the Bronx.

1096
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,763
Grand Concourse, 164th Street.

1097
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,359
I got a lot of friends
that live up there.

1098
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,119
Yeah, I go to Tomaso's on...

1099
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,719
Yeah, Tomaso's. Yeah, yeah.
You know Tomaso's

1100
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,279
on Arthur Avenue?
Yeah, I love the clams there.

1101
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,119
The clam, the spicy clams.
Yes. Oh, so good.

1102
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,839
Oh, they're fucking to die
for, those things. Yeah.

1103
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,202
Yeah, I haven't been there in a while.
I like that place.

1104
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,119
Well, you know what?

1105
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,129
Tell me, can I call you Carmine?

1106
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,799
You know, Carmine,

1107
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,919
hey, my fucking heart's going
from running down the stairs.

1108
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,759
I'm not used to running.

1109
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,679
There's a lot of green grass
in that hotel room up there,

1110
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,559
all right, and all the deals
would float through you.

1111
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,439
You get a serious piece
on both ends, all right?

1112
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,959
You do with it what you will.

1113
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,799
I mean, I live in
the real world, all right?

1114
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,599
I am a family man.
I got mouths to feed

1115
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,479
and everything like that,
but, you know, you got...

1116
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,599
We just... We got to
grease you directly.

1117
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,719
No middlemen, no bullshit,
it's the Arab way.

1118
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,959
That's it.
That's it. All right?

1119
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,719
Yeah, look, I understand.

1120
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,439
It's a great opportunity.

1121
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,119
You understand, it's just...
I got a little thrown

1122
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,959
by going to have a meeting
with somebody that ended up

1123
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,639
not being there, so...

1124
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,079
I was thrown as well.
No, look, I understand.

1125
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,759
I'll deal with you directly.

1126
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,879
I don't want any middleman
or any of that bullshit.

1127
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,759
Done. Done. You and me.
Deal with you directly.

1128
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,919
I like you, eye to eye,
we can do business together.

1129
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,279
That's fine.

1130
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,639
Yeah, how long you known this guy?

1131
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,559
I mean, you work
with this guy before?

1132
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,519
I got to work with him. It's the
sheik, all right, you know...

1133
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,959
But I still need to
meet the sheik, okay?

1134
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,439
Yeah. Done.
After you.

1135
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,039
<i>I'm going out for dinner</i>

1136
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,239
with Carmine and
the wives in Camden.

1137
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,319
Who?

1138
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,319
Carmine and myself and the wives.

1139
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,399
What? Without me?

1140
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,439
He doesn't like you.
What do you want from me?

1141
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,479
I got him to come
back and take the money.

1142
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,039
You got him on tape, all right?

1143
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,839
I mean, I can't make him like you.

1144
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,879
You know, I mean...
I did my job.

1145
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,439
Did you tell him that
you were working with me?

1146
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,130
That I'm the sheik's associate?

1147
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,959
I just fucking told you,
he doesn't like you.

1148
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,879
I mean, let him have a night out

1149
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,559
with a human being,
for fuck's sake, all right?

1150
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,319
He's going to jail soon.
You're done with him.

1151
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,010
You got him on tape taking a bribe.

1152
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,319
Carmine has got
to deal with me, Irving.

1153
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,439
We're going to use Carmine. Yeah,
no, we're gonna get Carmine's...

1154
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,359
We're gonna use Carmine
to get other people.

1155
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,639
That's what we're gonna do.

1156
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,839
What? Like who?

1157
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,119
Carmine's going to use
the sheik to pay off people.

1158
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,079
You fucking nuts? What are you...
Are you fuck...

1159
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,199
We're going to let Carmine
show the sheik

1160
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,319
Atlantic City, how he's
going to renovate hotels,

1161
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,879
and see who shows up and

1162
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,319
whoever the sheik pays off
for licenses and casinos,

1163
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,799
that's who we're going to go after.

1164
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,759
We're going to go
after all of them.

1165
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,359
More politicians?

1166
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,599
Yeah.

1167
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,719
You realize how
fucking dangerous that is?

1168
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,439
There's no fucking
reasoning with you.

1169
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,839
All right, Edith and I were
so successful for so long

1170
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,519
because we kept it
just small enough.

1171
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,519
You are taking us to a very
fucking dangerous place,

1172
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,927
with very serious numbers!

1173
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,679
If you were that successful,
how come you wound up

1174
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,119
in this room with me right
now, taking orders from me?

1175
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,559
You're taking your
wife out to dinner?

1176
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,839
Your fucking wife? Did I
just hear you correctly?

1177
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,039
That's the one thing
you heard me say.

1178
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,119
I just find it rather
shocking. That's all.

1179
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,439
I get to handle two
wives with one dinner.

1180
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,719
All right? I take Rosalyn out,
she keeps her mouth shut,

1181
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,519
she sees that my work is
legitimate, I get to keep my kid

1182
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,839
and I get to keep
that fucking wife happy.

1183
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,804
Both wives happy.

1184
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,401
MRS. DiMASO:
Richard, what are you doing?

1185
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,759
Richard, don't eat in the bathroom!

1186
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,399
I told you so many times!

1187
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,239
And Diane brought napoleons.

1188
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,559
Come out of the bathroom and pray!

1189
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,879
Oh, my God, what did you do?

1190
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,519
Richard, the filter is
broken in the fish tank.

1191
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,919
It's a problem.

1192
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,359
See, your job is to
do the filter, Mom.

1193
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,639
Mine is to do the gravel.

1194
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,759
When you don't do the filter
right, all the fish die. See?

1195
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,159
I can't get that top on the
filter, that thing on there.

1196
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,679
We went over this 100 times, Mom.

1197
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,999
And please help Richard
to marry Diane so that I

1198
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,360
may have grandchildren and the
Pope may have more followers.

1199
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,119
And please bless this food

1200
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,599
that we are about to eat.

1201
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,679
Richard!

1202
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,079
Yeah, hello?

1203
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,479
Hi.

1204
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,919
<i>Who's this?</i>

1205
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,439
It's Edith.

1206
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,199
Sit down and pray properly!

1207
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,199
Are you all right?

1208
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,559
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1209
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,439
I'm just...
I'm alone, you know.

1210
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,279
Irving's out with Carmine.

1211
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,479
Oh, yeah, that's right, he went
out with Carmine and his wife.

1212
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,999
Yeah, you must not
feel so good about that.

1213
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,439
<i>Richard, sit down.</i>

1214
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,039
Wait. Who's that?
Who are you with?

1215
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,719
Oh, no, it's just people.

1216
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,319
"People"?
I'm your fiancée. Richard!

1217
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,919
Oh, you've got a fiancee.
You're engaged.

1218
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,639
I don't know, I don't know.
No fiancée.

1219
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,079
<i>I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.</i>

1220
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,759
You don't know? You don't
know if you have a fiancée?

1221
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,759
<i>I don't. No.
MRS. DiMASO: The fish filter is broken!</i>

1222
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,239
Hmm. Interesting.

1223
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,359
What, you want...
You want to get together?

1224
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,166
MRS. DiMASO: Richard, do something
about the fish tank.

1225
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,359
54th Street?

1226
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,519
<i>Okay, 54th Street.</i>

1227
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,165
Okay. Great.

1228
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,679
That's what that
phone call was about.

1229
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,199
Everybody thought,
"Oh, Richie DiMaso's

1230
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,239
"going to stay in
the office pushing papers."

1231
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,559
That's not going to happen, Mom.

1232
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,799
I'm outside in the field.

1233
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,679

Hi. Good to see you.
This is Irving.

Dolly, Dolly.
Hi. How are you?

This is Rosalyn. Carmine.

Rocco, the...
You know, like we do

1248
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,399
with the chicken, very thin, right?

1249
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,759
Thin. Very thin.
Absolutely.

1250
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,279
Really thin, look,
the way he does this...

1251
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,359
- Does this chicken with the red sauce, right?
- Beautiful.

1252
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,519
With the red sauce, the lemon?

1253
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,599
Oh, my God, the garlic.

1254
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,519
The garlic is amazing.
It's so good. It's so good.

1255
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,519
Here it is, right here.
Here it is. This is it.

1256
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,239
This. This right here,
this right here! Look at this!

1257
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,999
Oh, my God!
You're going to love it!

1258
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,919
You see it?
This is so good, so good.

1259
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,879
It's the piccata of the gods.

1260

1263

Thank you, Rocco.
Thank you, Rocco.

1264
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,879
Salute. You're welcome.

1265
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,759
I believe that you
should treat people

1266
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,159
the way that you
want to be treated.

1267
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,959
Right? Didn't Jesus
say that or something?

1268
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,719
He may have.
I think also,

1269
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,199
always take a favor over money.

1270
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,159
I think Jesus said that as well.

1271
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,719
I don't know if he
said the second one,

1272
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,119
but he might have
said the first one.

1273
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,319
I chipped that moving furniture.
It's my new obsession.

1274
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,679
Moving, redecorating, it makes
me feel better, like exercise.

1275
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,079
But there's this topcoat that you
can only get from Switzerland.

1276
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,399
And I don't know
what I'm going to do

1277
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,239
because I'm running out of it,
but I love the smell of it.

1278
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,879
I can get it for you.
Irv and I can't get enough of it.

1279
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,559
I can get it for you. Of course.
That would be amazing.

1280
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,519
There's something, the topcoat...

1281
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,879
It's, like, perfumey, but
there's also something rotten.

1282
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,439
And I know that sounds crazy,
but I can't get enough of it.

1283
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,879
Smell it. It's true.
Yeah.

1284
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,719
Dolly, historically,
Oh, my God.

1285
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,279
The best perfumes in the world...
It's disgusting.

1286
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,759
they're all laced with
something nasty and foul.

1287
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,759
It's true. Stop. Stop.
It is true. it is true.

1288
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,119
It feels true.
It feels true.

1289
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,519
Irving loves them.
Oh, my God.

1290
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,119
He can't get enough of that smell.

1291
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,159
Can't get enough.

1292
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,399
Can't get enough. I can't get enough.
Carmine.

1293
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,599
Carmine, smell her nails.

1294
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,199
Sweet and sour.
Smell her nails.

1295
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,719
Rotten and delicious.
What am I smelling?

1296
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,279
It smells like flowers.
Am I right?

1297
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,919
Flowers, but with garbage.

1298
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,279
And, like... Yeah.

1299
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,599
Or like sour flowers.

1300
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,919
You know what that is for me?
It's coriander for me.

1301
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,679
But Irv loves it.
He can't get enough.

1302
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,279
- That's what hooks you.
- Mmm.

1303
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,999
He always comes back for it.
Yeah.

1304
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,770
I can't stop.

1305
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,959
I'm having a good time.

1306
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,239
Oh, you two are just so nice.

1307
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,479
Hey, listen...

1308
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,119
Yes?
He's going to...

1309
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,159
He's going to say,
"We have to talk business."

1310
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,479
In five.

1311
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,799
Four.
Four.

1312
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,919
- Three. Two. One.
- Three. Two. One.

1313
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,959
Thank you. Dolly, can me and the
man talk about business here?

1314
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,879
She's all right.
She's all right.

1315
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,679
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't do that!

1316
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,999
It makes me look
more drunk than I am.

1317
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,159
No, it's okay.

1318
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,279
I got you. Okay.

1319
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,319
I don't think that's possible.

1320
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,359
I'm not this drunk. No, it was
just because I was laughing.

1321
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,479
Irving, please don't make me go.
Oh, she's fine. She's fine.

1322
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,159
She's fine. All right.
I was just starting to have fun.

1323
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,480
I was just starting to have fun.
Let's take her to the car.

1324

Didn't your fiancée
want to come out tonight?

1325
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,839
Yeah. No...

1326
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,519
I don't... Yeah, no.

1327
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,609
No, I don't know.

1328
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,879
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
we don't have to talk about it.

1329
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,679
I was just teasing you. I'm...
It's all right.

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,439
It's all right.

1331
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,519
Do you ever think, like,
how did I end up here?

1332
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,564
Like, how did my life become this?
Do you ever think that?

1333
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,439
And you wonder, like...

1336

No, no, no, no.

No. No, I need this.

01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,119
Hey, boys,
this guy right here, Julius.

1397
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,799
This guy...

1398
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,839
Irving Rosenfeld,
you know what he's gonna do?

1399
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,559
He's gonna bring
the sheik to Atlantic City,

1400
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,919
that's what he's gonna do.

1401
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,119
Where we can rebuild
all those resorts there,

1402
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,199
put everybody back to work.

1403
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,279
He's gonna get this community,
he's gonna get this state,

1404
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,159
back on its feet
to where it belongs.

1405
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,679
Isn't that right?

1406
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,239
He's gonna grow our tax base
and create thousands

1407
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,239
and thousands of jobs for everyone.

1408
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,719
You understand that?
You know what that means?

1409
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,199
To Irving.

1410
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,519
To Irving.
To Irving.

1411
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,839
Come on,

1412
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,249
this guy right here,
he's got a big heart.

1413
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,799
I'd just hate it
if it didn't work out.

1414
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,959
What do you mean?

1415
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,239
Of course it's gonna work out, Irv.

1416
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,039
Come on, guys like you and me?

1417
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,239
Come on, man. Right?

1418
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,959
We dream and we build.

1419
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,479
We never give up, we never quit.

1420
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,647
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1421
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,839
Yeah, sure.

1422
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,451
Is the sheik black?

1423
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,759
He's from... He's...

1424
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,962
He's an Arab.

1425
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,880
Well, that...
That's black, isn't it?

1426
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,279
I don't know.

1427
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,919
I don't know, maybe it's
a dumb question, but...

1428
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,079
I'm just wondering.

1429
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,919
Why are you asking?

1430
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,279
I would like to arrange

1431
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,839
for the sheik

1432
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,159
to see Camden.

1433
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,159
To see the people of Camden.

1434
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,319
The people I serve.
The people I love.

1435
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,239
Who are mostly
black and Puerto Rican.

1436
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,839
Irv, I really want him to see

1437
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,079
how good this is going to be
for the community,

1438
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,119
how ready we are
for this opportunity.

1439
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,359
And he can see how
far his dollar will go.

1440
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,519
You know what I mean? What do you think?
Yeah.

1441
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,599
Yeah.
Yeah, we can do that. Yeah.

1442
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,599
Yeah?
He can see Camden. Yeah.

1443
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,879
All right.

1444
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,759
All right, good. Yo, hey,

1445
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,959
I got something
I want to give you.

1446
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,199
Come on.
For me?

1447
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,839
Yeah, I got...
I got you a gift.

1448
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,479
Let's get out of here.
Okay.

1449
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,519
The girls are going to kill us.

1450
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,125
Right here.

1451
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,362
There you go.

1452
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,919
What is it?

1453
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,559
It's a microwave.
It heats up everything.

1454
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,919
Pasta, lasagna,
meatballs, whatever.

1455
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,399
Really?
It's science. Yeah, that's how it

1456
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,599
heats up the food, it's scientific.

1457
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,599
And you specifically

1458
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,599
bought this

1459
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,839
science oven for me?

1460
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,610
Yeah.

1461
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,889
A new friend.

1462
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,120
Thank you. Thank you.

1463
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,239
Don't put metal in it.

1464
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,805
Come on, let's get it out of here.

1465
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,639
I need a jet at Teterboro.

1466
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,359
I need a jet at Teterboro for the sheik.
I told you that.

1467
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,839
You don't need a jet.

1468
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,759
You just let him
walk to the curb at JFK.

1469
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,079
That's not how it works.

1470
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,879
No, you got to
start from the feet up.

1471
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,679
That doesn't mean anything.
What does that mean?

1472
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,279
It means you got to be committed.

1473
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,839
It means you got to be
committed to something

1474
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,039
in your life, for
Christ's sake, all right?

1475
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,199
I want a jet at Teterboro
for the sheik.

1476
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,959
It could be a small jet,
doesn't even have to take off.

1477
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,679
'Cause I know you're so
worried about how much money

1478
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,079
the Bureau's gonna fucking spend.

1479
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,170
You take off and land
on the tarmac, okay?

1480
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,159
All right, I'll... You can
have a jet for an hour, but it

1481
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,919
takes off and lands at Teterboro.
I got the jet?

1482
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,770
You got the jet, yeah.
All right, thank you.

1483
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,399
All right, so tell me the rest
of the ice fishing story.

1484
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,439
Where was I?
Your father woke you up,

1485
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,199
it was a blizzard,
it was Lake Canoga.

1486
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,402
Come on, come on.

1487
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,239
Okay, well, my brother
and I were on the ice,

1488
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,199
and my father came out of the
house and I could see him coming.

1489
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,959
He was holding a lantern
and he was in the blizzard,

1490
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,839
and I knew he was gonna be angry.

1491
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,759
So I went to intercept my father,

1492
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,519
because I knew if he
saw what my brother

1493
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,039
was doing, he was gonna kill him.

1494
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,079
Oh, so you tried to
protect your brother,

1495
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,479
but you couldn't,
and that's why you feel bad,

1496
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,839
because you're trying to protect me

1497
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,319
and you're worried about me. Is
that what the story's about?

1498
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,399
It's about protection.
No, it's not about protection.

1499
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,679
It's not?
No.

1500
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,803
All right, fine.

1501
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,159
"Don't put metal in that
science oven, Rosalyn.

1502
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,442
"Don't put metal in the science..."

1503
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,839
He always treats me
like a fucking child.

1504
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,239
I'll do whatever I want.

1505
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,319
Oh!

1506
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,519
Another fire!
No, Danny, not that one!

1507
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,079
That one's empty.
We got to use the big one.

1508
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,239
I told you not to put metal
in the science oven.

1509
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,559
What'd you do that for?

1510
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,759
Don't make such a big deal.

1511
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,839
We'll just get another one.

1512
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,199
I don't want another one.

1513
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,759
I want the one
that Carmine gave me.

1514
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,199
"Oh, Carmine. I want the
one that Carmine gave me.

1515
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,519
"Carmine, Carmine."

1516
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,839
Why don't you just marry Carmine?

1517
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,159
Get a little gold microwave

1518
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,839
and put it on
a chain around your neck.

1519
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,359
You want to be more like Carmine?

1520
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,079
Why don't you build
something, like he does?

1521
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,519
Instead of all your empty deals

1522
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,199
that are just like
your fucking science oven.

1523
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,399
You know, I read that
it takes all of the nutrition

1524
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,719
out of our food.

1525
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,199
It's empty, just like your deals.

1526
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,199
Empty, empty.
Listen to this bullshit.

1527
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,759
It's not bullshit.

1528
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,327
I read it in an article. Look.

1529
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,922
By Paul Brodeur.

1530
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,599
Bring something into
this house that's gonna

1531
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,159
take all the nutrition
out of our food

1532
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,119
and then light our house on fire?

1533
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,971
Thank God for me.

1534
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,450
All right, you've got this.

1535
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,719
I don't think you should come
to Carmine's party tonight.

1536
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,241
You look beautiful, by the way.

1537
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,879
Don't look at me.
All right?

1538
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,919
Don't look at my legs,
don't look at my hair,

1539
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,999
don't smell my hair,
don't ask me how I am,

1540
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,679
don't talk to me
outside of these roles,

1541
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,119
'cause we're done.
Where you going?

1542
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,119
Just stand still.
Get under the umbrella.

1543
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:11,079
Come on. It's just, Carmine
wants Rosalyn to come.

1544
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,759
I don't care.

1545
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,119
You weren't listening. I
don't care if Rosalyn comes.

1546
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,439
Just do your job, okay?

1547
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,849
You're nothing to me
until you're everything.

1548
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,005
I'm not Rosalyn, I'm not
gonna put up with that shit.

1549
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,719
That's a fucking jet, right?

1550
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,919
It's good.

1551
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,399
That's the kind of
moves you need to make.

1552
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,639
Paco Hernandez?
Hi. How's it going?

1553
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,319
Richie DiMaso.
Nice to meet you.

1554
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,599
Nice to meet you in person.

1555
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,959
This is Irving Rosenfeld.

1556
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,319
Paco Hernandez.
Nice to meet you.

1557
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,239
Paco? He's...
He's not a real Arab.

1558
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,599
No, I'm Mexican, from Tucson.

1559
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,919
Where's... Where's my guy? Where's Al?
Where's Al from Queens?

1560
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,439
Who?
My friend from Queens. Where is he?

1561
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,639
What are you doing?
I got to hire an FBI guy.

1562
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,479
You speak any Arabic?
Yeah.

1563
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,679
That's it?
That's good.

1564
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,999
No, I have a couple of phrases.

1565
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,359
From the feet up, you motherfucker.

1566
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,879
What are you doing?
Come on.

1567
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,879
Act noble. That's
it, just, you know,

1568
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,519
like you can't barely
understand English,

1569
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,039
you can't speak it, you say
as little as possible,

1570
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,879
you follow my lead,
all right? All right?

1571
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,639
Okay. Who's running this?
I thought you were running it.

1572
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,479
I am running this, but you
got to listen to him.

1573
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,719
He's the guy with the vision.

1574
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,359
I got the vision?
Know what vision I had?

1575
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,719
You just kissing my girl, right outside.
That's what vision I had.

1576
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,199
I thought you guys broke up.

1577
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,129
I'm giving you a compliment.

1578
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,880
What's going on?

1579
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,519
Don't worry about it, all right?
You got a knife.

1580
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,199
All right, this is for the mayor.

1581
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,079
You got to present it to the mayor.

1582
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,799
Just look at me, all right?

1583
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,239
Look me in the eye.

1584
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,239
This means a lot to you, right?

1585
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,679
That knife.
Oh.

1586
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,519
Play it. You present it, all right?

1587
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,519
Friendship for life, all right?

1588
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,879
You got to feel it.
Sacred, can you do it?

1589
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,079
Right.
Sacred. Sacred.

1590
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,919
You got to sell it. You got to sell it.
Sell it.

1591
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,759
If you believe it's sacred, it's sacred.
Right.

1592
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,559
All right? Can you do it?
Listen to what he's saying.

1593
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,039
It's the details, that's what
makes this guy a genius.

1594
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,719
Again?
You compliment me again?

1595
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,879
What is this, rubbing salt
in the wound? What are you?

1596
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,082
I'm complimenting you.

1597
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,679
You got any other questions?

1598
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,799
Yeah, I think the name

1599
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,239
of this operation is offensive.

1600
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,319
What, Abscam. Arab scam?

1601
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,559
It's racist.

1602
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,879
Are you fucking kidding?

1603
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,919
What do you care?
You're Mexican.

1604
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,079
Hello, Sheik.

1605
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,239
Hello, Sheik, my friend.

1606
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,399
Welcome. On behalf of the
great state of New Jersey,

1607
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,999
I want to welcome
you to New Jersey.

1608
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,559
I know that was redundant.
I'm sorry.

1609
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,799
I'm just very nervous.

1610
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,288
Thank you, thank you.

1611
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,279
We have a great party planned
for you this evening.

1612
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,039
What are you talking
about, I can't go?

1613
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,999
I just did my hair
and makeup and everything.

1614
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,759
Sheiks are very particular.

1615
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,079
It's international cultural
protocol, you know.

1616
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,359
You don't know that?

1617
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,599
International protocol?

1618
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,484
Yep.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1619
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,959
Do not answer that.

1620
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,439
Do not answer that!
Hello?

1621
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,959
<i>Robert Spencer for Irving.</i>

1622
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,999
Robert Spencer? I don't
know a Robert Spencer.

1623
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,799
What do you want?
<i>I'm a business associate...</i>

1624
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,479
Who is that? Who is that?
I tell you, for God's sake,

1625
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,569
I told you not to call here, all right?
What is that about?

1626
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,079
Two more federal agents tonight.
<i>What?</i>

1627
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,119
<i>No. No way.
Two feds.</i>

1628
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,526
<i>No.
I need them.</i>

1629
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,079
Bodyguards for the sheik.

1630
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,399
No, no, no, that's too many
guys for me to control.

1631
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,839
No. No.
<i>Irving, remember</i>

1632
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,559
<i>who's in charge here.</i>

1633
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,599
Rosalyn, get off the extension.

1634
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,999
I'm not on it.

1635
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,639
Look, don't call
here again, all right?

1636
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,599
Don't call at home.
<i>All right. Good night.</i>

1637
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,359
All right.

1638
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,679
If it's a business call,
don't interrupt, all right?

1639
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,279
Federal agents?

1640
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,759
No, it's bodyguards for the, uh,
visiting dignitaries, that's all.

1641
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,639
What is it, an IRS thing?
Like a tax investigation?

1642
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,119
Why do you got to say that?
I mean, that's why

1643
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,639
I can't invite you...
It's too complicated.

1644
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,559
Are you in trouble?
Look, stop being so nosy.

1645
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,919
Look at this shit.
Well, I'm only nosy

1646
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,159
'cause you never tell me anything.

1647
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,479
Can we clean up this fridge?
I mean,

1648
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,679
what are you causing trouble for

1649
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,919
all the time?

1650
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,199
Do not answer that!

1651
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,759
Hello?
<i>Hello, it's Carmine.</i>

1652
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,079
Oh, hi, Carmine. We were
just talking about you.

1653
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,999
Yeah, Irving's being
a mean, boring man,

1654
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,479
saying that he doesn't
want me to come tonight.

1655
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,599
<i>Tell him he's crazy.</i>
Well, I agree.

1656
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,559
Tell him yourself.
<i>It wouldn't be a party without you.</i>

1657
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,679
Can you imagine?
<i>'Cause you're coming!</i>

1658
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,999
Yeah.
Tell him yourself.

1659
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,679
All right. Hey, Carmie.

1660
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,359
Irving, you're crazy.
Your wife is coming.

1661
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,719
<i>You kidding me?
She's the life of the party.</i>

1662
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,959
<i>Everybody loves her.</i>

1663
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,119
I'm the life of the party.

1664
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,679
You know what she's like.
She's unpredictable. She's just...

1665
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,199
Hey, don't talk about me like that!

1666
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,839
What is Carmine saying?
I can't hear what he's saying.

1667
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,959
Let me listen.
<i>Hey, look, Irving,</i>

1668
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,119
<i>it's very important
that she comes,</i>

1669
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,319
you understand?
Carmine loves me.

1670
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,879
This is a really big, big
night for us, you understand?

1671
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,359
Come on,
you got to bring your wife.

1672
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,199
And Dolly's got something
special for her, right?

1673
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,159
Yeah, I do, I got your nail polish.
See? Listen, listen.

1674
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,159
Yeah, I got your nail
polish for you, sweetie!

1675
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,679
See?
Something special for you.

1676
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,439
What is it? What is it?

1677
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,599
Come on. Tell me.
What... What...

1678
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,599
What is it?
You got a girlfriend coming?

1679
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,879
<i>Come on, I thought
we were friends.</i>

1680
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,679
<i>You're not gonna tell me you got a girlfriend?
This is ridiculous.</i>

1681
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,399
<i>What is it?</i>
Nah, it's...

1682
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,399
<i>Look, we handle this
like men, you understand?</i>

1683
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,439
<i>You're bringing your wife.
We're gonna have a good time.</i>

1684
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,319
All right, we'll see you there.
It'll be fun.

1685
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,439
That's an order from the mayor.
Goodbye.

1686
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,291
All right, you happy?
Go get ready.

1687
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,839
Yes, I am happy.

1688
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,122
<i>♪ When are you gonna
come down?</i>

1689
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,524

1690

Want me to take your coats?

1706
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,039
Now, mind you, a week ago,
this place was a mess.

1707
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,679
But what existed
was this plasterwork.

1708
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,359
Look at the detail.
This is beautiful.

1709
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,759
My sons are craftsmen. Please,
tell them what you did.

1710
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,519

Trompe l'oeil.
"Trick of the eye."

1713
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,679
We restore all of this, you see?

1714
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,719
Saved you $50 million.
Look at me. $50 million,

1715
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,279
right off the bat, like that.
Right off the bat.

1716
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,159
I waive the law that I helped write

1717
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,039
that said casino
construction had to be built

1718
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,599
ground-up new.
We don't do new.

1719
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,039
No. We renovate.
We renovate, right?

1720
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,839
We put in some temporary fun.

1721
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,359
Some gaming tables, some play money

1722
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,879
for people to have a good time.

1723
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,839
This is for charity,
for the Boys and Girls Club

1724
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,919
and, uh, some arts programs.
Hey, how are you?

1725
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,601
This is the Ocean Room.

1726
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,886
There's some gentlemen sitting
over there at the bar.

1727
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,279
That's 130 years
sitting right there.

1728
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,719
That's how much time between them.

1729
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,359
They run the biggest casinos
in the United States,

1730
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,879
and we have to work with them.

1731
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,039
Right.

1732
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,559
The good news is,

1733
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,319
they know how it's done,
they get it done,

1734
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,599
you don't have to worry,
everyone makes their money.

1735
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,879
You mean the Mob?

1736
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,199
Yes, but they're businessmen, okay?

1737
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,359
Now, spend as much or as
little time with them

1738
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,399
as you like, but we do
have to deal with them.

1739
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,079
All we got to do is go say hello.

1740
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,559
We just got to say hi. That's it.
Carmine, maybe...

1741
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,039
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

1742
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,199
We got to confer before
we talk to these guys.

1743
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,839
Confer? What is there to confer about?
I don't understand.

1744
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,519
They're casino guys.

1745
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,839
They're casino guys.
They're the businessmen.

1746
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,919
Yeah, we come all this way.
Irving,

1747
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,279
we came all this way,
we should be here.

1748
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,559
What's everybody scared of?
What's everybody scared of?

1749
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,079
You just got to be delicate.

1750
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,239
Those are the guys that you
guys are all scared of?

1751
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,279
Those guys over there?
They don't scare me.

1752
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,599
I'm not scared.

1753
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,759
Rosalyn? Rosalyn?

1754
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,159
Hi. Can I join you?

1755
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,999
Irv, that's not the way to do this.

1756
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,850
It's not a good idea.

1757
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,130
I love this.

1758
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,439
Everybody over there's really scared
of you guys, do you know that?

1759
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,639
- No.
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,359
Kids, I want you to go up

1761
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,359
and get some soda
and pizza, please.

1762
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,439
It's a disaster.

1763
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,839
I think they got
this room all wrong.

1764
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,441
Yeah?
What would you do?

1765
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,279
I would do it in
all black and gold,

1766
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,439
and I would do this bar
like a big warm golden mirror.

1767
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,799
Sounds beautiful.

1768
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,679
Oh, thank you.
But you expect that from her

1769
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,639
because she's so beautiful.
Oh, God, stop.

1770
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,799
Gorgeous.
And I love her hair,

1771
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,999
so I know I'm gonna
love what you do.

1772
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,639
- Oh, my God. It's messy.
- How do you do?

1773
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,039
I'm sorry, is she your wife?

1774
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,599
No, she's my wife.
She's my wife.

1775
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,639
Look at these fine gentlemen.
Hey, Carmine, there you are.

1776
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,799
How you doing?
How are you?

1777
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,999
You well?
Good to see you.

1778
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,319
How you doing?
Hey, how are you?

1779
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,639
That's enough of that right now.

1780
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,119
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1781
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,479
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, stop it.

1782
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,999
Hey, oh, no, it's because
he's a party pooper.

1783
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,599
He's so boring.

1784
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,399
May I present

1785
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,999
Sheik Abdullah, gentlemen,

1786
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,399
from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,
these are professionals,

1787
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,439
and they run the best casinos
in the United States.

1788
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,839
Mr. Sheik, as a sign
of our seriousness,

1789
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,520
Mr. Tellegio came from
Miami to meet you tonight.

1790
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,919
Mr. Tellegio?

1791
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,799
Why didn't you tell me
Mr. Tellegio was...

1792
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,079
He's in the back room.

1793
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,599
It's a sign of disrespect

1794
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,519
to talk, uh, business
on the first meeting.

1795
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,119
That's not true.
It's disrespectful...

1796
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,959
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1797
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,959
He's got it all wrong.
You want to leave him back there in

1798
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,359
the back room waiting?
Come on, let's go, we got

1799
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,199
to go meet him.
My friend from New York

1800
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,799
doesn't know the customs...
Hey, no disrespect, pal.

1801
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,319
Hey, Irving,
I'm gonna be having fun.

1802
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,159
Maybe it'll be contagious, huh?

1803
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,879
You and me, we're gonna visit.

1804
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,519
She's a fun girl.

1805
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,359
I'm having fun.

1806
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,245
Can you believe he
talks to me that way?

1807
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,399
Carmine.

1808
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,199
<i>Victor Tellegio was from Miami.</i>

1809
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,719
<i>He was Meyer Lansky's
right-hand man.</i>

1810
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,599
<i>With his prior reputation as
an enforcer from 20 years ago,</i>

1811
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,759
<i>he was known to never bury a
body, because he felt it sent</i>

1812
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,679
<i>a stronger message to
leave it in the street.</i>

1813
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,484
He looked at me like...

1814
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,249
<i>This is the guy
we now had to deal with.</i>

1815
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,879
You sure you don't
want to go into the Ocean Bar?

1816
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,039
It's really,
it's beautiful in there.

1817
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,399
No, I don't have to go there. I like it here.
There's an exit.

1818
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,011
I'm like a ghost.

1819
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,288
Nobody knows I'm here.

1820
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,239
Look, tell him I speak
for our friends in Florida.

1821
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,079
We're very excited.
It's been our lifelong dream

1822
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,399
to build casino resorts
on the East Coast.

1823
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,079
You told him that?

1824
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,599
They didn't want
the Jews to make money.

1825
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,079
They didn't want the
Italians to make money.

1826
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,239
They definitely don't want
the blacks to make money.

1827
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,599
After the oil embargo,
gasoline crisis,

1828
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,919
the hijackings, the Olympics,

1829
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,879
they don't want to
see Arabs make money,

1830
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,889
trust me, not on our soil.

1831
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,279
And, I don't know, you can
tell him this in your own way.

1832
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,439
I've been in the casino
business 40 years,

1833
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,769
it's scrutinized more carefully
than any other business.

1834
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,279
Carmine made this legal, but

1835
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,767
we must be careful,
or they'll take it away.

1836
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,639
So, Mr. Tellegio, how do you
think we should approach this?

1837
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,002
What do you think?
What do you want to do?

1838
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,603
Well, if you want to get the
gaming license and keep it,

1839
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,039
we have to make our principal
investor here, the sheik,

1840
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,049
an American citizen.

1841
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,479
Well, to expedite citizenship,

1842
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,919
that requires very
special treatment.

1843
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,199
Well, you would know the right
people to do that, Carmine.

1844
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,479
Carmie knows everybody.

1845
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,479
What are we talking about?

1846
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,999
Uh, U.S. senators...

1847
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,959
Uh, U.S. congressmen and senators.

1848
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,889
Wow!
That's fantastic.

1849
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,319
I say stay away from that.

1850
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,239
That's bad, that's trouble.

1851
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,679
It's not good.

1852
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,519
Irving, please.
That's trouble.

1853
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,609
Who is this guy?
Who are you? Huh?

1854
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,839
What are you, a farmer?

1855
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,439
This is, uh... Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry.

1856
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,159
This is Irving.
Irving.

1857
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,519
This is Irving Rosenfeld.

1858
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,759
Irving, Irving.

1859
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,999
Yes. New York businessman.

1860
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,639
What's the matter, Irving?
What's the problem?

1861
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,199
Nothing.
No problem.

1862
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,519
Eh, you know, don't get
your balls in an uproar.

1863
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,519
Everything's fine,
everything's good.

1864
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,239
It's all good, it's all good.

1865
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,885
It's all good.
I just hope

1866
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,439
the other part of this is all good.

1867
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,079
And real.
Because we're real.

1868
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,519
You know that.
Yes. That's correct.

1869
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,799
You deal with us,
we're a real organization.

1870
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,240
We're dealing with you, we don't
know what we're dealing with.

1871
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,879
Where is he from?

1872
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,359
Abu Dhabi.

1873
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,199
Oh, he's from the Emirates.
Yeah.

1874
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,039
Can I count on you?

1875
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,799
You gotta be honest about this.
Did you understand me?

1876
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,359
"Good" means good.

1877
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,971
No bullshit.

1878
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,479
Did you hear what I said?

1879
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,490
Do you want me to repeat it?

1880
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,719
What do you think now?

1881
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,410
Tell me.

1882
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,282
Tell me.

1883
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,368
Uh...

1884
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,359
I think... I think, what is, uh...

1885
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,039
No, no, let him speak for himself.

1886
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,919
Uh...

1887
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,359
It's okay. He's a friend of mine.

1888
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,839
It's okay, I know him, I know him.

1889
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,919
I know him, he's a friend of mine.

1890
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,239
You guys are way too
serious for a party.

1891
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,799
Holy cow.
What are you drinking?

1892
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,919
Hey, Al, listen to me.
You got a drink?

1893
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,279
We're in a very serious meeting.
I apologize.

1894
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,999
You got to come with me now.
You got a speech that...

1895
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,959
Everybody's waiting for you.
Al, I'll be right behind you.

1896
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,039
Okay, trust me. Right behind you, okay?
Come on.

1897
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,483
It'll be great
doing business with you.

1898
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,121
The investment is real.

1899
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,484
It was a pleasure to meet you.

1900
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,119
<i>What are the fucking odds of an
Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic?</i>

1901
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,639
<i>It turns out he's got casino
investments in the Mideast,</i>

1902
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,279
<i>and he spent two years learning
it to keep the upper hand.</i>

1903
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,005
Listen to me carefully.

1904
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,159
If you're real, you put $10 million

1905
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,399
in the bank of our choice
in the next two weeks.

1906
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,759
Carmine, listen to me carefully.

1907
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,879
If you're real, you put $10 million

1908
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,759
in the bank of our choice
in the next two weeks

1909
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,039
or not only will
the sheik feel insulted,

1910
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,559
but our friends in Florida
will feel deeply disrespected.

1911
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,921
So will I.

1912
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,359
MANI What a girl.

1913
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,879
Rosalyn, you need to
come with me, all right?

1914
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,959
Oh, I need to come with you?

1915
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,879
Yeah, you need to come with me,
this needs to stop, all right?

1916
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,239
Oh, you think I should come with you?
Why don't you go...

1917
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,319
Get your fucking hands off
me, you fucking whore.

1918
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,519
You're a whore.

1919
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,639
Oh, okay.
That's really nice.

1920
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,759
We're not gonna do this in the
Ocean Room tonight, please.

1921
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,279
This is my husband's whore!

1922
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,839
You know, you stay
here right now, darling.

1923
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,599
Please, please, please.
You stay over here with me.

1924
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,439
Everybody just calm down.
I don't know what's going on.

1925
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,559
You all right?

1926
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,799
Take it easy, okay?

1927
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,199
All right.
These things happen.

1928
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,359
Whatever's meant
to be is meant to be.

1929
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,039
All right?
I always say that.

1930
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,239
You say that?
Yeah.

1931
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,559
See, kindred spirits.

1932
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,207
Whatever's meant to be will be.

1933
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,599
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1934
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,079
What do I think I'm doing?
Yeah.

1935
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,199
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1936
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,719
You're gonna come
in here and judge me

1937
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,119
for flirting with someone
after you've been fucking

1938
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,039
my husband for how many years?
I'm not fucking judging you.

1939
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,719
You don't have any fucking
clue what's going on!

1940
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,399
I got a ring on my finger.

1941
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,409
We have a child together.

1942
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,879
He doesn't love you,
Rosalyn.

1943
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,039
He loves me, and you know it,
and I know it, and he knows it.

1944
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,199
And it might be done now, but it
was beautiful and it was real.

1945
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,679
Stop it.
And we loved each other.

1946
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,119
Shut up.
You scare him,

1947
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,290
and you manipulate him,
and you use your son.

1948
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,679
Well, he must like it on some level.
He must want it,

1949
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,159
because he keeps
coming back for it.

1950
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,759
It's like that perfume that you
love that you can't stop smelling

1951
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,999
even when there's
something sour in it.

1952
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,770
You can't get enough of it.

1953
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,287
But guess what?
He's never gonna leave me.

1954
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,719
He's always going to want me,

1955
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,279
and I will make
you so sorry, Edith.

1956
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,399
I will make you so sorry for
what you've done to my family.

1957
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,079
Mark my words.

1958
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,759
That is fucked-up.

1959
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,799
I would never say anything
that fucked-up to anybody,

1960
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,199
but you do because
you're gross inside.

1961
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,359
You're so fucked-up and gross.

1962
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,439
Oh, I'm gross inside?
Yeah.

1963
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,679
Maybe you're gross inside.

1964
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,519
What, robbing people and
all that shit that you do.

1965
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,279
Maybe we're both gross inside.
That's what Irving loves about us.

1966
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,759
At least he's consistent.

1967
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,399
You know, sometimes in life,
all you have are fucked-up,

1968
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,965
poisonous choices.

01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,643
<i>to a new era
that begins tonight.</i>

1997
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,719
<i>From me and my family,</i>

1998
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,359
<i>we thank you</i>

1999
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,770
<i>for all the hard work that you've
given us in the community.</i>

2000
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,166
<i>Look what you've done.
This is beautiful.</i>

2001
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,411
<i>Thank you.</i>

2002
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,685
Edith!

2003
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,725
Use your phone?

2004
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,721
Last night was insane.
I got it all figured out.

2005
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,719
<i>Stoddard Thorsen.</i>

2006
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:26,319
Listen, I need the Sherman Suite
at the Plaza Hotel, okay?

2007
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,159
<i>That's a whole
floor of the hotel.</i>

2008
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,603
No, no, no, no, I need the whole floor.
I need it for my operation.

2009
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,839
Stop calling it your operation, Richard.
It's not your operation,

2010
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,479
and I'm not giving you a whole
floor of the Plaza Hotel.

2011
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,719
I have members of Congress that
are gonna come in right now

2012
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,239
and try to give the sheik
citizenship, all right?

2013
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,639
They're taking bribes.

2014
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,763
That's happening right now. That's
what's happening right now.

2015
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,319
Bribing members of Congress? Are
you out of your fucking mind?

2016
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,039
Stoddard, Stoddard, no, shut up!

2017
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,159
Listen, do you know
who Victor Tellegio is?

2018
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:57,239
Victor Tellegio. Works for Meyer
Lansky. You know who that is?

2019
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,119
<i>I know who Victor...</i>
Resorts International, all right?

2020
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,799
He wants $10 million. I have
two weeks, I have two...

2021
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,759
Listen to me, just listen to me.
Listen to me!

2022
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,759
You're not listening to me!

2023
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,166
I have two weeks!

2024
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,079
I have two weeks to
put this thing together.

2025
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,279
And I need you to get me the
Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel!

2026
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,359
<i>Lower your voice.</i>

2027
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,679
And you're gonna fucking do it!

2028
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,479
<i>You don't get to say what happens
and you don't get to yell at me.</i>

2029
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,079
Calm me down, baby.

2030
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,691
Calm me down.

2031
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,079
You've got to calm me down.

2032
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,521
You got to calm me down, baby.

2033
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,879
You got to calm me down.

2034
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,959
You got to calm me down, baby.
Let's do it, let's do this right now.

2035
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,279
No, no, no.
Let's do it.

2036
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,359
We're not gonna do it unless...
No, I want to do it right now.

2037
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,559
I want to do this right now.

2038
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,999
I want you so bad. Look at your skin.
No, no, no.

2039
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,559
Oh, my God, your fucking
skin is glowing.

2040
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,399
No, no, no.
Baby, your fucking skin is glowing.

2041
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,199
We're not gonna go all the
way until we do it for real.

2042
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,599
I want to do it now.
Remember, we agreed on that.

2043
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,119
That's what we agreed
on, all right?

2044
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,959
So we're not gonna
do that, all right?

2045
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,879
All right?
Where are you?

2046
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,119
I'm here.
You're acting all scary.

2047
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,319
Honey, I'm here, okay? Yeah.
Okay, are you here with me?

2048
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,010
I love you.

2049
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,959
It is real now.

2050
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,571
I just... I just said it.

2051
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,879
So now's the time.

2052
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,119
Look at me, look at me.

2053
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:14,086
I love you.

2054
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,204
I just said that.

2055
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,164
I'm in love with you.

2056
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,959
Do you want the truth? You want real?
Yeah.

2057
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,839
You want real, okay.

2058
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,639
I'm ready for real.

2059
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,526
This is real.
Do you hear my voice, huh?

2060
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,650
This is real.

2061
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,247
This is real, what you hear is real.

2062
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,479
This is real.

2063
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,011
What?

2064
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,719
This is me.
What do you mean?

2065
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,039
What, are you doing an accent?
The American accent?

2066
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,279
No, there is no English.

2067
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,608
There's only American,
there is no English.

2068
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,359
I'm not...

2069
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,999
What are you talking about?

2070
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,879
Stop it. You're Edith,
you're Edith Greensly.
No.

2071
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,519
Not royal, but you're British.
I checked your records.

2072
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,399
No, I falsified
my records back to birth.

2073
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,250
I falsified them.
I...

2074
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,722
My name is Sydney Prosser, and I'm
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

2075
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,285
I'm not Edith Greensly.
There is no Edith Greensly.

2076
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,611
You're freaking me out.

2077
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,848
No, you said in the stall

2078
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,759
that we were gonna be real

2079
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,039
and that we weren't gonna fake it.

2080
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,919
I'm being real now.

2081
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,169
This is who I am.
I'm Sydney Prosser, okay?

2082
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,279
So...

2083
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:04,405
Why did you do an English
accent after that?

2084
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,802
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you in the stall.

2085
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,679
I created Edith because I
needed her to survive, okay?

2086
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,159
But I'm done with that now.

2087
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,442
I'm so fucking done with it.

2088
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,799
All right, like, you do what
you need to survive, right?

2089
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,445
You, like...

2090
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,679
You, um, you know,
you live with your mom.

2091
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:24,279
You have a fiancée you don't
even acknowledge, right?

2092
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,079
That's what you do,
and you curl your hair

2093
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,799
in little fucking curlers,
which is...

2094
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,199
No, it's okay. You look
good with it, but...

2095
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,919
You know, you have straight hair.

2096
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,399
So that's what you do to survive.
You do all sorts of things, you know?

2097
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,840
We all do.

2098
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,969
Please don't talk about that.

2099
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,839
I'm confused.
I'm confused.

2100
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,439
I'm fucking confused,
too, all right?

2101
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,769
I think we should fuck,
and then we'll feel it,

2102
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,799
and then we won't
be confused anymore.

2103
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,479
No, I want to talk.
I don't want to fuck, okay?

2104
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,639
No. No.
I think that will be better.

2105
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,879
No.
Let's just see how we feel.

2106
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,159
No, I'm not fucking you!
I'm not fucking fucking you!

2107
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,365
Oh, shit.

2108
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,039
Oh, my God.

2109
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,679
Can you please step
away from Edith?

2110
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,119
What the...
Please, I'm asking you nicely.

2111
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,722
Please step away from Edith right now.
Come on, step away from her. Please.

2112
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,731
You mean Sydney?

2113
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,208
I told him. I'm sorry.

2114
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,719
I just don't give a fuck anymore.

2115
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,919
I don't give a fuck,
I don't fucking care.

2116
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,246
I don't fucking...

2117
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,679
Irving has a gun, huh?

2118
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,281
What Richie's got us
into is worse than jail.

2119
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,959
I told you last night,

2120
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,399
don't sit down with those goons.

2121
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,039
And what?
Now what, huh?

2122
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,159
No one's getting $10 million
for Tellegio. It's over.

2123
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,441
I don't think so.

2124
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,723
What?
What do you mean?

2125
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,559
Because when Tellegio
finds out what happened,

2126
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,759
you think he's gonna go after me?

2127
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,485
Someone from the Bureau?

2128
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,242
Or he's gonna go
after a politician?

2129
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,361
He's gonna kill you.

2130
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,608
And he's gonna go after your son

2131
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,164
and Sydney.

2132
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,559
<i>Stoddard Thorsen.</i>

2133

You got to get me the Sherman Suite.
The whole floor.

01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,964
<i>That's a no.
I said no, wacko. Jesus.</i>

2135
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,239
Then you're gonna tell me the point
of that fucking fishing story.

2136
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,759
<i>Not the way you're behaving.</i>

2137

What's the matter with you?
Where are you right now?

2138
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,279
<i>I... Why does that
make a difference?</i>

2139
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,359
Just tell me where
the fuck you are.

<i>The field office on 61st Street.</i>

I'm coming to 61st
Street right now.

<i>You're gonna do what?</i>

2143
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,839
To beat your ass.

<i>You're gonna what?</i>

2145
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,845
You were right.

2146
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,049
Should've gone away.

2147
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,759
I should've gone away with you.

2148
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,919
We were supposed to do it from the
feet up, like you always said.

2149
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,239
That's how we were meant to do it,

2150
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,919
only you didn't do it like that.

2151
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,399
You didn't do it like that.

2152
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,279
You played it safe,
so there was always a danger

2153
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,799
you were gonna end up with
Rosalyn in the dead space,

2154
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,639
floating on some dead spaceship

2155
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,922
with the furnitures
and the curtains.

2156
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,799
And I was your lifeline out,
and you were mine,

2157
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,889
and that was okay, you know?

2158
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,322
I wish I could get you back.

2159
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,806
Yeah.

2160
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,159
You know I can't do it without you.

2161
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,691
You know that.

2162
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,331
Come on.

2163
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:57,519
Me, you and Danny, like we said.

2164
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,919
Like I said.

2165
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,361
You never said that.
I said that.

2166
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,719
We got to get over
on all these guys.

2167
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,161
That's what we need to be
thinking about right now.

2168
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,806
Fuck, shit, that's, uh...

2169
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,719
That's big.

2170
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,684
That's fucking crazy.

2171
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,844
Whatever it is,

2172
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,887
it's got to be the best
we've ever done.

2173
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,444
Okay?

2174
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:49,399
"Agent DiMaso called me
late on the night of the 21st.

2175
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,759
"I believe that he was intoxicated.

2176
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,559
"He threatened me. I told
him this was inappropriate.

2177
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,082
"Procedures exist for purposes
that we must respect.

2178
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,519
"This is the third such call
I received from Agent DiMaso.

2179
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,159
"He called me again on the
night of the 5th at 2:00 a.m.,

2180
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,203
"and he threatened to kill me.

2181
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,519
"Subsequently, he
demanded that I allow him

2182
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,919
"to use the Sherman
Suite of the Plaza Hotel

2183
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:19,119
"for purposes of bribing
members of Congress."

2184
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,919
I...

2185
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,168
I am so sorry.

2186
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,439
I'm not finished.
There's a lot more.

2187
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:32,039
I have nothing but the utmost
respect for you as my mentor and...

2188
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,639
It's okay, it's okay.

2189
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,439
As my mentor and as...

2190
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,599
What are you doing?

2191
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,919
I just want to talk from my heart.

2192
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,359
I don't want to put it on record or anything.
I want to get vulnerable.

2193
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,800
Can I finish my...

2194
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,119
Can I finish my statement?
Of course, of course.

2195
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,526
That's why we're here.

2196
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,799
I respect you.

2197
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,731
I think you do other
things besides respect me.

2198
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,279
Hello.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2199
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,519
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

2200
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,006
What are you doing?

2201
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,279
It's just hard for me to control my passion.
I'm a very passionate person.

2202
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,959
We're from New York.
You understand this.

2203
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,162
He goes ice fishing in the Midwest.

2204
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,568
That was told to you in confidence.

2205
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,411
He's an ice fishing guy.
Look at him.

2206
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,359
What are you doing?

2207
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,519
It's not you, that's not
you with the gun. Stop it.

2208
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,519
No, it's me, it's me.

2209
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,639
Don't do something you don't
know anything about, all right?

2210
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,159
Wait, wait, put that...
I'll show you who gets shot.

2211
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,439
Do not load that gun!

2212
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,799
You drop that gun!

2213
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,239
I'm not even gonna hit you.

2214
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,204
Don't! Don't!
Watch this, fucko.

2215
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,005
So...

2216
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,199
You want to use the Sherman Suite?

2217
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,243
The entire floor?
Yes.

2218
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,679
Oh, God.
Of the Plaza Hotel.

2219
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,239
What happened to the Mafia?
I thought you...

2220
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,519
Yes, no, no, no, this is
where they intersect.

2221
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,879
This is where
the two things intersect.

2222
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,599
The two worlds, the
politicians and the Mafia.

2223
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,319
Victor Tellegio's people, who
run Resorts International...

2224
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,359
Wait a minute. Victor
Tellegio showed his face?

2225
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,519
Yeah, I sat with Victor Tellegio.

2226
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,599
I hung outwith him.

2227
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,999
Yeah, we can get him,

2228
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,399
we can get his whole organization,

2229
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,039
as well as getting
any number of congressmen.

2230
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,479
I mean, that's just...

2231
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,400
That's just peeling the
first layer of the onion.

2232
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,926
Wow.

2233
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,519
How you gonna do that?

2234
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:13,039
We would get $10 million, that we...
$10 million?

2235
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,399
And that's how we just let
them know we're for real.

2236
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,519
$10 million?

2237
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,919
All right, so what does he
say he's gonna do for us?

2238
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,719
How are we trapping him?
They're gonna promise

2239
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,319
to build casinos, handle the
skims, do the licensing...

2240
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,039
And you have what? You have
him on tape saying this?

2241
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,083
You have that, right?
No.

2242
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,039
I want you to find a safer way to
get Victor Tellegio on a wire.

2243
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,890
No $10 million.
That's crazy.

2244
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,759
Thank you.
Right?

2245
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,239
Even to entrap Tellegio,
it's crazy.

2246
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,559
But you can have the Sherman Suite.

2247
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,439
No, no.
Stoddard, please.

2248
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,879
To go and get me some congressmen.
Oh, my God.

2249
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,239
Go get some congressmen
taking bribes.

2250
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,879
I want to pinch us some
congressmen, okay?

2251
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,684
You come back to me,
I'm proud of you.

2252
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,520
Thank you.

2253
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,371
And Stoddard.

2254
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,679
Good luck keeping
your job, by the way,

2255
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,119
and staying out of jail, and
not being killed by the Mob,

2256
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,448
but otherwise,
you're doing a great job.

2257
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,279
What's the end of
the ice fishing story?

2258
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,959
I'm not telling you the end
of the ice fishing story!

2259
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,159
I'm gonna call your fucking brother

2260
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,679
and find out the end.
My brother's dead!

2261
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,919
That's how it ends!

2262
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,359
He fell through the fucking ice!

2263
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,087
Not, that's not... He died a
different way, many years later.

2264
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,689
Listen, I know it's
awkward, and, uh,

2265
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,681
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, all right?

2266
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,599
But I think we can stick together
and, uh, still fulfill our goal.

2267
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,799
I mean, we got the Sherman Suite.

2268
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,959
Yeah, you got the whole floor?

2269
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,559
Got the whole floor, yeah.
Whole floor?

2270
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,639
That's good.

2271
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,119
Yeah, you okay?

2272
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,839
Yeah. You?

2273
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,279
Yeah, you know, it's all right.
Just got hit a little bit.

2274
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,279
My eye is a little blurry.

2275
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,239
I got drops at the pharmacy.

2276
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,959
Uh, you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

2277
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,321
Listen, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

2278
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,011
I'm sorry.

2279
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,206
I'm sorry, Irv.

2280
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,439
You can put a camera here.

2281
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,211
Right in here, maybe,
and we get it all on film.

2282
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,799
You like it?
We do.

2283
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,919
You know what,
give me those flowers.

2284
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,999
If we put the flower vase
here, put a camera in there,

2285
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,639
and then we can get
a clear shot of the couch

2286
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,879
where we can put the congressmen.

2287
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,159
That's right.
That's the idea.

2288
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,839
And Carmine will go to jail
after he delivers us

2289
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,319
<i>congressmen soon-to-be felons.</i>

2290
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,079
We really need the help.
Please sit down.

2291
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,159
Representative O'Connell's
on the phone.

2292
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:21,204
I got to take this, you guys.
Everyone out, please.

2293
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,199
This is sad, it's just sad.

2294
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,719
Darling, please,
I got to take this.

2295
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,839
Okay, sorry, everyone out.
Go out.

2296
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:29,199
Congressman, how you doing?
It's Carmine.

2297
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,359
Everybody out, please.

2298
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,039
Tell me you're gonna
be in Trenton this week.

2299
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,799
We have an amazing
investment opportunity

2300
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,206
I'd like to discuss with you.

2301
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,679
<i>I'm Federal Agent
Richard DiMaso.</i>

2302
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,319
<i>I placed $75, 000
into this briefcase</i>

2303
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,761
<i>for Representative John O'Connell
of the Ninth District.</i>

2304
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,679
<i>Representative O'Connell was
contacted by Carmine Polito</i>

2305
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,770
<i>to ask if he could obtain rapid
citizenship through an act of Congress</i>

2306
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,759
<i>for one Sheik Abdullah,
investor.</i>

2307
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,724
How you doing? Robert Spencer.
Nice to meet you.

2308
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,399
<i>I'm excited to be here.</i>

2309
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,410
Oh, John, please, this
brings the state back.

2310
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,039
How long we known each other?

2311
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,359
You know what this
is gonna do for us?

2312
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,359
This is huge for the
state of New Jersey.

2313
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,959
Stabilizes our economy.

2314
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,119
Hotels, restaurants.

2315
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,919
Carmine sees it.
It's waiting to happen.

2316
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,519
This fucking thing
is waiting to happen.

2317
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,199
But the goddamn bankers,

2318
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,719
they're keeping their
money on the sidelines.

2319
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,919
How we supposed to
get anything done?

2320
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,599
Bankers only put money in the game

2321
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,246
when they can reap insane profit.

2322
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,119
The only problem is this, uh...

2323
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,919
This citizenship situation.

2324
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,088
I mean, we got to expedite
as soon as possible.

2325
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:32,319
Well, I'll tell you,
you came to the right place.

2326
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,439
Yeah?
You know? Yeah.

2327
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,039
- We can make it happen.
- Oh, hey.

2328
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,839
<i>This is going to happen.</i>

2329
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,319
You understand, this is real.

2330
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,399
On my family, on my kids,
on my life, on my work.

2331
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,239
I know that, Carmine.
You're a good man.

2332
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,959
<i>I'm Federal Agent
Richard DiMaso.</i>

2333
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,079
<i>I placed $75, 000
in this briefcase</i>

2334
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,681
<i>for one Representative Gerald
Sanders of the Third District.</i>

2335
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,239
I don't want to do
anything illegal.

2336
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,319
Please, Gerry, use it

2337
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,399
as a campaign donation,
whatever you want to do.

2338
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,359
All right.
Thank you. It means a lot.

2339
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,879
<i>I'm placing $60, 000
into this briefcase</i>

2340
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,199
<i>for one Congressman Eric
Keshoygan of the Fourth District.</i>

2341
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,399
I'm gonna do what
I can to help, Carmine.

2342
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,079
<i>$100,000 into this briefcase</i>

2343
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,759
<i>for two-term
United States Senator</i>

2344
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,119
<i>Horton Mitchell
of New Jersey.</i>

2345
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,479
Atlantic City.
That's right.

2346
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,284
All the way down the shore.

2347
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,599
A mecca by the sea.

2348
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,439
Carmine, you're beloved
by your people.

2349
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:22,319
Your constituency is not even
a constituency. It's your family.

2350
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,170
That's what you represent, family.

2351
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,239
<i>The one small thing
you do for this man</i>

2352
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,799
is a huge thing we do for
the people of New Jersey.

2353
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,959
This is what we can leave...

2354
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,162
Hey, Irving, what are you doing?

2355
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,601
Where you going?

2356
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:37,163
Just got to go see a man about a dog.
I'm sorry.

2357
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,919
<i>I've been a senator
a very long time. 16 years.</i>

2358
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,359
<i>Trust me, this is probably</i>

2359
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,999
<i>the biggest opportunity
that we could have here.</i>

2360
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,039
<i>I will do whatever I can
in the United States Senate.</i>

2361
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,559
<i>I appreciate this.
On my family,</i>

2362
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,366
<i>on my kids, this needs to happen.
It's got to happen.</i>

2363
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,650
<i>You have my word.</i>

2364
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,159
I want to save us, I want to
save us, I want to save Carmine.

2365
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,919
It's killing me,
it's fucking killing me.

2366
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,759
You know the only way to help
Carmine is through the Tellegio thing.

2367
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,879
Yes.

2368
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,919
It's dangerous, it's dangerous.
We got to get in there,

2369
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,280
we got to get a wire in there,
we got to make him feel safe.

2370
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,839
There's only one thing that
could really fuck this up,

2371
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,565
and that's your wife.

2372
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,725
Yeah.

2373
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,999
I don't like your husband.
You're no good together.

2374
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,770
He doesn't appreciate you.

2375
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,519
I mean, it happens,
it happened to my marriage.

2376
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,404
That's why I went to Miami.

2377
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,519
Sometimes you just got to be tough.

2378
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,610
You got to stand up and you
got to leave, you know?

2379
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,529
Sometimes you got to let something
die to let something live.

2380
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,123
You're too beautiful to be unhappy.

2381
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,839
I know.

2382
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,599
I mean, I don't want
to badmouth my husband,

2383
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:35,679
but just let me badmouth
my husband for a second.

2384
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:37,199
He just thinks that
he knows everything,

2385
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,399
and he's so full of shit.
He's such a liar.

2386
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,919
He thinks that I'm stupid,
but I'm not stupid.

2387
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,839
I hear him on the phone, arguing.

2388
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,919
He loves Carmine, but he
hates that other guy,

2389
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,122
that curly-headed
IRS guy or whatever,

2390
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:52,240
who's carting around my husband's
ex-lover, that redheaded whore.

2391
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,919
IRS?

2392
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,407
Anyway, you can see
that it drives him crazy.

2393
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,559
When you said IRS, what IRS guy?
What are you talking about?

2394
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,841
I hear them on the phone.

2395
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:04,199
I think that he's got Irv in
some sort of bind or something,

2396
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,119
and he's making him
do all of this stuff.

2397
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:09,239
And so Irv and Carmine right
now are at the Plaza Hotel,

2398
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:12,639
like, throwing all of this money
away at, like, Congress or whatever.

2399
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,399
They're giving money
to Congress or something.

2400
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,490
I don't really know, but I
overheard it on the phone.

2401
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,529
Well, I hate to do this to you.

2402
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,650
I got to go talk to your husband.

2403
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:26,845
My boss, he's already angry.

2404
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,119
You stay here.

2405
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,322
I'm gonna give you some
money for a taxi home.

2406
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,639
Have some dessert, finish
the bottle of Prosecco.

2407
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,966
I'm sorry.

2408
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,839
You all right?

2409
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,610
I don't like change.

2410
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,839
It's really hard for me.

2411
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,121
Yeah.

2412
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,759
Sometimes I think that
I'll die before I change.

2413
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,650
It's all right.

2414
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,479
It's gonna be okay.

2415
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,250
You got to come with me to Miami.

2416
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,891
Don't hurt him too bad.
He's still Danny's father.

You know where I was recently?

I was in your boyfriend's

Shut up.

What...
Shut the fuck up.

2450

What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

2453
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,759
What do you think you're doing? Huh?
Get out of here!

2454
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,799
I'm not doing anything!
Why are you talking so much?

2455
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,650
You're gonna get us
all killed! Danny.

2456
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,639
Come here, buddy.
All right.

2457
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,679
Go draw a picture
or something. All right?

2458
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,159
You are a sick son of a bitch

2459
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,519
for screaming at me like
that in front of Danny.

2460
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,159
Attaboy, all right?

2461
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,839
I'm a sick son of a bitch? You're
trying to get me fucking killed.

2462
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,799
I'm a sick son of a bitch?
Oh, my God!

2463
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,159
You drive me so fucking crazy.
What are you doing?

2464
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:39,639
Your boyfriend, your fucking
boyfriend will kill me,

2465
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,639
he will kill Danny,
and he'll kill you.

2466
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,559
Stop talking like that.
That's who you're dealing with.

2467
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,559
He's a mobster, all right?
That's who you're dealing with.

2468
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,159
What do you think you're doing?

2469
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,759
Stop, all right? Fine!
What are you doing to us?

2470
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,759
Yes, I wanted to hurt you, but
how do you think that I feel?

2471
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,679
All day when you leave
me alone, all day,

2472
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,159
and all I've ever wanted
you to do is love me.

2473
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,279
That's all I've
ever wanted is for us

2474
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,719
to stay married and
for you to love me.

2475
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,079
And that's why I'm going to Miami!

2476
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,239
You're not going to Miami.
That's why I'm going to Miami

2477
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,559
with Pete!
You're not going to Miami!

2478
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,599
You are not going to Miami!
I'm going to Miami with Pete!

2479
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,199
I finally found
somebody who loves me!

2480
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,119
Just like you've always wanted!

2481
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:16,199
Too fucking dangerous.
Miami, not now!

2482
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,039
He likes me just the way I am.
Too fucking dangerous.

2483
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,199
You're gonna stay normal. You're
gonna shut your fucking mouth.

2484
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,399
You told me that you wanted
me to find a nice, quiet man.

2485
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,519
He's the one.

2486
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,319
Oh, and what a doozy you picked.

2487
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,719
Oh, you hit that...

2488
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,359
He's the most dangerous guy ever.

2489
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,919
Well, what do you expect, Irving?

2490
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,999
I know everybody through you!

2491
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,399
Why can't you just be happy for me?

2492
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,999
Why are you taking your heart pill?
Irving, what's going on?

2493
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,970
Irving, take your pill.

2494
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:50,444
What kind of trouble are you in, Irving?
What is going on?

2495
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,239
What's happening?

2496
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,290
I got a plan.

2497
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:02,599
You got a plan?
When did you get it?

2498
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,290
You know what?

2499
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,962
It really fucking came to me

2500
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,602
when I was inside
of that canvas bag,

2501
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:17,201
with your boyfriend's
hands around my throat.

2502
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,679
Yeah, that's when
it really came to me.

2503
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,439
Take the fucking bag off his head.
We got two million...

2504
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,159
We got two million
coming this week.

2505
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:24,719
You see? Come on!
What do you think this is?

2506
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,919
You think this is a fucking
down payment plan?

2507
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,963
What, we're Sears or Chevrolet?

2508
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,731
You ask Victor

2509
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:35,799
if he wants two million this week.

2510
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,439
That's real money.
That's real money.

2511
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,039
Two million?
Two million this week.

2512
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,890
How?

2513
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,439
Wired in.

2514
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,599
Hold, hold on to the scarf.

2515
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,161
Irving, come on, you all right?

2516
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,279
That true? Is it true what
he said about your wife?

2517
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,244
It's not fucking true. That's not...
About Rosalyn?

2518
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,848
I can save all of us,
and we could save money.

2519
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:59,039
I can take care of
you and Danny, okay?

2520
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,890
But you got to close your mouth.

2521
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,159
I knew it.

2522
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,639
I have always said, Irving,

2523
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:08,003
that you are very, very hard
to motivate properly.

2524
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,919
And I knew that Pete
was gonna go over there

2525
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,559
and knock some
sense into your head.

2526
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,559
I've been reading
this book, Irving.

2527
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,491
It's by Wayne Dyer, about
the power of intention.

2528
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:22,359
And my intention in
sending Pete over to you

2529
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,679
was so that you could
come up with this plan.

2530
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:26,530
So you're welcome.

2531
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,440
Okay.

2532
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,599
Thank you, Rosalyn.
Thank you for the plan.

2533
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:36,679
You're welcome.

2534
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:39,406
I appreciate that.
So, uh...

2535
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,679
I think that we should
be partners on this.

2536
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:46,159
Yeah, I'm a good partner,
almost better than Edith.

2537
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,319
You ever think about that?

2538
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,879
You ever think about how you
might have underestimated me?

2539
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,366
So what is our plan?

2540
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,891
Tell me the plan.

2541
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,206
What are you gonna do?

2542
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,839
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut,
and I'm not gonna say anything,

2543
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,479
but what do I do if Pete calls
me, what am I supposed to say?

2544
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:03,559
You got to stop talking about
your government agencies,

2545
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,679
and your IRS and your taxes
and your conspiracies,

2546
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,879
and all of that, you're gonna
say how you were wrong.

2547
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,039
You were wrong about that.

2548
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,919
I'll tell Pete that I was wrong,

2549
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,519
but you know that in real life,

2550
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,119
I was right for
saying all that stuff

2551
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:17,200
because then that spurred on the actions
that made you come up with this plan.

2552
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,559
So I will tell Pete.
Okay.

2553
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,559
The power of intention, Irving.

2554
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,119
The power of intention.

2555
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:24,199
Thank you.

2556
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,289
Okay, Okay.

2557
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,759
You were right.
Irv?

2558
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,086
Irv?

2559
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,291
You're so smart.

2560
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,199
Good job, peaches.

2561
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:44,449
Irving, I've been
doing a lot of thinking.

2562
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,727
And you need to grow up,

2563
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,650
and you need to face the facts,

2564
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,959
and I think that both of us
will be a lot happier

2565
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,446
if we get a divorce.

2566
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,879
Okay.

2567
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,605
Just think about it.

2568
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,089
These things are never easy.

2569
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,000
All right.

2570
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,846
Irving?

2571
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,130
Good luck with your plan.

Hi. Alfonse Simone.

2591
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,439
Edith Greensly.

2592
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,039
Alfonse Simone.
Hey.

2593
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,879
Hi. Alfonse Simone.
Irving Rosenfeld.

2594
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,119
Please, uh, be seated.

2595
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,199
I appreciate the fact that
you all came in person,

2596
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,199
but, uh, the trip
was really unnecessary,

2597
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,959
because this whole thing could've been
done with a simple wire transfer.

2598
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,239
As a matter of fact,

2599
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:05,442
this is the number
of our wire right here.

2600
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,439
Where is Mr. Tellegio?

2601
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,879
Mr. Tellegio, unfortunately, was
called out of town on business.

2602
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,199
Oh, that's not good.

2603
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:17,319
You know, we were willing
to come here today in person

2604
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:19,839
to meet with Mr. Tellegio
as a sign of respect

2605
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,399
to give $2 million...
Well, listen,

2606
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,559
I can assure you that I have
the power of attorney...

2607
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:26,719
Excuse me, if you'll let me finish.
We were willing

2608
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:29,207
to give $2 million
today of the ten,

2609
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,479
but without Mr. Tellegio here...

2610
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:33,279
We can't make that decision.

2611
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,079
We can't do that?
It's not the right thing.

2612
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,726
It's just not the right time.
It's just not good.

2613
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:40,519
You don't have the authorization
to make this kind of choice,

2614
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:41,839
so don't be hasty, all right?

2615
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,239
Not being hasty.

2616
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:45,239
Just, let's be smart
about it, all right?

2617
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,283
This is not how we do
business. I'm sorry.

2618
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,439
Apologize, but it's true.

2619
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,720
I think you should
hang in there, all right?

2620
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,039
For what?
The guy's not here.

2621
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,119
Edith...
That's it.

2622
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,519
You know what?
Sorry, I can't do it.

2623
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,239
This is a surprise. The
sheik don't like surprises.

2624
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:05,599
Don't leave.

2625
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,239
Edith,

2626
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:09,159
this is not your decision to make.

2627
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,959
It's not your decision.
No, I understand, but maybe

2628
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,359
- we can call the sheik.
- What? Let's go.

2629
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,971
Let's call the sheik.

2630
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:17,679
It's not the plan.
It's not the...

2631
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:19,159
No, let's...

2632
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:20,959
I'll call the sheik, yeah.
Can I use your phone?

2633
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,799
Please do.
Let's see. I don't know if he's in,

2634
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:23,959
but I'll call the sheik.

2635
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:25,799
But before I do,
I'd like to go over,

2636
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,439
specifically, what this
money will be used for.

2637
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,559
Okay.

2638
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:32,119
What we will do is we guarantee

2639
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:35,039
all proper licenses
and construction permits

2640
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,527
for any hotel-casino

2641
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:40,079
that plans to open
before the end of the year,

2642
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,683
and we'll throw in the customary,
uh, privileges of protection.

2643
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,079
What if there's obstacles?

2644
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:48,359
What will you do?
Obstacles...

2645
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,119
We are prepared to
overcome any obstacles.

2646
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:51,239
This is a big enterprise.

2647
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:54,479
If we have to pay somebody
off, we'll pay somebody off.

2648
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,159
If we have to lean on somebody,

2649
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,519
intimidate somebody,
we'll intimidate somebody.

2650
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:01,199
We're experienced.
This is our business.

2651
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,839
That's powerful stuff.

2652
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,959
Thank you.
And I'll tell you something else.

2653
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,199
At the end of this, we'll
teach you how to skim

2654
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,959
and how to cut it up and
make some money on the side,

2655
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,039
because we invented skimming.

2656
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,119
We've been doing
it for 30 years.

2657
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,439
Thank you, thank you
for clarifying that.

2658
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,999
Okay.

2659
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,770
I'm very happy.

2660
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,843
I think that'll be
okay for the sheik.

2661
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,999
This is the sheik.

2662
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,679
<i>Mr. Tellegio is not here.</i>

2663
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:32,079
<i>It's just Mr. Alfonse Simone,
his lawyer.</i>

2664
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,039
<i>Are we still okay
to wire the money?</i>

2665
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,844
Simone can take the wire.
What's the number?

2666
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,199
<i>531...</i>

2667
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,319
531...

2668
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,039
<i>78P...</i>
78P...

2669
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,447
76.
76.

2670
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,159
The funds are transferred.

2671
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:47,249
The funds have transferred.

2672
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,610
The money's been wired.

2673
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:53,679
I think we have a deal.

2674
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:54,759
Yes, we do, sir.

2675
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,639
Pleasure doing business with you.

2676
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,639
Okay, well, thank you
very much, Mr. Simone.

2677
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,839
Well, thank you.

2678
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,359
The sheik's very excited.

2679
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,079
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other.

2680
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:05,039
Oh, I'm sure that we'll be
seeing each other very soon.

2681
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,239
Looking forward to it.

2682
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,359
Yeah, so am I.

2683
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,050
You might even get sick of me.

2684
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:10,639
Like these two.

2685
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:11,879
I don't think I'll get sick of you.

2686
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:14,082
Thank you very much.
Bye.

2687
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,489
Good-bye.
Nice meeting you.

2688
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:31,279
How did that happen?
How did that happen?

2689
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,323
I mean, how did that happen?

2690
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,119
Finally! Finally,
we're getting some respect.

2691
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,639
We're getting some respect finally!

2692
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:40,239
It's you and me!
It's...

2693
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,759
We're ambitious.
That's why.

2694
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,719
Whoa. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2695
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,359
ALFONSE
If we have to pay somebody off,

2696
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,799
<i>we'll pay somebody off.</i>

2697
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,799
<i>If we have to lean on somebody,
intimidate somebody...</i>

2698
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,599
"We'll intimidate somebody!"

2699
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:59,519
I'm kissing his boo-boos!
I'm kissing his boo-boos!

2700
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,846
Oh, come on!

2701
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:33,959
Yeah, well, I got to do it.

2702
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,959
What do you mean, there's no sheik?
What does that mean?

2703
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,810
"There's no sheik"?

2704
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,919
I want to face you like a man
because I want to be real now.

2705
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,645
All right?
Who is "they"?

2706
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:53,399
Who is "they"?
"They" is the feds.

2707
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,364
The feds?
Yeah.

2708
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,850
Irving...

2709
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,159
Look... I'm a good person.

2710
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:03,719
You're a good person.

2711
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:06,730
I've been doing this for a
long time, for 20 years.

2712
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,439
Do you think I would
have taken that money

2713
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,971
if it wasn't the right thing to do?

2714
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,799
Hey, look... Look.
Huh?

2715
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,759
You're a good person.
I know that. I know.

2716
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:17,439
But in all honesty...
You said that was the only way, Irv.

2717
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,839
You chased me, you remember?

2718
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,679
They fucking made me do it.
What's a guy to do?

2719
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:23,039
They had Syd in jail.
Whoa, whoa.

2720
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:24,559
You made me go back to the Plaza

2721
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,679
to take that money,
you piece of shit!

2722
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:28,639
I was gone!

2723
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,519
You fucking prick!
I know. I know. I know.

2724
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,799
You motherfucker!

2725
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,439
You fucking chased me,
you piece of shit!

2726
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:35,839
Carmine? Honey?

2727
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,246
I was gone! I left!

2728
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:39,879
Everything all right?
Please, Dolly, just go upstairs.

2729
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:41,799
All right, I'll go upstairs.
Take the kids and go upstairs.

2730
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:44,048
Please. Please, just go.
Of course. Of course.

2731
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:47,479
I want to make this right. I came
here because I want to make it right.

2732
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:48,841
Look at my face.

2733
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,328
You tell me that I'm lying to you

2734
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:53,719
when I say that everything I do

2735
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,526
is for the good of
the people of New Jersey.

2736
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,927
Everything I do is for them.

2737
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,039
Am I lying to you?

2738
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,163
I never had a friend
like you before.

2739
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:12,161
I used that money
for the goddamn casino.

2740
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:17,319
I got some fucking
leverage, all right?

2741
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:19,039
I can help you out.

2742
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,651
This is all shit.
It's all bullshit.

2743
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:22,919
Look at this thing.

2744
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,406
Look at this.

2745
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:29,247
Ceremonial fucking knife.
What, is this bullshit? Some toy?

2746
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:35,359
Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for you.
Yeah?

2747
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,324
We can help you out.

2748
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,199
Please get out of my house, Irving.

2749
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:43,324
Will you please leave? I'm
asking you nicely, please leave.

2750
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,488
Get out of my house. Go!

2751
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:47,759
Get out of our house!

2752
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,041
I don't wanna...

2753
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:52,490
Oh, fuck.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2754
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,559
I didn't mean for this to happen.

2755
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:55,959
You break my motherfucking heart,

2756
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:57,319
Irving,
right in front of my family.

2757
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:58,439
Go, go, go up to the bedroom.

2758
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:01,679
This is what matters to me most,
and you're crushing that.

2759
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:02,919
You're going to
take me away from them?

2760
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,239
I didn't want this to happen ever.

2761
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:05,679
Fucking son of a bitch!
Get the fuck out.

2762
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:06,959
Oh, my God! Stop!

2763
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,759
- You son of a bitch!
- Dad, stop!

2764
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:10,119
I just want to make it right.

2765
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:11,359
Just get out of my house.

2766
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,119
Look what you made me do.
Please go.

2767
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,879
I'm sorry, Carmine.
Oh, my God.

2768
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,799
I am. I'm sorry.

2769
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,559
Get out of here!
Get out!

2770
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,799
Will you just get out?

2771
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,959
Please go. Please leave.
Please leave.

2772
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,319
Oh, God. No, Carmine.

2773
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,760
What's happening?
It'll be all right.

2774
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,522
No, no.

2775
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,170
Oh, my God, no!

2776
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,999
- Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
- Irving?

2777
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:38,684
Irving, are you all right?

2778
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,839
Where are your heart pills?

2779
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:42,929
Where are your heart pills?
In the pocket. Inside.

2780
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:44,839
Here. There you go.

2781
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,405
Are you all right?

2782
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,366
Okay. Come with me.
Come on.

2783
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,005
Come on.

2784
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,079
Come on, just walk.

2785
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,805
Come on. You okay?

2786
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,450
I got to lay down.

2787
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:04,679
Okay?

2788
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,325
Just rest.

2789
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,202
You ready?
Yeah.

2790
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,525
I love you.

2791
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:56,806
Please. Come in, sit down.

2792
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:10,759
You know where our $2 million is?

2793
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:12,599
Two million?
Yeah.

2794
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,439
It's with, uh, Victor
Tellegio and Alfonse Simone.

2795
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:19,201
No, actually, it's not with Victor
Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.

2796
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,119
He fucking knows about it.

2797
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,599
It's gone missing.

2798
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:23,961
Did you know that?

2799
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:25,639
No, I knew nothing about that.

2800
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,719
Where's it gone?

2801
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,719
Well, that's interesting
that you say that, because,

2802
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,119
while you were on
your way over here,

2803
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:34,928
we got an anonymous
phone call from someone

2804
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:40,799
who said that, in exchange for
immunity for the two of you

2805
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:44,482
and a reduced
sentence for Carmine Polito,

2806
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,084
we get our $2 million back.

2807
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:50,806
That's interesting.
That's very interesting.

2808
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,039
I have no idea.
No idea?

2809
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,004
No idea what you're talking about.

2810
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:56,239
I get it.

2811
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:58,159
I understand how these
deals are made, right?

2812
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,319
See, someone has leverage.

2813
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,519
Anthony, fuck them.
Fuck them. It's over.

2814
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:02,679
I don't think so.

2815
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:04,359
We got them for wire fraud.
It's over. You're done.

2816
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,879
You're both done. You're done.
No, I don't think so.

2817
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,559
I don't think so.
Oh, you don't think so?

2818
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,764
Richard, you requested
the two million.

2819
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:13,919
And you gave Brenda
the account number.

2820
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:15,239
No, no.

2821
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:16,680
We didn't do any of that.

2822
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,931
None of it.

2823
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,841
How do we know that
you don't have the money?

2824
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,999
Am I living in a fucking
nightmare right now?

2825
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,239
I find this a little offensive.

2826
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:27,519
Really, I find this
a little offensive,

2827
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:28,679
and I don't see that
you got any sort of

2828
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:30,599
cock-solid case here at all.
- Don't let him get in your head.

2829
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:31,999
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

2830
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,319
We're dealing with
a very clever individual.

2831
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,090
Don't let him...
Richard. Richard.

2832
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,723
Think about it, all right?

2833
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,279
You got some big arrests.

2834
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:42,881
You got U.S. congressmen.
You look good.

2835
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,202
You're going to be
all over the news.

2836
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,411
You know what doesn't look good?

2837
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,849
A story about gross incompetence.

2838
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:51,719
I have a warrant for...

2839
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:54,321
Sorry, do I have the wrong office?

2840
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,879
This 701? Alfonse Simone?

2841
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:59,241
This is 701.

2842
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:02,919
My name is Roger Thigpen.
I've had this office for 25 years.

2843
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:04,531
I'm a divorce attorney.

2844
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,079
You lost $2
million of taxpayer money

2845
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:13,319
because you were confused
about the location

2846
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:16,444
and the identity of
Victor Tellegio's attorney?

2847
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,599
<i>The role of Tellegio's attorney,</i>

2848
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:21,679
<i>Alfonse Simone, was played
by our friend, Ed Malone,</i>

2849
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,759
<i>the Cold Cut
King of Long Island,</i>

2850
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,442
<i>whose party we were at
when Sydney and I first met.</i>

2851
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,530
Alfonse Simone.

2852
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:32,599
People believe what they
want to believe, Richie.

2853
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:35,439
No, because you conned me. That's
why, because you both fucking con...

2854
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,559
You got under me.
You did.

2855
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,239
You know, that, uh...

2856
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,639
That doesn't sound so good,
either, right there.

2857
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,719
You know, I mean, and I don't
know what you're talking about,

2858
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:46,279
but let's just assume you
want to go with that story.

2859
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:47,839
Really?

2860
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,999
That's the story
you want to go with?

2861
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,079
All right?

2862
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:54,409
That's what you want
the <i>New York Times</i> to hear?

2863
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:59,760
That you got conned
by the very con men

2864
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:05,761
who you forced to entrap the members
of Congress in the first place?

2865
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:07,359
That's what you want to go with?

2866
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:10,643
That doesn't sound so good
for your whole thing, does it?

2867
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:16,159
And how ironic that the ones
who were working hardest

2868
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:19,250
to get the economy
of New Jersey going,

2869
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:22,439
those are the ones
that you round up.

2870
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:23,559
And why? Why?

2871
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:26,161
Because, what, they're
the easiest to go after?

2872
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:30,089
And what about
the real bullshit artists?

2873
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:33,439
You didn't even come close
to the big leagues.

2874
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,608
Those big guys, the money men.

2875
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,599
That's what I was
trying to go after.

2876
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:42,041
I'm sorry to tell you,
you got none of them.

2877
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,687
You know, Richie,
I think, uh...

2878
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,159
We may call you as a witness,
but otherwise you're done.

2879
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:54,169
I think you better go home.

2880
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,048
- Stoddard?
- Go on home, Richard.

2881
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,999
<i>We took down some very big guys.</i>

2882
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,999
<i>Some of whom, they were
just doing business as usual,</i>

2883
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,248
<i>helping their
communities or their states,</i>

2884
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:24,608
<i>but some of them knew they
had larceny in their blood.</i>

2885
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:26,519
<i>And they even admitted it.</i>

2886
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,439
<i>But in all,
it was six congressmen,</i>

2887
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:31,608
<i>one United States senator</i>

2888
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,122
<i>and my friend, Carmine Polito.</i>

2889
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,319
<i>We gave the two million back,</i>

2890
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,888
<i>so Carmine got the reduced
sentence, 18 months.</i>

2891
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:47,889
<i>The loss of his friendship</i>

2892
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:50,928
<i>would haunt me
for the rest of my life.</i>

2893
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,168
<i>And when
the story was written,</i>

2894
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:59,929
<i>Richard DiMaso's name
was never mentioned.</i>

2895
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,282
<i>Syd and I,
we moved in together.</i>

2896
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,559
<i>Rosalyn...</i>

2897
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,239
The car is a little dinged
up, I'm a little stiff,

2898
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:22,841
but whatever, I don't
want to talk about it.

2899
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:26,127
<i>She would always
be interesting.</i>

2900
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,079
You know, my boss knows
you did him a solid.

2901
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,159
Yes, I did.

2902
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:34,250
He never took a nickel, so they
can't get him for nothing.

2903
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,330
I was never going
to let that happen.

2904
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,485
All right.
Irv.

2905
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:46,279
I'm done with that nail finish.

2906
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,801
Bye for now.
I'll see you next weekend.

2907
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,079
Hey. Look at you.

2908
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,639
I think your mom got your nose.
Is it okay that I wipe that?

2909
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:00,127

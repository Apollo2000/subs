Terribly sorry.
What happened?

299
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:56,100
- Why are you doing this? Why?
- What?

300
00:22:56,204 --> 00:23:01,107
This is none of your business.
It's not a part of your life anymore.

301
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,609
I'll tell you
what happened.

302
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:07,273
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets.

303
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:09,907
- [Groans]
- You rolled over and there
was this good-looking guy,

304
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,986
well-groomed,
expensive watch on.

305
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,887
And you realized
this guy never makes me laugh.

306
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,551
That's it, Bud.
That's it. Aren't you clever?

307
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,958
Jesus, you're clever.
You should start your own talk show!

308
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:25,123
Ask Dr. Bud... advice to the lovelorn
from 300 fathoms.

300 meters away,
70 meters below us.

317
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:34,800
We think she slid down the wall,
and now sits here on this outcropping.

318
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:38,133
So we're gonna have to
drop straight down here.

319
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:40,729
This tell us how much radiation
we're gettin'?

320
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:46,006
- I'm not going near radiation. No way!
- Aw, Hippy, you pussy.

What good is the money?
Six months later, your dick drops off.

322
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,084
We'll take readings as we go.

323

If the reactor's
breached or the warhead's
released any radioactive debris,

These guys are running on bad coffee
and about four hours of sleep.

341
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:54,480
- Maybe you could think about
cutting them some slack.
- I can't afford slack.

342
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:57,243
Hey, you come on my rig.
You don't talk to me.

You start orderin' my people around.
It's not gonna work.

344

You got to know how to handle
these people. We got a way
of doin' things around here.

00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,089
Right now, I'm not interested
in your way of doing things.

Just get your team

- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

353

- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid-breathing system.
We just got them.

- How deep?

355
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:48,661
- Deep.
- How deep?

356
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:53,536
It's classified. Anyway, you breathe
liquid so you can't get compressed.

357
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,834
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

358
00:26:56,827 --> 00:27:00,319
- Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit.

Check this out.

He's taking the fluid
into his lungs.

369

There he goes.
There's a bit of anxiety here.

370

<i>Now he's starting to relax.
He's breathing fine.</i>

That is no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.

374

See, the fluid's harder to push in
and out than air.

Okay. All right.

Okay, now we let
the fluid drain from his lungs.

380

All right. Give her here.
Give her. Give her.

[Lindsey]
Careful.

I rigged in Little Geek's chip
the same as Big Geek.

It should take you

[Lindsey Over Radio]
You're doing fine.

1540
02:12:37,724 --> 02:12:41,785
You'd better watch out for crane
wreckage. You should be almost to it.

Forty-eight hundred feet.

Yeah.

02:12:56,543 --> 02:13:00,343
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

this when you got up this morning, huh?

One mile down.
Still grinnin'.

Ensign Monk wants to know

It hits the nervous system first.

Keep talking.
Let him hear your voice.

Okay, Bud, your depth is 8,900 feet.

It's hard for me, you know.

It's not easy
being a cast-iron bitch.

A lot of people
don't appreciate that.

you just lit up another candle

"No. See, that's me. That's me."

Well, if you remember

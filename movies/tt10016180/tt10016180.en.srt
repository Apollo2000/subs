- Yeah, it's blood.
- Good.

28
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,233
I hope they bleed to death.

29
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:24,775
It's the third time
in two months.

30
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,192
There are 47 bulbs
in the letter "G."

31
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,150
It's $3.10 a pop.

32
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,400
That's $145.70, every time.

33
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:36,108
That's an additional 13 dinners
I gotta sell just to float.

34
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,317
Are you listening to me?

35
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,442
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,817
Half our take is
from the interstate.

37
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,983
You drive by, you look up...

38
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,567
Not exactly
a Happy Meal.

39
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,775
Morning, Deke.

40
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,275
Hey, Deke.

41
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:06,858
Yes, sir.

42
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,442
You remember a punk named
JJ Kendricks?

43
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,317
Robbed the Quick Mart?

44
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,192
We've got a witness who ID'd him,
but she's getting the, uh, guilts.

45
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:19,733
All she knows for certain is that he
was wearing a really nice pair of boots.

46
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,567
Fancy stitching.

47
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,233
"Unforgettable," she says.

48
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:26,775
But Kendricks is a suspect
in a robbery down in LA.

49
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,025
Down in LA?

50
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,692
- Yeah.
- Is this headed somewhere?

51
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,358
Yeah. And so are you.

52
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:35,608
There's a prelim day after
tomorrow with a motion to dismiss.

53
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,067
You drive to LA and bring back
the bloodstained boots,

54
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,692
she ID's them,
and the judge sets a trial date.

55
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,525
The blood, they definitely
ran the ABO on the blood?

56
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,400
That's correct.

57
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:48,275
Then that means this
is a DA problem, Captain, not ours.

58
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,817
Oh, no, it's our problem.

59
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,858
No evidence, no conviction.

60
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,442
I got nobody else.

61
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:57,983
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:28,858
Don't look at me like that. You the
one been gone for the last two weeks.

63
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,233
Ah...

64
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,358
I'll see you tonight.

65
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,233
I'm, uh, here to pick up
seized evidence.

66
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:47,775
Property said it was here.

67
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:49,858
Yeah.

68
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,650
Excuse you.

69
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,067
Evidence is here, but it's not
leaving without a signature.

70
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,858
- Ah.
- Uh-uh. Not yours.

71
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,442
I need authorization
from Homicide to release.

72
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,483
- There's a preliminary tomorrow.
- Not my problem.

73
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,983
Captain Farris put a lock on
this item for testing.

74
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,775
- It's already been tested.
- Don't I know it.

75
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,692
He wants it re-tested.
Become a thing.

76
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,650
So I hear.

77
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,275
Hey, look. You get me a signature
and, uh, you can walk out of here...

78
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,483
wearing the damn things
for all I care.

79
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,525
Hey. Hey.

80
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:39,733
This yours?

81
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,692
- Yeah, unhook it.
- You blocked me in.

82
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,317
Why didn't you just
ask me to move it?

83
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,900
'Cause I don't have time.
You want special treatment?

84
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,525
Go back to Kern County.

85
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,775
Unhook it.

86
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,942
...all-hands-on-deck
approach to this case.

87
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,233
To these cases.

88
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:01,900
Our city, our communities,
our citizens,

89
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,900
and above all else...

90
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:06,025
these innocent victims
deserve no less.

91
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:09,025
I don't know how many
times I need to tell you, man.

92
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:12,358
Take it out of the file.
Please.

93
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,317
...is that we're asking
for your help.

94
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,067
If anyone has seen
or heard from anyone

95
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,192
that might somehow
be related to these cases...

96
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,442
Carl.

97
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:32,775
I see Brother Love's...

98
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:35,900
salvation show's
still in operation.

99
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,233
Everybody needs a little faith.
Even you.

100
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:43,442
Got yourself a new disciple.

101
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,400
Great detective,
great guy.

102
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:48,108
You should listen in,
you might learn something on both counts.

103
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,650
- Anyway...
- The lab called.

104
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,275
Are you leaving town
when you're done?

105
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,900
- You wanna take me to dinner?
- Want you out of here.

106
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,275
They'll run the test
first thing in the morning

107
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:56,150
and if there's no match,
you're gone.

108
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,025
Tomorrow's no good.
My CO told me...

109
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,608
Ah, I called your CO.

110
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,942
He says you should hang
until the tests are complete,

111
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,650
deliver the evidence tomorrow.

112
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,025
Okay?

113
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,942
Good to see you, Captain.

114
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,608
Look at it this way...

115
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,942
give you a chance to visit all
those friends you left behind.

116
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:20,400
Who says that bad guys don't
return to the scene of the crime?

117
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,192
How's it feel
to be back in uniform?

118
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,775
Still padding your overtime,
Rogers?

119
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,108
- Ooh. That's, uh, Sergeant Rogers now, Deke. Yes.
- Sergeant Rogers?

120
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,858
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

121
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:30,900
Hmm.

122
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,025
Your phone's ringing.

123
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,067
Yeah, I know.

124
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,400
We are being meticulous
and methodical in our efforts.

125
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:39,275
Sergeant Rogers.
Yeah, but what did he say?

126
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,317
...and we are in the process of
evaluating and prioritizing leads...

127
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,567
- Nice to see you, Deke.
- Good to see you, too.

128
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,108
...and gathering
additional evidence.

129
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,275
I can assure you all,
we are taking a 24/7,

130
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,275
all-hands-on-deck approach
to this case.

131
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:54,483
These cases.

132
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:57,650
Questions.

133
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:01,650
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but what I'm hearing is

134
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,358
after two months
and four victims,

135
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:05,900
you don't have a suspect.

136
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:09,608
None that I can discuss.

137
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:14,108
<i>Four dead girls, Jimmy.</i>

138
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:17,608
We haven't been under this much
scrutiny since the Night Stalker.

139
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:19,900
There's talk.

140
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:23,400
Sheriff hinted that we might wanna
reach out to the feds for help.

141
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,275
- Are you kidding me?
- Some point.

142
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:27,567
Some point, Jimmy.
Not today.

143
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,192
Deke?

144
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,692
Son of a bitch.

145
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,317
- The man, the myth, the legend.
- Hey, Sal.

146
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
You still hanging around?

147
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:39,650
No rest for the ugly.

148
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,025
What are you doing here?

149
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,733
Eh, don't ask, don't tell.

150
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,192
I'm just going across the
street, let me buy you a cup.

151
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,775
Come on,
what's one cup of coffee?

152
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:47,858
All right.

153
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:50,858
Yeah.

154
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,025
Who is that, talking to Sal?

155
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,233
Kern County patrol dep.

156
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:56,900
That's Joe Deacon.

157
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,567
You're kidding.

158
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,067
No.

159
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,858
They're
a bunch of nancies.

160
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,400
End of shift, I gotta beg for
somebody to grab a beer with.

161
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,067
They got no soul,
these new guys.

162
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,733
They weeded all the heart
out of the place.

163
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:14,483
But then, you know that
better than anybody.

164
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,067
- Hey, Sarge.
- Sal.

165
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,358
- You know Joe Deacon?
- Get what you came for?

166
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,358
I will.

167
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,108
You got nothing better to do than
to bust my balls in the meantime?

168
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,567
Nothing personal.
Deke busts everybody's balls.

169
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,275
You wanna bullshit
John Q. Public

170
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,650
into thinking that
the worst is behind us,

171
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,608
that's your business,
until the next time,

172
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:32,942
but, hey,
it's your shift, right?

173
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,567
Yeah, it is.

174
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:38,150
I hear you're a good cop.

175
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,733
I hear things, too.

176
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,525
He is a good cop, Deke.
College boy,

177
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:49,275
bit of a Holy Roller, but, hey, I've
been thinking about joining them myself.

178
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,733
Get on the fast track
for a promotion.

179
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,358
Sal, we're up.

180
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,817
You wanna stay with me
and the wife tonight?

181
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,525
Ah, nope.
Thank you, though.

182
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,192
- Good to see you, Deke.
- Good to see you, too, brother.

183
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,775
Why don't you
ride over with me?

184
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,858
Maybe you can even
give me a few pointers.

185
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:29,858
Everybody outside, nobody in.
Dollar to a dime, it's a decomp.

186
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,025
Baxter. 362071.
What's everybody waiting around for?

187
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,525
Power's off
inside the victim's building.

188
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,442
- You call Edison?
- They're working on it now.

189
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,483
You been inside?

190
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,067
- How big's the place?
- Two-room efficiency.

191
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,650
Due to the victim's
body position,

192
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,650
access is through the adjacent
apartment's fire escape.

193
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,025
We got generators on the truck.

194
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:48,483
Nah, let's let
the wazoo boys go to work.

195
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,400
You wanna superglue
the whole apartment?

196
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,692
Why not? We're dead in the water
until the power comes back on.

197
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:00,942
- You familiar with all of this?
- No.

198
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:04,567
Things probably changed a lot
since you left.

199
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,775
Still gotta catch him, right?

200
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,567
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

201
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,817
Not that much
has changed, then.

202
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,608
Anybody want some menthol?

203
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,900
Everyone eat?

204
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:07,983
All right.

205
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,858
Lights off.

206
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:38,608
Holy shit!

207
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,275
<i>♪ Don't watch it
Don't watch it ♪</i>

208
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>♪ Don't watch TV Don't
watch it Don't watch it ♪</i>

209
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,983
Arterial wound...

210
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,608
stab wound, body cavity.

211
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:55,733
Another stab wound.

212
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:58,442
She crawled to here...

213
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,483
all the way to here.

214
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,733
This is where she died.

215
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:06,358
So, why is she there?

216
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,400
They lift prints
from this window?

217
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:12,442
Hey, Jimmy,
they dust that ledge yet?

218
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,942
Get me the first officer.

219
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,108
Still making house calls,
eh, Flo?

220
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,108
Oh, good Lord.

221
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,858
- You in town for a while?
- No.

222
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,775
Stick around till I'm finished.

223
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,942
Okay.

224
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,817
Joe Deacon, meet Julie Brock.

225
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,067
Julie's 5'4", a buck 20,
and hails from Manhattan, Kansas.

226
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,483
This job sucks.

227
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,025
Hey.

228
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,983
Our killer exited the same way
we came in.

229
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:51,525
It's your responsibility to secure and protect
the premises from anyone who might spoil it.

230
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:56,525
From the moment she expired to the
time I cuff whoever did this...

231
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,775
we work for her.

232
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:00,233
- Yes, sir.
- Get out of here.

233
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,817
It's starting
to look a lot like Illinois.

234
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
- It's Michigan.
- Cut it out.

235
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,525
This been dusted?

236
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,025
Yeah, but it's broken.
Stuff's rotten.

237
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,150
Not all of it.

238
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:14,317
Hey.

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,358
When's your boy, Columbo,
gonna break my case for me?

240
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,608
Deke's got his own style.

241
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,233
We're still
processing out that room.

242
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,358
What do you got, Flo?

243
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,650
She assumed room temperature
two or three days ago.

244
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,442
- We'll know more when we take her in.
- Lean her forward.

245
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:38,317
Check the closets.

246
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,150
Postmortem lividity.

247
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,650
She was moved.

248
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:48,692
All right, canvass the block,
knock on every door, quiz every hooker.

249
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:52,025
Find out Julie's habits,
friends, suitors, enemies.

250
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,150
They get anything
across the alley?

251
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:57,150
They lifted a print, tested stains
on the floor for semen, all negative.

252
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,192
Pull files on any known
sex offenders in the area.

253
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:03,525
Peeping Toms, neighborhood
arrests, transients included.

254
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,483
Lean on the lab for prints,
all right?

255
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,400
- Mm-hmm.
- Jamie, lean on 'em.

256
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,525
Okay.

257
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,275
Awfully quiet
back there, Kojak.

258
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,983
Am I missing something?

259
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,817
Any of the other girls
have bites?

260
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,233
Carrie Holland.

261
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,025
One of 'em. Why?

262
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,692
Similar to a case up north,
that's all.

263
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,192
Deacon.

264
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,317
Yeah?

265
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,192
Sal says you're here overnight.

266
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:37,775
How about you buy me breakfast?

267
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:39,067
Why would I wanna do that?

268
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,567
All right, I'll buy.

269
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,192
Nick's, 0800.

270
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,317
If I'm still here.

271
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:34,817
Go again on Wednesday?

272
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,983
Yeah, sure. I'll run you home.

273
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,358
Three blocks. I'll be fine.

274
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,775
- Night.
- Bye.

275
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,192
<i>Yeah,
surprised the DA, too.</i>

276
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:34,900
<i>She made a second-degree offer.</i>

277
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:36,858
Kendricks copped a plea.

278
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,567
What about
the unforgettable boots?

279
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,775
<i>Forget 'em. Don't need 'em.
Neither will Kendricks.</i>

280
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,067
Not where he's going.

281
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,067
- <i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
- All right.

282
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:45,692
Morning.

283
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:47,442
- Morning.
- Look, I know it was you

284
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:50,983
spotted the observatory
across the street last night.

285
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,692
Might have missed that one
without you.

286
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:54,567
You're welcome.

287
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,400
- When you leaving?
- Right now.

288
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:59,233
Oh, that's a shame.
I got something you might wanna sit in on.

289
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:02,192
He got picked up twice for peeping
in the victim's neighborhood.

290
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:04,233
Sheet says he's a KSO.

291
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,567
Stan Peters.

292
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,858
Picked up this morning
on a Ramey warrant.

293
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:09,275
Letting him stew a bit.

294
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:12,025
He wants a mouthpiece.

295
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:13,858
You might wanna stay.

296
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:17,400
Nice boots.

297
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,942
Hi, Stan. Jim.

298
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:42,025
- Where's my lawyer?
- In the building.

299
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,608
Takes a while.

300
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,275
A girl from
your neighborhood...

301
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,733
dead.

302
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:15,192
And you,
a known sex offender...

303
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:18,150
I was taking a piss
and I was in the alley.

304
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,608
You had your dick out.

305
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,483
- This girl...
- Teenage girl, Stan.

306
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:23,858
She was just walking by.

307
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,317
You gotta believe me.

308
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,525
I want to.

309
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,650
I got nothing to do with this.

310
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:39,858
Yeah.

311
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,817
What can you tell me
about Mary Roberts?

312
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:53,108
What?

313
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:56,108
Mary Roberts.

314
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,733
<i>Mary Roberts,
Stan Peters?</i>

315
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:35,275
Dead girl, suspect.

316
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:36,775
Was he your boy?

317
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:39,650
You never know.
Just saying hello to an old pal.

318
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,942
Well, your old pal says
you broke his jaw once.

319
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,733
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs
to find your prince.

320
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:46,150
What are you
still doing here?

321
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:47,608
Just leaving.

322
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,983
Order up the poor boy
on a Mary Roberts.

323
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,775
I'm going for a sandwich.
You want one?

324
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:57,858
Nah, I'm good.

325
00:25:57,942 --> 00:25:59,233
The Rathbuns are waiting.

326
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,233
Missing person.

327
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:02,775
Yeah, they think
their daughter Ronda's a stat.

328
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:04,358
We got a corpse?

329
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,733
Then it's still
Missing Persons.

330
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:24,317
So crazy, girl.
You're gonna fly out of here.

331
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:11,942
Don't you ever get tired
of looking at dead bodies?

332
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,442
I could ask you the same.

333
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,650
What's this all about, Joe?

334
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,983
Similar case up north.

335
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:27,442
- Thanks for doing this for me, Flo.
- No problem.

336
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,692
She won't see the knife
till tomorrow.

337
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,900
Well, she won't see
another knife.

338
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:40,483
General proximity, similar pattern
and depth to our other four.

339
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,983
The garbage bag was an adornment
placed on her head postmortem.

340
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,817
Maybe when the guy came back.

341
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,317
Came back?

342
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,525
Unless he was a babysitter,
he made a return trip,

343
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:53,900
moved the girl and propped her
up against the door.

344
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:55,567
Now, turn that up for me.

345
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,108
Okay.

346
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:05,400
Mm... KHRT. Love songs
of the '50s and '60s. Mm.

347
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,275
You get a dental on the bites?

348
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,525
Right. Uh...

349
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:12,358
Yeah, we did a rush on it.
Inconclusive.

350
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,817
It could be the same as we
found on the Holland girl.

351
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,483
More sucking, less biting.

352
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:20,025
Any saliva samples?

353
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,608
Funny you should ask.

354
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:23,650
I found traces of sodium
benzoate in the bites.

355
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:26,358
- What's that?
- Used in mouthwash. Toothpaste.

356
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:27,650
And check this out.

357
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:30,108
He gave her a postmortem shave.

358
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,858
Nicked her, no blood.

359
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,108
What about her D-tract?

360
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:37,275
She had one good meal
before she died.

361
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,650
Speaking of which, you hungry?

362
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,233
I'll buy if you pull up
an old file for me.

363
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:43,608
Yeah.

364
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,692
Case up north, my ass.

365
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:52,442
The fuck is going on, Joe?

366
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,108
I'll pull your file.

367
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:00,525
But if something goes wrong,
I can't be there for you again, okay?

368
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:01,942
Okay.

369
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,650
You knew him, didn't you?

370
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,067
At least, he knew you.

371
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:31,108
That's why he did that
to your face.

372
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:34,900
You let him in.

373
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,525
You thought...

374
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:39,900
"Eh...

375
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:43,775
Not my type," but...

376
00:29:45,192 --> 00:29:47,650
maybe he could be
a friend. I mean,

377
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,858
you can't get enough of them.

378
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:59,150
But then you had
that one little feeling.

379
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,067
You thought, "What if?"

380
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:05,692
But you waved it away.

381
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,025
Thought, "Ah, what the hell?

382
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:14,775
Life's too short."

383
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,983
And you were right.

384
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,692
Life is too short, Julie.

385
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:25,483
And you should've listened.

386
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,400
You should've listened to
that one little feeling, but...

387
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,900
Just like I'm listening
to you now.

388
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:38,525
You can talk to me.

389
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,817
I'm all the friend you got.

390
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:48,442
You know my take
on the world, Joe?

391
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:52,358
There's good and there's bad,

392
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:53,650
but you gotta fight.

393
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,692
Because, brother...

394
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,483
when I look in your eyes,

395
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:04,775
what I see...

396
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,108
it ain't good.

397
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,900
To remind me of what I did.

398
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,775
For what we did.

399
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:02,942
I thought
you guys were finished.

400
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:06,067
How long has this, uh,
fridge been broken?

401
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,275
I don't know. A week, maybe.

402
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,608
You're responsible for repairs?

403
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,692
Oh, are you thinking
about moving in?

404
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,567
No, ma'am.

405
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,400
I called a guy to come fix it, but, uh,
then, you know, the girl got killed.

406
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:22,483
So, suddenly,
it didn't seem so important.

407
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,650
And, I mean, look. I gotta paint the
walls and get rid of the mattress.

408
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,233
Who'd you call?

409
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:30,108
Uh, a place
around the corner.

410
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,400
AB... ABC Appliance.
Something like that. ABC Appliance.

411
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,150
And the stuff in the fridge
was already rotten?

412
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,192
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Except the milk?

413
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,775
- My kid drank it, so cuff me.
- Oh.

414
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,983
- Anything else?
- In the fridge?

415
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,400
There were a few beers. Why?

416
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:44,567
I'm gonna need it for evidence.

417
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,317
For evidence.
Yeah, okay.

418
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,233
- Coming right up.
- All righty.

419
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,067
How do you
ever get used to it?

420
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:40,108
What's that, ma'am?

421
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,567
The smell.

422
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:48,150
You know, if you're lucky,
you don't get used to it.

423
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:51,025
Here.

424
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,108
Close up when
you're done, okay?

425
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,400
I don't want any trouble.

426
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,317
I have no connection
to the girls out front.

427
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,858
- Just need a room.
- Oh.

428
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,358
$20 a night, $100 a week.

429
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,567
There are some things in there
from the last guy.

430
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,817
Just toss 'em in the hallway.

431
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,275
And don't worry,
the sheets are clean.

432
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:24,817
Hey!

433
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,900
Do you want some company?

434
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,108
- <i>Good night. I love you.</i>
- <i>Love you.</i>

435
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,192
- I love you.
- Love you.

436
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,858
- Did you say your prayers?
- Yep.

437
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:31,317
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night.

438
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,358
Good night.

439
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:34,067
- Hey.
- Mm?

440
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,900
Did you set the alarm?

441
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,025
Yeah.

442
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,983
It's never over.

443
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,525
Re-interview the immigrants
in the Brock apartment.

444
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:09,858
Jimmy.

445
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:11,817
All of 'em.

446
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,817
Close it.

447
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:20,400
- Stan Peters.
- What about him?

448
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:21,817
Killed himself last night.

449
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:24,775
That's not good.

450
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:26,108
What the hell's this got to do
with Kern County?

451
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:27,567
Deacon watched
through the glass.

452
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,067
He's got a similar case
up north.

453
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,025
It's just a little
interagency cooperation.

454
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:34,400
Guy hasn't worked a murder since
we ran him off five years ago.

455
00:37:34,483 --> 00:37:35,733
Do you know the book on him?

456
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,108
A great detective,
has a heart attack,

457
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,525
leaves town
for a post in the sticks.

458
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:40,525
The guy worked
the case so hard,

459
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,817
he got a suspension, a divorce and
a triple bypass, all in six months.

460
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,358
Complete meltdown.

461
00:37:45,442 --> 00:37:47,567
He's a rush-hour train wreck.

462
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,817
That's a tad dramatic.

463
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,525
Only good came out of it,
we got you.

464
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:51,858
What are you saying?
I took his spot?

465
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:53,608
Manner of speaking, yeah.

466
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:55,483
Piece of personal advice,
Jimmy,

467
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,275
you got a good thing
going here.

468
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,942
Don't get mixed up
with this guy.

469
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,817
What's the big deal? He's gone.

470
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,817
His CO says
he's taken vacation days.

471
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,442
- Yeah, so what?
- Does he strike you

472
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,567
as the kind of guy
that plays golf?

473
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:17,150
Employee list.

474
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,983
Repair appointment book.

475
00:38:22,525 --> 00:38:23,983
Look for yourself.

476
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,858
So, I could even
have it delivered to you tomorrow.

477
00:38:57,942 --> 00:39:00,650
All you gotta do is go out and
get some food, put it in there,

478
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:03,192
your kids are gonna be happy,
you're ready to go.

479
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,942
Excuse me a minute.

480
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,650
- What can I do for you?
- I'm Joe Deacon.

481
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:09,983
I need to see all repair orders
for the last two weeks,

482
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,858
and a list
of all your employees.

483
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,692
Thank you.

484
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:16,483
It's okay.
You're not under arrest.

485
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:18,233
Yet.

486
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:36,567
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much. Ah, this one.

487
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,692
This one's crossed out.

488
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,358
- It's a cancellation.
- Yeah?

489
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,358
That's before
I can get a man out.

490
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:42,733
And it always takes that long?

491
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:44,400
Hey, we're busy.

492
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,650
Yeah.

493
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:48,775
Yeah, I see.

494
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:50,483
And this is the list?

495
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,275
Mm...

496
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:53,942
Mm.

497
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,108
- And your name is?
- Jack.

498
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:57,442
You all right, Jack?

499
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,900
What's your last name, Jack?

500
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,192
Aboud.

501
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,067
Thank you, Jack Aboud.

502
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,733
You don't mind
if I take your list, do you?

503
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:08,858
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

504
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:18,983
Thanks, Jack.

505
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:34,942
Did you look at my print
from the Brock apartment?

506
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:36,900
It's no good
without one to compare to.

507
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:39,608
The center's missing and the computer
can't work without the center.

508
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:42,150
Look on the bright side,
the guy finally left a partial.

509
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,150
What exactly is it you guys do?

510
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:48,608
We make you look good in court.

511
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:03,275
<i>Dad!</i>

512
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:11,400
Anything else?
Jewelry, maybe?

513
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:13,442
A red barrette.

514
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:17,608
When she ran, she always used to wear
a red barrette to hold her hair back.

515
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:21,108
<i>I'm gonna find her.</i>

516
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:01,150

Jesus.

525
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,192
It's not her.

526
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,275
Really? This how you
spend your time off?

527
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:22,067
When's the last time
you saw two hoop-dees

528
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,192
and a meat wagon
going 20 miles an hour?

529
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:27,942
They didn't wanna come
any more than I did.

530
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,067
What have you got?

531
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,358
Deceased fits the MO.

532
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,525
Stab wound, ligature,
killed elsewhere.

533
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,442
- She a floater?
- Yeah.

534
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:37,025
But they dumped overflow
in here a few days back.

535
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:39,567
Guessing there's mud
in her cavities.

536
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,150
Shallow grave, most likely.

537
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:50,108
You ready to tell me
about Mary Roberts?

538
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:59,150
Your boy, Stan Peters,
swallowed a 12-gauge late last night.

539
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,400
Hey, Jimmy,
come give a look.

540
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,275
If you didn't know
any better, from up here...

541
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:37,858
you might say it's beautiful.

542
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,608
Sal told me you went to bat
for me with Farris.

543
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:46,025
It's not a wise career move.

544
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:49,025
You're not exactly
a department favorite.

545
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:50,650
Maybe I can make it up to you.

546
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:54,067
You might wanna run these names.
Couple of possibles.

547
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:59,150
They were working in appliance
stores in Julie Brock's neighborhood.

548
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,233
It's a long shot.

549
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:02,025
Aren't they all?

550
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:05,442
Thank you.

551
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:10,150
Something I gotta know.

552
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,900
How's a guy with the best
clearance rate in the department

553
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:15,817
work 15 years
without a promotion?

554
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:19,983
Maybe I didn't go
to the right church.

555
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:24,608
Hm.

556
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:33,942
Do you believe in God, Joe?

557
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,192
When I see a sunrise
or thunderstorm

558
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:41,067
or dew on the ground,
yes, I think there's a God.

559
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,692
When I see all this,
I think he's long past giving a shit.

560
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:48,983
I still owe you breakfast.

561
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:50,483
Yes, you do.

562
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:57,067
This is great.
Thank you.

563
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,525
You're welcome.

564
00:45:58,608 --> 00:46:00,108
Joe's in Kern County now.

565
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:02,483
Mm. Your wife drag you away?

566
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:04,275
I'm divorced.

567
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:07,900
Oh. Well, I'd like to get out of the
city, but Jim won't leave.

568
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:10,067
Hm.

569
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,775
You work homicide there, too?

570
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:15,983
Uh, no, ma'am. I'm just a...

571
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,858
a dep.

572
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:23,233
Hi.

573
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26,483
- Hi.
- My precious.

574
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:27,733
That's Mr. Deacon, Chloe.

575
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:28,775
How do you do?

576
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:30,358
Very well.

577
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:31,775
Do you have any kids, Joe?

578
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:35,108
Uh, two girls. They're...
they're all grown now.

579
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,942
All grown up.

580
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,775
I'm gonna be late.

581
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:41,483
- We ready to take Jen to school, baby?
- Mwah.

582
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,442
Got a parent-teacher conference
until 5:00,

583
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:46,150
so the girls are gonna stay
at Mom's until dinner.

584
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:48,108
- That's fine.
- Okay. I love you.

585
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:50,108
Where are you going?

586
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:54,108
Nice to meet you, Joe.

587
00:46:54,192 --> 00:46:57,525
Thank you.

588
00:46:57,608 --> 00:46:59,567
She's beautiful.

589
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:01,483
They all are.

590
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:02,942
Yeah.

591
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:07,483
I'll run the names on the list.
Where can I reach you?

592
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:09,317
St. Agnes.

593
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,442
I've heard of living on the beat,
but that's above and beyond.

594
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:13,983
Wanna meet after shift,
compare notes?

595
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:17,067
You may have to ask the
Reverend Captain about that.

596
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,317
It's my case.

597
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,233
You look good, Marsha.

598
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:45,192
- You too, Joe.
- Thank you.

599
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:47,692
I was just on my way to work.
If I'd known you were coming by...

600
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:49,150
Gotta get going anyway.

601
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,817
- Let me... let me grab my purse.
- Okay.

602
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:58,192
House looks good.

603
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:00,858
Glad you kept it.

604
00:48:00,942 --> 00:48:01,900
Lawn, too.

605
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:03,983
Yeah, well, Tom's a...

606
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:06,567
He's a wiz in the yard.

607
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,733
Better than me.

608
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:11,983
Well, you never really had time
for that kind of thing.

609
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,442
How are the girls?

610
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:18,483
- Good.
- Good.

611
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,442
You ought to give 'em a call.

612
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,567
Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,150
Yeah.

614
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,025
Yeah, I should.

615
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,692
You all right?

616
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:36,400
You know me.

617
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:39,317
Yeah.

618
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,942
I know you.

619
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:45,817
Well...

620
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:47,775
I gotta...

621
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,525
All right.

622
00:48:50,108 --> 00:48:51,525
Bye, Joe.

623
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:52,983
Bye, Marsha.

624
00:49:00,192 --> 00:49:04,442
Mary Roberts.
Paige Callahan, Tamara Ewing.

625
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:06,942
I only asked for Roberts.

626
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:08,525
Yeah, well,
all the victims were hookers,

627
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:10,650
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death

628
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:11,942
on the same night
in the same location.

629
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:13,108
You gotta be kidding me.

630
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,608
Yeah, I'm hilarious.

631
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,983
I never figured
you to be so hip.

632
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:26,900
Yeah, they must have...

633
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:29,483
must have changed owners.

634
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,317
You want something to drink?

635
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,317
Don't worry, I won't tell.

636
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,525
Where are you from? Originally.

637
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:41,442
The Valley.

638
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,025
Where are you from?

639
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:46,317
- Originally.
- Mississippi Valley.

640
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,817
Alabama, Birmingham.

641
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,775
Well, here's to being
from somewhere.

642
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:52,525
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

643
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:55,817
All right,
last night's victims...

644
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,900
so we got six now.

645
00:49:56,983 --> 00:49:58,442
One, Julie Brock,
never left home.

646
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:00,233
Three from the north county,
bodies dumped here.

647
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:02,483
Two from here,
bodies dumped in north county.

648
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,067
And who said
busing doesn't work?

649
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:05,650
All knifed, all gagged,
all bound,

650
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:06,858
all very organized killings.

651
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:08,692
Not a lot of wasted motion.

652
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:10,900
- So, I got a question. Why?
- Why what?

653
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:12,858
First, geography.

654
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:14,942
Yep. Guy's a shark.
If he stops, he dies.

655
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:16,900
He likes to drive.
Probably has a decent car.

656
00:50:16,983 --> 00:50:19,317
Maybe two. High mileage.

657
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,692
Can't find one
in the neighborhood, a victim,

658
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:26,025
then, uh, he goes
wherever opportunity knocks.

659
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:28,775
All right, next "why." Why the
extreme torture, then the love bites?

660
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:30,025
Turns him on.

661
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:32,150
No rape, no sodomy,

662
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,108
- no genital mutilation. Hm.
- He kills for sexual pleasure.

663
00:50:35,942 --> 00:50:37,983
Was Stan Peters our boy?

664
00:50:38,983 --> 00:50:40,858
God, I hope not.

665
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:43,692
All right, back to the living.
Our boy.

666
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:46,108
- He's got balls.
- I'll give him that.

667
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:48,233
He goes back to Julie's house,

668
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:52,233
a few days after he kills her,
moves her body, shaves her legs,

669
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:55,692
poses her, he brings beer,

670
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:58,483
milk, food. Just threw
himself a little party.

671
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:01,025
And they found partially
digested meat in her stomach.

672
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,067
But she was a vegan.
Strict vegetarian.

673
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,317
She'd never touch it.
Same as Ana. No way.

674
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,233
Not even with a knife
to her throat?

675
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,692
Nobody wants to eat alone.

676
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:09,733
Mm.

677
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,817
One last "why."

678
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,650
Why are you trying to solve
a five-year-old case

679
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:15,775
that everyone else
has forgotten about?

680
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:41,108
Farris and I were...

681
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:47,025
a couple of miles away.
We heard a call over the radio.

682
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,192
Screams reported.
Sal was first one on the scene.

683
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:57,108
No lights.

684
00:51:57,192 --> 00:52:01,567
Switching problem. Guy from Edison said
it happens once every decade or so.

685
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,692
Now, you see the woman
behind me

686
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:06,192
- over my left shoulder?
- Yeah.

687
00:52:06,275 --> 00:52:08,150
Gladys Fulcher. Spinster.

688
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,817
Sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood.

689
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,150
A pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective.

690
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,692
And what did good old
Gladys have to say?

691
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:20,150
Said she was out. She lied about it
at first out of sheer embarrassment,

692
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,275
but she came clean.

693
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:24,567
What was she embarrassed about?

694
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,525
She went on her first date in 15
years, slept at the old guy's house.

695
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:33,108
So, the night of the hat trick,
we had no lights,

696
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,400
Gladys getting boned...

697
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:39,567
two-million-to-one long shot
crossing the finish line

698
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,983
in a dead heat.

699
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:43,400
Third strike.

700
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:46,317
Drought.

701
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,192
No water, no mud, no prints.

702
00:52:52,442 --> 00:52:54,358
Ground was hard like cement.

703
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:57,817
Victims were placed
on that rock right there.

704
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,567
They were drugged elsewhere, but they
were brought here, stabbed to death.

705
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,358
Posed facing each other,

706
00:53:03,442 --> 00:53:07,983
bags over their heads, laid down,
like the rock was a table, like a...

707
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:11,192
tea party.

708
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:12,817
Where the guests fell asleep.

709
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,817
Warm. This just went down.

710
00:53:21,275 --> 00:53:23,400
And where was
your third victim?

711
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:25,567
Close by.

712
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,358
You work the evidence,
you still come up with zeros.

713
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:31,525
It's all you can do.
Happens to everybody.

714
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:36,567
Then you draw the black bean.

715
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,567
Maybe the victim looks like
a kid you picked on in school

716
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,025
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady.

717
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:46,733
Or maybe it's something else,
but whatever it is,

718
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:49,108
they're your lifelong
responsibility, Jimmy.

719
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,983
You own them.

720
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:56,442
You own them.

721
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:08,567
They're wherever they are,
and you are their angel,

722
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:15,150
trying like hell to turn the
ledger from red to black.

723
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:18,275
Word to the wise, Jimmy,
stay out of the angel business.

724
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,942
Hey.

725
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:23,317
What is it you're looking for
in all of this?

726
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:27,192
To finish the job.

727
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,692
Just like you.

728
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,192
<i>It's not the same boy.</i>

729
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,150
Guys that kill pros
are a different breed

730
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,025
than the ones
that go after solid citizens.

731
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:42,483
Yeah, nobody's that good
out of the block.

732
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:44,608
This boy practiced his trade
somewhere before.

733
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:46,025
Well, it can't be the same guy.

734
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:48,858
He's a shark, remember?
He stops, he dies.

735
00:54:48,942 --> 00:54:50,608
Who said he stopped? Maybe he
just took his show on the road.

736
00:54:50,692 --> 00:54:52,067
I'm over here on the right.

737
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,983
Two of the five appliance
store employees have records.

738
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:01,608
One's 55, the other one's in his
late thirties, lives in Hollywood.

739
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,275
Both simple assaults.

740
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:04,983
It looks like a wash to me,

741
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,483
but you got all the info there.

742
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:10,775
And for the record, your hunch?
I don't think it holds water.

743
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:12,400
Then why all the interest?

744
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:15,442
You wanna clear your
conscience, that's your problem.

745
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:18,817
But you gotta solve my case to
solve yours, who am I to moan?

746
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,025
But you piss on my leg and call it
rain, we're through.

747
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:27,858
Hey, uh, what was
Julie's last supper?

748
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:32,150
It was roast beef. Why?

749
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:36,233
It's the little things
that are important, Jimmy.

750
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:38,775
It's the little things
that get you caught.

751
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,817
Can I help you?

752
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,067
I saw
the "for sale" sign.

753
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,942
That was for another car.

754
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,025
Got a lot of miles on it.
You a... you a salesman?

755
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,442
No.

756
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,108
How's the trunk space?

757
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:51,400
It's standard.

758
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:52,900
Mind if I take a look?

759
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:55,692
I'm in the market.

760
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,775
It's not for sale.

761
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:00,900
All I need to do is
take a look.

762
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:05,025
You must really like my car.

763
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:06,733
I do.

764
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:42,525
Hey, Sal, listen.

765
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:45,400
Run a DMV check
on an Albert Leonard Sparma.

766
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:47,733
Yeah, see if he's sold any cars
in the last few months.

767
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,567
Inconclusive.

768
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,983
But there are some similarities
to both Brock and Ewing.

769
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:25,067
Partial of an incisor
on Ewing's cheek.

770
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,400
What about Brock?

771
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:29,483
Partial of a bicuspid.

772
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:31,192
- Something else.
- What's that?

773
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:33,483
He's from back east.

774
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,233
Folds his slice.

775

790

You have a good night.

791
01:01:03,317 --> 01:01:07,108
We got roast beef,
we got strippers...

792
01:01:07,192 --> 01:01:09,358
Baby, you got anything
for us tonight?

793
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:11,650
We got hookers.

794
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:14,900
Damn, homie.

795
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:18,483
You don't know
how lucky y'all are.

796
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:47,275
Okay.

797
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:35,108
How's the trunk space?

798
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,817
- Baxter.
- The second girl, the ditch pitch,

799
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,317
where did you find her?

800
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,233
Couple hundred yards after 126.

801
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:03,900
- And you didn't leak it to the press?
- No.

802
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,817
You sure about that?

803
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,608
It went out over dispatch,
but it was never given to the press. Why?

804
01:05:07,692 --> 01:05:09,108
What's the nearest mile marker?

805
01:05:09,192 --> 01:05:10,317
Hang on.

806
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,775
467.

807
01:05:23,775 --> 01:05:25,775
<i>4-6-7.</i>

808
01:05:34,442 --> 01:05:37,483
There's this guy Deke asked me to
run a vehicle check on. Sparma?

809
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,858
Seems that Topanga Tow
has a car registered to him.

810
01:05:39,942 --> 01:05:41,692
Found it abandoned
two weeks ago.

811
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:42,775
Reported stolen?

812
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:43,900
No.

813
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,692
Well, tow that sucker in.

814
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,858
- Wine.
- Damn it.

815
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:57,275
Sal, what do you got?

816
01:05:57,358 --> 01:05:59,567
Clean. 22,000 miles.

817
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,358
- A rollback?
- Definitely.

818
01:06:01,442 --> 01:06:03,192
All right, keep at it.
Let me know if you find anything.

819
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:05,942
<i>Here we go.</i>

820
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:08,567
I'll take the prints.
Call the lab, tell 'em I'm on my way.

821
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:12,483
Grab Deke and a patrol dep,
pick up Sparma.

822
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:14,858
What about Tina Salvatore,
the potential witness?

823
01:06:14,942 --> 01:06:16,150
Get her a magazine.

824
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,775
What are the chances
he'll let us in?

825
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,692
Yeah. Just keep him busy,
keep him talking.

826
01:06:29,775 --> 01:06:32,525
Tell him to take his time,
change his clothes, whatever.

827
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:33,817
Match is inconclusive.

828
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,025
- Conclude it.
- Eleven identifiers.

829
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:39,067
County requires 18 for an ID,
LAPD requires 12.

830
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,775
So, we're one short of
somebody's legal requirements?

831
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:43,983
- That says something.
- It says you're seven short.

832
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:47,567
Look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't my boy.

833
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,733
This other fella...

834
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:50,525
let's call him Mr. X...

835
01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:54,233
he's got eight identifiers.
Only three less than Sparma.

836
01:06:54,317 --> 01:06:55,567
Maybe he's the killer.

837
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,858
Who?

838
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:08,233
Thank you.

839
01:07:23,942 --> 01:07:25,775
Are we ready to go?

840
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:28,858
<i>It's like
I told the police...</i>

841
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:31,150
it was dark, he was
wearing glasses, a hat...

842
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:34,567
If I showed you some photos, do you
think you'd be able to identify him?

843
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,067
Maybe.

844
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:38,775
Probably not.

845
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:41,442
Nothing. It was like
he was expecting us.

846
01:07:42,983 --> 01:07:45,942
Get her something to drink.
Keep an eye on her.

847
01:07:46,025 --> 01:07:47,608
I have to use the restroom.

848
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:50,108
Yep. Come on.

849
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:53,067
It's, uh, right over here, to your right.
I'll wait for you.

850
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,150
Hey, you got a second, Jamie?

851
01:07:55,692 --> 01:07:57,608
It's okay. I can find my way
back to your desk.

852
01:07:57,692 --> 01:07:59,067
All right,
do you want anything to drink?

853
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,275
Uh... Diet anything.

854
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:02,942
Just come straight back, okay?

855
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:06,192
- What's up?
- Thanks.

856
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:11,858
The Harvester was clean
as a whistle.

857
01:08:11,942 --> 01:08:13,942
Damn it.

858
01:08:14,025 --> 01:08:15,608
Got this off your desk.

859
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:17,400
You don't mind if I move
the table, do you?

860
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:19,108
Do your thing.

861
01:08:19,192 --> 01:08:21,275
Grab the other end.

862
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,733
All clear.

863
01:08:38,942 --> 01:08:40,483
Bring him in.

864
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:42,275
Okay, Jerry.

865
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,983
Well, what did you have to do
to get a job like this?

866
01:08:53,067 --> 01:08:54,608
Kind of a demotion, huh?

867
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:06,567
No, we're not gonna need those.

868
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,317
Where's big Dick Tracy?

869
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,025
Is he joining us for dinner?

870
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:12,483
Ow. Man...

871
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:13,608
Hello, Albert.

872
01:09:15,358 --> 01:09:16,817
I'm Detective Sergeant Baxter.

873
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,150
I know who you are.

874
01:09:18,233 --> 01:09:19,567
You're famous.

875
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,108
On television and in the papers
all the time.

876
01:09:21,192 --> 01:09:22,233
Thank you so much.

877
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:23,983
I'm kind of a crime buff.

878
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:25,900
Hm.

879
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:28,567
Well, then you know
if you're innocent,

880
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,483
you should talk to me,
clear your name.

881
01:09:36,942 --> 01:09:38,900
Is that it?

882
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:43,150
Not gonna work me over,
Mr. Clean?

883
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,358
Okay.

884
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:49,442
I invoke my Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination.

885
01:09:50,775 --> 01:09:52,692
Just kidding.

886
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,275
You should see
the look on your faces.

887
01:09:58,358 --> 01:10:00,192
Come on, it's hilarious.

888
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:02,233
But I would like my rights
waiver card.

889
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:05,567
I know I'm not
officially in custody, but...

890
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:08,233
better be safe than sorry,
huh, guys?

891
01:10:10,775 --> 01:10:12,525
Hot damn.

892
01:10:15,025 --> 01:10:16,525
This is awesome.

893
01:10:20,358 --> 01:10:21,483
Can I keep this?

894
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:22,900
No, I'm afraid not.

895
01:10:22,983 --> 01:10:25,233
No fun.

896
01:10:25,317 --> 01:10:29,400
Hey, you wanna know something?
Ernesto Miranda...

897
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:33,192
was actually guilty.

898
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:36,442
Why did you abandon
your car, Albert?

899
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:40,567
The Harvester. Had a big back end,
was good for hauling things around.

900
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:41,692
Look, Jimmy.

901
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:43,442
- Detective Baxter.
- Whatever.

902
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:46,067
Like I said, the car was stolen.
Thank you for finding it.

903
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,400
I'll drive it home.

904
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:48,650
We'll be hanging on to it
for a few days.

905
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:49,858
Well, that's not
very nice of you.

906
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:51,275
Why didn't you
report the theft?

907
01:10:51,358 --> 01:10:54,233
Well, you see,
that's the funny thing.

908
01:10:55,108 --> 01:10:56,608
I did.

909
01:10:57,692 --> 01:11:00,108
Somebody's got some
homework to do.

910
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:13,400
Mm. Cute little thing,
wasn't she?

911
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:16,150
- Who said she's dead?
- I know the drill, Jimmy.

912
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,650
But the truth is...

913
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,483
I'm not the guy.

914
01:11:21,442 --> 01:11:23,150
Besides, if you had anything...

915
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:25,775
anything at all...

916
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:27,233
I'd be under arrest...

917
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:29,108
wouldn't I?

918
01:11:29,192 --> 01:11:30,942
Do you want to be?

919
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:33,775
I wouldn't mind getting a peek at
all that evidence you say you got.

920
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:38,483
Is that for me?

921
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:41,192
You get the feeling
he's enjoying this?

922
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,483
Oh, yeah.

923
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,775
Pineapples and jalapenos,
please.

924
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:54,067
Can I come in?

925
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:01,525
Eleven more,
you can make a calendar.

926
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,817
Uh-oh.

927
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,983
Oh, hey, stranger.

928
01:12:06,067 --> 01:12:08,525
Tired of steaming up
that glass?

929
01:12:10,233 --> 01:12:11,150
Pressies?

930
01:12:11,233 --> 01:12:12,692
Oh, yeah.

931
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:22,483
This is the part where I start
feeling like it's a trap.

932
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:23,942
Open it up, find out.

933
01:12:28,775 --> 01:12:30,442
It's not a pair of mittens.

934
01:12:37,108 --> 01:12:38,817
Wow.

935
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:43,233
Go on, take a look.

936
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,650
You know you want to.

937
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:47,025
Open it, you fucking weirdo.

938
01:13:04,983 --> 01:13:07,317
Holy guacamole.

939
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,650
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

940
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:14,483
catch a dead girl by her toe.

941
01:13:16,942 --> 01:13:18,442
Oh...

942
01:13:22,525 --> 01:13:24,983
The contrast is all off.

943
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:27,942
It's no Weegee.

944
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,692
My God.

945
01:14:03,817 --> 01:14:05,608
Let me ask you a question.

946
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,817
Why is that?

947
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,817
Huh?

948
01:14:11,775 --> 01:14:13,400
Why is that?

949
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,275
Hm? Come on,
you're a smart man.

950
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:28,483
You know every exit
on the highway.

951
01:14:31,692 --> 01:14:32,692
Let me help you.

952
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:39,983
I mean it.

953
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:41,900
Why?

954
01:14:50,775 --> 01:14:53,025
Why not?

955
01:14:53,108 --> 01:14:56,483
Son of a bitch. Your dick is
as hard as Chinese arithmetic.

956
01:14:56,567 --> 01:14:57,942
- Shit.
- Son of a...

957
01:14:58,025 --> 01:14:59,692
- Deke! Hey, Deke!
- That's why.

958
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,317
- That's why.
- Back off!

959
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,942
- Why is that? Why is that?
- Deke! Hey! Whoa!

960
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:05,192
- That's what I wanna know.
- Back off.

961
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:06,567
Hey. Hey.

962
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:08,192
It's all right.
It's all right, Sal.

963
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:09,983
We know, you know...

964
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:13,108
...we got you by the balls,
small as they are.

965
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:14,733
You son of a bitch.

966
01:15:15,775 --> 01:15:17,275
You lost control.

967
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,608
Rizoli.

968
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:33,733
- Huh. Jimmy, it's your wife.
- Take a message.

969
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:51,275
What do you think?

970
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:54,233
Maybe if I could
get a better look at him.

971
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:56,817
What do you mean,
a better look?

972
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:01,525
Well, at this guy.

973
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:05,275
I mean, you have him
here in the station, right?

974
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,358
Thank you, Tina.

975
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,567
<i>Look, I'm sorry.
What about a lineup?</i>

976
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,983
We've got no cause.

977
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:27,067
I mean, the ID is
tainted beyond repair.

978
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,567
She saw him in cuffs,
for God's sake.

979
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,108
<i>I told you.
I warned you.</i>

980
01:16:31,192 --> 01:16:32,150
<i>I take the heat.</i>

981
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:33,608
- I'm the primary.
- For now.

982
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:35,442
What the hell does that mean?

983
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:39,025
It means I got six bodies, no
witnesses, no evidence, no killer.

984
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:41,525
Two guys questioned,
and why are they suspects?

985
01:16:41,608 --> 01:16:43,942
One, who later sucks
on a 12-gauge,

986
01:16:44,025 --> 01:16:45,317
for malicious unzipping.

987
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,150
The other, for carrying
a concealed hard-on.

988
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:49,817
- What do you want the DA to do?
- He was visualizing the crime.

989
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:51,692
His crime.

990
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,025
Well, sheriff's calling
in the feds.

991
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,650
They got a guy
coming in on Monday.

992
01:16:54,733 --> 01:16:57,192
That point, we back off,
we revamp.

993
01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:01,067
- Revamp?
- They take charge.

994
01:17:03,192 --> 01:17:05,275
Hey, uh, one more thing.

995
01:17:05,358 --> 01:17:10,025
Were you aware Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

996
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:11,400
Guy walks in...

997
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,858
and we spent ten hours
going over the thing.

998
01:17:14,942 --> 01:17:19,275
He signs a confession.
Next morning, we had to cut him loose.

999
01:17:19,358 --> 01:17:20,858
- Why?
- He was lying.

1000
01:17:20,942 --> 01:17:22,317
I mean,
he knew all the details,

1001
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,067
but he wasn't within
ten miles of the killing.

1002
01:17:28,817 --> 01:17:30,692
Still got two days, right, Cap?

1003
01:17:32,317 --> 01:17:34,108
Hey, what is it with
you and Deke?

1004
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:37,150
You wanna be the one that finds
him after his next heart attack?

1005
01:17:37,233 --> 01:17:39,192
It's his destiny,
don't make it yours.

1006
01:17:50,192 --> 01:17:51,775
Deacon.

1007
01:18:25,942 --> 01:18:27,192
Boo.

1008
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:38,817
What is... what is all this?

1009
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:47,358
The past becomes the future,
becomes the past...

1010
01:18:47,442 --> 01:18:50,108
becomes the future,
becomes the past, becomes the...

1011
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,442
- Hey. Look at me.
- Becomes the future.

1012
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:53,900
This is sick.

1013
01:18:53,983 --> 01:18:56,067
- You need to get some help.
- Don't point fingers.

1014
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,692
I know all the symptoms.

1015
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,192
Congratulations.
We got a suspect.

1016
01:19:03,275 --> 01:19:04,525
Oh, we do, do we?

1017
01:19:04,608 --> 01:19:06,233
Yeah.

1018
01:19:06,317 --> 01:19:07,650
Are you aware that Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

1019
01:19:07,733 --> 01:19:09,275
So what?

1020
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:11,817
He walked in, jerked Rogers'
chain for an entire shift.

1021
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,817
He's a crime buff,
he said so himself.

1022
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,525
Walk-in confessors
aren't killers.

1023
01:19:15,608 --> 01:19:17,108
We don't have shit!

1024
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:19,025
You got the same ache
in your gut as I do, don't you?

1025
01:19:19,108 --> 01:19:21,317
We got something,
we just don't know what it is.

1026
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,567
If I can get in Sparma's apartment
for just five minutes, I know...

1027
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,067
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

1028
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,233
...like I'm standing
in front of you.

1029
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:29,233
I know.

1030
01:19:29,317 --> 01:19:30,733
Know what?

1031
01:19:30,817 --> 01:19:34,108
I know that the answer is
inside Sparma's place. I know.

1032
01:19:37,608 --> 01:19:39,775
Let me ask you something,
Jimmy.

1033
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,275
What do you want?

1034
01:19:44,358 --> 01:19:45,733
I wanna nail the bastard.

1035
01:19:45,817 --> 01:19:46,775
For who?

1036
01:19:46,858 --> 01:19:49,483
For all of the girls he killed.

1037
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:54,025
And for Ronda Rathbun,
wherever she is.

1038
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:56,817
Well, I wanna
nail the bastard, too.

1039
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,858
Difference is...

1040
01:20:00,483 --> 01:20:02,400
I'm doing it for me.

1041
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:07,150
Just five minutes, Jimmy.

1042
01:20:08,233 --> 01:20:09,817
Please.

1043
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,983
<i>I'm sorry
about what happened today,</i>

1044
01:20:12,067 --> 01:20:14,650
<i>and I'd like to
make it up to you in person.</i>

1045
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:19,400
Meet me at Pike's,
near your place, on the bully.

1046
01:20:19,483 --> 01:20:21,900
<i>That the place
with potato skins?</i>

1047
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:38,692
We'll see.

1048
01:20:59,108 --> 01:21:01,983
He comes back,
I'll hit the horn twice.

1049
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:10,900
<i>7-0, respond.</i>

1050
01:22:10,983 --> 01:22:12,442
<i>Code seven, Fifth and Main.</i>

1051
01:23:09,942 --> 01:23:11,275
<i>Hey, you got a phone?</i>

1052
01:23:11,358 --> 01:23:12,650
Yeah.

1053
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:14,400
It's local.

1054
01:23:16,775 --> 01:23:18,942
And a Shirley Temple to go.

1055
01:24:49,442 --> 01:24:50,442
<i>Officer down.</i>

1056
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:52,775
<i>Repeat, officer down.</i>

1057
01:24:52,858 --> 01:24:56,025
<i>10929 San Marina Street.</i>

1058
01:24:56,108 --> 01:24:58,192
<i>Repeat, officer down.</i>

1059
01:25:28,025 --> 01:25:29,900
LAPD, open up!

1060
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:32,483
Going right.

1061
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:34,817
Hey!

1062
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,483
LA Sheriff. What's going on?

1063
01:25:36,567 --> 01:25:38,108
There's an officer down.
Two guys inside now.

1064
01:25:38,192 --> 01:25:39,900
Hey, hey, hey.
All respect, Detective,

1065
01:25:39,983 --> 01:25:42,317
your jurisdiction doesn't start
for another 20 blocks. Move.

1066
01:25:57,442 --> 01:26:00,525
- <i>Sheriff's.</i>
- Baxter. 362071.

1067
01:26:00,608 --> 01:26:02,067
<i>How can I help you?</i>

1068
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:05,775
<i>Detective Baxter.</i>

1069
01:26:06,483 --> 01:26:07,650
<i>Detective...</i>

1070
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:08,942
- Bathroom's clear.
- Clear.

1071
01:27:00,358 --> 01:27:02,317
Sparma called in
an "officer down."

1072
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,692
Wily son of a bitch.

1073
01:27:03,775 --> 01:27:05,275
Wily enough to keep his
apartment clean?

1074
01:27:05,358 --> 01:27:08,608
He's got a box full of
knickknacks and souvenirs.

1075
01:27:08,692 --> 01:27:10,233
By any chance,
did you see a red barrette?

1076
01:27:10,317 --> 01:27:11,817
- Red barrette?
- Yeah.

1077
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,567
Ronda Rathbun was wearing one
when she disappeared.

1078
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,317
You give me five more minutes,
I can find out for you.

1079
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:34,442
All right, bad news first.

1080
01:27:34,525 --> 01:27:39,400
Sparma did file a stolen on the wagon.
Rogers neglected to file.

1081
01:27:39,483 --> 01:27:40,983
The good...

1082
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:44,442
Sparma left town less than
six weeks after your murders.

1083
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:45,650
Where'd he go?

1084
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:47,275
Detroit.

1085
01:27:48,275 --> 01:27:50,025
Any unsolved bodies up there?

1086
01:27:50,108 --> 01:27:51,775
Detroit?

1087
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:55,608
Right.

1088
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:57,775
He knows we're here.
He knows we're watching him.

1089
01:27:57,858 --> 01:27:58,900
Good.

1090
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:01,567
I want him to know.

1091
01:28:07,858 --> 01:28:10,483
Do you ever wonder...

1092
01:28:10,567 --> 01:28:14,275
that maybe, just maybe,
it's a waste of time?

1093
01:28:14,358 --> 01:28:17,483
All this sitting, waiting...

1094
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:22,442
watching, spending your life
in another man's shadow.

1095
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:28,108
One, wherever he goes,
I mark it for search warrants.

1096
01:28:28,192 --> 01:28:31,983
Two, he tries it again,
I catch him in the act.

1097
01:28:32,067 --> 01:28:35,275
Three, when I'm with him...

1098
01:28:35,358 --> 01:28:36,733
nobody dies.

1099
01:28:37,567 --> 01:28:38,900
Nobody dies on my watch.

1100
01:28:38,983 --> 01:28:40,150
How long is your watch?

1101
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:45,275
As long as it fucking takes.

1102
01:28:56,983 --> 01:28:58,900
What's he doing?

1103
01:29:00,775 --> 01:29:03,608
How can you listen to these
sappy love songs all day long?

1104
01:29:03,692 --> 01:29:06,692
Reminds me of being 16
in the backseat of my car...

1105
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:09,358
with Marsha McConnell.

1106
01:29:10,817 --> 01:29:13,233
Guy's got a car,
why's he taking the bus?

1107
01:29:13,317 --> 01:29:15,192
<i>♪ I will follow him ♪</i>

1108
01:29:15,275 --> 01:29:20,150
<i>♪ Follow him
wherever he may go ♪</i>

1109
01:29:20,233 --> 01:29:24,108
<i>♪ There isn't
an ocean too deep ♪</i>

1110
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:31,067
<i>♪ A mountain so high
it can keep me away ♪</i>

1111
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:34,525
<i>♪ I must follow him ♪</i>

1112
01:29:34,608 --> 01:29:39,358
<i>♪ Ever since he touched
my hand I knew ♪</i>

1113
01:29:42,233 --> 01:29:44,067
This is fucking comical.

1114
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,525
We're running out of sand,
this guy's taking public transportation.

1115
01:29:46,608 --> 01:29:47,692
You run this place?

1116
01:29:47,775 --> 01:29:49,900
Yeah. No connection.

1117
01:31:02,525 --> 01:31:04,608
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Ah, fuck!

1118
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,233
Hey, you all right?

1119
01:31:07,317 --> 01:31:08,525
I'm all right.

1120
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:10,733
Okay.

1121
01:31:12,275 --> 01:31:13,817
Mm-hmm.

1122
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:16,483
We work the case.
That's all we can do, is work the case.

1123
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:18,483
It's like fishing.

1124
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:21,817
You can go days without a strike,
then all of a sudden, bang, you get one.

1125
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,317
I'm fucking dying here, Deke.

1126
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,858
Okay. Why don't you go home,

1127
01:31:24,942 --> 01:31:26,108
I'll put him to bed.

1128
01:31:26,192 --> 01:31:28,275
- Fuck you.
- There you go.

1129
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,900
That's what I expected.

1130
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,775
You think they got watch
batteries down there?

1131
01:31:52,358 --> 01:31:53,858
Mm.

1132
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:56,358
All right, I'm gonna go down there.
So, you want anything?

1133
01:31:56,442 --> 01:31:57,858
Black coffee.

1134
01:31:57,942 --> 01:31:58,858
All right.

1135
01:33:12,275 --> 01:33:14,108
- Hello?
- Boo.

1136
01:33:15,608 --> 01:33:18,233
Get your hands in the air!

1137
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:19,692
- Now!
- Okay, okay.

1138
01:33:19,775 --> 01:33:21,150
Do it now! Up against the gate.

1139
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:22,567
<i>♪ 8-6-7-5-3-0-9 ♪</i>

1140
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:24,150
Move!

1141
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:26,150
- Move!
- Okay.

1142
01:33:27,233 --> 01:33:28,275
Is this right? This...

1143
01:33:28,358 --> 01:33:30,317
- Forward!
- Okay. Fine.

1144
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,192
Hands on your head!

1145
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:36,608
Interlace your fingers.

1146
01:33:36,692 --> 01:33:37,650
Excuse me?

1147
01:33:37,733 --> 01:33:39,775
Interlace your fingers.

1148
01:33:39,858 --> 01:33:41,067
Oh. Um...

1149
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:43,942
That sounds complicated. Mm.

1150
01:33:44,025 --> 01:33:46,192
Point your fingers to the sky.

1151
01:33:46,275 --> 01:33:47,983
Now!

1152
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:50,483
- Spread your legs.
- Thought you'd never ask.

1153
01:33:57,567 --> 01:33:59,650
- Where is she?
- Oh.

1154
01:33:59,733 --> 01:34:03,733
The original. How did you wrangle
that, Mr. Fancy Pants?

1155
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:11,358
Where is she?

1156
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:17,650
You don't wanna know.

1157
01:34:19,275 --> 01:34:20,817
Not really.

1158
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,400
Okay, okay.

1159
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:24,817
Okay.

1160
01:34:25,733 --> 01:34:27,400
You win.

1161
01:34:29,608 --> 01:34:31,150
I'll take you to her.

1162
01:34:31,233 --> 01:34:33,608
Would you like that?

1163
01:34:33,692 --> 01:34:34,983
Jeez.

1164
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,150
Are you coming?

1165
01:34:41,233 --> 01:34:45,358
You got some serious anger issues, Jimmy.
You know that?

1166
01:34:46,275 --> 01:34:47,942
You almost cracked my rib.

1167
01:34:53,775 --> 01:34:56,192
40, 50...

1168
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,942
60, 70...

1169
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:22,900
Come on.

1170
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,400
I won't bite.

1171
01:35:25,483 --> 01:35:28,650
Get in.
We've got a drive ahead of us.

1172
01:35:28,733 --> 01:35:31,567
And I've gotta work tomorrow.

1173
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:34,900
You already felt me up.
You're armed, I'm not.

1174
01:35:34,983 --> 01:35:37,483
What are you so scared of,
little boy?

1175
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:51,025
Oh, PS, your buttbuddy's
not invited.

1176
01:36:07,067 --> 01:36:07,983
Buckle up.

1177
01:36:08,067 --> 01:36:09,692
Safety first.

1178
01:37:04,192 --> 01:37:07,108
You know,
you're not very good company.

1179
01:37:23,817 --> 01:37:25,692
Where exactly is it
we're going?

1180
01:37:26,483 --> 01:37:28,900
Ronda Rathbun?

1181
01:37:47,608 --> 01:37:50,150
You know,
you and I are a lot alike.

1182
01:37:52,775 --> 01:37:55,358
In another lifetime...

1183
01:37:55,442 --> 01:37:56,983
uh, we could be friends.

1184
01:37:57,067 --> 01:37:58,650
Isn't that crazy?

1185
01:38:35,317 --> 01:38:38,067
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

1186
01:39:25,692 --> 01:39:27,233
You mind?

1187
01:40:54,483 --> 01:40:56,567
I knew a guy
who had a hunting lease here.

1188
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:57,900
And we got the moon tonight.

1189
01:40:57,983 --> 01:41:00,067
Cut the bullshit. Where is she?

1190
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:01,358
All business.

1191
01:41:02,817 --> 01:41:04,567
You start walking that way.

1192
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:06,442
Hm.

1193
01:41:06,525 --> 01:41:08,775
I'm a man of my word, Jimmy.

1194
01:41:13,858 --> 01:41:15,233
Chilly.

1195
01:41:15,317 --> 01:41:17,567
Uh...

1196
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:18,567
Colder.

1197
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,233
No, no. Cold.

1198
01:41:20,317 --> 01:41:23,358
God, you're really terrible
at this, you know that?

1199
01:41:23,442 --> 01:41:26,067
Let me give you a hint.

1200
01:41:26,150 --> 01:41:28,400
That way.

1201
01:41:29,275 --> 01:41:30,067
Okay.

1202
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:32,400
Uh-uh. Warm.

1203
01:41:32,483 --> 01:41:34,108
Warmer.

1204
01:41:34,192 --> 01:41:36,108
Hot. Hotter.

1205
01:41:36,192 --> 01:41:37,192
Hottest.

1206
01:41:39,317 --> 01:41:40,983
Bingo.

1207
01:41:43,608 --> 01:41:46,358
Now look down at the ground
and say...

1208
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:50,192
"Hello, Ronda."

1209
01:42:01,483 --> 01:42:02,858
You're gonna need this.

1210
01:42:08,275 --> 01:42:09,525
You dig.

1211
01:42:09,608 --> 01:42:11,108
The devil's
in the details, Jimmy.

1212
01:42:11,192 --> 01:42:13,442
Witnesses, physical evidence.

1213
01:42:13,525 --> 01:42:16,358
You'd have to get rid of
my body, get rid of my car.

1214
01:42:16,442 --> 01:42:18,275
It's a lot to consider.

1215
01:42:21,483 --> 01:42:22,442
Besides...

1216
01:42:25,567 --> 01:42:27,733
it's a peace offering.

1217
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,067
Okay.

1218
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:12,817
Oh, you're gonna kill me.

1219
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,817
Uh...

1220
01:43:16,442 --> 01:43:18,442
Oh, poop.

1221
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,025
I think I made a boo-boo.

1222
01:43:21,108 --> 01:43:25,483
Yeah. Come to think of it,
this doesn't look that familiar.

1223
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:27,650
But this one over here...

1224
01:43:29,692 --> 01:43:32,192
this looks very promising.

1225
01:43:35,525 --> 01:43:36,858
Yeah, that's it.

1226
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:38,025
What did you say?

1227
01:43:38,108 --> 01:43:39,400
Um...

1228
01:43:39,942 --> 01:43:41,608
"Poop."

1229
01:43:41,692 --> 01:43:45,525
Then,
"This one is more promising."

1230
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:52,775
It's not like
I have a fucking treasure map.

1231
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:05,692
I keep digging,
you keep talking.

1232
01:44:31,858 --> 01:44:34,275
X marks the spot.

1233
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,358
Third time's the charm.

1234
01:44:42,692 --> 01:44:45,108
It's like the cereal aisle.

1235
01:44:52,692 --> 01:44:54,733
You want the truth?

1236
01:44:59,317 --> 01:45:02,192
I've never killed anybody
in my entire life.

1237
01:45:05,192 --> 01:45:07,817
If you believe me, we can get in the
car and we can drive straight home.

1238
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,067
Maybe even stop for tacos.

1239
01:45:11,483 --> 01:45:12,900
If not...

1240
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:48,233
That's it.

1241
01:45:49,775 --> 01:45:51,733
Not too much longer now.

1242
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:07,983
What are you, five, six deep,
and no end in sight?

1243
01:46:13,108 --> 01:46:14,775
Oh...

1244
01:46:14,858 --> 01:46:17,192
I forgot to tell you.

1245
01:46:17,275 --> 01:46:19,192
I've seen a picture
of your family.

1246
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:24,900
You should've stayed out
of the public eye, Jimmy.

1247
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:29,858
You and your ego.

1248
01:46:31,817 --> 01:46:34,525
I mean, what kind of
a father are you?

1249
01:46:35,942 --> 01:46:38,067
How can you protect
those two beautiful daughters

1250
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:41,400
when you can't even
begin to help one...

1251
01:46:41,483 --> 01:46:44,442
of those poor girls
or their families?

1252
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:49,650
You're insignificant.

1253
01:46:50,858 --> 01:46:52,233
You don't matter.

1254
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:57,233
And this will go on
and on and on.

1255
01:46:59,317 --> 01:47:00,942
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1256
01:47:19,442 --> 01:47:22,608
Hey. Hey. Hey, get up.

1257
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,358
Get up, man.

1258
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,400
Get up!

1259
01:47:31,483 --> 01:47:32,858
Get up!

1260
01:48:27,025 --> 01:48:29,317
- Deke, what is it?
- Quiet.

1261
01:48:34,692 --> 01:48:35,775
Oh.

1262
01:48:38,817 --> 01:48:40,900
Oh, shit.

1263
01:48:40,983 --> 01:48:43,358
<i>The past becomes the
future, becomes the past...</i>

1264
01:48:43,442 --> 01:48:44,858
<i>becomes the future...</i>

1265
01:48:44,942 --> 01:48:47,483
<i>becomes the past,
becomes the future...</i>

1266
01:48:47,567 --> 01:48:49,567
<i>becomes the future.</i>

1267
01:49:13,233 --> 01:49:14,942
It was him.

1268
01:49:16,775 --> 01:49:19,108
We got him. He was our boy.

1269
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:24,150
He was our boy.
He as much as told me.

1270
01:49:24,233 --> 01:49:25,983
Nothing you can do
about it now.

1271
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:28,358
We gotta call somebody.

1272
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:33,442
What am I gonna say?

1273
01:49:35,858 --> 01:49:37,692
What am I gonna do?

1274
01:49:37,775 --> 01:49:40,275
Nothing. You're not gonna say
anything, you're not gonna do anything.

1275
01:49:40,358 --> 01:49:42,233
You're gonna find a hole,
stick him in it.

1276
01:49:42,317 --> 01:49:45,858
Pick one at least four feet deep.
I'll be back in a few hours.

1277
01:50:30,358 --> 01:50:31,817
What'd she say, man?

1278
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,442
What's up with homeboy
there?

1279
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:40,733
Hey.

1280
01:53:08,025 --> 01:53:09,942
He was our boy, Deke.
I'm sure he was our boy.

1281
01:53:10,025 --> 01:53:12,567
Nobody's gonna give a damn.
I've taken care of it.

1282
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:14,650
So, listen...

1283
01:53:14,733 --> 01:53:16,983
you go back,

1284
01:53:17,067 --> 01:53:21,150
you tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash,

1285
01:53:21,233 --> 01:53:23,067
and that you need a break.

1286
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:28,150
A couple of weeks. You tell him
I left town Saturday,

1287
01:53:28,233 --> 01:53:29,358
and you went home.

1288
01:53:30,442 --> 01:53:32,525
Are you listening to me?

1289
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,733
He's dead.

1290
01:53:36,817 --> 01:53:38,650
He's forgotten.
He's rotting in the ground

1291
01:53:38,733 --> 01:53:41,442
and the only way he's gonna come
back is if you let him come back.

1292
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:44,650
Don't you ever go back to his
place,

1293
01:53:44,733 --> 01:53:47,817
don't you ever let his name
cross your lips,

1294
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:50,525
don't you ever pull his file,
'cause if you do...

1295
01:53:50,608 --> 01:53:54,400
he'll rise up out of that
ground. He'll do you in.

1296
01:53:57,275 --> 01:53:59,817
It's the little things, Jimmy.

1297
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,942
It's the little things
that rip you apart,

1298
01:54:02,025 --> 01:54:03,400
it's the little things that...

1299
01:54:04,442 --> 01:54:06,567
get you caught.

1300
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,442
That's my boy.

1301
01:54:39,858 --> 01:54:41,525
He was...

1302
01:54:44,317 --> 01:54:45,442
Joe...

1303
01:54:58,275 --> 01:54:59,692
<i>Sí.</i>

1304
01:55:09,483 --> 01:55:12,567
<i>And that</i> brings
to an end <i>the world as we know it.</i>

1305
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:15,483
<i>Thanks for listening
for all these many years.</i>

1306
01:55:15,567 --> 01:55:17,900
<i>It's twelve o'clock.</i>

1307
01:55:17,983 --> 01:55:20,608
<i>Straight-up noon, LA.
This is Bobby Saunders,</i>

1308
01:55:20,692 --> 01:55:23,067
<i>and I'm saying welcome
to the new KHVY,</i>

1309
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:25,525
<i>the king of talk radio,
where what you have to say...</i>

1310
01:55:36,733 --> 01:55:40,525
<i>A white male,
between the ages of 25 and 40.</i>

1311
01:55:40,608 --> 01:55:44,275
He's of above-average intelligence
and socially competent.

1312
01:55:44,358 --> 01:55:46,358
Works as a skilled laborer.

1313
01:55:46,442 --> 01:55:49,317
Probably firstborn or an only
child.

1314
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,317
<i>And he follows the crimes in</i>
the media.

1315
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:54,358
<i>He has at least one car in good
condition, possibly two,</i>

1316
01:55:54,442 --> 01:55:56,942
<i>and he has a propensity
for changing jobs.</i>

1317
01:55:57,025 --> 01:56:00,025
<i>Picking up,
leaving at a moment's notice.</i>

1318
01:56:00,108 --> 01:56:02,608
<i>That, ladies and gentlemen,
is the guy we're looking for.</i>

1319
01:56:02,692 --> 01:56:04,483
What about the leads we're
following?

1320
01:56:04,567 --> 01:56:07,150
I think it's safe to say we're
at square one on this operation.

1321
01:56:07,233 --> 01:56:08,983
But I can promise you this.

1322
01:56:09,067 --> 01:56:10,983
We'll get the bastard.

1323
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:28,442
- Ana.
- Hey, Sal.

1324
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:30,900
Come in.

1325
01:56:30,983 --> 01:56:32,900
Thanks. I gotta get going.

1326
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,942
You okay?

1327
01:56:36,733 --> 01:56:39,942
Yeah. Well...

1328
01:56:40,025 --> 01:56:42,525
We miss him already. Uh...

1329
01:56:42,608 --> 01:56:43,858
Joe Deacon gave me this.

1330
01:56:43,942 --> 01:56:45,900
Said it was for Jimmy.

1331
01:56:49,608 --> 01:56:50,525
Thanks.

1332
01:56:50,608 --> 01:56:51,733
Take care.

1333
01:56:51,817 --> 01:56:53,233
You too.

1334
01:56:53,317 --> 01:56:54,858
Thanks, Sal.

1335
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:01,275
<i>You know I love you, Dad.</i>
<i>But go away?</i>

1336
01:57:01,358 --> 01:57:03,942
<i>You're always around
when I don't need you.</i>

1337
01:57:28,525 --> 01:57:31,150
Sal brought this by.

1338
01:57:31,233 --> 01:57:34,067
He said it was from Joe Deacon.

1339
02:00:05,733 --> 02:00:08,067
Cause of death, multiple stab
wounds.

1340
02:00:09,442 --> 02:00:11,400
That's what I'm putting down.

1341

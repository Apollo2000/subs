<i>Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh.</i>

<i>Oh! Oh, yeah.</i>

00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,842
I came to pray with your daddy.
Where is he at?

9
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:29,909
He's busy.

10
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,845
I'm gonna take care of this one.

11
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:33,614
<i>But I made it clear to God</i>

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,648
<i>it wasn't my pussy
I was selling.</i>

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,120
<i>And I learned it young.</i>

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,357
Right through this door.

15
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:45,628
Amen.

16
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:48,730
Bring me back some gum.

17
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:57,371
<i>My name is Wednesday.</i>

18
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:59,273
<i>Everybody in the Bronx
call me Win for short.</i>

19
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,673
- Hey, are you winning?
- I always do.

20
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:01,742
Are you winning?

21
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:02,745
I always do.

22
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:06,947
Finish up, Win,
so we can get back

23
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:08,415
to this math homework,
all right?

24
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:09,816
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,821
I'll take that. Mm.

26
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,588
All right, let's see
what you did.

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,623
<i>My daddy was a pimp,</i>

28
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,225
<i>and my mama
was one of his girls.</i>

29
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,460
Good.

30
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,528
- <i>After they had me,</i>
- You're like your mama.

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,596
<i>Mama stopped tricking.</i>

32
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:23,831
Mwah.

33
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,334
<i>Daddy ain't
want nobody touching her again.</i>

34
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,668
<i>As for me...</i>

35
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,671
What are we doing, man?

36
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,737
<i>I was just one of them boys</i>

37
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,741
<i>learning the game.</i>

38
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:37,210
<i>My daddy said...</i>

39
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,346
<i>as long as I keep my eye
on the action,</i>

40
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:40,884
<i>ain't no way I lose
in this life.</i>

41
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,251
<i>I will watch niggas come and go,</i>

42
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:46,256
<i>day and night,
drunk on their pussy.</i>

43
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,389
<i>My daddy had all his girls
living in our house</i>

44
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,860
<i>so he can keep an eye
on his money.</i>

45
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:55,561
<i>Money meant love.</i>

46
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:56,165
Yeah, let's gamble
and make more shit.

47
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,564
- Here, Daddy.
- Come on.

48
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,499
Ain't no money like ho money.

49
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,769
<i>And pussy,
pussy meant power.</i>

50
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:04,938
<i>Half-dressed, half baked.</i>

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,507
<i>His girls are working hard
to pay those bills.</i>

52
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,409
<i>All I gave a fuck about
is if some nigga wanted them.</i>

53
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,578
<i>Or if their hair looked good,</i>

54
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,380
<i>and if they felt sexy
in them tight dresses.</i>

55
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:17,651
<i>I was never gonna be like
them girls in the corner.</i>

56
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:19,620
<i>And what my daddy
loved best about me...</i>

57
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:21,822
Come here. Let me show you
how to count 20's, 50's, 100's.

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,689
<i>...was that I was
exactly like him.</i>

59
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,525
It's five o'clock
in the fucking morning.

60
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,628
Ain't she got
some homework to do?

61
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:31,431
Shut the fuck up, Slim.

62
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:34,835
One day she's gonna run
your motherfucking block.

63
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:36,902
You better show her
some respect now.

64
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:38,607
And maybe she'll
show you some later.

65
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:40,742
Now play cards.

66
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:44,910
Once you're in this game,

67
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,349
you're in it for life.

68
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,384
It's gonna take you for a ride.

69
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,519
And when it does...

70
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:55,588
the only thing you can to trust
is your money.

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,025
Never let a bitch get close
to your heart.

72
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:03,466
Get that for daddy.

73
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,605
Hey, yo, dawg, man, I'm sorry
about that whole thing.

74
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:12,673
Don't you think
she's a bit too young?

75
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,510
You ain't never too young
to find your way.

76
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,515
<i>When the night was over,</i>

77
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,349
<i>as the light would shine in...</i>

78
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:26,521
<i>there was only one girl
I wanted to see.</i>

79
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,625
<i>Sweet little Nikki.</i>

80
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,400
Come on out.

81
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:47,039
<i>Since the day I saw her,
I was in love.</i>

82
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,675
<i>And now that I was working
with my daddy...</i>

83
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,046
<i>I just want to buy her shit.</i>

84
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:25,581
I love you so much.

85
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:27,783
I love you, too.

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,466
Whoo! Ooh!

87
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:06,552
- He's just sleeping.
- I'm telling you...

88
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:07,653
He just fainted.

89
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,855
Mae, listen.

90
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,023
- Babe.
- Mae.

91
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,958
- Babe. Babe, wake up.
- Mae, listen to me.

92
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,560
- Mae, come on. Mae, he's gone.
- Babe. Wake up, babe.

93
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:14,761
- He's gone. He's gone, Mae.
- They can't take you!

94
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,196
Babe, why are they taking you?

95
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,863
- Come on.
- Don't take him!

96
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,865
Don't take him away!

97
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,802
- Mae, come on.
- Don't take him!

98
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,636
Listen, Mae. Come on.

99
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:24,971
<i>Just like that, he was gone.</i>

100
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:28,040
Oh, god. I got nothing.

101
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,175
This way, Mae.

102
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:31,745
<i>And I had to continue.</i>

103
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:34,747
<i>He didn't say shit
on how to play this one out.</i>

104
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:37,716
She needs you. Come on, Mae.

105
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:40,920
Come on. She needs you.
She's gonna need you.

106
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,023
She needs you.

107
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,060
What are we gonna do?

108
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,495
I don't know.

109
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,999
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

110
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,134
He said he weren't
going to leave me.

111
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,168
What are we gonna do?

112
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,971
What are we gonna do?

113
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,841
What are we gonna do?

114
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,543
Oh, my god.
What are we gonna do?

115
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,713
<i>I'm gonna look out for moms.</i>

116
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:08,148
<i>And as for Nikki...</i>

117
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,583
<i>I ain't gonna let anything
happen to her</i>

118
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:10,653
<i>as long as I'm alive.</i>

119
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:12,888
<i>These are my girls now.</i>

120
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,156
<i>I'm gonna protect them.</i>

121
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,858
<i>I'm gonna take care of them.</i>

122
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,861
<i>You know...</i>

123
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:21,763
<i>pimp shit.</i>

124
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:29,905
Come on!

125
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,649
Don't let her shoot!

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh! Yo, yo! Pass it, man!
Pass it!

127
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:53,929
Where's the ball?

128
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:57,030
- Foul!
- Hell, no!

129
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,564
My hands didn't touch you
and you know it.

130
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,100
Our ball. Check it.

131
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:02,802
Huh! You think you're all-star
or some shit?

132
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,607
Let's see you try
and get past me again.

133
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:09,511
You know what it is.

134
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,248
She thinks
she's all tough, huh.

135
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,552
Don't let her through. Come on.

136
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:19,619
Block her.

137
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:22,155
- Oh, my god!
- Yes!

138
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,290
Where are you going, player?

139
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:27,226
Yo, are you deaf?
I got money on this one.

140
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,261
Twenty-one.
Game's over.

141
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:30,329
Oh, fuck that.

142
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,501
We play until I say game over,
I ain't done yet.

143
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:34,834
Yo, you deaf?

144
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,540
Put the money down,
come get your game on.

145
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,143
Or what?

146
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:46,079
Oh, yeah, you're crazy
just like your mama...

147
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:48,281
Come on, bitch!

148
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,750
Come on!

149
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:52,851
Oh, yeah!

150
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:54,254
Get the fuck off me!

151
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,256
Oh, shit. Yeah.

152
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:57,790
Get her!

153
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,893
Fuck her up! Let her know.

154
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:00,961
Yo, yo, yo.

155
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,028
She's crazy.

156
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,798
Get the fuck back!

157
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,067
Get the fuck back!

158
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,235
Come on!

159
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:13,139
I want my fucking money!

160
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,111
When I put my hands on,
it's to throw some.

161
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:53,647
Nikki!

162
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,648
You look good
in them jeans, girl.

163
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,185
Oh, and just for you.

164
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,891
Come here and give me a kiss.

165
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,397
Does that hurt?

166
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,765
Only if you keep touching it
like that.

167
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,200
I'll be all right.

168
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,802
You got to be. 'Cause we have
some partying to do later.

169
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:18,705
Shit. That's tonight?

170
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,440
You know I got the girls
working tonight.

171
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,775
I guess it's just gonna be me
and my fly jeans,

172
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:24,146
dancing all alone.

173
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,980
Well, I ain't gonna miss that.

174
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,048
I gotta go.

175
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,948
I gotta ask
for those extra shifts.

176
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,750
- Hope you get 'em.
- Mm-hm.

177
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:33,189
You ain't worried
about money again, are you?

178
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:36,025
I got it under control.

179
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:38,827
Go get 'em.

180
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,168
Louisa! Louisa!

181
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,903
Louisa!

182
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:52,138
Get your ass up
and get poppin', baby.

183
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,972
Niggas are on our corner
right now!

184
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,140
You know, I just needed
a little sleep.

185
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,241
The baby cried all night.

186
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:57,309
I made that clear to you

187
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:58,711
when you were changing diapers
under the bridge.

188
00:09:58,713 --> 00:09:59,580
That's your shit.

189
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:01,748
And you're responsible
for your shit.

190
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,018
But, right now...

191
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,384
tick-tock, your pussy's
on my clock. You hear me?

192
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:06,952
Get your ass up!

193
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,354
Niggas are hungry out here.

194
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,425
And it's feeding time.

195
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:12,191
You heard that, Maria?

196
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:14,760
Your sister's feeding me excuses
on why she's so damn lazy.

197
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,328
We didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

198
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,397
Like what?

199
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,032
We need new clothes
for the baby,

200
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,100
we need a phone card.

201
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:21,768
Okay. Well, I need shit, too.

202
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,969
But you bitches
be sleeping all day.

203
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,171
You ain't had no time to think
about me and what I need.

204
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,039
Ain't that right, Louisa?

205
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,241
Y'all need to bust
your ass for me,

206
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:31,945
the way I bust my ass
for you, Boricuas.

207
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,813
Just $20. For the baby.

208
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:36,816
- You gotta show up.
- Thank you.

209
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,020
Hey, you feel me?

210
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,089
For the baby.

211
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,458
Thank you.

212
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,326
- You got your phone?
- Yes.

213
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,428
Well, where the fuck is it?

214
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,733
Okay. See, this is the shit
that drives me crazy.

215
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,100
Is it charged?

216
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,235
Yes. I had it on the charger
all night.

217
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,104
Text me as soon
as you got out of a car.

218
00:10:58,106 --> 00:10:59,873
I need to know
if the corners are hot.

219
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,773
And lay off the fast food,

220
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:01,707
'cause your thighs
are getting bigger,

221
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,278
and we ain't got no money
for new clothes.

222
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:05,448
Okay, Wednesday.

223
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:37,213
When are you
gonna make it rain?

224
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:42,251
I'm gonna pay you back.

225
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:46,286
Yeah? With what money?

226
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,890
Don't you worry
about that.

227
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,925
Like I said,
I'm gonna pay you back.

228
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,495
Why are you making promises
you can't keep?

229
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:59,865
You think it's easy for me
being locked up like that?

230
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:03,235
Dirty bitches be all up
in my face making me crazy.

231
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,236
Drugs is making you crazy.

232
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,274
Don't be talking to me
like I'm some junkie.

233
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:10,076
I'm your mother,
show me some respect.

234
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,010
Yeah, you're right.
You ain't no junkie, huh?

235
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,078
'Cause junkies
don't have a place to stay

236
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,147
with food on the table.

237
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,215
You're just like
every other woman

238
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,283
spending my hard-earned money.

239
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:20,419
If you think eating cereal
for dinner is making it,

240
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:22,824
then I might as well be dead
than to live this shit.

241
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,457
Running in the street,

242
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,527
selling pussy like you got game.

243
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:30,330
All you've got

244
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,898
is a bunch of bitches
sucking dick for five dollars.

245
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,967
I thought you was going
to be bigger than that.

246
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:36,872
If it weren't for them,
your ass would still be in jail.

247
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,306
Damn ho was saying shit.

248
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,140
Let me tell you something.

249
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:48,081
Back in the day, your daddy
had me in new cars all the time.

250
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,619
Taking me out to dinner
every Saturday night.

251
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,890
What you got for me? Huh?

252
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,326
What you got?

253
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:02,461
We're still riding around
in this same shit.

254
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,465
I remember
when we bought this car.

255
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:19,245
- Get out.
- Well...

256
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,614
I sure hope there's hot water.

257
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:24,153
'Cause you could use a shower.

258
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:49,042
Oh! Hey, hi!

259
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,309
Charlie,
there's a party going on

260
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,946
and you didn't even invite me.

261
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:55,083
- Hey, Win.
- Who the fuck are these clowns?

262
00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:57,283
They live upstairs.

263
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,719
Didn't I say no boys
in the house?

264
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,523
Boys like that are gonna rob you
of your youth.

265
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:05,591
These your friends from school?

266
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:07,994
Yeah. Um, this is Kim,

267
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,595
and that's Nina.

268
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:10,933
How old are you, girls?

269
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:12,567
Eighteen.

270
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:18,674
Look, we're 16.

271
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,011
Yo, Nina, won't you, uh...

272
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,446
give homeboy here some hit.

273
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,248
Yeah. Oh, uh...

274
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,653
Charlie, you know
what the fuck's going on here?

275
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,021
Yeah.

276
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,058
You sucked dick before?

277
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,293
- You sucked dick before?
- Yeah.

278
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:43,262
Okay, then get to it.
Take it easy on him.

279
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,764
Oh, is this for real
or what?

280
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:47,200
What the fuck you thought
it was, a magic show?

281
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,735
'Cause I don't see
no fuckin' magician's anywhere.

282
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,537
All I see is a house full
of pussy.

283
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,342
Charlie,
take them to the bail room.

284
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,343
This one's on me.

285
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,089
I never sucked dick before.

286
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,360
Then this ain't for you.

287
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,029
Get the fuck out of here!

288
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,137
No more parties at this house.

289
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:34,246
Yo, I'm serious.
I was on like, the 20-yard line

290
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:35,581
with three haters
hanging off my back

291
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,051
then I just start
dragging them from me.

292
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,619
Just dragging them down
to the end zone.

293
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,321
Scored my touchdown, boom!
Sipped on my forty.

294
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:45,059
There you go! There you go.

295
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:47,295
Come and get it!

296
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:10,649
Yo-ho, girl.

297
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:13,152
Oh, oh, oh, okay!

298
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:14,620
- Look who it is.
- Yeah, yo.

299
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:16,188
Where you been, player?

300
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,590
Shit. Hustlin' like you,
Science.

301
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:19,091
You'd kill nobody, right?

302
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:21,259
Ain't none of these hoes
worth killin' by a pimp.

303
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:22,662
Your mom fuckin' up again?

304
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,429
And again, and again.

305
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,432
Ah, yeah, man, see,
all that babysitting shit

306
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:27,600
is gonna wear you out.

307
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:29,268
See, girls come
with so much shit,

308
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,769
even broke
they high maintenance.

309
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:31,837
Damn right. Shit.

310
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,105
What about you, dawg?

311
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:34,740
Chop shop's been tight.

312
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,442
You gotta see the dope shit
that just came through.

313
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,378
I rode one of them
up to this new spot over there,

314
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,645
on the north side of the Bronx,

315
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:42,115
Erotic City.

316
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,182
Hey, that's where
we're gonna go

317
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,283
and find you some, uh,
inspiration.

318
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,220
Hell, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

319
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,187
Hey, rich brothers roaming
in Maseratis.

320
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,722
They bring in girls
from all over.

321
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:52,491
That's where we're gonna find
some new pussy.

322
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:54,159
- You could hook it up?
- Get outta here. Yeah!

323
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,427
I'm gonna get us
on the guest list for Saturday.

324
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:58,630
Shit! I already got us on the
guest list for Saturday night.

325
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:00,133
Let me quarterback this one.

326
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,501
You know, united,
we could solve our problems,

327
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,303
divided, we got shit.

328
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:05,704
Now there you go
going off Farrakhan on me.

329
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:07,240
You know I don't understand
that shit?

330
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,673
Hey, what are we doing

331
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:09,775
talking shit?

332
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:11,510
Let's go talk some money
right now!

333
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,514
Damn. Now you're speaking
my language.

334
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:16,652
That's my girl.

335
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:20,653
Make us some shit!

336
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,555
- Come on, G, damn!
- God!

337
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,156
- Why are you laughing?
- 'Cause I'm about to win.

338
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:25,223
Oh, okay.

339
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,159
- Come on, G.
- What was that smile?

340
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,593
- Yeah, yeah. Kick back...
- Double back.

341
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,200
- Are we rolling?
- Give it to me.

342
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,334
Give me my money.

343
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:36,801
Yeah!

344
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:37,869
- My bad!
- Whatever.

345
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:38,938
Thank you!

346
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,906
I feel so rich. Thank you.

347
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,175
You're the man.

348
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:44,509
I wish I was hitting that hard.

349
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:46,278
Keep dreaming, yo.

350
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,946
You could never land
a girl like Nikki.

351
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,215
Well, I was all over that!

352
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:52,384
- Quit lying, dawg.
- Hell, yeah.

353
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:54,123
Yo, Nikki sucked me off, too.

354
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,622
Get out.

355
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:58,427
Was it as good
as everybody's saying?

356
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:02,662
I mean, it was all right.

357
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,596
It wasn't that tight, though.

358
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:04,631
Oh, for real?

359
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:05,464
How would you know
when you ain't seen a pussy

360
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,368
since you popped out
of your mama?

361
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,970
Sounds like y'all need
to get your money back.

362
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,371
I ain't paid her nothing.

363
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:13,573
That's the problem.

364
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,473
Y'all need to pay up.
Twenty each.

365
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,647
Man, fuck that bitch,
and fuck you.

366
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,318
Sounds like you tried,
but your pipe was too small.

367
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,820
Everything all right?

368
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,190
We're cool.

369
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:30,522
We're cool now.

370
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,325
Get the fuck outta here.

371
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,362
Fuck outta here.

372
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:35,928
Hey, what did I miss?

373
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,296
You missed shit.

374
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:38,364
We're out.

375
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,464
- It's early.
- Then I'm out.

376
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,267
I'm out of here, Science.

377
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:42,069
All right.

378
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,938
Hey.
What's wrong with you?

379
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,138
Where the hell
did you go?

380
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,407
- Are you serious right now?
- Don't play stupid with me.

381
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,675
I saw the way you was dancing
with them dudes.

382
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:51,611
We were just dancing.

383
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:52,545
Then why was they talking
about your ass

384
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,247
like they was tapping that shit
for free?

385
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,449
'Cause I got a nice ass.

386
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,384
Well, they're paying
for it, too, now.

387
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:00,653
Who gives a fuck
what they think?

388
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:01,921
Everybody knows
that we're together,

389
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,923
- and it ain't like that.
- I know!

390
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,590
Then why are you acting
like a jealous boyfriend?

391
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,359
- I'm not! It's just...
- It's just what?

392
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,362
Ah...

393
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,667
We're broke.

394
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,365
What?

395
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,967
I had to bail Ma out.

396
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,502
But that's my money, too.
Don't I get a say in that?

397
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,506
You're right.

398
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,806
I should have told you.

399
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:22,540
But I'm gonna figure it out.

400
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,309
How are we gonna make
that money back, Win?

401
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:26,615
I'm gonna get some new bitches,
and I'm gonna fix it.

402
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:34,053
Hey.

403
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,657
Let's fix this together.

404
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,357
We should have done this
a long time ago.

405
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,326
- You need me.
- You're my girl.

406
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:41,794
I don't want nobody
touching you like that.

407
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,729
Sex ain't mean shit!

408
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:46,300
As long as you got me,
ain't no one gonna break us.

409
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,704
You've seen the way
they look at me.

410
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,373
It's just business.

411
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,542
Hey, hey.

412
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,912
It's just business.

413
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:13,828
Oh, so you're just gonna leave
your mama starving again?

414
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:16,028
Nikki!

415
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,096
Just ignore it.

416
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,497
How can I ignore it?

417
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,665
I hear you whispering
up in there!

418
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,035
Yeah, get your ass up
and make your own dinner.

419
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,703
- Fucking lazy.
- Don't start, all right?

420
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:26,372
I'm not having any
of her shit tonight, okay?

421
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:27,373
I'm done playing nice.

422
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,575
Bitch, if you've got
something to say,

423
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,544
you come on out here
and you say it to my face.

424
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,078
You're just gonna lay there
and let her rip on me like that?

425
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,380
You can't let her bother you.

426
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:35,847
She just called me a bitch.

427
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,950
Ma! Go to bed!

428
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:40,553
All she does,
is lay on her ass all day.

429
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:42,958
You need to lay it down for her,
she's gonna keep us broke.

430
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:47,628
Ma.

431
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:49,665
Ma!

432
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,403
Are you serious?

433
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,439
Give me my remote back!
I'm watching my show!

434
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:01,507
No.

435
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,375
- Give me my remote back!
- No.

436
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,542
Hey!

437
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:06,545
No more TV for you tonight.

438
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:07,680
This is between family.

439
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,048
Nikki is family.

440
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,482
To who?

441
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:11,884
Girl...

442
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,986
you're stupid
to keep this bitch around.

443
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,086
She's trouble.

444
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:17,522
Her daddy was a drunk...

445
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:18,824
and her ma...

446
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:19,828
Her mama...

447
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:24,465
Her mama,
she hung herself, right?

448
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,034
Ain't that right?

449
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:29,902
I'm surprised
you ain't killed yourself.

450
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,770
- Now, you need to stop!
- No, Win.

451
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:33,571
What you want to say to me?

452
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:34,707
What you want to say?

453
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,174
You've been champing at the bit
to say something to me,

454
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,442
Come on, say it!

455
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:39,111
Fuck off!

456
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:40,913
Anybody would
wanna kill themselves

457
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:43,484
if they had to live
with a crazy bitch like you.

458
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:47,621
I'll see you in bed, baby.

459
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:55,461
You chicken shit.

460
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:58,730
Oh. Oh, tough motherfucker,
she ain't no real woman.

461
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,098
Win, she ain't no real woman.

462
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,599
Don't be fooled
by them titties and ass.

463
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,536
I'll make you some dinner.

464
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,538
Fuck that!

465
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,772
Go take her side.

466
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:09,474
Ma, don't you think there's been
enough drama for the night?

467
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:11,644
Can we just call it?
I'm tired of this shit!

468
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,711
I'm tired, too.

469
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:16,080
I'm tired of watching my child
being brainwashed

470
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:17,450
into thinking things
that ain't right.

471
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,717
What ain't right?

472
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,155
I see how you look at her.

473
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,693
She won't ever love you
like I do, Win.

474
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:29,865
She won't ever love you
like I do.

475
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:31,599
She's not.

476
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,098
She's not.

477
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,501
She can live in my house...

478
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:38,037
and she can trick your mind,

479
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,472
but she ain't gonna
ever love you like I do.

480
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:41,606
Remember that.

481
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,241
Remember your mama's words.

482
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:47,449
Nikki do love me.

483
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:14,874
Remember
to get the money up front.

484
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:15,941
Have them place it
on the dashboard,

485
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:17,076
and make sure you count it.

486
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:18,076
What did I say?

487
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:18,944
Get the money up front,
make sure they put it

488
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:21,212
- on the dashboard.
- And?

489
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:24,049
Make sure you count it,
that's important.

490
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:24,182
Okay.

491
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:26,018
Forty for a blow,
80 for 15 minutes.

492
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,019
If you only catch a blow,

493
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:27,953
tell them to keep their hands
off your body.

494
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:30,623
You got to make that clear
from the start.

495
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,760
Win, I heard you.

496
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,229
I'm gonna get us a room
over there.

497
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:03,122
When did hookers get so pretty?

498
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:04,256
Could you take
your jacket off

499
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:05,760
so I can see those tits?

500
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,598
Oh, that is nice.

501
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,267
First I want my blowjob,

502
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,938
and then, I'm going to fuck you.

503
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,306
You're in it for life.

504
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:54,809
I got you.

505
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,651
Well, get that for daddy.

506
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:08,988
Did somebody place an order
for a million dollars?

507
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,256
Uh-uh! Are those hands clean?

508
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:13,028
Fuck that. You're so beautiful.

509
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:32,938
Seven hundred
and sixty big ones.

510
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,338
Not bad for four hours.

511
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
Yeah, but that's some
world record shit right there.

512
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:38,278
I'm so glad
you liked my idea.

513
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,113
What you mean your idea?

514
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,714
Yeah, my idea.

515
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:43,849
You heard me, right?

516
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:46,317
Nothing like a real woman
to show you how it's done.

517
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,119
- Oh, real woman, huh?
- Mm-hm.

518
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,488
I guess I gotta protect
the real woman, then.

519
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,355
Mm-hm.

520
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:54,093
Hey, nigga.
What the fuck you lookin' at?

521
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,861
You see this here, hammer?

522
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:57,096
Yeah, I know my bitches are bad,

523
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,163
but if you keep staring at them
like that,

524
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,498
I'm gonna have to charge you.

525
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,834
Well, what the fuck you mean
you got no money, nigga?

526
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:02,701
Pow, pow, pow!

527
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:05,304
Yes, what the fuck
I thought, bitch.

528
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:07,338
I'd hate to mess with you.

529
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,041
Do you wanna try?

530
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:12,376
No. You know how much
I hate guns.

531
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:13,444
Oh, it ain't gonna hurt.

532
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,282
Please, Win, just put it away.

533
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,116
Can we just live here?

534
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,352
It's so much better
than your house.

535
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:21,420
As long
as I'm with you,

536
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,955
I don't care where we are.

537
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:26,157
I'm gonna get you some shit
better than this, though.

538
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,826
You know, I always wanted
to go to Florida.

539
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:29,461
Where we'll get a little place
on the beach.

540
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:31,930
- I've never been to the beach.
- Me, neither.

541
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:33,298
If we keep making money
like this,

542
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,866
we can head there by winter.

543
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,835
I've never even been on a plane.

544
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:39,137
Can you imagine
being so high up?

545
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:42,143
Pick up all the sun
as far as it takes us.

546
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:47,045
We're gonna look down
from that plane at everyone.

547
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:48,850
So they ain't looking down
on us no more.

548
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:11,138
Hey, baby.
Wanna go out?

549
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:23,015
<i>Forty to suck you off.</i>

550
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:25,017
<i>That's two hours,
set on $40 too.</i>

551
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,055
<i>My pimp is right outside.
You got it?</i>

552
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,461
So, how'd we do
last night?

553
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:38,462
Just a couple
of blowjobs

554
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:40,499
and an extra 20 someone gave me
to lick my ass.

555
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,468
I don't want nobody putting
their mouths on my curves.

556
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,369
I'm sorry, well,
it won't happen again.

557
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,538
I don't want you catching shit.

558
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,105
'Cause then,
you're no good to me.

559
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,508
If a dude asks you
to stick some shit in,

560
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,242
then they ain't right
in the mind.

561
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,184
All right.

562
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:25,243
Whoo-hoo.

563
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:26,380
Kill 'em little mother...

564
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:34,886
- This? Whatever.
- I'm hungry.

565
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:36,121
I'm hungry too.

566
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:37,890
- Ooh.
- Oh, no. Fifty. Fifty!

567
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:39,892
That's mine. That's mine, bitch!

568
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,159
- What did you do?
- Snap.

569
00:29:41,161 --> 00:29:43,261
Good goin'.

570
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:45,564
Hey, Maria.
For the baby.

571
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,232
Look, bitch.

572
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,535
Oh, you got nothing
at me.

573
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:58,111
Wednesday.

574
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:03,582
Ooh, love. It's okay.

575
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,401
Uh-huh.

576
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,271
All right. All right.

577
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:39,550
Who was that guy?

578
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:42,019
Just somebody I know.
We were just catching up.

579
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:43,355
I've been
at the house waiting on you.

580
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:45,022
You was late. I had shit to do.

581
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,657
Like what? I ain't
ever seen that car before.

582
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:47,896
Bye.

583
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:50,162
Who was he?

584
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,229
Go away!

585
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:52,267
Do you owe him money?

586
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,969
You sucking him off for ice?

587
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:58,135
Answer me!

588
00:30:58,137 --> 00:30:59,371
You don't trust me?

589
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:00,372
I wanna trust you, Ma.

590
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,410
So just open up the door
and let me talk to you.

591
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,410
The last ho
that got up here was hot.

592
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:40,045
You really overhyped it.

593
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,313
You overhyped this shit.

594
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:43,080
We're in the Bronx, y'all!

595
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:45,483
Are we ready
for the hottest girl

596
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,586
in fucking town?

597
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:50,388
I know you'll put
your own money on here.

598
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,156
Put your dongs together...

599
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:53,592
That's some shit, man.

600
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:54,759
...for Destiny!

601
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,410
We need to find you
a girl like that.

602
00:34:02,755 --> 00:34:04,524
Did you know you gonna be
dancing for me tonight?

603
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:07,791
Saw you lookin' at me.

604
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:09,196
Did you like it?

605
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:13,265
- Yeah.
- Turn around.

606
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,912
I've never danced for anybody
who looks at me the way you do.

607
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:29,550
'Cause there ain't nobody
like me.

608
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:32,484
You are so sure

609
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,218
of yourself, aren't you?

610
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,189
If I wasn't would you be
so turned on right now?

611
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:50,334
You got a price tag
for those eyes?

612
00:34:50,336 --> 00:34:51,470
Maybe.

613
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:53,374
How about
the way you're lookin' at me?

614
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:55,906
Oh, that's extra.

615
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,875
Smart girl.

616
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,611
You know your worth.

617
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:01,245
So what you doing wasting
your energy in a club

618
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:03,247
when you could be doing
bigger things with me?

619
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:04,784
Well, you haven't asked me yet.

620
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:09,486
What else
could you do?

621
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:10,925
I don't think you can handle it.

622
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,593
Close your eyes and show me.

623
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:07,979
Man, she could be illegal
she's so damn fine.

624
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,714
She got these niggas hypnotized.

625
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:13,017
You got your ass hypnotized,
nigga.

626
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:15,386
Yo dawg, our girl over here
sounds pussy-whipped.

627
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:16,453
I ain't pussy-whipped.

628
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:17,622
I'm thinkin'
about that business.

629
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:20,325
I mean for real. How much
you think she pull a night?

630
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:21,993
Can't keep up
with a hoe like that.

631
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:24,296
Looked like she was falling
in love with me tonight, though.

632
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:26,798
Well, you're right, though.
I saw the way

633
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,899
she would clock at you.

634
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,133
- Right, bruh.
- My daddy told me

635
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:31,636
that dreams are for free but
the hustle's sold separately.

636
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:33,772
That ass right there,
that's my future.

637
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:37,741
Forget it.

638
00:36:37,743 --> 00:36:39,009
All right, all right. I guess,

639
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:40,178
that sounded a little
pussy-whipped.

640
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,546
Just saying, I saw your face
when her ass was up there,

641
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:43,915
and you was like...

642
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,417
I did not!

643
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:46,551
- Hell, yeah.
- No.

644
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:48,586
You're all just jealous
'cause she was looking at me.

645
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:54,926
Beat that. Look.

646
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:56,998
I got 50 bones...

647
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,564
Wednesday's the man.

648
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:01,098
Oh, yo. No, nah.

649
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,935
I got a hundred.
Say's you can't beat that.

650
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:04,939
Oh, yeah?

651
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:10,040
Woo-hoo!

652
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,776
Pay up, player.

653
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:13,078
- Pay up. All right, shit.
- Fuck that.

654
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,446
Hold on.

655
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:15,616
All right.

656
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,917
Hey, what's up. Who is this?

657
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,054
<i>It's Destiny.</i>

658
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:21,953
From the club.

659
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:24,756
Oh, Destiny from the club.

660
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:27,859
Oh, girl. So glad you called.
I've been thinking 'bout you.

661
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:28,993
That's because you snuck off

662
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:31,031
without letting me
finish my dance.

663
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:34,064
I bet you're wondering
how it ends.

664
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,066
<i>Glad you could read my mind.</i>

665
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:37,267
Where you at?

666
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:40,604
<i>Meet me at this hotel,
tomorrow night at ten.</i>

667
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:41,908
I'll text you the address.

668
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:48,613
Gonna take one for the team.

669
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:50,615
Whoo! My motherfuckin' hero.

670
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:51,783
- Aah!
- Ah, damn.

671
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:52,651
Money!

672
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:54,586
Oh, you ain't taking shit
pulling up

673
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:55,919
in that broke-ass Dodge.

674
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:56,921
Oh, shit. You don't...

675
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:58,723
You think she gonna see
what I'm pulling up in?

676
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:01,792
Hey! Don't worry, sis.
I got you.

677
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:03,595
- What's this nigga talk about?
- Watch it.

678
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:08,799
Oh, shit!

679
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,167
- Hell yeah!
- That's it.

680
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:12,703
Just got 'em. Plates is clean.

681
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:14,638
When Destiny see you pull up
in this shit,

682
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,345
she gonna know she fucking
with a real player.

683
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,910
S'love.

684
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:21,546
Oh, lotto. Can we check
the goods, too?

685
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:23,180
You know it's not a good look
to have your,

686
00:38:23,182 --> 00:38:25,183
your boys running
the streets hungry.

687
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,919
Every nigga I know is starving
even if he already ate.

688
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:30,187
What a man gotta do to get
a little breakfast up in here?

689
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:31,890
When a man find out,
let me know.

690
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,558
I'm hungry, too.

691
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,625
Holla!

692
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:45,071
Oh, there she go.

693
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:53,511
After tonight.

694
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:55,113
What the fuck are they doing
in my car?

695
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,551
I'm putting them to work.

696
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:02,220
They need a little training
so I need you to teach them

697
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:03,488
a thang or two.

698
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,658
Oh, yeah? Like what?

699
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:08,026
I don't know. Like...

700
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,727
How I like my dick sucked.

701
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:10,794
Fuck you.

702
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:13,997
So you can just get rid of them
or I'm fucking gone.

703
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:15,902
You need to lose
that attitude.

704
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:18,638
This is work.

705
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:22,573
I need you to teach them

706
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,075
how things go around here.

707
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:26,180
I'm thinking there's only room
for one at the top.

708
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,250
Dude, they're fucking wearing
my shit...

709
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,730
You need to check yourself.

710
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,100
I think you're the one
who needs checking.

711
00:39:49,102 --> 00:39:51,803
You haven't even given me
my money from last month.

712
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:52,906
Where the fuck is it?

713
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,573
Are you spending it
on these hoes?

714
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:58,877
You want me to prove how much
I love you

715
00:39:58,879 --> 00:39:59,944
and there's only you?

716
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:01,879
Well, I'll shoot one
of these bitches right now.

717
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:03,580
They don't mean shit to me.

718
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:04,883
Fuck you, Kenny.
You're all talk.

719
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:06,584
Okay? Put the fucking gun down.

720
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:07,921
Maybe I shoot them both.

721
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:09,821
Is it gonna be Blondie?

722
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,122
Oh, shit.

723
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:12,756
Oh, my god.

724
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:13,793
Or Chocolate Love?

725
00:40:15,294 --> 00:40:16,361
Pick one.

726
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:18,595
- Or I'll shoot them both.
- Oh, my god.

727
00:40:18,597 --> 00:40:20,064
I'll shoot you both.

728
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:22,566
- Please.
- Oh, god! He's gonna kill us.

729
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,667
- Call it.
- He's gonna kill us.

730
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:25,069
Put the fucking gun down,
Kenny.

731
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:26,970
- Blondie?
- Oh, my god.

732
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:27,971
Chocolate Love?

733
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:30,107
- What is he doing?
- Put the fucking gun down.

734
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:31,975
Okay? You're fucking
scaring them.

735
00:40:31,977 --> 00:40:33,176
After all this time,

736
00:40:33,178 --> 00:40:35,747
you don't understand
how much you mean to me?

737
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,250
No, no! Please.

738
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:40,551
He's gonna shoot us!

739
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:42,287
Oh, no. Not you, Blondie.

740
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:43,754
You're way hotter
than Chocolate Love.

741
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,756
- Fucking stop!
- No, no, no!

742
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:47,225
No!

743
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,930
- No!
- You're fucking crazy!

744
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:00,738
- Fucking out of here!
- Oh, no.

745
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,272
I love you.

746
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:04,110
Don't make me put you down.

747
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:35,675
Oh, stop eyeballing me like
I won't bash your head in.

748
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:42,116
Pull your panty to the side.

749
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,028
Here we go.

750
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,832
You don't mean shit
to me.

751
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:07,640
Hey, baby.
How much for that ass?

752
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:14,812
Sweet ride. Man!

753
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:17,180
It's fully loaded,
complete with tires.

754
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,049
You know
what else it got?

755
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:19,984
Heated seats for my girl

756
00:42:19,986 --> 00:42:22,220
and the best sound system
in the Bronx!

757
00:42:22,222 --> 00:42:24,055
Every time you kick it
with Science,

758
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:25,890
you start talking
this VIP bullshit.

759
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:26,957
- We can't afford this.
- Look.

760
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:27,892
I know it's gonna sound crazy,

761
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:29,694
but when an opportunity
comes in knocking,

762
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:31,863
which it never does,
you gotta grab it.

763
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:33,964
And last night,
I grabbed it hard.

764
00:42:33,966 --> 00:42:35,232
What do you mean?

765
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:37,435
I ended up pulling the sickest
bitch from the club last night.

766
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:39,703
And I mean dudes was draping
their lifesavers on her.

767
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:41,305
But she only had her eyes
for me.

768
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:42,807
So I brought me a private dance,

769
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:43,875
tipped her a hundred bucks

770
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:45,308
with my number on it
and then, bam!

771
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,743
She hit on you?

772
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:48,845
'Cause if she did,
I'm gonna fuck a bitch up.

773
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,314
She didn't have to.

774
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:51,448
I was already on it.

775
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,153
So that's where you were
last night, huh?

776
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:55,021
I'mma kill you.

777
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,087
You think I'd put our dreams

778
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:58,258
in the hands of just some bitch?

779
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:02,093
I ain't gonna let you down.

780
00:43:02,095 --> 00:43:03,129
You better not.

781
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,934
And let me hear the sound system
up in here.

782
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,366
Man!

783
00:43:09,468 --> 00:43:11,703
- Hey, damn.
- Oh, oh, hey.

784
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:13,337
Hey, hey, hey.

785
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:14,404
Hey, hey.

786
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:35,896
I'll be right out.

787
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:51,776
This belong to me.

788
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:53,511
It's my ass now. You got that?

789
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:55,178
That's a lot of ass.

790
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,948
You gotta show me
you can handle it.

791
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,283
Ain't nobody gonna touch it
unless they speak to me.

792
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:00,450
I'mma protect it.

793
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:02,155
And I'mma use it
to make us some money.

794
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:05,758
Just tell me how
we're gonna sell this hot shit.

795
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:09,160
I got a phonebook
full of numbers

796
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:11,129
with your name on it.

797
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:13,096
You just gotta tell me
where to work it.

798
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,491
I don't know
about this but that's...

799
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:46,196
That's where we're goin'.

800
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:47,265
Okay. See you later.

801
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,899
- He's in here?
- We saw him.

802
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,834
Best quarterback
the Giants ever had.

803
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:52,203
Nigga, I'm telling you,
every dick-sucking hoe

804
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:53,270
in the Bronx is on!

805
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:55,272
So, so how much are we talking?

806
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:56,908
Shit. Crowd like this?

807
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,075
I'm thinking about three
to four G's in just a few hours.

808
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:01,078
- Suck that.
- Yes.

809
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,953
Yo, look at our girl go.

810
00:45:07,252 --> 00:45:10,120
She flossing like
the NFL boys be, right?

811
00:45:10,122 --> 00:45:12,089
Hey, I get to hit that for free,
right?

812
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:13,890
After all nigga did
to hook it up.

813
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:15,426
You know I'd kill you for it,
right?

814
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:17,562
Shit.

815
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:18,662
Yo, yo, yo!

816
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:22,098
Yo, is this some Italian-made
Versace denim shit?

817
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,433
You're in the wrong business,
nigga.

818
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,502
And I've been telling you that.

819
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:27,437
We got money, girls, sex.
What else do you need?

820
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:28,872
Motherfucking food, nigga.

821
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:31,875
Hey, Malcolm needs some chicken
wings every once in a while.

822
00:45:31,877 --> 00:45:34,544
Myself, I rather feed
on the pussy buffet.

823
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:35,846
Nigga.

824
00:45:35,848 --> 00:45:36,948
Hell, yeah.

825
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,482
Hey. But look, though.

826
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:39,450
Win, with this kind of pimping,

827
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:41,187
you're gonna need more than
an assistant.

828
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:43,087
What?

829
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,288
Hey, you're gonna really need
to protect your shit.

830
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,357
It's like running in the streets

831
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:47,924
with paper bags filled
with cash.

832
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:50,026
You're gonna attract
the wrong niggas.

833
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:51,562
So what do you think?
Like a bodyguard or some shit?

834
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:52,629
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah.

835
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:53,900
Something like that.

836
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,444
There wasn't much action.

837
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:08,645
How'd you do, Maria?

838
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:12,116
I did okay. I just hope
Wednesday's not mad.

839
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:13,220
I don't know.

840
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:22,993
What the fuck is this?

841
00:46:26,265 --> 00:46:28,935
This is only the beginning.

842
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:33,504
- I'm gonna make you rich.
- Mm-hm.

843
00:46:33,506 --> 00:46:35,205
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

844
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:36,573
So how rich are you
gonna make me?

845
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:39,109
Well, I think
we can make millions.

846
00:46:39,111 --> 00:46:40,611
Millions?

847
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:41,982
I like the sound of that.

848
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:01,598
<i>Your call...</i>

849
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:28,091
Ma, you're good?

850
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:30,097
Just get me some water.

851
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,645
You're burning up, Ma.

852
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:50,314
- I'm fine.
- We gotta get you in the shower.

853
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:51,749
Come on.

854
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,316
Come on, let's get you
washed up now.

855
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:54,384
All right, come on.

856
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:57,323
I can do it myself.

857
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:18,709
You're staying
off the drugs, Ma?

858
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:21,379
I ain't touching nothing weird.

859
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,017
Mom, you're sick.

860
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:27,421
I'm sick and tired.

861
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,323
You ain't lying to me, right?

862
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:33,491
I ain't left the house.

863
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,128
Just like you said.

864
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:39,332
I believe you. You know that?

865
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:44,504
And if you stay clean, we could
do things different this time.

866
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:55,548
You look different.

867
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:02,787
Just making money, Ma.

868
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:04,154
Real money.

869
00:49:04,156 --> 00:49:06,158
What?

870
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:09,095
You making money.

871
00:49:10,363 --> 00:49:12,229
What you gonna do
with all this money?

872
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:13,196
I'mma take care of you.

873
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:14,732
It's time for things
to change around here.

874
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:16,299
You gonna buy me a new TV?

875
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:17,767
Yeah, I already started looking
at better models.

876
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:19,069
- Did ya?
- And I'mma get us

877
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:20,738
a bigger house, too.

878
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,372
How are you gonna do that?

879
00:49:22,374 --> 00:49:24,075
I got some new girls.

880
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:25,442
Got a whole little hotel suite

881
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:27,778
where everybody in Bronx
go to see 'em.

882
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,649
You gonna be proud
if you saw 'em, Ma.

883
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:33,651
I got game, Ma.

884
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:35,386
It's only going up for me
from here.

885
00:49:35,388 --> 00:49:36,390
You hear me?

886
00:49:56,676 --> 00:49:59,310
What you mean
she ain't in the club?

887
00:49:59,312 --> 00:50:01,412
You tellin' me you can't keep
your eyes on one bitch for me?

888
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:05,149
She ain't been home
for a few days.

889
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:06,616
She ain't
returning calls.

890
00:50:06,618 --> 00:50:08,155
Shit. Ain't nobody seen her.

891
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:11,122
You playing with me, dawg.

892
00:50:11,124 --> 00:50:13,591
No, boss. I heard she was
on a break.

893
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,859
Who the fuck said that?

894
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,828
One of the strippers. Said you
was the one who gave it to her.

895
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,696
Nigga, go get Destiny right now.

896
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:21,631
Bring her back here back here
before people start talking.

897
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:23,399
I got niggas waiting on her.

898
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:25,769
I'll get this city
on lock down, boss.

899
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,573
And pull her back in her cage,

900
00:50:30,575 --> 00:50:32,646
or I'll kill all of you
motherfuckers.

901
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:50,196
- What the fuck is this?
- It's Nikki. She's family.

902
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:53,863
Bitch.

903
00:50:53,865 --> 00:50:55,601
The fuck was that?

904
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:57,370
Hey!

905
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,539
Hey!

906
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,207
Hey, what's wrong with you?

907
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:04,274
You should know better, okay?

908
00:51:04,276 --> 00:51:05,808
Don't mix me
with your street hoes.

909
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,444
She one of my top girls,
like you.

910
00:51:07,446 --> 00:51:08,779
That's the problem, okay?

911
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:10,613
There's only room for one
at the top.

912
00:51:10,615 --> 00:51:12,249
So what do you want me to do?

913
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,584
Get rid of her.

914
00:51:13,586 --> 00:51:14,651
Or I'm gone, too.

915
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,187
Hold up.

916
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:17,720
I'm the one that makes the rules
around here.

917
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:19,492
Fuck you, nigga bitch!

918
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,131
It won't happen again.

919
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:27,631
Yeah.

920
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:29,202
Get your head straight.

921
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,512
Hello.

922
00:51:42,414 --> 00:51:43,781
Hello.

923
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:44,851
Hello.

924
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:22,489
What do you want?

925
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:24,787
Is Jamal here?

926
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:25,891
Who the fuck are you?

927
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,595
Tell him G Star's here.

928
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:33,363
- Yo, Jamal.
- Yo.

929
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:35,634
Some old bitch,
G Star is here to see you.

930
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,837
You know her?

931
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,274
Oh, shit.

932
00:52:42,874 --> 00:52:44,610
G Star in the building.

933
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:47,781
What you doing in my hood?

934
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:53,316
I tried to call you.

935
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,423
Can you hook a sister up?

936
00:52:57,622 --> 00:52:59,857
It's been a long time, G.

937
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,493
You know, you're one crazy bitch

938
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:03,930
for coming
all the way down here.

939
00:53:04,997 --> 00:53:05,999
Come on.

940
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:21,347
Hey, I'm trying to smoke.

941
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:24,013
Can you unlock
the window?

942
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:25,848
- What's the problem?
- You gonna be cool with that?

943
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:27,886
Not if it's gonna mess
with my hair.

944
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,491
I can't believe you're listening
to this bitch.

945
00:53:34,493 --> 00:53:36,526
You better teach this little
girl some manners, Wednesday.

946
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:38,629
'Cause she needs to know
who's riding who over here.

947
00:53:40,332 --> 00:53:42,966
- You know, Win, fuck this bitch.
- Shut the fuck up, Nikki.

948
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:44,435
Keep your mouth shut.
Destiny is right.

949
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:45,538
You need to know your role.

950
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,640
So that's how it is, huh?

951
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:50,910
We'll talk about it later.

952
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:06,459
So what you looking for, G?

953
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,959
Same as last time.

954
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:10,461
Same thing.

955
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:11,828
Oh, no. I got some new shit
right here

956
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,397
about to hit the streets.

957
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:14,601
Why don't you try a speck?

958
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:19,803
I, I don't have any money.

959
00:54:19,805 --> 00:54:21,875
No? Then you're in
the wrong fucking place.

960
00:54:22,841 --> 00:54:24,674
I can have it for you tomorrow.

961
00:54:24,676 --> 00:54:25,743
You know, first,

962
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:26,913
- first thing, J.
- No.

963
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:30,714
I'mma have it for you
first thing tomorrow.

964
00:54:30,716 --> 00:54:33,450
You're saying it like
back in the days, yo.

965
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:41,060
Come on, J.

966
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,768
Come on, J.

967
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:55,772
I'll let you fuck me.

968
00:54:55,774 --> 00:54:56,776
What?

969
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:01,580
I'll let you fuck me in the ass.

970
00:55:02,714 --> 00:55:05,682
Anything.

971
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:06,685
Please.

972
00:55:08,586 --> 00:55:09,888
Okay, I'll call you later.

973
00:55:23,736 --> 00:55:25,538
- You serious right now?
- Don't start it.

974
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:28,705
Are you fucking serious?

975
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:29,772
What do you want me
to do, Nikki?

976
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:30,776
What the fuck was that?

977
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,580
Nikki! Nikki!

978
00:55:34,879 --> 00:55:36,048
Get back in the car.

979
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:40,883
I can't believe you let
that bitch talk to me like that.

980
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:42,586
What was I supposed
to do, Nikki?

981
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:44,455
Kick her out the car?
What about our future?

982
00:55:44,457 --> 00:55:46,022
This is your future right here.

983
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:47,457
You and me, remember?

984
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:51,160
She's big money right now
and we need that.

985
00:55:51,162 --> 00:55:54,631
You think that money
is the answer to everything.

986
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:57,667
That's your problem.
I see it different.

987
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:59,502
I see how she looks at you.

988
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:01,238
We out here doing big things.

989
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,839
And to me,
you're just getting emotional

990
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:04,644
and you need to keep
that shit to yourself.

991
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,243
I love you, Win.

992
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:08,714
I ain't even know that
right now.

993
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:10,716
What?

994
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,086
I'm your pimp, Nikki.

995
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:17,154
Please.

996
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:19,492
Bitch, are you fucking blind?
Huh?

997
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:23,826
Get the fuck out of here, man.

998
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:25,064
What about this?

999
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,636
It's a phone.

1000
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:34,207
And I know it's worth something.

1001
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:36,107
I know you,

1002
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,741
you can get something for this.
It's, it's worth something.

1003
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:39,845
Here, take it.

1004
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:43,716
Take it. Take it.

1005
00:56:57,729 --> 00:56:59,231
All right. This shit should hold
you through the night.

1006
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,004
This is the last fucking time
I'll hook you up.

1007
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:14,944
What is up with you?

1008
00:57:14,946 --> 00:57:17,015
- Are you in love with that girl?
- Shut the fuck up!

1009
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,783
Shut the fuck up!

1010
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:22,021
Because you think you know shit
but you know nothing.

1011
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:24,223
Fuck you, Win.

1012
00:57:27,593 --> 00:57:30,060
This is two Gs.

1013
00:57:30,062 --> 00:57:32,729
And until you start making that
in a night,

1014
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,033
you need to keep
your mouth shut.

1015
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:36,633
And play your role, Nikki,

1016
00:57:36,635 --> 00:57:38,701
so we can get what we need.

1017
00:57:38,703 --> 00:57:40,303
It's just business.

1018
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:41,573
Remember?

1019
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:45,711
Get in the car.

1020
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:49,147
Get in the car!

1021
00:57:58,923 --> 00:58:00,256
Blunted, right?

1022
00:58:03,095 --> 00:58:04,227
That's nice.

1023
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:07,730
That's nice.

1024
00:58:38,196 --> 00:58:40,263
Shit's crazy up in here, man.

1025
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:42,167
I can even die
if we sell this shit.

1026
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:46,035
Wednesday and I
are making money,

1027
00:58:46,037 --> 00:58:48,707
and she's buying me everything
a girl can dream of.

1028
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,743
You think he misses me yet?

1029
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:54,944
Well, fuck him!

1030
00:58:54,946 --> 00:58:57,180
All right? I'm never going
back to that.

1031
00:58:57,182 --> 00:58:59,852
Stop talking shit
and get off that phone.

1032
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:02,354
Let me hit you back real quick.

1033
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:06,323
Who the fuck let you in here?

1034
00:59:06,325 --> 00:59:08,924
I don't need anybody's
permission to be up in here.

1035
00:59:08,926 --> 00:59:09,993
Didn't you see the sign
that said

1036
00:59:09,995 --> 00:59:11,731
no street hoes up in here?

1037
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:17,334
Fuck you, bitch!

1038
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:18,769
Fuck you, bitch!

1039
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,372
Fuck you. Fuck...

1040
00:59:23,374 --> 00:59:25,777
Fuck you, Nikki!

1041
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:34,187
Get off me!

1042
00:59:42,928 --> 00:59:44,394
Wednesday's mine.

1043
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:45,796
You're just some whore we used

1044
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:47,863
to get where we wanna be.

1045
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:50,033
Nikki.

1046
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:51,901
What the hell
are you doing here?

1047
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:53,039
How could you?

1048
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:00,843
Nikki.

1049
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:02,279
Nikki.

1050
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:03,349
Nikki, wait!

1051
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:05,848
Nikki, wait!

1052
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,149
I told you
not to come around here.

1053
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:09,218
And now I know why.

1054
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,053
You promised that
there wouldn't be any secrets

1055
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:11,921
between us.

1056
01:00:11,923 --> 01:00:13,423
Can you just please keep
your voice down?

1057
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:15,424
How can I keep my voice down

1058
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:18,030
when you're up in here spending
all of our money on her?

1059
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:23,301
I mean, look at you, Win...

1060
01:00:24,435 --> 01:00:26,271
and your fancy suit.

1061
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:31,274
Who are you?

1062
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:32,345
Nikki...

1063
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:46,159
Ma'am, you need to wake up.

1064
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:51,897
Can you hear me?

1065
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:53,899
You need to wake up.

1066
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:08,245
See, Wednesday,
this is why I don't want

1067
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:11,113
your fucking street hoes
in here.

1068
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:13,051
You had me worried sick, girl.

1069
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,956
What's up with you
running off like that?

1070
01:01:19,457 --> 01:01:21,924
Since when a girl
who got everything she want,

1071
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:23,292
everything she needs,

1072
01:01:23,294 --> 01:01:25,030
this is how you show
your respect?

1073
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:29,001
What could be more important
than me?

1074
01:01:30,202 --> 01:01:33,439
We're over, Kenny, okay?
Get the fuck out!

1075
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:37,040
Stupid.

1076
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:38,941
Dumbass bitch.

1077
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,076
See that's the...

1078
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:43,446
That's the problem
with these hoes.

1079
01:01:43,448 --> 01:01:45,015
You give them too much room
to think,

1080
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:46,883
they start making decisions
for theirself.

1081
01:01:46,885 --> 01:01:48,884
Fuck your shit up every time.

1082
01:01:51,022 --> 01:01:52,892
Don't you know
you can never leave me?

1083
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:57,930
You can never... leave me.

1084
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:03,834
Pump your ass right now

1085
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:05,267
if it weren't for the money
you make me.

1086
01:02:05,269 --> 01:02:06,472
Nigga, her grab her shit.

1087
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:10,443
Look.

1088
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:15,515
Just show me the money...

1089
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:19,318
- and then we're talking.
- Aah.

1090
01:02:20,285 --> 01:02:21,988
So it is about the money.

1091
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:26,792
We the same girl.

1092
01:02:29,928 --> 01:02:31,196
Who the fuck is this?

1093
01:02:33,432 --> 01:02:34,867
Leave her alone, Ken.

1094
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:37,399
Look at this thing right here.

1095
01:02:37,401 --> 01:02:39,502
What the fuck is you, girl?

1096
01:02:39,504 --> 01:02:41,303
Look, Destiny's done
for the night.

1097
01:02:41,305 --> 01:02:42,538
You all can go home.

1098
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,607
You...

1099
01:02:48,046 --> 01:02:49,979
Oh, I like you, tiny.

1100
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:51,314
I like you,

1101
01:02:51,316 --> 01:02:54,116
'cause you're so funny looking
in your pimp talk.

1102
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:55,919
Well, let me set this straight
right here.

1103
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,187
This here is my property.

1104
01:02:57,189 --> 01:02:58,254
See...

1105
01:02:58,256 --> 01:02:59,355
I own this.

1106
01:02:59,357 --> 01:03:01,493
And you ain't ask my permission
if you can have her.

1107
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,060
What the fuck is you, anyway?

1108
01:03:05,062 --> 01:03:06,328
Half girl, half nigga pimp?

1109
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,564
All girl, all nigga, all pimp.

1110
01:03:08,566 --> 01:03:11,234
This is my territory.
You're fucking my shit now.

1111
01:03:11,236 --> 01:03:12,238
I own this.

1112
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:18,010
Okay, okay.

1113
01:03:19,144 --> 01:03:20,977
Let me ask you this, tiny.

1114
01:03:20,979 --> 01:03:24,314
How a girl like you...

1115
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:27,616
fuck a woman like this?

1116
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:29,618
First, I fuck her with my mind.

1117
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,120
Then once I'm in her head,
I'm fucking her deeper

1118
01:03:31,122 --> 01:03:32,191
than you've ever been.

1119
01:03:33,624 --> 01:03:36,526
Men... always think
you need a dick to fuck.

1120
01:03:36,528 --> 01:03:37,562
Ain't that right?

1121
01:03:39,363 --> 01:03:41,363
Look, she's just here
to give me my money.

1122
01:03:41,365 --> 01:03:42,598
Oh, I know.

1123
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,368
- What are you talking about?
- Go on and put on some clothes.

1124
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,435
Who are they?

1125
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:48,437
Grab some shit.

1126
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:51,073
Yeah. Destiny done this
some bad things

1127
01:03:51,075 --> 01:03:52,911
but, see here, tiny...

1128
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:55,948
I'mma forgive her.

1129
01:03:57,149 --> 01:03:58,647
As for you...

1130
01:03:58,649 --> 01:03:59,651
Ahh.

1131
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:03,653
You can either work for me...

1132
01:04:03,655 --> 01:04:04,720
or you can die.

1133
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:06,455
Fuck you.

1134
01:04:06,457 --> 01:04:08,591
You go walking to my club,

1135
01:04:08,593 --> 01:04:11,194
steal my hoe,

1136
01:04:11,196 --> 01:04:13,366
and think you're gonna walk
out of here big pimpin'?

1137
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,002
Oh, you're lucky
you're walking home.

1138
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:20,069
You're just gonna leave?

1139
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:21,274
Thought we had a deal.

1140
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,274
You can send my love to Nikki.

1141
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:26,241
Hey, my boy gonna be really
gentle on you.

1142
01:04:26,243 --> 01:04:28,211
Fuck you...

1143
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:33,116
Hey, your game ain't that bad
for a bitch.

1144
01:04:33,118 --> 01:04:34,383
Good luck.

1145
01:04:51,435 --> 01:04:53,336
You still pimping now, huh?

1146
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:54,738
Help!

1147
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,140
- You a pimp now, huh?
- Help!

1148
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:22,064
Count to ten.
Son of a bitch.

1149
01:05:27,272 --> 01:05:29,605
Calm the fuck down,
piece of shit woman.

1150
01:05:29,607 --> 01:05:31,609
And take those
fucking hands off.

1151
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:34,778
Where the fuck
are you going, woman, huh?

1152
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,314
Come here.

1153
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:40,352
You're fucking...

1154
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:44,421
Aah!

1155
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:48,792
You fucking shot me!

1156
01:05:48,794 --> 01:05:50,826
Think I was gonna let you
fuck me?

1157
01:06:19,156 --> 01:06:20,089
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

1158
01:06:20,091 --> 01:06:21,290
<i>I didn't tell him anything.</i>

1159
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:22,691
- No, Nikki...
- I'm done!

1160
01:06:22,693 --> 01:06:24,093
You need to think fast, Win.

1161
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:25,261
Once they find out you killed
that guy,

1162
01:06:25,263 --> 01:06:26,495
they're gonna search
every street.

1163
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:27,696
It was Destiny.

1164
01:06:27,698 --> 01:06:28,832
I heard her bragging
on the phone

1165
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,165
about this shit
you've been buying her

1166
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,301
with our money!

1167
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:33,169
Quit tripping, Nikki,
'cause it ain't even like that.

1168
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:34,636
Well, that's what it seems
like to me.

1169
01:06:34,638 --> 01:06:36,605
I got played, all right?

1170
01:06:38,743 --> 01:06:40,078
Sorry.

1171
01:06:44,816 --> 01:06:46,149
What's going on, Win?

1172
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:47,216
Just go back to bed, Charlie.

1173
01:06:47,218 --> 01:06:48,283
It's just a shit
I gotta deal with.

1174
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:49,252
It's okay, Charlie.
Come over here.

1175
01:06:49,254 --> 01:06:50,886
Hide out here
with us for a little while.

1176
01:06:50,888 --> 01:06:52,754
No, I can't do that to you
and the baby.

1177
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:54,256
She's right.

1178
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:55,558
We gotta get out of here.

1179
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,593
"We"? I'm the one
that got us into this shit.

1180
01:06:57,595 --> 01:06:59,595
I'm the one that's gotta go.

1181
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:01,763
I said "we."
I ain't leaving without you.

1182
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:02,832
We can't leave.

1183
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,303
I ain't afraid of them.

1184
01:07:06,604 --> 01:07:08,307
You gotta stick to the dream,
remember?

1185
01:07:10,142 --> 01:07:11,674
You and me...

1186
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:13,511
this is the dream.

1187
01:07:14,379 --> 01:07:15,548
Malcolm's here.

1188
01:07:16,914 --> 01:07:18,480
- I'm gonna go get Ma.
- I'm coming with you.

1189
01:07:18,482 --> 01:07:20,917
No, you and Science go get
our shit and the money.

1190
01:07:20,919 --> 01:07:23,155
I got you.
Meet back here.

1191
01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:28,160
Go.

1192
01:07:29,693 --> 01:07:31,493
Win, no...

1193
01:07:31,495 --> 01:07:32,664
What about us?

1194
01:07:33,865 --> 01:07:35,468
Let's meet here after, Charlie.

1195
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:40,169
Maria, you're in charge now.

1196
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:41,236
It'll last you
a couple of weeks.

1197
01:07:41,238 --> 01:07:42,205
You gotta figure it out.

1198
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,705
Do whatever you gotta do
to feed your family.

1199
01:07:43,707 --> 01:07:46,341
- You understand?
- Are you leaving us, Win?

1200
01:07:46,343 --> 01:07:47,410
Yeah.

1201
01:07:47,412 --> 01:07:48,477
I ain't even worried
about y'all.

1202
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:49,514
Y'all gonna be fine.

1203
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:55,553
Now, go get me some clothes
so I can change.

1204
01:07:56,588 --> 01:07:58,189
Go!

1205
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:04,426
Still checking
on your paperwork,

1206
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:05,528
she's in the cell
straight ahead.

1207
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:08,700
You only got 15 minutes.

1208
01:08:12,836 --> 01:08:13,903
You all right?

1209
01:08:13,905 --> 01:08:15,270
What does it look like to you?

1210
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:16,406
We'll get you out of here.

1211
01:08:16,408 --> 01:08:17,473
I just gotta wait on them
to finish...

1212
01:08:17,475 --> 01:08:18,340
What's taking you so long?

1213
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:20,210
I thought
she was making money now.

1214
01:08:20,212 --> 01:08:21,577
Plan has changed.

1215
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:22,745
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

1216
01:08:22,747 --> 01:08:23,883
So you got the money?

1217
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:28,483
Is that all you care about?

1218
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:29,986
I've just been through hell.

1219
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:31,653
Can we talk about this later?

1220
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:33,355
It is "later."

1221
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,590
How come
you're always lying to me?

1222
01:08:34,592 --> 01:08:36,593
'Cause you will never want
to hear the truth.

1223
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:39,696
Ma, do you even care to ask
what happened to me?

1224
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,232
Well, you know,
if you got me out of here,

1225
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:43,499
then you know,
we can go talk about it.

1226
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:45,367
I'm in trouble.

1227
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:47,002
Big trouble. I shouldn't even
be here right now.

1228
01:08:47,004 --> 01:08:48,804
You sitting there looking
at my busted face?

1229
01:08:48,806 --> 01:08:51,407
Well, you know, I...
I just wanna go home right now.

1230
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:52,341
I'm sure
you can understand that.

1231
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:53,608
You said you wasn't doing
no more drugs.

1232
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:56,278
Where are you going with this?
Do you have the money or not?

1233
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,346
Yeah, I got the money.

1234
01:08:57,348 --> 01:08:58,848
Everything, I got.

1235
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:01,517
But I'll ask you something.

1236
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:03,952
Do you even give
a shit about me?

1237
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:06,788
What kind of ques...
I know you not asking me...

1238
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:08,890
Are you serious?
Are you really asking me that

1239
01:09:08,892 --> 01:09:09,759
- right now?
- Dead ass serious.

1240
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:12,464
Do you love me?
Did you ever love me?

1241
01:09:19,537 --> 01:09:21,571
I can't love...

1242
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:22,908
when there's nothing in me.

1243
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,643
I'm just doing my best.

1244
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:29,348
I've loved you all my life.

1245
01:09:30,714 --> 01:09:32,814
Everything I've done,
I've done for you.

1246
01:09:32,816 --> 01:09:34,550
But you?

1247
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:35,852
You didn't give a shit about me.

1248
01:09:35,854 --> 01:09:38,353
I don't give a shit about you?

1249
01:09:38,355 --> 01:09:39,788
I don't give a shit about you?

1250
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:42,658
I sold my ass to put clothes
on your back.

1251
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,960
To put food on the table

1252
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,060
for you!

1253
01:09:45,062 --> 01:09:47,063
Now, I may not have been
the best mother in the world

1254
01:09:47,065 --> 01:09:49,465
'cause God knows I didn't intend
to be one,

1255
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,501
but sometimes, sometimes,
Wednesday,

1256
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:53,439
you don't get to live
the life you wanna live.

1257
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,575
So do you?

1258
01:09:58,677 --> 01:09:59,942
Do you love me?

1259
01:09:59,944 --> 01:10:01,946
I just wanna know that,
last thing.

1260
01:10:03,748 --> 01:10:05,581
Do you love me?

1261
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,349
Do you love me?

1262
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:08,486
No!

1263
01:10:09,387 --> 01:10:11,086
No!

1264
01:10:11,088 --> 01:10:14,023
I don't love you.

1265
01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:16,826
Now get me out of here

1266
01:10:16,828 --> 01:10:18,564
so I can go home!

1267
01:10:20,097 --> 01:10:21,699
You are home.

1268
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:24,701
At least I know where
to find you.

1269
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:26,402
I know people
are gonna feed you,

1270
01:10:26,404 --> 01:10:28,504
I know you got a place
to lay your head.

1271
01:10:28,506 --> 01:10:30,406
I ain't gotta worry
about you no more.

1272
01:10:32,843 --> 01:10:35,344
I know you're not gonna leave me
locked up in here.

1273
01:10:35,346 --> 01:10:38,747
I know you're not gonna leave me
locked up in this hellhole.

1274
01:10:38,749 --> 01:10:40,515
What about all that shit
you was talking about

1275
01:10:40,517 --> 01:10:41,584
the other night?

1276
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:43,353
How you was gonna
take care of me?

1277
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:45,354
What about all that? Huh?

1278
01:10:45,356 --> 01:10:46,656
What about all that?

1279
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,029
I love you, Ma.

1280
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:53,898
I'mma pray for you.

1281
01:10:57,135 --> 01:10:58,501
Go on!

1282
01:10:58,503 --> 01:11:00,803
Go on, leave me
just like your daddy did.

1283
01:11:00,805 --> 01:11:02,938
Leave me just like
your daddy did!

1284
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,475
Go ahead and leave!

1285
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:09,448
Wednesday!

1286
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:13,483
<i>Wednesday, come back here!</i>

1287
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:16,152
<i>You go ahead, Wednesday!
You leave me!</i>

1288
01:11:16,154 --> 01:11:19,325
<i>You leave me! You leave me
just like your daddy did!</i>

1289
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:22,023
<i>You leave me!</i>

1290
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:24,562
<i>Go ahead, Wednesday. Leave me!</i>

1291
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:32,969
- You ready?
- But what about Mama?

1292
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:34,906
Just me and you.
Come on, y'all. Let's go.

1293
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:38,107
Hope the old lady can make it.

1294
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:39,108
I bet you a hundred bucks

1295
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:40,443
I'm gonna drive her right down
to the beach.

1296
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:42,612
I'm going with Win on this.

1297
01:11:42,614 --> 01:11:43,845
You just follow us
to the interstate

1298
01:11:43,847 --> 01:11:44,882
till you're safe.

1299
01:11:50,855 --> 01:11:52,091
Don't look back.

1300
01:12:14,812 --> 01:12:16,481
You know, I ain't mad
at you, Win.

1301
01:12:22,153 --> 01:12:23,655
I love you, Win.

1302
01:12:26,857 --> 01:12:28,023
Oh, shit!

1303
01:12:32,797 --> 01:12:33,929
Get down, Nikki!

1304
01:12:39,837 --> 01:12:41,439
Fuck you!

1305
01:12:50,181 --> 01:12:51,450
Get your ass around!

1306
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:08,200
Holy shit!

1307
01:13:13,805 --> 01:13:15,871
- Run, Malcolm!
- No!

1308
01:13:15,873 --> 01:13:17,773
- Oh, shit.
- Malcolm!

1309
01:13:19,843 --> 01:13:21,810
Oh, shit!

1310
01:13:21,812 --> 01:13:24,482
- Where you going?
- Don't be afraid. I got you.

1311
01:13:31,055 --> 01:13:32,220
Oh.

1312
01:13:47,805 --> 01:13:49,975
Bang! Bang!

1313
01:13:50,775 --> 01:13:51,840
Bang!

1314
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,304
Stop.

1315
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:24,042
Help. Wait...

1316
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:26,578
Come on!

1317
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:34,720
Science, we gotta get up.

1318
01:14:36,788 --> 01:14:38,987
Come on, man.

1319
01:14:38,989 --> 01:14:41,823
- Come on, man. We gotta get up.
- Fuck you, man.

1320
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:50,066
You know you dropped
your gun, young blood.

1321
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,367
Science!

1322
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:53,669
Science!

1323
01:14:53,671 --> 01:14:55,971
Don't you know
bitches can't be pimps?

1324
01:14:55,973 --> 01:14:57,743
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1325
01:14:59,142 --> 01:15:01,012
You did real good for a bitch.

1326
01:15:04,615 --> 01:15:05,915
You did real good.

1327
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:07,148
Fuck you!

1328
01:15:09,153 --> 01:15:10,752
Fuck y'all.

1329
01:15:23,368 --> 01:15:25,166
- Come on, come on.
- No.

1330
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,202
Come on. Let's go.

1331
01:15:27,204 --> 01:15:28,906
Come on. Come on.

1332
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:31,206
Come on.

1333
01:15:53,998 --> 01:15:55,834
I'm sorry.

1334
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,056
Come on, Nikki. Come with me.

1335
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:54,255
Where are we going, Win?

1336
01:16:54,257 --> 01:16:56,694
Don't be afraid. I got you.

1337
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:01,432
- Me and you.
- Me and you.

1338
01:17:14,044 --> 01:17:16,815
Me and you, baby.

1339
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:39,068
<i>My daddy told me...</i>

1340

<i>Never let a bitch get close
to your heart.</i>

1341
01:17:42,906 --> 01:17:44,208
<i>What he didn't know is...</i>

1342
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:49,077
<i>that bitch is money.</i>

1343
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:52,081
<i>And I'mma tell him
when I see him.</i>

1344
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:55,518
<i>Truth is... money
is the biggest bitch</i>

1345
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,553
<i>you're gonna ever hustle.</i>

1346
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:58,987
<i>And if you're living
chasing that,</i>

1347
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:00,391
<i>you might as well be dead.</i>

1348
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:03,459
<i>In the end,</i>

1349
01:18:03,461 --> 01:18:06,327
<i>we're all pimps in this life.</i>

1350
01:18:06,329 --> 01:18:09,532
<i>You just gotta be clear
on what you're hustling.</i>

1351
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:11,770
<i>And the one thing
you can't hustle...</i>

1352
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,439
<i>is love.</i>

1353
01:18:15,472 --> 01:18:17,072
<i>It's the light in this life</i>

1354

<i>even when we're living
in the dark.</i>

1355
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,049
<i>I love you, Nikki.</i>

1356
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:27,485
<i>I'll see you in the next life.</i>

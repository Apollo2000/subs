2
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,053
Miss Carmichael, please.

3
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,431
Dr. Petersen is ready for you.

4
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,224
I'm awfully sorry. I have to go.

5
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,852
Had a perfect hand.
Would've beaten the pants off you.

6
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,104
- Harry will take you, Miss Carmichael.
- Thank you.

7
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,274
Watch her carefully.
Don't take your eyes off her.

8
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,867
- How are you today, Harry?
- Fine.

9
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,745
- You look a little bilious.
- It's the light.

10
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,872
I worry about you, dear.

11
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,624
I'll be all right.

12
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,084
Must we dash into Dr. Petersen's office?

13
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,130
Can't we go sit somewhere in private
and talk, just you and I?

14
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,215
Love it, if I had time.

15
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,842
Would you?

16
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,561
Come in.

17
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,194
You ruined a very interesting card game,
Dr. Petersen.

18
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,530
- You may go now, Harry.
- I'll be outside.

19
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,576
I hope you feel better today, Mary.

20
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,578
- Well, I don't.
- You will.

21
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,705
I think this whole thing is ridiculous.

22
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,207
What whole thing, Mary?

23
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,377
Psychoanalysis. It bores the pants off of me.

24
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,547
Lying on the couch
like some dreary nitwit, telling all.

25
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,549
You don't really expect to get anywhere

26
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,636
listening to me babble
about my idiotic childhood.

27
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,804
Really.

28
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,431
My patients invariably regard me
as a wretched nuisance

29
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,933
during our first talks.

30
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,812
I see. It's my subconscious
putting up a fight.

31
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,939
It doesn't want me cured.

32
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,984
Exactly. It wants to continue
enjoying your disease.

33
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,820
Our job is to make you understand why.

34
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,239
When you know why you're doing something
that's bad for you

35
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,826
and when you first started doing it.
Then you can begin curing yourself.

36
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,120
You mean I've been telling you lies?

37
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,413
The usual proportion.

38
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,749
You're right. I've been lying like mad.

39
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,544
I hate men. I loathe them.

40
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,295
If one of them so much as touches me,

41
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,424
I want to sink my teeth into his hands
and bite it off.

42
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,928
In fact, I did that once.
Do you care to hear about it?

43
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,930
Tell me anything you remember.

44
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,432
We were dancing.

45
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,602
He kept asking me to marry him,
panting in my ear.

46
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,355
I suddenly pretended
I was going to kiss him

47
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,860
and sank my teeth into his mustache
and bit it clear off.

48
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,656
You're laughing at me.

49
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,659
That smug frozen face of yours
doesn't take me in.

50
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,537
You just want me to tell you all this
so you can feel superior to me.

51
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,291
You and your drooling science.
I detest you.

52
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,336
I never want to see
that nasty face of yours again!

53
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,796
I can't bear you.

54
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,382
You and your nickel's worth of nothing!

55
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,637
Come on, Miss Carmichael.

56
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,474
Silly fool.
Letting a creature like that worry me.

57
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,184
Miss Frozen Puss.

58
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:24,980
Dr. Fleurot, I want to talk to you alone.

59
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,399
I can't stand that woman.

60
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,817
I'll see you later, Mary.

61
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,819
Come, Miss Carmichael.

62
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,244
Murchison must be really out of his mind
to assign Carmichael to you.

63
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,165
You may report your findings
to the new head when he arrives.

64
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,084
You can't treat a love veteran
like Carmichael

65
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,086
without some inside information.

66
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,505
I've done a great deal of research
on emotional problems

67
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,008
- and love difficulties.
- Research, my eye.

68
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,762
I've watched your work for six months.
It's brilliant but lifeless.

69
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,514
There's no intuition in it.

70
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,433
You approach all your problems
with an ice pack on your head.

71
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,394
- Are you making love to me?
- I will in a moment.

72
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,022
I'm just clearing the ground first.

73
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,025
I'm trying to convince you
that your lack of human and emotional experience

74
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,069
is bad for you as a doctor

75
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,030
and fatal for you as a woman.

76
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,200
I've heard that argument
from a number of amorous psychiatrists

77
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,911
who all wanted to make
a better doctor of me.

78
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,539
But I've got a much better argument.

79
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,791
- I'm terribly fond of you.
- Why?

80
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,631
It's rather like embracing a textbook.

81
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,968
- Why do you do it then?
- Because you're not a textbook.

82
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,388
You're a sweet, pulsing,
adorable woman underneath.

83
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,223
I sense it every time
I come near to you.

84
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,226
You sense only your own desires and pulsations.

85
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,061
I assure you,
mine in no way resemble them.

86
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,106
Stop it. I'm mad about you.

87
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,071
I'm afraid I'm boring you.

88
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,074
No. Your attitudes are very interesting.

89
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,246
You're exactly like Miss Carmichael.
I'd like to throw a book at you.

90
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,831
But I won't.

91
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,041
- May I borrow this?
- Certainly.

92
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,085
Oh, and forgive me for my criticism.

93
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,630
I think you'd better stick to books.
And another thing...

94
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,009
Pardon me for marching in,
but I'm spreading the tidings.

95
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,844
My successor will be due any moment.

96
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,763
Dr. Murchison, it's been a pleasure
working under you.

97
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,015
Thank you very much.

98
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,600
Coming, Dr. Petersen?

99
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,436
I'm in no mad hurry to welcome Dr. Edwardes.

100
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,608
It's hard to imagine this place without you,
Dr. Murchison.

101
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,193
Yes, I sort of go with the fixtures.

102
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,446
More than that. You are Green Manors.
It seems unfair.

103
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,448
You're very young in the profession.

104
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,992
You haven't learned
the basic secret of science.

105
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,994
The old must make way for the new,

106
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,872
particularly when the old is suspected
of a touch of senility.

107
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
That's ridiculous.

108
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,126
I should think the Board of Directors
would realize you're feeling much better.

109
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,128
You've been like a new man
since your vacation.

110
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,131
The Board's as fair and all-knowing
as a hospital board can be.

111
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,134
I agree with you.
I'm as able and brilliant as ever.

112
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,970
But having crumbled once,
I might crumble again.

113
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,680
You were overworked.

114
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,975
A charming diagnosis for a broken-down horse.

115
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,519
I shall always remember
your cheerfulness today

116
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,356
as a lesson in how to accept reality,
Dr. Murchison.

117
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,234
Don't be too taken in
by my happy air, Constance.

118
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,862
It's the least difficult way
of saying goodbye to 20 years.

119
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,031
Yes, I know.

120
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,199
Come in.

121
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,496
- Your mail, Dr. Petersen and Mr. Garmes.
- Come in, Mr. Garmes.

122
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,041
You're not leaving today?
I'll see you again?

123
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,836
I shall hover around for a while
like an old mother hen.

124
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,714
At least until Dr. Edwardes
is firmly on the list.

125
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,055
How do you feel today, Mr. Garmes?

126
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,642
Somewhat better, Doctor.
The thing seems a little less troublesome.

127
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,523
May I do that for you, Doctor?

128
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,776
Thank you, no.
I can do this myself very well.

129
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,861
Please sit down.
I'll be with you in a moment.

130
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,590
- So that's the mighty Anthony Edwardes.
- He looks a little younger than I expected.

131
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,386
He's only brought one suitcase.
Perhaps he doesn't intend to remain very long.

132
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,471
Leave those daydreams to Dr. Murchison.

133
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,772
Gentlemen, our new chief,
Dr. Anthony Edwardes. Dr. Fleurot.

134
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,982
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

135
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,235
- I am Dr. Graff.
- How do you do?

136
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,820
- Dr. Hanish.
- How do you do?

137
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,489
There's still some staff members missing,
Dr. Edwardes.

138
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,742
These are your quarters.

139
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,996
They're very festive for an institution.

140
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,750
Dr. Edwardes, Dr. Murchison.

141
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,127
How do you do, Dr. Murchison?
I've heard a great deal about you, sir.

142
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,755
And I naturally about you.

143
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,633
- You're younger than I thought you'd be.
- My age hasn't caught up with me yet.

144
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:08,305
Mine has, it seems. I'm pleased to hand over
the reins to steadier hands.

145
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,432
I'm leaving you my library which contains,

146
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,850
amongst other items of interest,

147
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,021
your latest volume, <i>The Labyrinth of the Guilt Complex.</i>
An excellent work.

148
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,523
I hope Green Manors will inspire others as fine.

149
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,525
I'm very grateful.

150
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,987
I don't know the formal words
for an abdication, Dr. Edwardes.

151
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,283
May I say, merely, that these quarters
which I've occupied for 20 years

152
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,286
are now yours. Will you excuse me?

153
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,713
I spent a half-hour with Dr. Edwardes.

154
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
I must say, I was most favorably impressed.

155
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,385
I intend to learn a great deal
from Dr. Edwardes.

156
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,304
I think we all can,
from a man with such obvious talents.

157
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,474
- You're familiar with his work?
- Yes, I've read all his books.

158
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,976
A very keen, unorthodox mind.

159
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,772
It would be dreadful
if Dr. Murchison's successor was unworthy of him.

160
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,565
He's joining us.

161
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,368
I think you know everyone here,
Dr. Edwardes.

162
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,079
- No, not yet.
- Oh.

163
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,581
- This is Dr. Petersen.
- How do you do?

164
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,543
Dr. Edwardes.

165
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,630
Dr. Hanish has been showing me the grounds.

166
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,383
It's a remarkable institution,
Dr. Murchison.

167
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,177
- Must be quite beautiful in the summer.
- I pointed out to Dr. Edwardes

168
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,763
our various open-air diversions
for the patients.

169
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,683
Dr. Murchison always argued
we did not do enough in that direction,

170
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,892
and I agree with him.

171
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,687
Let me warn you that Dr. Petersen
is a frustrated gymnast.

172
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,065
Dr. Fleurot considers anything
beyond sitting and standing gymnastics.

173
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,151
I imagine you're very fond of sports.

174
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,070
Yes, I am, and I miss them,
particularly winter sports.

175
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,947
Did you show Dr. Edwardes the elm grove?

176
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,699
Yes, yes indeed.

177
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,868
That's where we hope to have
our new swimming pool.

178
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,494
I'm a great believer in the swimming pool.

179
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,205
There's a perfect spot for it
among the elms.

180
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,959
Not an oblong one,
but an irregular pool, something...

181
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,298
Something like this, you know.

182
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,634
Bathhouses should be here.

183
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,390
I take it that the supply of linen
at this institution is inexhaustible!

184
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,565
Forgive me.

185
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,403
That reminds me of my professor in psychiatry,
Dr. Brulov.

186
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,573
He could never stand a sauce bottle
on the table or even a salt shaker.

187
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,742
They took his appetite away.

188
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,537
I remember once at a banquet in his honor,

189
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,664
he refused to sit at the speaker's table

190
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,167
because he was completely surrounded by...

191
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,837
by ketchup.

192
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,262
Last night at dinner,

193
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,307
a dimple appeared in your cheek
that was never there before.

194
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,311
And I detected the outcroppings
of a mother instinct toward Dr. Edwardes.

195
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,105
I detest that sort of high-school talk.

196
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,108
Your reactions have upset
one of my pet theories about you.

197
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,861
To wit, that you were immune to psychoanalysts

198
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,823
and would end up in the arms
of some Boob McNutt with spiked hair.

199
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,035
If I were looking for that type, Dr. Fleurot,
I would long ago have adored you.

200
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,998
Come in.

201
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,291
Hi.

202
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,877
Excuse me, it's from Dr. Edwardes.

203
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,300
Love notes already.
The French school of science.

204
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,183
I didn't want to come to this institution,
but my brother insisted.

205
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,561
I can see no sense in it myself.

206
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,647
You see, I'm convinced I'm not suffering
from any hallucination

207
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,816
but that my guilt is very real.

208
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,152
I know, Dr. Edwardes,
that I killed my father.

209
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,821
And I'm willing to pay the penalty for it.

210
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,323
Come in.

211
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,537
Thank you for coming so soon.

212
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,206
I've been listening to Mr. Garmes
and thought you might help me out.

213
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,709
Mr. Garmes, you shouldn't
have disturbed Dr. Edwardes.

214
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,003
That's all right.
I'm very interested in Mr. Garmes' case.

215
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,548
I knew you would be. He fits perfectly
into your chapters on the guilt complex.

216
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,175
Would you mind telling me
what you're talking about?

217
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,929
You're here to see if we can cure your guilt complex 
by psychoanalysis, Mr. Garmes.

218
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,099
But I have no guilt complex.

219
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,852
I know what I know.

220
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,022
- I killed my father and I...
- No, you didn't kill your father.

221
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,858
That's a misconception
that has taken hold of you.

222
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,945
I'm sorry, Doctor.
You were talking to him.

223
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
No, no, go on.

224
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,869
People often feel guilty
over something they never did.

225
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,871
It usually goes back to their childhood.

226
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,249
The child often wishes something terrible
would happen to someone,

227
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,460
and if something does happen
to that person,

228
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,712
the child believes he's caused it.

229
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,297
Then he grows up with a guilt complex

230
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,467
over a sin that was
only a child's bad dream.

231
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,136
What I am thinking isn't true, then?

232
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,056
No. In the course of analyzing yourself,
you'll see that.

233
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,893
Would you care to go back
to your room, Mr. Garmes?

234
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,066
Harry.

235
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,739
I think we'd better put him under drugs
for a few days.

236
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,324
He looks agitated.

237
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,327
His conviction is curious.

238
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,829
But you've encountered such cases
very often, Dr. Edwardes.

239
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,791
You described them perfectly in your book.

240
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,169
Yes.

241
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,962
Yes, so I did.

242
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,842
- Would you mind doing me a favor?
- Not at all, Doctor.

243
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,970
I've a headache. I'd like to take
the afternoon off. With you.

244
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,973
I understand you're not on duty
till after dinner.

245
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,601
- I intended typing out my notes.
- Please, I need a little fresh air

246
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,144
and you look as though
it might do you a bit of good.

247
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,521
I was going to lunch with Dr. Hanish.

248
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,815
He has an interesting new patient, a kleptomaniac.

249
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,776
Kleptomaniacs for lunch?
They'll steal the food right out of your mouth.

250
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,112
Excuse me.

251
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,200
Hello? Yes. Dr. Edwardes.

252
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,452
What? Yes, Anthony Edwardes.

253
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,705
Who?

254
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,791
Sorry, I don't get your name.

255
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,293
Norma Cramer?

256
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,799
Please, Miss Cramer,
I'm very busy and I don't know you.

257
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,970
Some girl claiming to be...

258
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,517
I hate practical jokes, don't you?

259
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,311
People calling you up and chirping,
"Guess who I am."

260
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,313
Sounds like some ex-patient of yours.

261
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,023
They're always full of coy little tricks.

262
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,401
Very likely. Come on, let's go.

263
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,363
We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass,
and clouds without complexes.

264
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,329
I think the greatest harm done
to the human race

265
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,749
has been done by the poets.

266
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,918
Poets are dull boys, most of them,
but not especially fiendish.

267
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,338
But they keep filling people's heads
with delusions about love,

268
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,509
writing about it as if it were a
symphony orchestra, a flight of angels.

269
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,554
- Which it isn't, eh?
- Of course not.

270
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,055
People fall in love, as they put it,

271
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,058
because they respond
to a certain hair coloring,

272
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,437
or vocal tones or mannerisms
that remind them of their parents.

273
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,397
Or sometimes, for no reason at all.

274
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,609
But that's not the point. The point is
that people read about love as one thing

275
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,611
and experience it as another.

276
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,365
They expect kisses to be
like lyrical poems

277
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,993
and embraces to be
like Shakespearean dramas.

278
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,704
And when they find out differently,

279
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,707
then they get sick
and they have to be analyzed, eh?

280
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,292
Yes, very often.

281
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,961
Professor, you're suffering
from mogo on the go-go.

282
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,088
I beg your pardon.

283
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:46,387
- You can't get through there like that.
- I can. I've done it many times.

284
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,890
- You hurt?
- No, not at all.

285
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,100
- Here.
- No, I'm perfectly all right.

286
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,813
I've usually gone on picnics here alone.

287
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,981
That doesn't sound like much fun.

288
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,275
I haven't gone in for fun,
as you call it.

289
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,236
Isn't this beautiful?

290
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,405
Perfect.

291
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,119
Oh, lunch. Lunch. What will you have?
Ham or liverwurst?

292
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,414
Liverwurst.

293
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,170
Has anybody seen our new chief today?

294
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,130
He has been tied up.

295
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,425
He frisked off with Dr. Petersen at noon.

296
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,428
It's odd spending his first day
running after Dr. Petersen

297
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,097
like a drooling college boy.

298
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,266
It'll do Constance good
to be drooled over.

299
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,309
Poor girl's withering away with science.

300
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,853
I was telling her only recently

301
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,105
that something vital
was missing from her life.

302
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,822
Please don't get up.
I just came in because

303
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,658
I learned Mr. Garmes
became agitated again this afternoon.

304
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,661
- Yes, I gave him a sedative.
- I'm very sorry I wasn't here.

305
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,455
Nonsense. You look as if
you had an instructive time.

306
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,208
- Instructive?
- Gentlemen, notice her stocking.

307
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,960
The lady's been climbing trees.

308
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,045
Or lolling in a briar patch.

309
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,007
No, it's trees.
There are two leaves in her hair.

310
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,509
Allow me, Dr. Petersen.

311
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,804
You're surpassing yourself
as a charmer, Dr. Fleurot.

312
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,806
Don't run away. Do have some coffee.

313
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,808
Dr. Petersen's already eaten,

314
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,811
as one can tell by the mustard
on her right forefinger.

315
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,731
I would say hot dogs
on the state highway.

316
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,818
Would you really? Your diagnosis is,
as usual, wrong, Dr. Fleurot.

317
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,820
Not hot dogs, liverwurst.

318
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,657
I'm very sorry, I have to leave this nursery.
I must see Mr. Garmes.

319
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,746
It looks as if we have Casanova himself
at the head of Green Manors.

320
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,415
Did you notice her blush
every time we mentioned his name?

321
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,715
It's very late.

322
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,474
I was going to read your new book again.

323
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,978
I would like to discuss it.
I have never discussed an author's work with him.

324
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,647
Of course, at school,
we had several literary professors,

325
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,274
but that was quite different.

326
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,320
I sound rather nervous, don't I?

327
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,905
Not at all.

328
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,579
I thought I wanted to discuss
your book with you.

329
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,747
I'm amazed at the subterfuge.

330
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,752
I don't want to discuss it at all.

331
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,671
I understand.

332
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,969
It's quite remarkable to discover
that one isn't what one thought one was.

333
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,472
I mean, I've always been entirely aware
of what was in my mind.

334
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,266
And you're not now?

335
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,773
It's quite ridiculous.

336
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,944
It was stupid of me to come in here
like a distracted child.

337
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,613
You're very lovely.

338
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,491
Please don't talk that way.
You'll think I came in to hear that.

339
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,954
I know why you came in.

340
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,957
Why?

341
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,710
Because something has happened to us.

342
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,632
But it doesn't happen like that,
in a day.

343
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,343
It happens in a moment sometimes.

344
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,137
I felt it this afternoon.

345
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,224
It was like lightning striking.

346
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,353
It strikes rarely.

347
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,389
I don't understand how it happened.

348
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,531
- What is it?
- It's not you.

349
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,033
Something about your robe.

350
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,202
My robe? I don't understand.

351
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,873
Forgive me. Something struck me.

352
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,420
I've been having a rather bad time
with my nerves lately. Your robe...

353
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,880
- I mean, the dark lines.
- You're ill.

354
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,384
I'll be all right.

355
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,557
Hello. Yes, Dr. Edwardes.

356
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,227
Yes. Yes. What? Where is he?

357
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,229
I'll be there right away.

358
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,065
Mr. Garmes, he's run amuck.
Tried to murder Fleurot, then cut his own throat.

359
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,443
- Is it bad?
- I think so. He's in surgery.

360
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,153
I'll be right along.

361
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,954
He's lost a lot of blood,
but I think he'll pull through.

362
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,081
- What's the pulse?
- 140.

363
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,958
It's going down.

364
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,609
- Why are the lights out in the corridor?
- What do you mean?

365
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,612
It's dark. That's why he did it.

366
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,366
Because the lights are out.
Turn them on!

367
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,951
Doors, unlock them!

368
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,329
- You can't keep people in cells.
- Dr. Edwardes.

369
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,041
Fools babbling about guilt complexes.
What do you know about them?

370
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,168
He did it.

371
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,797
He told me he killed his father.

372
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,385
Put the lights on. Quick!

373
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,054
It's dark. It's dark.

374
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,306
- He's in collapse.
- He's ill.

375
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,477
He didn't look like a heart case.

376
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,772
Not heart, shock of some sort.
Must be brought about by exhaustion.

377
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,649
Take him up to his room.
I'll take care of him.

378
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,048
I'm sorry.

379
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,387
I suppose I made quite an exhibition of myself.

380
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,059
Who brought me down here? You?

381
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,153
It's rather a mess.
Going to pieces in surgery.

382
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,740
Who are you?

383
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,296
I remember now.

384
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,466
Edwardes is dead.

385
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,346
I killed him and took his place.

386
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,974
I'm someone else, I don't know who.

387
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,521
I killed him. Edwardes.

388
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,283
I have no memory.

389
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,662
It's like looking into a mirror
and seeing nothing but the mirror.

390
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,623
Yet the image is there.
I know it's there.

391
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,291
I exist, I'm there.

392
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,128
How can a man lose his memory,
his name, everything he's ever known,

393
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,632
and still talk like this,
as if he were quite sane?

394
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,971
- Are you afraid of me?
- No. You're ill.

395
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,848
Loss of memory is not a difficult problem.

396
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,809
Yes, I know, amnesia.

397
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,312
A trick of the mind for remaining sane.

398
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,400
You remain sane by forgetting
something too horrible to remember.

399
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,652
You put the horrible thing
behind a closed door.

400
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,070
We have to open that door.

401
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,156
- I know what's behind that door. Murder.
- No!

402
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,994
That's a delusion you have acquired
out of illness.

403
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,204
Will you answer me truthfully
and trust me?

404
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:46,417
I trust you, but it's no use.
I can't think. I don't know who I am.

405
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,919
I don't know, I don't know.

406
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,880
Who telephoned you yesterday?

407
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,883
- Telephoned me?
- Yes. There in the office.

408
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,845
Yes, I remember.

409
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,889
What did she say?

410
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:06,687
She said she was my office assistant.
She was worried about me, hadn't heard.

411
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,732
You mean she was Dr. Edwardes' assistant
and hadn't heard from him.

412
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,191
What else did she say?

413
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,737
She didn't recognize my voice,
that I wasn't Dr. Edwardes.

414
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,198
- You hung up in anger?
- I was confused.

415
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,575
My head ached.

416
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,952
- Was that your first doubt?
- First doubt?

417
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,538
The first time you became confused as Edwardes?

418
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,375
Did anything else happen before that?

419
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,628
Yes.

420
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,049
When I was in the hotel room
packing to come here

421
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,801
I found a cigarette case in my coat.

422
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,888
It frightened me.
I didn't know why it should.

423
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,139
Here.

424
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,895
The initials J.B. See them?

425
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,273
When I saw them in the hotel room,

426
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,610
they made my head ache.

427
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,240
Well, they're probably your initials.

428
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,079
J.B., J.B.

429
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,963
You must sleep. I think... 
When you wake up, you'll be able to tell me more,

430
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,800
- if you trust me.
- I trust you.

431
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:22,304
It's late. You'd better get some sleep yourself.
I'll be all right.

432
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,355
I'm sure there will be no police inquiry
for a few days.

433
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,357
We'll talk about it
and straighten everything out

434
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,025
before anything happens.

435
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,366
I'll come in in the morning
and report you too ill for service.

436
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,834
I have been in Dr. Edwardes' office
for five years,

437
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,171
and the man who spoke to me
is not Dr. Edwardes.

438
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,048
He let me have my vacation
when he left on his.

439
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,594
I was very worried
when I didn't hear from him last week.

440
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:47,681
Then I thought he might have just come here
without reopening his office.

441
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,101
- That's why I telephoned.
- Show them the picture.

442
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,269
Yes.

443
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,364
- That's a different man.
- He was taking a chance.

444
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,201
Somebody might have known
what Edwardes looked like.

445
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,203
You never saw the real Edwardes?

446
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,538
No, I never met him.

447
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,958
But I felt something was wrong
from the moment our man appeared.

448
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,045
He didn't impress me as a scientist.

449
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,590
Last night when he collapsed,
I became actually alarmed.

450
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,218
What do you think
made him break down last night?

451
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,386
It's obvious now. Garmes.

452
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,225
Our impostor, I'm almost certain,
is an amnesia case.

453
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,102
Garmes brought him back to reality
for an instant.

454
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,105
Being unable to face the truth
of who he was, he collapsed.

455
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,317
- You think he may have killed Edwardes?
- There's no question of it.

456
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:44,613
He killed Dr. Edwardes and took his place
in order to conceal his crime

457
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,658
by pretending the victim
was still alive.

458
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,745
This sort of unrealistic act
is typical of the shortsighted cunning

459
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,456
that goes with paranoid behavior.

460
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,626
We're wasting time, gentlemen.
His room is upstairs.

461
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,313
Oh. Uh, this is Dr. Petersen.

462
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,025
- These gentlemen are from the police.
- The police?

463
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,946
- What has happened?
- Nothing to be alarmed about.

464
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,782
Our Dr. Edwardes turns out
to be a paranoid impostor.

465
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,869
He's very likely guilty
of having murdered the real Edwardes.

466
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,370
He's disappeared.

467
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,498
He is not in his room?

468
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,793
- You left him in his room, miss?
- Yes.

469
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,505
Did he say anything about himself,
about why he broke down?

470
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:47,301
No. He was not himself.
He was unable to speak coherently.

471
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,304
You don't seem very surprised to learn
that this Dr. Edwardes is a fake

472
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,889
and may be guilty of murder.

473
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,183
I'm used to such surprises in my work.

474
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,227
You suspected something then?

475
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,523
No. I thought his collapse
due to mental strain.

476
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,817
That's a funny diagnosis for a fellow

477
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,986
who's supposed to have
just come from vacation.

478
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,362
I made no medical diagnosis.

479
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,157
I was shocked to see him collapse
and didn't think beyond that.

480
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,285
We were all pretty shocked, Sheriff.
The fellow took us all in.

481
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,037
All except Dr. Murchison.

482
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,999
And he didn't say anything
that might give you an idea of where he went?

483
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,208
No.

484
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,047
He may be hanging around.
We'll have to go over the grounds first.

485
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,681
I'm sorry this has happened to you, Constance.

486
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,976
I felt like warning you about him,
but I wasn't certain.

487
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:41,229
Don't worry. It's not your fault.
They're bound to find him.

488
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,732
I'll keep you informed
of the police activities.

489
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,842
I say the fellow expected to get away with it
like any criminal.

490
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,136
Nonsense. Obviously, a case of amnesia.

491
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,390
He hadn't the faintest notion
of who he was or what he was doing.

492
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,392
What do you say, Constance?

493
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,727
I don't know.

494
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,022
You know, if you were anybody
but Constance Petersen, the human glacier

495
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,024
and the custodian of truth, I'd say...

496
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,068
Yes, you'd say what?

497
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,071
My dear, forgive me my scurvy thoughts.
You are telling the truth.

498
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,116
I was going to say
that you were holding something back.

499
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,909
I'm a sentimental ass.

500
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,911
A woman like you
could never become involved emotionally

501
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,288
with any man, sane or insane.

502
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,290
I suggest you change the subject, Fleurot.

503
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,168
I would be very interested
to ask him certain questions

504
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,587
when they bring him back here.
No matter what you think.

505
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,631
You'll never ask our mystery man
any questions.

506
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:50,799
Why not?

507
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,677
For the very good reason,
the police will never find him alive.

508
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,013
Amnesia case of that sort
with the police after him,

509
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,806
it's an obvious suicide.

510
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,183
The fellow'll put an end
to his pain and nightmare fantasies

511
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,687
either by blowing his brains out
or dropping himself out of a window.

512
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,357
You're offending Dr. Petersen
with your callousness.

513
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,944
I'm sorry, Constance, that our staff
retains the manners of medical students.

514
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,114
I'm not offended.

515
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,160
I think Dr. Fleurot's ideas are quite accurate,
but I'm rather tired. Good night.

516
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,327
Good night.

517
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,622
<i>The police have asked me to announce</i>

518
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,999
<i>that our neighborhood roads</i>

519
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:28,003
<i>are free of the dangerous madman
who escaped from Green Manors.</i>

520
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,964
<i>The search for the impostor
has shifted to Manhattan.</i>

521
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,885
<i>This is WQZK Brooklyn, George Bell.</i>

522
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,138
<i>We now resume our regularly scheduled program.</i>

523
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,115
Sure feels good
to take the weight off your feet.

524
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,039
I'm from Pittsburgh.

525
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,708
There's a town for you.

526
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,545
Really can meet people in Pittsburgh.

527
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,214
Friendly.

528
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,593
Fellow could live and die in this town,
and he couldn't meet nobody.

529
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,890
How about you and me
having a nice little drink together

530
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,809
now that we're acquainted?

531
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,978
No, thank you.

532
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,106
You don't have to be so snooty about it.

533
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:16,570
I'll have you know, madam,
that I know better people than you in Pittsburgh.

534
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,240
Yeah, I'm sure you're a great social success,
given half a chance.

535
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,909
Now you're talking.

536
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,495
Do you mind not sitting in my lap in public?

537
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,581
That's enough of that.

538
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,749
Beat it.

539
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:34,087
I'll have you know, I'm a guest in this hotel.
Who do you think you are?

540
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,090
I'm the house detective. Get going.

541
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,761
This town's getting worse and worse.

542
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,433
That's all right, lady,
you don't have to go.

543
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,436
I'm sorry you were being annoyed.
I've been watching you for some time,

544
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,688
and I figured something like this
might happen.

545
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:56,443
The chief duty of a house detective
is to spot trouble in advance.

546
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,279
- You're not registered here, are you?
- No.

547
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,948
I didn't think so,
the way you were wandering around.

548
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,367
Looking for somebody?

549
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,286
Don't be afraid of me.

550
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:11,458
I've got you spotted as a lady in trouble
and from out of town.

551
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,047
Schoolteacher or librarian, which is it?

552
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,174
- Schoolteacher.
- I thought so.

553
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,010
They always look like
they just lost something.

554
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:25,013
- Maybe I can help you.
- I don't think so, thank you.

555
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:28,558
Looking for some man, I suppose.
Must be a relative.

556
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,021
And from the worried look,
I'd say a pretty close one.

557
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,023
A husband, for instance.

558
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,152
- I'm really amazed.
- I hit it, huh?

559
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,403
But how could you tell?

560
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,324
I'm a kind of a psychologist.
You know, you got to be in my line.

561
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,579
Now, would you mind filling in
a few of the blank spaces for me?

562
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,833
No. It's just that we quarreled.

563
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:59,422
And then you got sorry and came running after him.
That's the usual psychology.

564
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,591
But now you're afraid to face him.

565
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,176
No, no.

566
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,180
It's that I don't know
what room he's in.

567
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:10,183
He told a friend he was coming to this hotel
but under a different name

568
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,851
so I couldn't find him.

569
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,689
But I must find him and apologize
and make him feel better.

570
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,191
When did he arrive here?

571
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,194
Yesterday morning.

572
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,071
Give me a description of him.

573
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,284
He's very tall and attractive.

574
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,955
Dark hair, a rather rugged face

575
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,292
and brown eyes and one suitcase.

576
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,043
I'll go check on him.

577
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,081
Did you find him?

578
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,416
Well, I think we got a line.

579
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,753
About 25 guys answering your description
registered here yesterday.

580
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,840
These are their registration cards.
You might recognize the handwriting.

581
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,092
That's very clever of you.

582
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,271
- This is his handwriting.
- John Brown, huh?

583
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,941
Not much imagination for an alias.
Room 3033.

584
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,694
Thank you very much. I was going
to sit here all day watching for him.

585
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,947
I know you would. I'm glad to be of service.
I'm a married man myself

586
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,951
and I know how it feels to have a wife
come chasing after you to apologize.

587
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,174
Constance.

588
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,304
What did you come for?
You don't owe me anything.

589
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,182
I'm going to do what I want to do.

590
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,477
Take care of you, cure you,
and remain with you till that happens.

591
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,646
But you can't,
you can't help hide a criminal.

592
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,148
You're not going to jeopardize
your standing as a doctor.

593
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,527
You're just getting started.
I won't let you be stupid about it.

594
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,029
I couldn't bear it away from you.

595
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:31,157
I went through yesterday holding my breath
as if I were being hunted.

596
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:35,036
I couldn't eat or work or do anything
but think of you.

597
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,746
So I had to come.

598
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,418
I'll get a room on this floor.
I'm here as your doctor only.

599
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,921
It has nothing to do with love.

600
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,219
Nothing at all.

601
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,555
Nothing at all.

602
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,059
Try remembering.

603
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:02,105
Let your mind go back to your childhood.
Was it happy?

604
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,691
Whom did you know in your childhood?

605
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,527
I'm haunted, but I...

606
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,114
I can't see by what.

607
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,868
- It's no use.
- You lived somewhere.

608
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,871
You had a mother, you were loved,
you had friends.

609
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,040
Yes. Probably a wife.

610
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,253
Can you remember her?

611
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,382
I didn't say I had one.

612
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,259
I said I probably had.

613
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:37,307
No, darling. Thank heaven,
I can't remember a wife.

614
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,767
I would like to ask you
a medical question.

615
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:44,439
Constance, would you mind not prodding me?
It mixes me up.

616
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,068
I can't remember anything.

617
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,236
Except that I love you.

618
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,906
How would you diagnose a pain
in the right upper quadrant?

619
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,657
A pain that is persistent?

620
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,078
Gall bladder, possibly a heart case,
or pneumonia,

621
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,331
depending on the patient's history.

622
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,082
It's obvious you're a doctor.

623
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,420
Yes. The eminent Dr. X.

624
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,966
And if we can unlock one tiny memory,
it will give us a key to the others.

625
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,176
No.

626
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,765
The only thing that comes to my mind
that I keep thinking over and over,

627
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,100
- is the logic of the situation.
- What logic?

628
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,686
That it was I who was with Edwardes.

629
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,777
"Police believe the impostor
who escaped from Green Manors

630
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,404
"to be the patient who visited
the real Dr. Edwardes

631
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:38,201
"in the Cumberland Mountains
the day that the noted psychiatrist disappeared.

632
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,704
"No trace of Dr. Edwardes has been found
since he left the Cumberland Resort

633
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,290
"in the company of his supposed patient."

634
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,959
- Do you remember that?
- No.

635
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,962
Why do you believe then
that you were with him?

636
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,382
Because wherever we went,
I came back with his identity.

637
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,967
I wouldn't have come back as Dr. Edwardes

638
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,344
if I hadn't known that he was dead.

639
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,055
How would I know that he was dead
if I hadn't been with him when he died?

640
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,640
Were you?

641
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,475
I don't remember,

642
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,854
but, logically, I know that I must have been.

643
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,360
Logically, I also know
why the body hasn't been found.

644
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,406
Because it was hidden by me.

645
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,534
Don't you see
that you are imagining all this?

646
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:23,871
You call yourself names.
You insist without proof that you're a murderer.

647
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,374
You know what that is, don't you?

648
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,419
Whoever you are,
it's a guilt complex that speaks for you.

649
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,547
A guilt fantasy that goes way back
to your childhood.

650
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,510
I think you're quite mad.
You're much crazier than I

651
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,430
to do all this
for a creature without a name,

652
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,266
to run off with a pair of initials.

653
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:52,692
The police have not given your name
or case history to the papers.

654
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,238
That must mean one thing.
That your name was not in Dr. Edwardes' files.

655
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,199
You were in an accident.

656
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,369
Where was it?

657
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,539
What happened to your hand?
Your hand was burned.

658
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,585
You've had an operation
in the last six months.

659
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,630
A skin graft. Third degree burns.

660
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,549
Your hand was burned. Where?

661
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,760
- It hurts.
- Try remembering.

662
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:22,889
My hand hurts.

663
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:26,100
Your hand is remembering.
Open your mind and the pain will leave.

664
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,102
- Where did it happen?
- I can't. It hurts.

665
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,979
- What happened?
- It's burning. My hand's burning.

666
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,898
Try to remember.

667
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:46,579
- My dear, are you all right?
- I'm all right. What happened?

668
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,082
You relived an accident you've been in.

669
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,335
But the memory only touched
the part of your mind that feels.

670
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,171
But it's a beginning. It really is.

671
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,589
You'll feel better soon.

672
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,259
Who could that be?

673
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:04,263
I know. I sent down
for the later editions of the papers.

674
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,769
- You ordered the afternoon papers?
- Yes.

675
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,146
- They came. I brought them right up.
- Just a minute.

676
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,989
- Here you are. Thank you.
- Thanks.

677
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,120
My picture's in the paper.
He recognized me.

678
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,871
We've got to go. Quick.
We can't pack.

679
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:11,497
Listen, when you left the mountains,
you must have passed through New York.

680
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,999
Wherever you came from,
wherever you went,

681
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,542
you must've been in a railroad station.

682
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,712
You must have heard Edwardes
ask for tickets to somewhere.

683
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,674
- I don't remember.
- You will.

684
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,511
When you come to the ticket window,
try to relive that other time with Edwardes.

685
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,849
Try to repeat what was said then.
Ask for the same tickets.

686
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,185
I'll try.

687
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,780
One, Philadelphia.

688
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,874
Philadelphia. $3.39, including the total
with tax. Thank you.

689
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,884
You went someplace with Edwardes.
Ask for tickets to that same place.

690
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,095
$8.46, including tax. Thank you.

691
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,560
What is it?

692
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,314
What do you want, sir?

693
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,654
Can you please step aside?

694
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,573
I want two tickets.

695
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,575
Where to?

696
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:34,956
Rome.

697
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,000
- Rome.
- To where?

698
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,420
- Rome.
- What Rome?

699
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,008
He means Rome, Georgia.

700
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,436
Is there anything wrong?

701
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,356
My husband is ill. I'm taking him home.

702
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,608
Here you are.
Two tickets to Rome, Georgia.

703
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,444
He'll be all right in a minute.
These dizzy spells go away quickly.

704
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,781
- He looks sick. I'll call a doctor.
- No, no, he'll be all right.

705
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,616
Do you feel better now, darling?
Darling?

706
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,452
Pull yourself together.
You're all right.

707
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,037
When does the train for Rome leave?

708
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,291
Birmingham Special.
Leaves in 10 minutes. Track 17.

709
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,460
- I feel better now.
- Thank you.

710
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,005
That's all right, I'll take him to the train
in case anything happens.

711
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,506
He has recovered now.

712
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,384
You're very nice to offer help,
but I can get along. Thank you.

713
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,868
Act as if we are taking this train.
We walk down-aways and then turn back.

714
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,537
- What's the matter with this train?
- The policeman heard us buy the tickets.

715
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,164
- Did he act suspicious?
- No, he was very nice.

716
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,749
But when he goes
to the police station tonight,

717
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,376
he may find descriptions of us posted
and he'll remember us.

718
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,670
They'll telegraph Rome, Georgia,
and have us picked up.

719
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,548
We can't go back to the hotel.
They'll have a million police there by now.

720
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,926
We're not going back.
We're going to Rochester.

721
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,178
Come on, we'll go over
to the Grand Central Station.

722
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,977
By the way, what are we going
to Rochester for?

723
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,938
We're going to visit Dr. Brulov.

724
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,689
That's the fellow who doesn't like
sauce bottles.

725
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,025
He was my analyst.
He psychoanalyzed me.

726
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,777
Really? What was wrong with you?

727
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,237
All analysts have to be psychoanalyzed
by other analysts

728
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,073
before they start practicing.

729
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,742
That's to make sure
that they're not too crazy.

730
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,870
Apparently, the mind is never too ill
to make jokes about psychoanalysis.

731
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,747
I'm sorry. I'm a pig.

732
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,707
I am. I keep forgetting you're a patient.

733
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,042
So do I.

734
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,544
When I hold you like this,
I feel entirely well.

735
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,047
Will you love me just as much
when I'm normal?

736
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,716
I'll be insane about you.

737
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,593
I am normal.

738
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:59,058
At least, there's nothing wrong with me
that a nice, long kiss wouldn't cure.

739
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,061
I've never treated a guilt complex
that way before.

740
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,571
- We don't want to attract attention.
- Everybody's doing it.

741
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,453
- You both going?
- Yes.

742
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,257
Don't read the paper.
Let's pick up where we left off.

743
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,425
Pick up what?

744
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,429
Try to recall the first moment you thought
you were Edwardes.

745
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,807
- Darling, I have a confession to make.
- Yes, I'm listening.

746
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,852
As a doctor, you irritate me.

747
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,938
I sit here swooning with love,
and then suddenly you ask me a question

748
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,273
and I don't like you anymore.

749
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,941
Do you have to sit there smiling at me

750
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,110
like some smug know-it-all schoolteacher?

751
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,779
I can't help smiling.
That's what happens in analysis.

752
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,657
As the doctor begins to uncover the truth
for the patient,

753
00:58:56,825 --> 00:59:01,370
said patient develops a fine,
hearty hatred of said doctor.

754
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,665
You're going to hate me a great deal
before we're through.

755
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,460
- And you're gonna like that.
- As a scientist, yes.

756
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,756
And if I shall happen to biff you one,
you'll consider that sort of a diploma.

757
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,507
Yes, but don't biff too hard.

758
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,968
No, I think we should go on
with our investigation.

759
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,304
We have some new facts
to work with now.

760
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,806
- What facts?
- You're a doctor,

761
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,185
you were in an accident,
your hand and forearm were burned,

762
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,146
- and you were in Rome.
- I was never in Rome in my life.

763
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,482
You were either there or going there.

764
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,860
You remembered something, no doubt
connected with the burning of your hand.

765
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,198
Rome. Think of Rome.

766
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,200
Maybe Rome, Italy.

767
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,494
When did you go to Rome?

768
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,704
What did you do in Rome?

769
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,373
Think.

770
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,676
Rome.

771
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,100
Yes. I remember something.

772
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,685
- Fighter planes spotted us.
- You were flying?

773
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,438
Transport, Medical Corps.
Over Rome, heading north.

774
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,398
- What happened?
- They hit us.

775
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,692
Caught fire. Uniform burned.
Bailed out.

776
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,027
What else?

777
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,365
I don't know. It blacks out.

778
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,200
You left the Army?

779
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,077
Yeah.

780
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,705
I probably deserted. I hated it.

781
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,583
I hated killing.
I can remember that much.

782
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,795
Your guilt fantasies were obviously inflamed
by your duties as a soldier.

783
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,798
Stop it.

784
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,300
Babbling like some phony King Solomon!

785
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,470
Sit there full of half-witted devil talk
that doesn't make sense!

786
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,973
If there's anything I hate,
it's a smug woman!

787
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:52,606
Darling, we're just beginning.
Don't biff too hard yet.

788
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,620
I worked as Dr. Brulov's assistant for a year,
right after my internship.

789
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,748
He got me the post at Green Manors.
You'll like Alex.

790
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,586
I doubt that.
One psychoanalyst in my hair's enough.

791
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:17,464
- What are you gonna tell him?
- That we are on our honeymoon.

792
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,510
Doctor, you think of
the most wonderful prescriptions.

793
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,598
- Good evening. Is Dr. Brulov in?
- No, he went out right after dinner.

794
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,807
He ought to be back soon.

795
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,395
Would you mind telling him
I've left his supper on the table?

796
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:33,939
I'm sorry, but I can't wait any longer.

797
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,442
There are two gentlemen
waiting for him in there.

798
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,993
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

799
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,428
How's your mother been lately?

800
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,473
She's still complaining about rheumatism.

801
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,726
She figures I ought to get transferred
down to Florida.

802
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,021
I said, "Do you expect me
to sacrifice all chance of promotion

803
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,731
"just because you've got rheumatism?"

804
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,568
Did you take the subject up with Hennessy?

805
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,655
Yeah. He said a transfer could be arranged,

806
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,157
but I'd probably have to start
all over again as a sergeant.

807
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,409
I said, "Personally, I think that's unfair.

808
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,079
"After all the work I did
on that narcotics case."

809
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,206
What did Hennessy say to that?

810
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:36,543
A lot of things. He made some crack
about me being a mama's boy.

811
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:48,264
Pardon me. That may be for me.
I gave headquarters this number.

812
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,432
Hello.

813
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,852
Yes. This is Lieutenant Cooley.
Any new developments?

814
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,106
When did you find that out?

815
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,902
No. Right. I'll be down later. Goodbye.

816
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:21,880
Alex.

817
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,882
Who is it, please?

818
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,259
My old friend!

819
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,553
- Alex.
- My dear darling.

820
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,431
I didn't have time to let you know.
I just arrived.

821
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:35,102
Imagine I find you here.
I would have come home quicker.

822
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,771
I was giving a lecture at the Army Hospital.

823
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,441
- Are these gentlemen with you?
- No. I'm here with...

824
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,110
Dr. Brulov, I'm Lieutenant Cooley
of Central Station.

825
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:46,322
- This is Sergeant Gillespie.
- What for?

826
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,033
We thought you might give us
some data on Dr. Edwardes.

827
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,242
Data?

828
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,163
What is this kind of persecution?

829
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:58,459
I told the policeman yesterday
I know nothing about Edwardes.

830
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,587
But yesterday, you had some kind of theory.

831
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,422
I explained to the policeman

832
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,508
that if Edwardes took along with him
on a vacation

833
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,344
a paranoid patient,

834
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:12,014
he was a bigger fool
than I ever knew he was.

835
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,808
It is the same as playing with a loaded gun.

836
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,019
Do you think this patient
might have killed him?

837
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,646
I'm not thinking anything.
I'm not a bloodhound.

838
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,607
Was Dr. Edwardes a great friend of yours?

839
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,902
What are you talking about?
The man was impossible.

840
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,030
You had a quarrel with him
when you were back in New York, I understand.

841
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:31,617
Not New York.
In Boston at the psychiatry convention.

842
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:35,662
What kind of an analyst is it
who wants to cure psychosis

843
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,124
by taking people skating
or to a bowling alley?

844
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,960
I understand you threatened
to punch his nose.

845
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,838
All I did was get up and walk out,

846
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,800
and kick over a few chairs
which nobody was sitting in.

847
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,968
So you don't have to ask me
any more questions.

848
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,470
You have now the facts.

849
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:55,182
Well, thank you very much.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

850
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:59,645
If anything turns up,
we'll let you know. Goodbye, ma'am.

851
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,647
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

852
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:12,825
What do you suppose
they are snooping around me for?

853
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,661
Next they will give me the third degree.

854
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,038
Alex, I'm so glad to see you.
I was going to write to you

855
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,749
but it happened so suddenly.
I got married.

856
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:22,918
Who is married?

857
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,004
Why, Alex, my husband, John Brown.

858
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,758
- I'm glad to meet you officially.
- So you are married.

859
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,387
There is nothing so nice
as a new marriage.

860
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:37,349
No psychoses yet, no aggressions,
no guilt complexes.

861
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,768
I congratulate you

862
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,772
and wish you have babies
and not phobias.

863
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:48,402
How about we have a glass of beer
like in the old days?

864
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,905
The truth is that we have no hotel room.
All the hotels were so crowded.

865
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,615
What do you want with a hotel?

866
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,369
That's for millionaires,
not for lovebirds on a honeymoon.

867
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,872
You will stay right here.

868
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,667
Look how I'm living by myself
with a can opener.

869
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:08,130
My housekeeper has gone to war,
my secretary is a WAC.

870
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:12,259
And I've got a cleaning woman
who can't cook and who hates me.

871
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:15,721
Cook me my coffee in the morning,
and the house is yours.

872
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,725
- That's wonderful of you, Alex.
- There's nothing wonderful about me.

873
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,436
It's nice to see my old assistant.

874
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,606
The youngest, but the best one I ever had.

875
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,775
But who knows now.

876
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,237
As my old friend Zannenbaum used to say,

877
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,408
"Women make the best psychoanalysts,

878
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,494
"till they fall in love.

879
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:42,247
"After that, they make the best patients."

880
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,086
Good night and happy dreams,

881
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,422
which we will analyze at breakfast.

882
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,342
Good night, Dr. Brulov.
Thanks for everything.

883
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,845
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine, so to speak.

884
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,764
- Good night, Alex.
- Good night.

885
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:17,324
- You were superb with the police.
- Was I?

886
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,368
Carried it off like a grade-A gun monger.

887
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:23,121
I felt terribly stupid for a few minutes
but it turned out very well.

888
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,457
Providing the professor
isn't wiser than he seems.

889
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,292
Alex? No.

890
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,003
Things are different here.
Someone's been here since my time.

891
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,214
Alex didn't think anything.
He's sweet.

892
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,343
He may be sweet, but he didn't
even ask us where our bags were.

893
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:40,472
Alex is always like that,
in a complete dream state socially.

894
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,648
Do you know, this room
does look changed,

895
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,316
but it isn't.

896
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:55,821
It's I who have changed.
It's called transfer of affects.

897
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,322
What is?

898
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,325
The fact that everything seems
so wonderful in this room.

899
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,204
That's what it's called, is it?

900
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:05,998
Did the police disturb you?

901
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,835
No. One ignores such trifles
on a honeymoon.

902
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:16,383
- I take it this is your first honeymoon?
- Yes.

903
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,553
I mean, it would be if it were.

904
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:34,276
For what it's worth, I can't remember
ever having kissed any other woman before.

905
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,530
I have nothing to remember
of that nature, either.

906
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,532
You're very sweet.

907
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,745
- Of course I'm no child.
- Far from it.

908
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,080
I'm well aware that we're all
bundles of inhibitions.

909
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,624
Dynamite dumps!

910
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:50,459
No.

911
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,880
- Please don't do that.
- Why not?

912
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,050
It isn't ethical.
I'm here as your doctor.

913
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,219
Well, you can stop worrying, Doctor.
I'm going to sleep on the couch.

914
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,763
No, that's also unethical.

915
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,223
Now, this honeymoon is complicated enough

916
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,267
without your dragging
medical ethics into it.

917
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:10,729
- I suppose the floor is out?
- The patient always sleeps in the bed.

918
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:14,274
The doctor occupies the couch,
fully dressed.

919
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,485
I see you know the rules.

920
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:26,745
You remember something.

921
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,289
No.

922
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,960
This room reminds you of something.

923
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,796
No.

924
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,756
You're resisting a memory.
What is in your mind?

925
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,341
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do! You're resisting it.

926
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,759
Don't start that again.

927
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,762
Don't stand there with that wiseacre look.
I'm sick of your double talk.

928
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:47,265
You were looking at the bed.
What frightens you?

929
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,934
White lines.

930
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:53,689
When I made fork marks on the tablecloth,
they agitated you.

931
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,108
The night you kissed me,
you pushed me away because of my robe.

932
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,276
It was white, it had dark lines on it.

933
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,321
Try to think. Why does the color white frighten you?
Why do lines frighten you?

934
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:04,116
- Think of white. White.
- It frightens me. I can't look.

935
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,369
Don't turn away. Stand still.
Look at the white spread. Look at it, remember!

936
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:16,962
Darling.

937
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,673
Oh, darling.

938
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,427
You mustn't be frightened.

939
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,637
You mustn't. We are making progress.

940
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,683
We have the word "white" on our side.

941
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,691
Is that you, Mr. Brown?

942
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,445
Oh, I thought it was you.

943
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:15,909
I was unable to sleep,
so I came down to work.

944
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:20,789
When you are old,
you don't need to sleep so much.

945
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:24,668
I'm just having a glass of milk
and some crackers.

946
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,211
Join me, please.

947
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,630
I'll get another glass.

948
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,216
I'm glad to have company.

949
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:35,637
Nobody likes to have
crackers and milk by himself.

950
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:41,893
When I was a young man,
I was always saying,

951
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,938
"If I could only get alone by myself

952
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,732
"instead of wasting my time with people,

953
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,275
"I would be happy."

954
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,071
Now I am saying just the opposite.

955
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,491
This is the secret of old age.

956
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,661
Everything becomes just the opposite.

957
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,539
Do you know who makes
the most trouble in the world?

958
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,708
Old people.

959
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,751
They are always worrying

960
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:11,631
what is going to be in the world tomorrow
after they are gone.

961
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,926
That's why they have wars.

962
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:19,139
Because old people got nothing else
they can get excited about.

963
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,521
Well, we will drink to you,

964
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,651
to when we are young
and know nothing except living.

965
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,904
Alex. Alex, are you all right?

966
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,991
Good morning.

967
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,369
Yes, I am all right, thank you.

968
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,164
- I fell asleep in the chair.
- Yes.

969
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,333
- What time is it?
- 7:00.

970
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:34,172
I was dreaming this morning
I get some real coffee.

971
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:39,344
My husband must have gone out very early
this morning. You didn't happen...

972
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,764
He didn't go out.
He's over there on the couch.

973
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,769
He's all right. He's sleeping fine.

974
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:53,191
My dear child, do you think
old Alex Brulov,

975
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,486
one of the biggest brains
who is in psychiatry,

976
01:16:56,654 --> 01:17:00,532
is unable to make out 
two and two come out four?

977
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,702
I should have known.

978
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:09,374
The moment I see you with a husband
whose pupils are enlarged,

979
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,918
who has a tremor of the left hand,

980
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,462
who's on a honeymoon with no baggage,

981
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,382
and whose name is John Brown,

982
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,051
I know practically what is going on.

983
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,303
What happened?

984
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,305
Only what I expected.

985
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:31,104
There is no use taking chances
with a possibly dangerous case.

986
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:34,232
I sit here waiting.

987
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,568
If you scream, I am ready.

988
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,905
So he comes downstairs,
and he's dangerous.

989
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,116
I can see by his face.

990
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,493
So I keep talking

991
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,830
while I put some bromide
into a glass of milk.

992
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,584
Enough to knock out three horses.

993
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:56,129
When he falls down,
I run up to see you.

994
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,173
You are sleeping like a baby,

995
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,633
and I come back here to watch out.

996
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,138
The struggle against his condition
agitates him at times,

997
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,931
but there's no danger in him.

998
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,977
This is what I found
in his hand last night.

999
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,110
He didn't know he had that.
Alex, you mustn't think that.

1000
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:20,945
He didn't try to do anything to you,
he couldn't.

1001
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,448
My dear child, he's not responsible.

1002
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,617
But that's not correct.

1003
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:30,330
I'm just a little more experienced
with his type than you.

1004
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,208
I grant you know infinitely more than I do
but in this...

1005
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:38,046
Do not complete this sentence
with the usual female contradictions.

1006
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,215
You grant me I know more than you.

1007
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,342
But on the other hand
you know more than me.

1008
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,637
- Women's talk.
- Alex, what are you going to do?

1009
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:48,223
Something more for you, than for me.
I'm calling the police.

1010
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:53,061
- No, no, please...
- You are giving me orders. My own pupil.

1011
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,605
You don't know this man,
you know only science.

1012
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,607
You know his mind,
but you don't know his heart.

1013
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,818
We are speaking of a schizophrenic,

1014
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,946
and not a valentine.

1015
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,907
We are speaking of a man.

1016
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,075
Oh.

1017
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,245
I see. Love.

1018
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,666
Look at you.

1019
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,711
Dr. Petersen, the promising psychoanalyst,

1020
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,546
is now all of a sudden

1021
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:24,425
a schoolgirl in love with an actor,
nothing else.

1022
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:28,012
- Alex, let me tell you about him.
- What is there for you to say?

1023
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,015
We both know that the mind
of a woman in love

1024
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,936
is operating on the lowest level
of the intellect.

1025
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,940
Doctor told me not to smoke in the morning,
but I am too excited.

1026
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,944
You're right.

1027
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:48,366
I'm not an analyst, not even a doctor.
I'm not talking to you as one.

1028
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,369
But believe me, not what I say,
but what I feel.

1029
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,371
The mind isn't everything.

1030
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,374
The heart can see deeper sometimes.

1031
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,212
The shock of a police investigation
might ruin his chances for recovery,

1032
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,714
and I can save him.

1033
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,633
But if he killed Dr. Edwardes,
how can you help him?

1034
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,385
He didn't, he didn't.

1035
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,680
But if it turns out he did,
which I am good and certain it will.

1036
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,974
It won't. You yourself taught me
what Freud says.

1037
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,436
A man cannot do anything in amnesia
that his real character wouldn't have done.

1038
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:20,064
And how do you know
what his real character is?

1039
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,567
I know. I know.

1040
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,985
She knows.

1041
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,156
This is the way science goes backward.

1042
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,283
Who told you what he is?

1043
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,244
Freud? Or a crystal ball?

1044
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,165
I couldn't feel this way toward a man
who was bad,

1045
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,375
who had committed murder.

1046
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:45,089
I couldn't feel this pain
for someone who was evil.

1047
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,801
You are 20 times crazier than him.

1048
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,554
"She couldn't love him
if he was no good."

1049
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,932
This is baby talk, nothing else.

1050
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,478
What do you want I should do?

1051
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,314
Give me time to treat him and cure him
before the police find him,

1052
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:04,150
and shock him into an incurable condition.

1053
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,861
- This could take a year.
- No. No, no.

1054
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,822
All right, half a year?

1055
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,325
We should sit and hide for half a year,

1056
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:16,871
waiting to find out if he's going
to cut your throat, my throat,

1057
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,832
and set fire to the house.

1058
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,834
Oh, my dear girl.

1059
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,795
Even to a woman in love,

1060
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:27,298
such a situation must seem
a little unreasonable.

1061
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,305
Just a few more days, Alex,
before you turn him over.

1062
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:37,934
Just a few more days, and then
if I can't do anything,

1063
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,062
if we both can't,
then you can call the police.

1064
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:44,232
You're not hiding a criminal.
There's no evidence against him

1065
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,150
except his own guilt fantasies.
He's wanted only

1066
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,112
as a possible witness
as to what happened to Dr. Edwardes.

1067
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,490
But in his present condition,
he could tell the police nothing.

1068
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,243
Don't you see you're doing nothing
against the law?

1069
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:59,038
We are helping them
by investigating the patient as doctors.

1070
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,333
Doctors who want the truth
even more than they do.

1071
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:07,713
All right.

1072
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:12,343
- You'll wait?
- Go make me coffee.

1073
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:16,055
I'll pretend to myself
I'm acting sensible for a few days.

1074
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,106
Thank you.

1075
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,275
Thank you very much.

1076
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,782
I'll make you coffee, with an egg.

1077
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,238
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Brulov.

1078
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,324
Brulov? Yeah, that's right.

1079
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,914
Bromides. Who's been feeding me bromides?

1080
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,999
I gave you, to sleep.

1081
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,085
Brulov.

1082
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,465
Oh, yes. Rochester.

1083
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,095
What's your name?

1084
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,432
I don't know.

1085
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,606
- Constance told you.
- Nobody told me.

1086
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:53,194
If I don't know a patient with amnesia
when I see one, what do I know?

1087
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,947
You don't remember your father or mother?

1088
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,114
No.

1089
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,116
- Wife or sweetheart?
- No.

1090
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,495
Don't fight me.
I'm going to help you, if I can.

1091
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,332
I'm going to be your father image.

1092
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,293
I want you to look on me
like your father.

1093
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,295
Trust me, lean on me.

1094
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:16,008
It's a shortcut, but we haven't much time.

1095
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,386
All right. Go ahead, I'm leaning.

1096
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,930
Maybe you've got something
you want to tell me,

1097
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,933
a single thought,
a few words in the corner of your head.

1098
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,935
Go on, talk to me.

1099
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:29,814
Whatever comes into your head,
just say what it is.

1100
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,525
There's nothing.

1101
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:34,860
Maybe you dreamt something?

1102
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:40,616
- Yeah.
- What did you dream?

1103
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,328
I don't believe in dreams.
That Freud stuff's a lot of hooey.

1104
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:48,082
You are a fine one to talk.

1105
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,711
You've got amnesia,
and you've got a guilt complex.

1106
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:55,256
You don't know if you are
coming or going from someplace,

1107
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,258
but Freud is hooey.

1108
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:59,260
This you know.

1109
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,013
A wise guy.

1110
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,394
You don't like me, Papa.

1111
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,732
Do you want I should help you or not?

1112
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:16,861
I'm sorry.

1113
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:21,032
I'll explain to you about dreams,

1114
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,367
so you don't think it is hooey.

1115
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,287
The secrets of who you are

1116
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,623
and what has made you run away from yourself,

1117
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,126
all these secrets are buried in your brain.

1118
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,962
But you don't want to look at them.

1119
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,382
The human being very often doesn't want
to know the truth about himself,

1120
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,135
because he thinks it will make him sick.

1121
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:45,723
So he makes himself sicker
trying to forget.

1122
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,892
- You follow this?
- Yeah.

1123
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,897
- How do you feel?
- Coffee.

1124
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,357
Awful.

1125
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:59,236
The patient is going to tell us
what he dreamt.

1126
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,156
Fine, I'll take notes.
I'll get my glasses.

1127
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:06,452
Now here's where dreams come in.

1128
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,748
They tell you what you are trying to hide.

1129
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,250
But they tell it to you all mixed up,

1130
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,629
like pieces of a puzzle that don't fit.

1131
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:21,384
The problem of the analyst
is to examine this puzzle

1132
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,762
and put the pieces together
in the right place.

1133
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,223
And find out what the devil

1134
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:30,017
you are trying to say to yourself.

1135
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:35,022
Let's see.

1136
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:39,193
I kept thinking while I was dreaming
that all this meant something,

1137
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,279
that there was some other meaning in it
that I ought to find out.

1138
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,115
We'll find out.

1139
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:54,458
I can't make out just what sort
of a place it was.

1140
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,219
<i>It seemed to be a gambling house.</i>

1141
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,973
<i>But there weren't any walls,
just a lot of curtains</i>

1142
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:11,308
<i>with eyes painted on them.</i>

1143
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:15,229
<i>A man was walking around
with a large pair of scissors</i>

1144
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:17,815
<i>cutting all the drapes in half.</i>

1145
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,947
<i>And then a girl came in
with hardly anything on</i>

1146
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:28,659
<i>and started walking around the gambling room
kissing everybody.</i>

1147
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,412
<i>She came to my table first.</i>

1148
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,331
Did you recognize this kissing bug?

1149
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:40,129
I'm afraid she looked
a little like Constance.

1150
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:43,132
This is plain, ordinary,
wishful dreaming.

1151
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,675
Go on.

1152
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,221
I was sitting there playing cards
with a man who had a beard.

1153
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,559
<i>I was dealing to him.
I turned up a seven of clubs.</i>

1154
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,483
<i>He said, "That makes 21. I win."</i>

1155
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,860
<i>But when he turned up his cards,
they were blank.</i>

1156
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,529
<i>Just then, the proprietor came in
and accused him of cheating.</i>

1157
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:10,159
<i>The proprietor yelled "This is my place.
If I catch you again, I'll fix you."</i>

1158
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:15,289
I'm sorry about that kissing bug.

1159
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:19,126
I'm glad you didn't dream of me as an eggbeater,
as one of my patients did.

1160
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,628
Why? What would that mean?

1161
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,379
Never mind.

1162
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,882
Does it make any sense to you,
what I've dreamed?

1163
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,218
Not yet. You're trying
to tell yourself something.

1164
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,470
What it is, we'll figure out later.

1165
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,598
There's a lot more to it.

1166
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,810
Go on and try to recall the details.

1167
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,688
The more cockeyed,
the better for the scientific side of it.

1168
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:47,112
It was, leaning over the sloping roof
of a high building

1169
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,950
<i>was the man with the beard.
I yelled at him to watch out.</i>

1170
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:54,328
<i>Then he went over slowly,
with his feet in the air.</i>

1171
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:59,166
<i>And then I saw the proprietor again,
the man in the mask.</i>

1172
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:03,921
<i>He was hiding behind a tall chimney
and he had a small wheel in his hand.</i>

1173
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:09,677
<i>I saw him drop the wheel on the roof.</i>

1174
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,352
<i>Suddenly I was running.</i>

1175
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,312
<i>Then I heard something
beating over my head.</i>

1176
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,064
<i>It was a great pair of wings.</i>

1177
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,108
<i>The wings chased me
and almost caught up with me</i>

1178
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,986
<i>when I came to the bottom of the hill.</i>

1179
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,449
I must have escaped.
I don't remember.

1180
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,995
That's all there was.
I woke up and saw Dr. Brulov.

1181
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:38,330
- Have some coffee.
- Thanks.

1182
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,010
- Something's happening there.
- What is it?

1183
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,852
- Snow.
- The light frightened him.

1184
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,312
Photophobia.

1185
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:04,481
No. It was the snow.

1186
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:28,422
That's the white he's afraid of.
Snow and those tracks.

1187
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:33,093
- What tracks?
- The sled tracks in the snow.

1188
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,846
The first symptom he revealed
was shock at the sight of fork lines

1189
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,348
drawn on a white tablecloth.

1190
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:41,769
And my robe, which had dark lines on it.
And last night, the white coverlet,

1191
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:44,355
like those dark tracks in the snow.

1192
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,690
We'll pull the blinds down.

1193
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,693
Dr. Edwardes was fond of sports.

1194
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,780
He mentions tennis and skiing
in his book as valuable

1195
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:55,074
in the treatment of mental disorders.

1196
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:58,369
Skiing.

1197
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,872
Ski tracks in the snow.

1198
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,210
That's what those dark lines
symbolize for him.

1199
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:09,046
His horror of them means, of course,
that they are immediately connected

1200
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,714
with the cause of his amnesia.

1201
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:13,092
Yes. A murder on skis.

1202
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:27,606
Where did Edwardes go for his skiing?
We must find out.

1203
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:29,942
Can you tell us where? Try.

1204
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:33,153
He has told us already in his dream.

1205
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,905
Let me see your notes.

1206
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,159
What can we do for him?

1207
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,620
You're not his mama, you're an analyst.

1208
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,957
Leave him alone.
He'll come out of this by himself.

1209
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,626
The sloping roof.

1210
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:52,548
- That means only mountainside.
- They were skiing.

1211
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:55,926
The father image, the bearded man,
is Dr. Edwardes.

1212
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,596
That's very simple.
Dr. Edwardes plunged over the precipice while skiing.

1213
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:03,267
And then a shadow chases him
up and down a hill.

1214
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,937
That could mean he was escaping from a valley.

1215
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:10,941
Skiing resorts are often called valleys.
Like Sun Valley.

1216
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:14,778
He was being pursued by a winged figure,
a witch or a harpy.

1217
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,448
No. The figure was you.

1218
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:20,868
If you grew wings,
you would be an angel.

1219
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:24,705
The dream's trying to tell him
the name of the resort.

1220
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,374
Angel. Angel Valley.

1221
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,712
Do you remember Angel Valley?

1222
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:33,756
No.

1223
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,967
We can call a travel agency
and check all the resort names.

1224
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,511
It wasn't Angel Valley.

1225
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,515
I remember it.

1226
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:47,311
It was a place called Gabriel Valley.

1227
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:49,396
What else do you remember now?

1228
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,982
Who was the masked figure in your dream?

1229
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,108
It was an accident.

1230
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,903
Do you remember that, a skiing accident?
Dr. Edwardes went over a snow cliff.

1231
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:59,156
It was no accident! I can't stand this anymore.
I've had enough of it.

1232
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:02,076
We've got to call the police.

1233
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,746
No. We have to go to Gabriel Valley.
You've got to go with me.

1234
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:13,253
- This is for Cooley when he comes in.
- I'll tell him.

1235
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:21,178
At 4:45? Thank you. Goodbye.

1236
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,892
There's a train leaving in an hour.
We can make connections for Gabriel Valley.

1237
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:30,854
I know what I have to do.
I can't go on endangering you.

1238
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:33,440
- I know about last night.
- Nothing happened.

1239
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:36,276
But it will.
I've got to end it before it does.

1240
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,404
I love you, but I'm not worth loving.

1241
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:43,242
- Darling, you can help me afterward.
- There's no help afterward.

1242
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,285
If you give yourself up to the police
in your condition,

1243
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,205
there's no afterwards for either of us.
I can cure you.

1244
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:51,041
- But you can't undo a murder.
- There is none to undo.

1245
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,251
- I killed him.
- Stop it.

1246
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:55,546
And now, you... Last night...
Don't try to stop me, I've got to go.

1247
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,965
Guilt, guilt, you've lived with it
for a long time, haven't you?

1248
01:33:58,133 --> 01:33:59,133
Yes.

1249
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,218
- Since childhood.
- What?

1250
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:04,930
Ever since your childhood,
you've tried to run away from something.

1251
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,057
You've always felt guilty
about everything that happened around you.

1252
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,767
What was it in your youth?

1253
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:11,562
It must have been terrible for you
to prefer to think you murdered Edwardes

1254
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,064
rather than remember what happened long ago.

1255
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:19,486
You said you love me. Look at me.
Then, why am I fighting for you?

1256
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,905
- Because I love you. Because I need you.
- But I'm nothing.

1257
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,615
I want you to come with me
to Gabriel Valley.

1258
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:24,783
What good will that do?

1259
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,661
When you see the hill where the accident happened,
you'll remember it.

1260
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,288
We'll go skiing together
as you did with Edwardes.

1261
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:30,455
I was there, I killed him.

1262
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:33,083
You'll see your innocence,
you'll see what really happened.

1263
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:35,252
- You mean, because it will happen again?
- Yes.

1264
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,087
And what if I killed him?

1265
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:44,344
Isn't it true that
if the episode's repeated,

1266
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,598
I'm likely to do
the same thing I did before?

1267
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:51,518
Then how do you know I won't kill again?

1268
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:54,313
Because I'm convinced
you didn't kill in the first place.

1269
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:59,359
You believe in me enough
to take such a chance?

1270
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,111
Of course I do.

1271
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,280
We're going back to that ski run.

1272
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:04,948
We'll find out what it was
in your childhood

1273
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,117
that's haunted you all your life.

1274
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:09,870
We'll also find out what happened
to Dr. Edwardes.

1275
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:35,062
Did you ever see her before?

1276
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,148
Let's go.

1277
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:46,490
I've always loved very feminine clothes,
but never quite dared to wear them.

1278
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:51,954
But I'm going to after this,

1279
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:55,165
I'm going to wear exactly the things
that please me.

1280
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,375
And you.

1281
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:07,928
Even very funny hats.

1282
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,684
You know, the kind that makes you look
a little drunk?

1283
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,228
Put them on.

1284
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,070
<i>It was something in my childhood.</i>

1285
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,363
<i>Something in my childhood.</i>

1286
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:34,825
<i>I remember now. I killed my brother.</i>

1287
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:50,507
I didn't kill my brother.
It was an accident. It was an accident!

1288
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:54,511
That's what's haunted you all your life.
That was the memory you were afraid of.

1289
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:20,579
It's like looking into a picture book,
an old one,

1290
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:23,039
seeing the familiar pictures one at a time.

1291
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:27,878
I went to Columbia Medical School,
met a girl with a giggle,

1292
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,422
who luckily married my roommate, Ken.

1293
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:34,134
Oh, and by the way,
my name's John Ballyntine.

1294
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:35,927
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1295
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:39,973
Another thing, my Army record's all right.
I was invalided out.

1296
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:42,642
I ran into Dr. Edwardes
when I was in the Cumberland Mountains,

1297
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,479
trying to recover from some kind
of nerve shock I got

1298
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,481
when the plane crashed.

1299
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:49,483
He was on vacation
but I asked him to help me,

1300
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,401
and he invited me to go skiing with him.

1301
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,905
We went through New York.
I seem to remember

1302
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:59,075
going to lunch somewhere.
It's still a little vague about that luncheon part.

1303
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:03,079
Then we arrived here,
and the accident happened at that spot.

1304
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,624
Where you saved me.

1305
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:09,085
Now, let's not have any confusion
about who saved whom.

1306
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,465
Yes, he went over there, all right.
It's still a little foggy.

1307
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:15,926
But I do know that Edwardes
was about 50 feet ahead of me

1308
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,761
when he went over. I saw him plunge.

1309
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:20,931
That was the thing that set you off.
That stirred up your old guilt complex

1310
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,974
and made you think that you'd killed him.

1311
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:25,060
Then you had to run away from that, too.

1312
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:27,062
Then you took on the role of Dr. Edwardes

1313
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:31,441
to prove to yourself he wasn't dead,
so therefore, you had not killed him.

1314
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:36,947
Professor, I never quite realized
in my amnesic state how lovely you are.

1315
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:40,408
Now that you got your head back,
you mustn't lose it again.

1316
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,453
It's too late. I'm beyond cure.

1317
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,289
How does it feel to be a great analyst?

1318
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:47,791
Not so bad.

1319
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:50,335
- And a great detective?
- Wonderful.

1320
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:52,796
And madly adored?

1321
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,465
Very wonderful.

1322
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:59,344
You'll look wonderful in white

1323
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:02,973
with a little orange blossom in your hair.

1324
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:06,351
That sounds vaguely as if
it had something to do with marriage.

1325
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:09,312
That's a brilliant analysis, Doctor.

1326
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:15,402
Hello.

1327
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:18,905
You know Lieutenant Cooley
and Sergeant Gillespie from Rochester?

1328
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:20,448
Yes, yes, we know them quite well.

1329
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:21,741
How did you find us?

1330
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,577
With no thanks to your friend,
Dr. Brulov.

1331
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:27,747
We made a few inquiries at the railroad station.
You left a trail a mile wide.

1332
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,207
You arrived just in the nick of time.

1333
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:31,501
I believe that's the usual expression.

1334
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,213
We found the body of Dr. Edwardes.

1335
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:38,758
It's almost exactly where you told
the local police it would be.

1336
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:42,512
- You remember the spot very well.
- Thank goodness it's all cleared up.

1337
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,056
Not quite, Dr. Petersen.

1338
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:47,517
I'm afraid a bullet was found in the body.

1339
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,108
That's impossible.

1340
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:58,236
- It was in his back.
- The case is one of murder.

1341
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,032
We shall have to detain you, sir.

1342
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,577
It's my duty to inform you that anything you say
may be used against you.

1343
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:14,794
No.

1344
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,212
You mustn't say you killed him.

1345
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,132
Try to remember what happened
before Edwardes went over.

1346
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,010
But when he said he killed him,
he wasn't himself.

1347
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,387
He was in a state of great mental distress.

1348
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:26,765
You can't put him away. You can't!

1349
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:29,768
It'll destroy his mind.
Don't you understand?

1350
01:42:30,936 --> 01:42:32,562
Goodbye, my dear.

1351
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:38,068
We won't give up hope.
I'm going to fight and fight and get you free.

1352
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,118
My dear girl,

1353
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:51,331
you cannot keep bumping your head
against reality

1354
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,583
and saying it is not there.

1355
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,670
The evidence was definite.

1356
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,923
We can't remove it by wishing or crying.

1357
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,135
He trusted me.

1358
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:06,971
I led him into a trap.
I convicted him.

1359
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:09,974
Is that real enough for you?

1360
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:12,435
There is no one to blame.

1361
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:17,148
The case was a little deeper
than you figured.

1362
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:19,359
This often happens.

1363
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,611
You must realize now one thing.

1364
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:24,280
It is over for both of you.

1365
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,866
It's not over.

1366
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:29,869
- You will have other cases.
- It's not over. It never will be.

1367
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:33,498
Don't ask me to stop, I can't. I can't.

1368
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:41,172
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I...

1369
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:49,180
Thanks for straightening things out
with Dr. Murchison

1370
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:51,015
and everyone.

1371
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,692
It is very sad

1372
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,902
to love and lose somebody.

1373
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,573
But in a while, you'll forget,

1374
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,743
and you will take up the threads
of your life

1375
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:12,495
where you left off not so long ago

1376
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,956
and you will work hard.

1377
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:18,585
There's lots of happiness in working hard.

1378
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:20,170
Maybe the most.

1379
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,300
I will write to you.

1380
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,388
Oh, Alex.

1381
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:33,183
You're very good.

1382
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:40,857
I'm sorry to hurry you, Dr. Brulov,
but your car is waiting.

1383
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:44,027
- You have just time.
- Thank you.

1384
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,821
I'm always late, always forgetting.

1385
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:20,063
A brilliant man.

1386
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:22,232
I should have gone to the station with him.

1387
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:23,942
You're too tired.

1388
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:26,986
I know that feeling of exhaustion
only too well.

1389
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,447
One must humor it, or it explodes.

1390
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:33,868
I shall try to help you in every way.

1391
01:45:34,036 --> 01:45:36,454
- You will take care of yourself?
- Yes.

1392
01:45:36,622 --> 01:45:39,791
And try to forget things better forgotten.

1393
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,169
You've got a great career
ahead of you, Constance.

1394
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,589
Thank you. Well, at least
one good thing came out of all this.

1395
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:48,758
You are back at Green Manors.

1396
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:52,011
Who knows what would have happened
to the place under Dr. Edwardes?

1397
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,639
I knew Edwardes only slightly.

1398
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:57,183
I never really liked him.

1399
01:45:57,351 --> 01:46:00,478
But he was a good man,
in a way, I suppose.

1400
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:04,274
Well, good night, Constance.

1401
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:06,484
I hope you feel rested in the morning.

1402
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:17,453
<i>I knew Edwardes only slightly.</i>

1403
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:19,789
<i>I never liked him very well.</i>

1404
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,626
<i>I knew Edwardes only slightly.</i>

1405
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,629
<i>Knew Edwardes slightly.</i>

1406
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:30,300
<i>Knew Edwardes.</i>

1407
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:32,302
<i>Knew Edwardes slightly.</i>

1408
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:35,305
<i>Knew Edwardes.</i>

1409
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:37,473
<i>Knew.</i>

1410
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:40,059
<i>Knew.</i>

1411
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:42,645
<i>Knew.</i>

1412
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:52,423
Come in.

1413
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:56,386
I want to talk to you, Dr. Murchison.

1414
01:47:57,554 --> 01:48:00,223
It's rather late, and you need rest, Constance.

1415
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:02,225
I must talk to you.

1416
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:05,019
Nocturnal confidences are bad for the nerves.

1417
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,230
- Is it something about your work?
- Yes.

1418
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:10,274
- Can't it wait till morning?
- It can't wait.

1419
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:12,777
Do sit down.

1420
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:18,282
Now, what's your problem?

1421
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:22,161
It is a dream one of my patients reported.

1422
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,247
May I ask who the patient is?

1423
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:27,417
The patient is John Ballyntine.

1424
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,253
I fancied that.

1425
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,840
You're still working on
the possibility of his innocence.

1426
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:35,466
Charming loyalty.

1427
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:39,095
One of your most
attractive characteristics, Constance.

1428
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:41,848
What did he dream?

1429
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:44,767
He dreamt he was in a gambling house,
it was full of odd people

1430
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,602
playing with blank cards.

1431
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:50,440
Blank cards.

1432
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:53,317
Obviously the patient was trying to deny
it was a gambling house

1433
01:48:53,485 --> 01:48:55,611
by dreaming of spurious cards.

1434
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:59,115
One of the people in the place went around
cutting the drapes in half.

1435
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:02,994
Another was a scantily dressed girl
who was kissing everybody.

1436
01:49:03,162 --> 01:49:06,456
With a little effort, one could almost imagine
the inmates of Green Manors.

1437
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:09,167
That's what I had in mind,
Dr. Murchison.

1438
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:13,880
Interesting notion to play around with, isn't it?

1439
01:49:14,048 --> 01:49:15,173
Do go on.

1440
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:20,303
There were eyes painted on the curtains
around the walls.

1441
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:21,929
Oh.

1442
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,473
The guards at Green Manors.

1443
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:28,227
The patient was playing cards,
now no longer blank.

1444
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:31,689
A game of twenty-one with a bearded man
who was evidently Dr. Edwardes.

1445
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,818
Yes, one usually dreams of one's analyst
as authority with a beard.

1446
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:39,030
He dealt Edwardes the seven of clubs,
and Edwardes said,

1447
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:41,199
"That makes it 21."

1448
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:45,828
I would say the patient
was trying to mention a locale.

1449
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,414
The seven of clubs might mean a club.

1450
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:51,084
Yes, with the word "twenty-one" in it.

1451
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:54,253
There is such a place in New York.
It's called the 21 Club.

1452
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:55,838
I've heard of it.

1453
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,178
The patient dreamt

1454
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:06,140
the proprietor of the place came in
and began accusing Dr. Edwardes of cheating.

1455
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:09,435
He ordered Edwardes out and said,
"I won't allow you to play here.

1456
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:12,021
This is my place.
I'm going to fix you."

1457
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:15,775
The dream gives the locale
a double identity.

1458
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:18,486
The 21 Club and Green Manors.

1459
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:22,031
The proprietor seems to belong
more to the latter.

1460
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:24,200
In fact...

1461
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:29,622
I would say that this angry proprietor
who threatened Dr. Edwardes...

1462
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,458
was myself.

1463
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,879
It seemed that way to me.

1464
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:44,470
I presume you only arrived
at this solution tonight?

1465
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:47,140
Yes.

1466
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:50,977
And have confided your
psychoanalytic findings to nobody?

1467
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:52,228
Not yet.

1468
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:59,569
Was there any more to the dream?

1469
01:50:59,736 --> 01:51:00,778
Yes.

1470
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:05,116
The patient dreamt he and Dr. Edwardes
were on a high sloping roof,

1471
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:08,452
and that he saw Edwardes
plunge over the edge to his death.

1472
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:11,873
He also saw the angry proprietor
hiding behind the chimney laughing,

1473
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:15,585
holding a small wheel in his hand.
He dropped the wheel.

1474
01:51:17,129 --> 01:51:20,173
The symbolism of the small wheel
escapes me.

1475
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:24,468
It was a revolver.

1476
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:28,764
The proprietor who threatened Edwardes' life
in the 21 Club

1477
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:31,684
dropped a revolver in the snow
in Gabriel Valley

1478
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:34,604
after shooting Dr. Edwardes in the back.

1479
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,982
The weapon is still there
at the foot of a tree

1480
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:40,193
with the murderer's fingerprints on it.

1481
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:44,447
I can't agree with this part
of your interpretation,

1482
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:47,617
for the good reason that the weapon
is now in my hand.

1483
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:52,330
I imagined something
of this sort would happen

1484
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:54,999
when I made the slip tonight
about knowing Edwardes.

1485
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:57,627
That started your agile,
young mind going.

1486
01:51:57,794 --> 01:52:00,713
You were having a breakdown.

1487
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:05,468
In a state of panic, you heard
that Edwardes was to take your place here.

1488
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:07,720
So you sought him out
in his favorite restaurant,

1489
01:52:07,888 --> 01:52:10,556
where he was lunching
with John Ballyntine.

1490
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,809
You accused him of stealing your job.

1491
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:16,312
You threatened to kill him.

1492
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,691
He calmed you down, told you
he was off on a skiing vacation.

1493
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:23,027
You followed him there

1494
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:25,488
and shot him from behind a tree.

1495
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:28,241
That's enough. Your story is ridiculous.

1496
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:30,159
You'll make a fool of yourself.

1497
01:52:30,327 --> 01:52:33,162
A love-smitten analyst
playing a dream detective.

1498
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:36,707
There'll be no dreams for the police.

1499
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:40,878
They'll find out from the waiters
in the 21 Club that you were there.

1500
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:45,549
You'll be identified as the man
who had a row with Dr. Edwardes.

1501
01:52:45,717 --> 01:52:48,010
There will be people who saw you
on the train to Gabriel Valley,

1502
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,679
who saw you there.

1503
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:54,183
There will be no dreams
necessary for this case.

1504
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:56,686
I see.

1505
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:03,901
You're an excellent analyst, Dr. Petersen, 
but a rather stupid woman.

1506
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:09,031
What did you think I'd do
when you told me all this? Congratulate you?

1507
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:14,996
You forget in your imbecilic devotion
to your patient

1508
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:17,873
that the punishment for two murders

1509
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,917
is the same as for one.

1510
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:25,923
You're not going to commit
a second murder, Dr. Murchison.

1511
01:53:26,258 --> 01:53:30,136
I hadn't planned to, but you're here.

1512
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:32,722
You're not leaving.

1513
01:53:34,099 --> 01:53:39,145
A man with your intelligence
does not commit a stupid murder.

1514
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:41,522
You're thinking you were not
mentally responsible

1515
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,899
for that other crime in the snow.

1516
01:53:44,067 --> 01:53:47,903
They'll find extenuating circumstances
in the state of your health.

1517
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:51,657
They'll not execute you
for the death of Dr. Edwardes.

1518
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:55,745
You can still live, read, write, research,

1519
01:53:56,913 --> 01:53:58,998
even if you are put away.

1520
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:02,626
You're thinking that now, Dr. Murchison.

1521
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:11,427
If you shoot now,
it is cold, deliberate murder.

1522
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:14,597
You'll be tried as a sane murderer,

1523
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:17,266
convicted as a sane man,

1524
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:21,103
and killed in the electric chair
for your crime.

1525
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:24,607
I'm going to telephone the police now,
Dr. Murchison.

1526
01:54:43,377 --> 01:54:45,169
And remember what I say.

1527
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:49,006
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine, so to speak.

1528
01:54:49,174 --> 01:54:50,508

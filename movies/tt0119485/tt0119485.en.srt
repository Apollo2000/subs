2
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,785
- Tell me.
- Again?

3
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:50,586
- Tell me.
- Your father had been very sick.

4
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,323
We thought he would die.
Some of our animals had died.

5
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:58,060
- Cow?
- Yes, a cow,

6
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:01,160
a horse,
a yak...

7
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,172
and chickens.

8
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,765
We had four years
of bad crops.

9
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,006
- All the farmers did.
- Yes.

10
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,742
Then one night,
I knew you were coming...

11
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,117
and at dawn,
you were born.

12
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,748
- Tell me.
- You didn't cry.

13
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,987
- No cry.
- No, you didn't cry.

14
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:26,757
And that day,
your father got better.

15
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,961
He named you
Lhamo the Protector.

16
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:31,970
I know.

17
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:34,768
Go to sleep now, Lhamo.
Go to sleep.

18
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:18,312
Shh!

19
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,652
- Me.
- No.

20
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,689
- Me.
- No. This must stop.

21
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,522
- Me, here.

22
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,989
- No, I am the father. You
are the child. You sit there.

23
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:31,427
- No.

24
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,331
- Me sit here.
- No.

25
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,301
- Oh, what's the harm?
Let him sit where he wants.
- He'll grow up all wrong.

26
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,640
Only you can serve him.

27
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,238
Only you can touch his food.
Too clean.

28
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:52,252
- Everything just so.
- So what's the harm?

29
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,288
He thinks he's king.

30
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:58,459
Tell my story.

31
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,654
- Not again.

32
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:04,062
Again. Me!

33
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,465
All right, Lhamo.
I'll tell you the story.

34
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:10,164
You were born at dawn.
It was so quiet outside.

35
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,676
I helped Mama.
She asked for me.

36
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,644
When you were born, you didn't cry
at all. You never cried.

37
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:19,511
And I was surprised.
Then we gave you the sweet drink.

38
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:23,179
- And you pooped all over!

39
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:26,223
- Can you stop that?

40
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,458
- Rinpoche, I'll ride back with you to the monastery.
- Thank you, Father.

41
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:36,467
There were crows.
I just remembered. There were crows.

42
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:41,131
- When?
- The morning Lhamo was born.
Do you remember?

43
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,971
You were sick,
and I brought him to you.

44
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:47,137
You said, "We'll call him Lhamo,"
and you went to pray.

45
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:50,239
I slept and later went outside
and saw them.

46
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,375
Huh?

47
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:57,049
A pair of crows had come to nest on
our roof as if they had come for Lhamo.

48
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:00,059
Just as they did
for the Dalai Lama.

49
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,926
Whee-whee!

50
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,873
This must stop now, Lhamo.

51
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:41,489
- Yes?

52
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:46,354
- Yes?

53
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,961
We are traveling
to Lhasa.

54
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:52,196
Oh, please, come in.
It's so cold.

55
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,153
Your servants may use the kitchen.

56
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,775
This is mine.

57
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:06,249
I will give it to you
if you know who I am.

58
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:08,252
Lama.

59
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:14,416
Mine!

60
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:27,201
No, no, no, Lhamo.
Give it back.

61
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,772
I'm sorry.
He doesn't usually do such things.

62
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,394
- Lhasa.

63
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:54,197
He always says he wants
to go to Lhasa. Lhamo.

64
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,638
- Shh.

65
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,254
Lhamo.

66
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,517
Thank you for joining us.

67
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,190
You say this is yours?

68
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:57,030
What else belongs to you?

69
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,054
Shh.

70
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,629
Yes, those are yours.

71
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:24,030
Yes, those are yours.

72
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:30,301
Yes.

73
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,776
This is mine.

74
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,472
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

75
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,482
Yes, Kundun.

76
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,344
Oh!

77
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,125
This is mine.

78
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:31,864
Mine. I need this.

79
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:34,671
This is mine, Mama.

80
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,908
Lhamo, I'll get you a better one.

81
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,571
Come on Lhamo.
We have to leave now.

82
00:14:56,111 --> 00:15:01,640
You must be a very high lama; a great
Tibetan monk. So this is a good thing.

83
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:05,517
Don't be scared. You're not the
first boy to be discovered like this,

84
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,681
and certainly
not the last.

85
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:14,290
I will never let harm come to you.
You must be a great man.

86
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,666
I know.

87
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:27,406
Who said you
could sit here?

88
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:44,855
Regent Reting,
Your Excellency.

89
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,023
The boy's caravan is near.

90
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:40,327
He has grown from the baby
you sent me to find, Excellency.

91
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:44,365
He's very strong.
Very inquisitive.

92
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:48,470
A little afraid. He's ready to meet
the man who discovered him.

93
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:10,102
We are going to shave your head now.
Don't be afraid.

94
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,469
- Don't be afraid, Rinpoche.
- Come here! Come here!

95
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,805
- We are going to cut your hair.
- Where are you going?
Come here, come here, come here.

96
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,456
Can you recite, "May I be
the doctor and the medicine,

97
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,721
and may I be the nurse
for all sick beings in the world...

98
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:35,321
until everyone is healed"?

99
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,303
Can you remember?

100
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:57,010
"May I be the protector
for those without one.

101
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:00,752
May I be a bridge,
a boat, a ship...

102
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:04,557
for all who wish
to cross the water."

103
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:10,393
Centuries ago,

104
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,564
a boy was born in Tibet.

105
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,541
His name was Gendendrub.

106
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,206
The night of his birth
robbers came to his home,

107
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:25,616
and his family had to run
to save their lives.

108
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,019
They hid the baby.

109
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,353
When they returned
the next day,

110
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,917
the baby was alive.

111
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,624
He was guarded by
a pair of black crows.

112
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,065
He was the first.

113
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,534
He was Chenrezig.

114
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:43,970
We call him Kundun.

115
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,046
Chenrezig ke khyen.

116
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,732
I saw you in a vision.

117
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:50,336
I am Reting, your regent.

118
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,075
I found you.
It was difficult.

119
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,845
But you left me good signs.

120
00:20:55,918 --> 00:21:00,218
I hope it was not
too long a wait, Kundun.

121
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:16,162
You have chosen to come back
to this life once more.

122
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,143
You will stay
as long as you can.

123
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,182
And then,
you will come again.

124
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,048
You will be born
again and again...

125
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,749
as long as
all life continues.

126
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:36,660
You are here to love
all living things.

127
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,856
Just love them.

128
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:43,155
Care for them.
Have compassion for them.

129
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,794
"As long as
any living thing draws breath,

130
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:51,696
wherever he shall be,
there in compassion...

131
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:54,633
shall the Buddha appear."

132
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,977
The Buddha of Compassion.

133
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,887
The Wish-fulfilling Jewel.

134
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,118
The 14th Dalai Lama.

135
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:17,665
Your Lord Chamberlain
will see you now.

136
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,758
Your Holiness, I am Phala,
Your Lord Chamberlain,

137
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,963
to serve you however I can.

138
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,972
Mm.

139
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,109
Fifth Dalai Lama.

140
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,613
Seventh Dalai Lama.

141
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:06,821
Thirteenth Dalai Lama.

142
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,897
And when you come of age,
you will hold...

143
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,902
the Great Seal.

144
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:27,038
Oh-ho. Very auspicious,
14th Dalai Lama.

145
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:27,045
Shall I tear it?
Yeah? Just watch me.

146
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:45,264
- Your turn. Let's play.
- Power!

147
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:52,441
I'm on a big mountain
hitting at men.

148
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:55,876
- I am braver.
- I have more men.

149
00:28:55,946 --> 00:29:00,679
I have smarter men.
I have all the men.

150
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:09,551
Today you lose, Kundun.
Tomorrow you may win.

151
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,789
- Things change, Kundun.

152
00:29:28,982 --> 00:29:32,349
- Kundun. Kundun. Kundun.

153
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:36,756
- Kundun. Kundun.

154
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:39,452
Reting is asking too much from us.

155
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:43,156
How much more land and money do we
have to give him for finding the boy?

156
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:46,291
It comes from our pockets.

157
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,168
And then there are the gifts and the estates 
to offer the Dalai Lama's family.

158
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:53,504
- Look at Father.
- Our purses are empty.

159
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,509
Our army is depleted.

160
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:58,809
The regent is asking for too high
a reward for finding the Dalai Lama.

161
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,009
He would have us pull
the hairs from our noses.

162
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:04,485
Surely you're not suggesting
that the cost for finding the boy...

163
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,647
come from Reting's
own pocket.

164
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:11,752
He didn't ask for this position. He'd
rather be at his hermitage in retreat.

165
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:14,957
- With all his women! Yeah.

166
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:19,435
The Great 13th-- Can't we all see him
in the face of this beautiful child?

167
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:22,940
He dared to be reborn
right on the Chinese border.

168
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:26,068
It's as if he took a scarf
and threw it as far as he could...

169
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:30,012
so it landed in Amdo,
right smack in the face of China.

170
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,985
And he said, "This is Tibet.
I will be born here."

171
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:38,456
Right to the edge of our country,
and he says, "This is my Tibet."

172
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,937
Your new home, your servants--
everything is as you wish?

173
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:56,442
We are very fortunate.
Thank you, Regent.

174
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:24,698
Mama.

175
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:47,728
Mama.

176
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,063
Shh-hh-hh.

177
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:54,231
I don't like it here.

178
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,306
This is an old, dark place.

179
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,352
But you will like
the summer palace better.

180
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,217
There are gardens and animals...

181
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,918
like deer and dogs,

182
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:14,928
little bears and birds--
peacocks.

183
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:16,964
Elephants?

184
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:19,695
No... but a river and a lake.

185
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:23,535
- Fish.
- Many fish.

186
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,972
Who's that woman here?

187
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,114
She's Penden Lhamo.

188
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:39,987
It is her special duty to protect you
and the government of Tibet.

189
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,695
Is she real or pretend?

190
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,696
She's real.

191
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,699
She's real.

192
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:05,755
Small ones first.

193
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:09,790
Wait. Big ones,
don't eat. No, no, no.

194
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:12,394
Let the small one finish.

195
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:29,044
- Holiness, will you take the head of the table?
- That's your place.

196
00:34:29,124 --> 00:34:32,355
Ah.

197
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:36,659
Dalai Lama is not supposed to
eat pork. It's bad for your brain.

198
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:40,099
Go study. I get in trouble
if you don't study.

199
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,307
The Dalai Lama
is not supposed to eat eggs.

200
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,223
I'm sorry.

201
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,262
Oh! We have him at last.

202
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:13,361
Pompo, eggs!
Look! Eggs!

203
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,566
- Eggs? No eggs!
- Go away!

204
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:19,338
- That's not the way you talk to people.
- But I'm in charge.

205
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,902
Of whom?

206
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:25,212
Can I save the sheep outside
so they don't die?

207
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:28,220
- You're rich. Buy them.
- Will you buy them for me?

208
00:35:28,288 --> 00:35:31,086
Where will you keep them?

209
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:33,092
Here. You and me.

210
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,288
Then I'll buy them for you.

211
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:40,490
You have
beautiful horses now.

212
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:44,471
Yes, I do. Go now.

213
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,969
I don't want to go.

214
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,779
My teeth are in there.

215
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:03,519
- What teeth?
- My teeth. I-I remember.

216
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:09,057
- Open it, Pompo. Open it.

217
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,582
My old teeth.

218
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,421
They belong to
the 13th Dalai Lama.

219
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,304
Holiness.

220
00:36:54,082 --> 00:36:56,607
Taktra Rinpoche,
the Oracle has told me...

221
00:36:56,684 --> 00:37:00,484
that if I don't leave Lhasa
and devote myself to prayer,

222
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,819
my life will be cut short.

223
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:05,383
Please, do it
right away, Reting.

224
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:09,295
- You agree I should resign?
- Yes, Excellency, I do.

225
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:11,299
The people are saying,

226
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:16,737
"How can Reting give the Dalai Lama his vows 
if he has not kept them himself?"

227
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:22,370
I am sorry,
Reting Rinpoche, but it's true.

228
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:25,346
I will resign.

229
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:29,580
But after the danger is over,
I will return to the position of regent.

230
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:34,250
We only wish to do
what is best for His Holiness.

231
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:53,071
Ling Rinpoche.

232
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,239
Trichang Rinpoche.

233
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,843
"I take refuge
in the three jewels:

234
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,048
the Buddha, the Dharma
and the Sangha,

235
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:05,523
until I attain enlightenment."

236
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:08,789
Taktra, where is Reting?

237
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:12,094
Where is Reting today?

238
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,533
He has left Lhasa, Holiness.

239
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:17,400
Where did he go?

240
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:19,702
A retreat, Holiness.

241
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:22,369
How long?

242
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:25,005
Several years.

243
00:38:26,082 --> 00:38:28,642
- Oh!
- He has left your service.

244
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:31,983
Another regent
will be chosen.

245
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:34,615
I don't understand.

246
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:37,057
It's not for your years,
Holiness.

247
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,152
Why not for my years?

248
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,960
"I take refuge in the Buddha,
the Dharma and the Sangha."

249
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,803
I want you to be
my new regent.

250
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:50,131
That is an order.

251
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:56,245
"I take refuge
in the three jewels:

252
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:59,716
the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha,

253
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:02,049
until I attain enlightenment."

254
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:44,332
- Lobsang, now?
- Go, go!

255
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,738
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

256
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:13,211
- Ahh!
- Ohh!

257
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,815
- Lhamo!

258
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:24,047
- Hmm.
- Oh.

259
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,089
Oh, no. But they found them.

260
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:32,257
The gifts from the West.
His things-- the Great 13th Dalai Lama--

261
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:05,198
Consider the importance
of the Four Noble Truths.

262
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:07,702
What are the Four Noble Truths?

263
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,968
The Four Noble Truths
as taught by the Lord Buddha are:

264
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:15,170
the Truth of Suffering,
the Truth of Why We Suffer,

265
00:42:15,245 --> 00:42:19,614
- the Truth of the End of Suff--
- You are exhibiting too much pride here.

266
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:22,481
Lower your head.

267
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:26,717
Ling Rinpoche is your teacher.
You bow down before him.

268
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:31,821
- What are the causes of suffering?
- Pride.

269
00:42:31,897 --> 00:42:35,333
Pride causes suffering.
You recite.

270
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,631
Think of what you know.

271
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:42,564
I need to squeeze this brain.

272
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:49,211
Answer.

273
00:42:57,892 --> 00:43:01,293
First, one understands
that he causes...

274
00:43:01,362 --> 00:43:04,354
much of his own suffering
needlessly.

275
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:07,993
Second, he looks for the reasons
for this in his own life.

276
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:13,269
To look is to have confidence in one's
own ability to end the suffering.

277
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:18,302
Finally, a wish arises
to find a path to peace,

278
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:20,815
for all beings desire happiness.

279
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:23,818
All wish to find
their purest selves.

280
00:43:27,624 --> 00:43:29,785
It's time for you
to leave him.

281
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:40,727
I don't want you to go.

282
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:44,757
We are older now.
You'll be fine.

283
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,704
- I'll miss you.
- You are a good Dalai Lama.

284
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,910
I see a safe journey.

285
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,351
I see a safe return.

286
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,807
This is Britain.

287
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:26,904
Ahh.

288
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,915
Where's Poland, Norbu?

289
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:30,917
I don't know, Holiness.

290
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:33,920
Where's Pearl Harbor?

291
00:44:35,457 --> 00:44:37,391
Do you know, Pompo?

292
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:39,393
I do not.

293
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,596
This is Tibet...

294
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:50,503
- Mmm.
- and this is China.

295
00:44:54,345 --> 00:44:58,577
- How many soldiers do we have?
- About 5,000, Holiness.

296
00:44:58,649 --> 00:45:00,583
Five thousand.

297
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:03,415
So many.
That's a lot.

298
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:07,451
Certainly, we are safe in Tibet.

299
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:09,460
We hope, Kundun.

300
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:02,742
- "Liars.

301
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,787
- Fools.

302
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:08,689
You learned--
You learned nothing.

303
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:14,630
Five forms of degeneration.

304
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,259
The red... ideology.

305
00:46:18,436 --> 00:46:22,202
Danger from within...
and without.

306
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:25,633
Devotion.

307
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:28,839
Skill. Regret.

308
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:32,111
- Failure."

309
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:05,014
- "Heed the warning...

310
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:07,953
of your predecessor...

311
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:11,092
or the war...

312
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,094
will end here."

313
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,936
- "Careful.

314
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,172
Careful."

315
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:43,060
Yaah!

316
00:47:57,363 --> 00:48:00,764
Holiness, we have a letter.

317
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:10,835
The 13th Dalai Lama
wrote this letter...

318
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:13,971
the year before he died;
before you were born.

319
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:21,452
"When I reached
the age of 18,

320
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:23,683
I was called upon to accept...

321
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:26,990
the responsibility
of serving as spiritual...

322
00:48:27,062 --> 00:48:29,155
and secular head
of the country.

323
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,334
The responsibility
was by no means small,

324
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:35,836
and it weighed heavily
upon my mind.

325
00:48:36,906 --> 00:48:39,807
And then the Chinese invaded."

326
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,470
"There was really
nothing much we could do,

327
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,877
other than pray.

328
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:48,350
Our prayers
were soon answered.

329
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:52,412
For the power of truth
is great and karma, infallible.

330
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,516
We routed the Chinese out.

331
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:00,054
It may happen...

332
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,361
that here in Tibet...

333
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:05,733
religion and government
will be attacked.

334
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:10,373
The monasteries will be looted
and destroyed...

335
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:15,875
and the monks and nuns
killed... or chased away.

336
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,450
We will become like slaves
to our conquerors...

337
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:25,685
and made to wander
helplessly... like beggars."

338
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:32,497
The days and nights
will pass slowly...

339
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:35,559
and with great suffering
and terror."

340
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:47,048
Where were you born, Taktra?

341
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:49,744
In Kyarpo, Holiness.

342
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:52,309
And you, Phala?

343
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,323
Lhasa, Holiness.

344
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,450
- Right here.
- Yes, Holiness.

345
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,096
What can I do?
I'm only a boy.

346
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:09,201
You are the man
who wrote this letter.

347
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:12,765
You are the man
who has come back to lead us.

348
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:17,406
You will soon have
great responsibilities.

349
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,643
You must know what to do.

350
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:28,156
...but to a single B-29 over
the Japanese city of Hiroshima,

351
00:50:28,227 --> 00:50:31,060
it was the beginning
of a new era for civilization.

352
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:38,132
8:15 in the morning
found a 400-pound bomb...

353
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,639
with the destructive force
of 20,000 tons of TNT...

354
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:43,972
mushrooming up
over the stunned enemy city.

355
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:47,104
To the frightened inhabitants,
the end of the world had come.

356
00:50:47,182 --> 00:50:51,312
The almost horribly beautiful mushroom
cloud ballooned up into the heavens.

357
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:53,684
The luminous formation
was to become the trademark...

358
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:55,814
for incredible death
and destruction.

359
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,087
One scientist had sounded
an ominous warning when he said,

360
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:03,427
"An atom bomb explosion is the nearest thing 
to doomsday one could possibly imagine.

361
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:07,731
I'm sure that at the end of the world,
in the last millisecond of the Earth's existence,

362
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:10,967
the last man will see
what we saw today."

363
00:51:13,243 --> 00:51:15,734
How is human life precious?

364
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,575
As a result of previous karma,

365
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,982
- you have obtained this human life.

366
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:25,420
- "Oh, ignorant one.
Do not fall asleep now."

367
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:36,698
I can't see!

368
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:38,702
What is happening?

369
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,909
It's my friend.
Leave him alone!

370
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:51,041
Norbu, what is happening?

371
00:51:51,117 --> 00:51:54,780
- Reting Rinpoche has been arrested.
- Reting?

372
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:58,484
Kundun, I am sorry.
This is not for your eyes.

373
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,027
Why not for my eyes?

374
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:13,641
- Summon the Kashag.
- Holiness.

375
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:21,780
What happened to Reting?

376
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:26,511
It is very complicated, Holiness.

377
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,820
Tell me.

378
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:35,863
Reting Rinpoche
thought he could return as regent.

379
00:52:35,934 --> 00:52:38,027
This was no longer possible,
Holiness.

380
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:40,866
There was an attempt
on Taktra Rinpoche's life.

381
00:52:42,106 --> 00:52:44,506
Really?

382
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:50,037
Reting was arrested. The Sera Monks
fought today on Reting's behalf.

383
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:53,551
The monks have guns?

384
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:56,452
In this case, yes, Holiness.

385
00:52:56,522 --> 00:53:00,014
I didn't know monks had guns.

386
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,084
No, of course not, Holiness.

387
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:07,926
Where is Reting Rinpoche now?

388
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:10,629
He is imprisoned here
at the Potala, Holiness.

389
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:13,265
There is a prison
in the Potala?

390
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:17,210
There has always been
a prison here, Holiness.

391
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:25,685
I think there are some things
we need to change here in Tibet.

392
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:32,285
- We will have tea, please, Pompo.
- Yes.

393
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:38,358
- Were you hurt, Taktra Rinpoche?
- I am fine, Kundun.

394
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:40,629
I am old
and too tough to kill.

395
00:53:47,578 --> 00:53:50,411
Now, tell me about China.

396
00:53:52,117 --> 00:53:55,985
Ah, yes. Again, a very
complicated situation, Holiness.

397
00:53:57,689 --> 00:54:02,251
Your Holiness, the Chinese are once
again trying to convince the world...

398
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:04,352
that Tibet belongs to them.

399
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,331
- Tibet is Tibet.
- For a long time, Holiness,

400
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,267
we have agreed to disagree.

401
00:54:10,336 --> 00:54:13,203
We knew,
and we knew that they knew.

402
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:17,304
Now, they are
trying to rewrite history.

403
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:21,880
How unfortunate.

404
00:54:26,354 --> 00:54:29,118
Why don't we ask all
the Chinese living here to leave?

405
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,058
If there are no Chinese in Tibet,
we cannot be a Chinese region.

406
00:54:33,127 --> 00:54:36,392
Very good, Kundun.

407
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:40,492
It is time we remind the world we are independent,
would you say, Holiness?

408
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,936
Can lndia help us? They know
we are not a part of China.

409
00:54:45,474 --> 00:54:48,807
India is a newly independent nation.
They are struggling.

410
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:51,176
They are in no position
to help us.

411
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:53,511
Britain?

412
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,778
Britain chooses not to.

413
00:54:57,787 --> 00:54:59,721
And America?

414
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,556
America. America.
We shall see, Holiness.

415
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:08,160
I shall write a letter
to the president of America.

416
00:55:09,568 --> 00:55:11,502
Excellent, Kundun.

417
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,232
I will go see
Reting Rinpoche now.

418
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:16,536
I must advise against that,
Holiness.

419
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:26,548
I want Reting Rinpoche
well cared for.

420
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:29,918
He is my teacher.
He found me.

421
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:32,048
It will be as you say, Holiness.

422
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,870
I need to know
what you know now.

423
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:50,035
I'm no longer a child.

424
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,540
And so, Mao Tse-tung
has called for all-out war.

425
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:05,677
He will settle for nothing less
than a red China.

426
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:10,748
Will the lron Curtain descend over Asia, 
as it has over Russia and Eastern Europe?

427
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:15,388
It is conceivable that this declaration
of war, following 20 years of fighting,

428
00:56:15,465 --> 00:56:18,957
may mark the final moments
of a free China.

429
00:56:19,035 --> 00:56:21,936
Mao Tse-tung is now mounting
an offensive in Peking.

430
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:24,337
- Kundun. Kundun.

431
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:26,341
Listen to this:

432
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:31,143
"To Mr. Truman, the President
of the United States of America:

433
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:35,345
I am glad that you are enjoying best
of health and doing good service...

434
00:56:35,419 --> 00:56:39,355
to uplift the happiness
and prosperity of the whole world.

435
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:42,416
Here, I am well and doing
my best for the religion...

436
00:56:42,494 --> 00:56:47,454
of Lord Buddha and welfare
of all beings."

437
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:52,028
- This is all so far.
- Yes.

438
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:56,371
Kundun, Reting Rinpoche
has died in prison.

439
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:17,193
Now, do not be distracted
as you enter into the coming...

440
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:19,927
of the awareness.

441
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:23,232
Do not be distracted.

442
00:57:23,305 --> 00:57:27,469
Go to your father.
He is dead.

443
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:34,071
Your mother would like you
to perform last rites, Holiness.

444
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,054
Now, do not be distracted.

445
00:59:22,335 --> 00:59:25,668
The Communists have control of China.

446
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:30,639
Jealousy came.

447
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:33,804
The Buddha of Compassion
should know this.

448
00:59:39,086 --> 00:59:41,987
Mao Tse-tung has presented Tibet
with three demands:

449
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:48,627
One: Tibet must accept
that it is part of China.

450
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,938
Two: Tibet's defenses
must be conducted by China.

451
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:08,444
Three: All political and trade matters
concerning foreign countries...

452
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,919
must be conducted
through China.

453
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:48,292
What would you do, Holiness?

454
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:03,703
If we agree to the first point,
that Tibet is part of China,

455
01:01:03,779 --> 01:01:06,714
then nothing else
will matter.

456
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:14,217
We will buy them!
We will buy them!

457
01:01:17,494 --> 01:01:19,826
What would you do, Taktra-la?

458
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:22,626
I am only a bug.

459
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,711
I would reject all three points.

460
01:01:27,712 --> 01:01:30,933
I would say, we accept no
conditions from the Chinese.

461
01:01:32,843 --> 01:01:35,778
We should hear
what the people have to say.

462
01:01:35,847 --> 01:01:41,183
I will consult our protective deities.
Lord Buddha appears where he is needed.

463
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:43,847
As you say.

464
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:51,955
-  Enter.

465
01:03:59,031 --> 01:04:01,158
Summon the Kashag.

466
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,605
- Your Holiness.
- Yes?

467
01:04:07,674 --> 01:04:10,108
The Chinese have invaded.

468
01:05:03,635 --> 01:05:08,072
The Chinese have crossed the river
in six locations around Chamdo.

469
01:05:09,808 --> 01:05:12,106
- Has anyone died?

470
01:05:12,177 --> 01:05:14,941
The radio operator said
one man had been killed.

471
01:05:15,014 --> 01:05:18,916
Then he said,
"The Chinese soldiers, they're coming."

472
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:21,418
And then the radio
went silent.

473
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:44,310
This week began the peaceful
liberation of Tibet.

474
01:05:44,378 --> 01:05:48,576
Members of the People's Liberation Army 
have entered this western region of China...

475
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,312
at the urging
of the Tibetan minority.

476
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:55,789
Long a stronghold of imperialists, 
the Tibetan people have found themselves living...

477
01:05:55,858 --> 01:06:00,192
in a feudal kingdom
under the tyranny of the Dalai Lama.

478
01:06:00,263 --> 01:06:03,357
As the People's Army moves
toward the capital of Lhasa,

479
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:06,664
the local peasants gratefully
welcome their liberators...

480
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:09,534
and happily join
the crusade.

481
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:11,651
What do the people say, Norbu?

482
01:06:11,785 --> 01:06:14,454
They think it's time
for you to rule them now.

483
01:06:14,454 --> 01:06:18,151
I'm too young.
I have no experience.

484
01:06:19,694 --> 01:06:23,130
Of course you have experience,
Kundun. Who else would be here?

485
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:28,898
- Norbu?
- Yes, Holiness?

486
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:31,097
Do you ever wonder
if Reting found the right boy?

487
01:06:31,173 --> 01:06:33,107
No.

488
01:06:35,878 --> 01:06:38,506
I want to be 18
when I'm enthroned.

489
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,844
All the Dalai Lamas
were given until 18.

490
01:06:56,534 --> 01:07:01,233
- "His time has come."

491
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,810
Holiness, November 17, 1950...

492
01:07:11,883 --> 01:07:15,649
has been selected as the most
auspicious day for your enthronement.

493
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:18,315
- Yes.
- We ask that...

494
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:22,760
you be prepared to leave Lhasa
immediately afterwards as a precaution.

495
01:07:23,896 --> 01:07:26,330
As you say.

496
01:09:36,425 --> 01:09:39,087
Tibet will
call on the West for help.

497
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:44,463
I am sending delegations to America
and Great Britain, as well as lndia,

498
01:09:44,533 --> 01:09:49,061
in hope that these countries
will recognize our independence.

499
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,234
Lukhangwa and Lobsang Tashi,

500
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:57,472
I am making you
my prime ministers.

501
01:09:57,547 --> 01:10:00,141
Send a delegation to China.

502
01:10:02,019 --> 01:10:05,853
We will begin to make plans
for reforms and modernization.

503
01:10:05,923 --> 01:10:09,916
Today, I declare
a general amnesty.

504
01:10:09,995 --> 01:10:12,875
Free the prisoners.

505
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:38,634
It's time to take this down.

506
01:10:40,205 --> 01:10:43,834
- You still won't come?
- No, Holiness.

507
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:46,434
You must continue
to study very hard,

508
01:10:46,512 --> 01:10:48,776
and don't let them
tangle you in politics.

509
01:10:48,848 --> 01:10:51,840
Remember, you're a monk.

510
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:55,247
I will miss you.

511
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:58,780
- We have had fun, you and l.
- Yes, we have.

512
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:01,157
- And you have grown up very good.
- And you...

513
01:11:01,228 --> 01:11:05,392
have grown older and more stubborn,
but you've stayed good.

514
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:08,401
Tonight, Kundun,
you see the world.

515
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:11,165
"The gods will win.
The devils will lose."

516
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:44,665
I'll send it back to you.
It'll work.

517
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:07,565
Good-bye, Kundun.

518
01:12:35,175 --> 01:12:38,269
We will move
the government to Dungkhar Monastery,

519
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:40,938
near the lndian border.

520
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:46,042
We will wait there for
the world's response to our crisis.

521
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:12,413
He goes for a short time. He will
not leave Tibet. He will return.

522
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:15,315
Please don't let him go.
Don't let him go.

523
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:37,269
The Precious One
will not abandon you. Please.

524
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:40,106
The Precious One will not
abandon you. He will return.

525
01:13:40,179 --> 01:13:42,443
He will not leave Tibet.
Please, get up.

526
01:13:42,515 --> 01:13:44,915
Please, let him go. Please, he will
return. He will not leave Tibet.

527
01:13:44,984 --> 01:13:49,872
Please, please, he will not leave Tibet.
The Precious One will not abandon you.

528
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:52,676
Please. Please,
venerable monks, please. Please.

529
01:14:10,261 --> 01:14:12,821
It's quiet.

530
01:14:12,898 --> 01:14:14,923
Yes, Holiness.

531
01:14:15,001 --> 01:14:18,437
- Where are you from?
- Kham, Holiness.

532
01:14:20,773 --> 01:14:22,832
Warriors.

533
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:25,207
We are that, Holiness.

534
01:14:25,278 --> 01:14:30,306
My army and the Khambas,
they fight with almost nothing.

535
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:34,548
No airplanes. No trucks.
No weapons. Nothing.

536
01:14:34,622 --> 01:14:37,557
No one can stop them.
Not even me.

537
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:40,651
They fight for you, Holiness.
Are they wrong?

538
01:14:45,734 --> 01:14:48,362
Violence is never good.

539
01:14:48,437 --> 01:14:53,204
Every result, be it good or bad--
It had a cause.

540
01:14:53,275 --> 01:14:58,178
Why have they come, Holiness?
What did we do that is bad?

541
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:11,720
Nonviolence takes a long time.

542
01:15:11,796 --> 01:15:15,095
Do we have the time, Holiness?

543
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:18,101
I have never known.

544
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:33,585
Holiness?
This has come for you.

545
01:15:42,096 --> 01:15:44,394
"Then, at the time of midnight,

546
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:46,626
the Bodhisattva
saw a clear light.

547
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:52,263
Then he saw in a single instant
the three states of existence:

548
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,673
the past, the present
and the future,

549
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:59,077
purified by the clear light.

550
01:15:59,147 --> 01:16:04,278
Then, sitting at the Tree
of Enlightenment, he conquered...

551
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:06,821
all the devils."

552
01:16:44,664 --> 01:16:49,033
No, no, wait.

553
01:16:49,102 --> 01:16:52,435
Wait, wait, please. Let's do away
with some of these formalities.

554
01:16:52,505 --> 01:16:55,167
It's enough now.
Stop, stop. Please.

555
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,338
Holiness,
your Nepalese visitors--

556
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,904
- It appears they've brought you an elephant.
- An elephant?

557
01:17:01,982 --> 01:17:04,348
- Yes, Kundun, an elephant.
- Is it here now?

558
01:17:04,418 --> 01:17:08,149
- They have it with them.
- How fortunate.

559
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,319
He's a modern man,
just like he was the last time.

560
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,130
Today, the surrender of Tibet
is complete.

561
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:22,069
In Peking, representatives from
Tibet and the People's Republic...

562
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:26,302
signed a Seventeen Point Agreement
returning Tibet to the motherland.

563
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:30,368
The Dalai Lama's representatives
have signed the agreement in his name...

564
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:34,941
and with his best wishes for Tibet's 
speedy reunification with the motherland.

565
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:39,148
- Point One: The Tibetan people
shall unite and drive out...

566
01:17:39,224 --> 01:17:41,658
imperialist aggressors
from Tibet.

567
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:09,547
Your Holiness, may I present
General Chang Chin-Wu.

568
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:23,235
Chairman Mao asks me
to convey his respect.

569
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:33,172
I have been instructed
to provide you...

570
01:18:33,248 --> 01:18:36,911
with this copy of the Seventeen Point
Agreement for your signature.

571
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:56,906
I am empowered to accept
your ratification.

572
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,305
I'm certain you wish
to return to Lhasa.

573
01:19:04,382 --> 01:19:07,442
Do you have plans
to return soon?

574
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:13,621
We are discussing our plans.

575
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:21,130
And we can discuss our plans
with you in Lhasa, when you return.

576
01:19:23,904 --> 01:19:28,807
Thank you. Let me know if we can be
of any help on your return journey.

577
01:19:46,996 --> 01:19:50,090
I thought he would be
some kind of monster,

578
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:52,793
even with horns growing
out of his head.

579
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:58,239
But he is only a man, just an ordinary
human being, like myself.

580
01:19:58,308 --> 01:20:02,176
They are the worst
of the worst.

581
01:20:02,246 --> 01:20:05,374
They're worse than ghosts.

582
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:32,548
We were like you.
We were an isolated country.

583
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:36,419
Then trade began.
For our spices, silks, tea.

584
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,389
But there was nothing that we,
the Chinese, wanted from the West.

585
01:20:39,456 --> 01:20:44,894
So they gave us something
to want: opium. We craved opium.

586
01:20:44,962 --> 01:20:48,921
They tried to use it
to destroy us, the imperialists.

587
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,801
We are here to rescue you from imperialists, 
or they'll do the same to you.

588
01:21:06,786 --> 01:21:09,914
You cannot imagine,
sitting here,

589
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,117
where I came from.

590
01:21:13,694 --> 01:21:17,528
The floods,
the famines,

591
01:21:17,597 --> 01:21:19,929
were so bad.

592
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:23,027
China was fragmented.

593
01:21:23,104 --> 01:21:26,073
Society was crumbling.

594
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:29,234
There was a day
before the war...

595
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:34,213
when I came upon a man
with a dead baby.

596
01:21:34,283 --> 01:21:37,047
He was gonna cook it.

597
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:42,147
He shouted, "It died.
I did not kill it. It died."

598
01:21:42,225 --> 01:21:46,559
That is what it was like
in China before Chairman Mao.

599
01:21:51,769 --> 01:21:56,229
We believe that the time has come
for you to go to lndia.

600
01:21:56,307 --> 01:22:00,835
India is our friend.
You'll be safe there.

601
01:22:00,911 --> 01:22:04,608
The Americans will help us, Holiness.
You've read their letter.

602
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:09,177
That letter's unsigned.
It is not a real promise.

603
01:22:09,254 --> 01:22:13,623
China is close.
America is far away.

604
01:22:13,693 --> 01:22:17,789
Many Tibetans could die,
and China would still be close.

605
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:21,197
lf you stay in Tibet,

606
01:22:21,267 --> 01:22:25,135
we cannot guarantee
your safety, Holiness.

607
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:29,733
If you flee, Holiness,
you might never be able to return.

608
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:33,840
We've managed the Chinese
for many years.

609
01:22:33,914 --> 01:22:38,180
These are not the Chinese we know,
Holiness. These are Communists.

610
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:42,986
The Fifth Dalai Lama joined
an alliance with the Chinese.

611
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:49,989
And a great spiritual revolution
began in the East.

612
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:54,161
A spiritual revolution?
Does it begin like this?

613
01:23:02,913 --> 01:23:06,178
Friends, who is
the Fifth Dalai Lama now?

614
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:09,184
- Things change.

615
01:23:09,253 --> 01:23:14,190
Our own short lifetimes
are not the only consideration.

616
01:23:14,258 --> 01:23:18,194
My first and foremost duty
is to protect my people.

617
01:23:18,262 --> 01:23:20,389
I'm going back.

618
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:37,473
At first, things were good.

619
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,678
The People's Liberation Army
were kind and helpful.

620
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:44,855
But that was a long time ago.

621
01:23:46,227 --> 01:23:50,687
They were with me all the time,
never left me alone.

622
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:52,755
Prodding and insulting and--

623
01:23:55,537 --> 01:24:00,099
Mother, no women
in the monastery after dark.

624
01:24:00,175 --> 01:24:02,973
Go on.

625
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:09,808
They have burned homes,
bullied people, like they did me.

626
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,419
They think I--

627
01:24:13,489 --> 01:24:15,923
They let me come--

628
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:18,188
They let me go because--

629
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,789
Tell me.

630
01:24:24,034 --> 01:24:27,902
The Chinese believe
I've agreed to kill you.

631
01:24:31,309 --> 01:24:33,277
Kill me?

632
01:24:34,812 --> 01:24:38,976
I am to convince the Dalai Lama
to agree to their rule,

633
01:24:39,051 --> 01:24:43,784
and if I cannot convince you,
they believe I will kill you.

634
01:24:45,024 --> 01:24:48,323
They think my own brother
will kill me?

635
01:24:48,395 --> 01:24:50,659
They believe that?

636
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:29,437
I hate meeting up here.
This place is a tribute to the past!

637
01:25:29,505 --> 01:25:32,633
And another thing.
I want the songs stopped.

638
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,644
Songs? What songs?

639
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:38,011
Street songs
about General Tan.

640
01:25:38,082 --> 01:25:41,108
They are singing
about his gold watch.

641
01:25:41,185 --> 01:25:44,348
He's right.
They are quite insulting.

642
01:25:44,422 --> 01:25:48,620
- We have no authority
to ban singing in our country.

643
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:50,957
Then ban the public meetings.

644
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:53,361
And we want 2,000 more tons
of barley.

645
01:25:53,432 --> 01:25:56,595
This is impossible. You will bring
famine down on the people of Tibet.

646
01:25:56,669 --> 01:26:00,332
More food. The best land
for your soldiers to camp.

647
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:03,569
The People's Liberation Army
pays for all food and lodging.

648
01:26:03,643 --> 01:26:06,476
So far, they do.
But the quantity does not exist.

649
01:26:06,546 --> 01:26:09,379
You'll have
to reevaluate your needs.

650
01:26:10,784 --> 01:26:13,480
How much tea do you drink,
Prime Minister?

651
01:26:13,553 --> 01:26:16,215
It depends on the quality,
and that it be lndian.

652
01:26:20,561 --> 01:26:23,860
I am instructed to tell you today
that plans for the Tibetan Army...

653
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:26,832
to be absorbed into the People's
Liberation Army have been finalized--

654
01:26:26,902 --> 01:26:29,097
- I will not approve it.
- Then, we will begin by replacing...

655
01:26:29,171 --> 01:26:31,571
the Tibetan flag
with the flag of the motherland.

656
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,835
And we will begin
with tearing it down.

657
01:26:57,707 --> 01:27:00,904
- I am so sorry.
- It must be done.

658
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:05,381
We can no longer meet
with the Chinese. They refuse us.

659
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,945
I accept your resignations.

660
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:17,089
Have you chosen
your new prime ministers, Holiness?

661
01:27:17,162 --> 01:27:20,097
There will be no new prime ministers.

662
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,644
They have taken away our silence.

663
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:57,066
Britain, Nepal, America, lndia--

664
01:27:57,139 --> 01:28:00,905
All of those governments have refused
to meet with our representatives.

665
01:28:00,977 --> 01:28:02,911
And the United Nations?

666
01:28:02,979 --> 01:28:06,107
The United Nations
voted not to hear our appeal.

667
01:28:06,183 --> 01:28:09,744
So, we must face China
and her might all alone?

668
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:13,779
I'm afraid so. We have
no choice but to negotiate.

669
01:28:13,857 --> 01:28:16,451
The Chinese must come to Lhasa.

670
01:28:16,527 --> 01:28:20,122
Times are desperate, Phala.
We can go to Peking.

671
01:30:01,842 --> 01:30:05,972
The news of the People's
Liberation Army's march into Tibet...

672
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:10,882
was enthusiastically supported
by all sections of the population.

673
01:30:10,952 --> 01:30:14,513
In particular, Tibetans
in all parts of China....

674
01:30:14,589 --> 01:30:17,183
jubilantly celebrated
the news...

675
01:30:17,259 --> 01:30:21,127
and demanded their return
to the motherland.

676
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:25,826
The mission of China
is to bring progress to Tibet.

677
01:30:25,901 --> 01:30:30,201
We welcome you, Tibet,
back to the motherland.

678
01:30:51,163 --> 01:30:56,328
It is too early to implement all the clauses
of the Seventeen Point Agreement.

679
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:04,343
The pace of reform
must meet...

680
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:07,436
with the desires
of the Tibetan people.

681
01:31:07,513 --> 01:31:09,947
Changes must be made slowly,

682
01:31:10,016 --> 01:31:14,851
as you, yourself, judge necessary.

683
01:31:14,922 --> 01:31:19,120
Tibet is a great land,
a wonderful history.

684
01:31:19,193 --> 01:31:23,152
Long ago, you even conquered
a part of China.

685
01:31:23,231 --> 01:31:27,497
But now, you have fallen behind,
and we want to help you.

686
01:31:27,569 --> 01:31:31,300
In 20 years time,
you could be ahead of us.

687
01:31:31,372 --> 01:31:35,399
And then, it will be your turn
to help China.

688
01:31:35,478 --> 01:31:39,414
You know, my mother
was a Buddhist.

689
01:31:39,482 --> 01:31:43,282
I have a great respect
for your Lord Buddha.

690
01:31:43,352 --> 01:31:48,688
He was anti-caste,
anti-corruption, anti-exploitation.

691
01:31:48,758 --> 01:31:52,871
For some,
politics and religion...

692
01:31:53,005 --> 01:31:54,206
can mix.

693
01:31:54,206 --> 01:31:56,868
Please, have some sweet.

694
01:31:56,943 --> 01:32:01,880
Made in my home province.
The kind my mother used to make.

695
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:12,748
I have great hopes
for a mutual cooperation.

696
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:15,955
He has made important promises.

697
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:21,229
You know, his family were Buddhist.
They were farming people.

698
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:26,400
I think socialism and Buddhism
have some things in common.

699
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:30,237
She will be fine,
Your Holiness.

700
01:32:30,313 --> 01:32:32,838
The climate does not
agree with her.

701
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,616
He has made
important promises.

702
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:43,956
As you say.

703
01:33:02,915 --> 01:33:08,751
I hope you will not feel badly about all
the things of childhood you missed.

704
01:33:08,821 --> 01:33:11,881
You lost so much.

705
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:16,861
I am sorry.
Good-bye, Kundun.

706
01:33:21,034 --> 01:33:23,901
Good-bye, Kundun.

707
01:33:25,773 --> 01:33:28,674
Good-bye, Kundun.

708
01:33:28,743 --> 01:33:32,304
No, Norbu. Don't die.
No, none of you. Don't die.

709
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:37,079
ln passing, a few words
about our nation's minorities.

710
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:41,486
The people of the whole country are pleased 
that the minority nationalities...

711
01:33:41,557 --> 01:33:44,048
and the Han people are united.

712
01:33:44,126 --> 01:33:47,493
But, we must combat
Han chauvinism.

713
01:33:47,564 --> 01:33:50,624
Don't get the idea that it is
the Han nationality that...

714
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,158
has been primarily helping
the minority nationality.

715
01:33:54,237 --> 01:33:58,105
The minority have given
the Han people great help.

716
01:33:58,175 --> 01:34:01,770
Their every participation
in the community of the Chi--

717
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,659
Dalai Lama, excuse me.

718
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:22,667
Chairman Mao Tse-tung
has sent for you.

719
01:34:40,455 --> 01:34:44,255
Dalai Lama.
Thank you for coming so late.

720
01:34:44,325 --> 01:34:46,293
I leave tomorrow.

721
01:34:46,361 --> 01:34:48,386
Yes, I know.

722
01:34:55,104 --> 01:34:58,073
How has your stay been?

723
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:01,303
Very interesting.
Your factories are very impressive.

724
01:35:01,377 --> 01:35:05,939
- And I enjoyed the agri--
- You have a lot to learn.

725
01:35:06,016 --> 01:35:10,919
How to draw out people's opinions
and make decisions.

726
01:35:10,987 --> 01:35:13,922
Instruct your young Tibetans,

727
01:35:13,991 --> 01:35:16,118
when I make contact with you,

728
01:35:16,194 --> 01:35:19,357
I want to reach you through
a Tibetan, not a Chinese.

729
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:22,558
Very good. I agree
with some of your ideas.

730
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:26,694
For years, we have been reforming
our monasteries and reorganizing--

731
01:35:26,772 --> 01:35:29,570
Your attitude is good, you know.

732
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:32,235
I understand you well.

733
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:35,803
But you need to learn this:

734
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:45,919
Religion is poison.

735
01:35:45,993 --> 01:35:48,052
Poison.

736
01:35:48,128 --> 01:35:51,222
Like a poison,
it weakens the race.

737
01:35:51,298 --> 01:35:54,734
Like a drug,
it retards the mind...

738
01:35:54,802 --> 01:35:57,430
of people and society.

739
01:35:57,505 --> 01:36:00,804
"The opiate of the people."

740
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:04,710
Tibet has been poisoned
by religion,

741
01:36:04,779 --> 01:36:09,409
and your people
are poisoned and inferior.

742
01:36:15,124 --> 01:36:18,059
Let me walk you
to your car.

743
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:49,856
We cannot persuade you
to stay in Peking?

744
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:52,261
I must return.

745
01:36:52,332 --> 01:36:56,496
Take care of your health.
Write me often.

746
01:37:37,783 --> 01:37:42,220
Welcome to your old home,
Your Holiness.

747
01:38:41,085 --> 01:38:43,019
Are you happy?

748
01:38:44,823 --> 01:38:48,657
I am very happy
and prosperous...

749
01:38:48,727 --> 01:38:51,855
under the Chinese
Communist Party...

750
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:53,989
and Chairman Mao Tse-tung.

751
01:39:24,132 --> 01:39:26,532
I admire them so.

752
01:39:26,602 --> 01:39:30,595
They face a modern, equipped army,
and still they fight.

753
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,448
I have always asked
for just plain information.

754
01:39:49,026 --> 01:39:52,120
The Chinese have bombed
the monastery of Lithang.

755
01:39:52,196 --> 01:39:54,756
It has been destroyed.

756
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:58,825
They throw rocks from airplanes.

757
01:40:00,405 --> 01:40:04,466
Nuns and monks are made
to fornicate in the streets.

758
01:40:07,512 --> 01:40:10,879
They put their guns in the hands
of our Khamba children...

759
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,646
and force the child
to kill the parent.

760
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,484
- Die!

761
01:40:24,431 --> 01:40:28,333
I'll write to Mao again.

762
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:31,701
He doesn't answer
your letters, Kundun.

763
01:40:31,773 --> 01:40:35,265
Nonviolence means cooperation
when it is possible...

764
01:40:35,343 --> 01:40:38,506
and resistance
when it is not.

765
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:45,085
You have tried cooperation.

766
01:40:45,154 --> 01:40:49,591
Your resistance must come
from outside Tibet, Kundun.

767
01:42:24,195 --> 01:42:28,393
We will be moving Chinese families
into Tibet territory.

768
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:38,304
Farmers-- 40,000.

769
01:42:46,553 --> 01:42:49,579
A revolt has broken out
in the East.

770
01:42:49,656 --> 01:42:55,492
We have decided that the Tibetan army 
must be used against the Khamba guerrillas.

771
01:42:55,563 --> 01:43:00,899
General Tan,
our people would never--

772
01:43:00,968 --> 01:43:03,596
You do not understand
our people.

773
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:06,162
I will not approve that.

774
01:43:06,241 --> 01:43:08,573
You have bombed
on peaceful people.

775
01:43:08,644 --> 01:43:13,775
- It is my job to deal with reactionaries.
- No, we are peace-loving people.

776
01:43:13,849 --> 01:43:17,080
We are here to heal
the people of Tibet.

777
01:43:17,153 --> 01:43:19,747
You need reform.
We are here to liberate you.

778
01:43:19,822 --> 01:43:24,350
No, Buddha is our physician,
General Tan. He will heal us.

779
01:43:24,427 --> 01:43:27,863
Wisdom and compassion
will set us free.

780
01:43:35,844 --> 01:43:38,278
You cannot liberate me,
General Tan.

781
01:43:38,348 --> 01:43:41,715
I can only liberate myself.

782
01:43:52,997 --> 01:43:56,558
You are in grave danger. The Dalai Lama
cannot fall into Chinese hands.

783
01:43:56,634 --> 01:44:00,900
- Our only hope is to fight.
- We cannot.

784
01:44:00,972 --> 01:44:04,169
If they kill you,
they kill Tibet.

785
01:44:04,242 --> 01:44:06,904
You must flee.

786
01:44:51,026 --> 01:44:56,191
"General Tan Kuan San wishes to invite
the Dalai Lama to a dance recital...

787
01:44:56,266 --> 01:45:00,464
at the newly erected Great Hall
of the Liberation Army."

788
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:06,207
- A dance?
- Yes.

789
01:45:06,277 --> 01:45:09,940
"And because of the climate
in Lhasa, General Tan requests...

790
01:45:10,014 --> 01:45:14,508
that the Dalai Lama come
without his bodyguards."

791
01:45:14,585 --> 01:45:19,079
"One attendant is fine," it says.
They would like to provide him.

792
01:45:19,157 --> 01:45:22,058
Yes, I'm sure they would.

793
01:45:23,362 --> 01:45:26,331
It's no time to anger
the Chinese, Phala.

794
01:45:26,398 --> 01:45:30,960
There are tanks in the streets.
Airplanes wait outside Lhasa.

795
01:45:31,037 --> 01:45:34,837
I think we can safely say the Chinese
are already angry, Holiness.

796
01:45:38,512 --> 01:45:41,447
What would you do,
my friend?

797
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:46,208
- I am only a bug, Holiness.

798
01:45:48,055 --> 01:45:50,580
Holiness,

799
01:45:50,659 --> 01:45:53,526
I would think of what survival
for Tibet really means...

800
01:45:53,595 --> 01:45:56,155
in the years to come.

801
01:45:56,231 --> 01:46:00,395
I would consider my duty
to protect my people.

802
01:46:00,469 --> 01:46:02,403
And so,

803
01:46:02,471 --> 01:46:05,065
I would leave now...
for lndia.

804
01:46:10,212 --> 01:46:12,510
But I won't do that.

805
01:46:12,582 --> 01:46:15,779
So, write them. Say I am sorry
to miss their dance.

806
01:46:15,852 --> 01:46:18,650
Another time, maybe.

807
01:46:18,722 --> 01:46:22,453
Tell them to write me often.

808
01:46:22,527 --> 01:46:26,725
I know it's a lie.
But times are bad.

809
01:46:26,798 --> 01:46:29,426
As you say.

810
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,934
You know, Kundun,

811
01:46:32,003 --> 01:46:34,563
I would never have
let you go alone.

812
01:46:35,674 --> 01:46:38,302
Don't ask me
to leave Tibet, Phala.

813
01:46:39,578 --> 01:46:42,945
I won't ask you today, Holiness.

814
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:23,818
You must go. You must go.

815
01:47:23,893 --> 01:47:27,385
Please don't go.
Please don't go. Please.

816
01:47:27,463 --> 01:47:30,990
I beg you to leave, please.

817
01:47:31,068 --> 01:47:35,004
Your Holiness--

818
01:49:03,399 --> 01:49:07,665
"Where there is no crossing
a big river, no fords, no shallows,

819
01:49:12,176 --> 01:49:15,737
where the only hope is a boat,
and there is no boat,

820
01:49:18,249 --> 01:49:21,412
I will put a boat, Kundun.

821
01:49:24,356 --> 01:49:29,487
The Wish-fulfilling Jewel
will shine from the West."

822
01:49:29,562 --> 01:49:33,999
- Long live His Holiness!

823
01:49:35,768 --> 01:49:39,431
- Long live His Holiness!
- Long live His Holiness!

824
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:44,240
- We have a letter. May l?
- Please.

825
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:48,042
"If the Dalai Lama
and a few trusted officers...

826
01:49:48,115 --> 01:49:51,278
can stay within the inner wall
and inform General Tan...

827
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:53,946
exactly which building
you will occupy,

828
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:58,185
we certainly intend that
this building not be damaged."

829
01:50:02,965 --> 01:50:05,024
They're going to bomb us.

830
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:08,968
- Apparently.
- Well, we want no mistakes.

831
01:50:09,037 --> 01:50:11,062
He adds as a postscript:

832
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:15,577
"The Chinese have taken the strictest
measure to prevent your escape."

833
01:50:19,849 --> 01:50:23,012
Tell them I will be here
with my people. Right here.

834
01:50:33,631 --> 01:50:35,565
How is it outside today?

835
01:50:35,634 --> 01:50:37,932
- It's a sea of frightened faces.
- Hmm.

836
01:50:38,003 --> 01:50:40,301
There is a rumor
that His Holiness is gone.

837
01:50:40,372 --> 01:50:43,307
The supply trucks coming
from the Potala--

838
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:47,368
- Could we fill them with guns?
- Yes, we could.

839
01:50:47,447 --> 01:50:51,474
Khesan, I want you
to call the tailor in.

840
01:50:51,551 --> 01:50:53,610
Have him make you
a soldier's uniform.

841
01:50:53,686 --> 01:50:57,747
Make it look old and worn,
and do it quickly, please.

842
01:51:28,324 --> 01:51:31,816
"Go. Tonight.

843
01:51:31,895 --> 01:51:34,090
Go."

844
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:44,234
Holiness, the Oracle's route takes us
right past the Chinese encampment.

845
01:51:44,308 --> 01:51:47,243
- We cannot possibly--
- Shh.

846
01:52:02,729 --> 01:52:08,463
- I'll fight them. I'll get a gun and fight them.
- I am so confused.

847
01:52:08,535 --> 01:52:13,700
I'm told we have to make a journey,
but no one tells me when or where.

848
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:17,742
I will go if you are going.

849
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:21,314
Just go ahead.

850
01:52:25,153 --> 01:52:30,591
The saddest thing is,
we were about to change.

851
01:52:33,395 --> 01:52:36,523
We were going
to do it alone.

852
01:52:36,599 --> 01:52:39,466
We were just about
to do it alone.

853
01:52:39,535 --> 01:52:44,837
- I'll go to war.
- The Dalai Lama does not believe in war.

854
01:53:22,515 --> 01:53:24,449
Dim the lights.

855
01:53:31,592 --> 01:53:34,789
We have a long journey
to make, Pompo.

856
01:53:34,862 --> 01:53:39,196
We do not know how it will end,
and it is very sad.

857
01:53:39,266 --> 01:53:41,496
But I would not consider
going without you.

858
01:53:55,918 --> 01:53:58,409
Holiness, the Chinese
have moved their camp.

859
01:53:58,488 --> 01:54:01,184
The Oracle's route is safe
for us now. We must go.

860
01:54:01,257 --> 01:54:04,920
- Yes.
- Sanctuary has been arranged in lndia.

861
01:54:04,995 --> 01:54:07,793
- They're expecting you.
- Thank you.

862
01:54:59,621 --> 01:55:02,351
I see a safe journey.

863
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:16,998
I see a safe return.

864
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:22,509
Now I am ready.

865
01:55:33,258 --> 01:55:36,421
"I rejoice
in the Awakening of the Buddhas.

866
01:55:36,495 --> 01:55:39,058
And also, in the spiritual levels
of their Sons.

867
01:55:39,058 --> 01:55:40,423
And also, in the spiritual levels
of their Sons.

868
01:55:51,906 --> 01:55:56,570
With folded hands, I beseech
the Buddhas of all directions...

869
01:55:56,645 --> 01:56:02,083
to shine the lamp of Dharma for all
bewildered in the gloom of misery."

870
01:56:11,928 --> 01:56:15,193
- Move aside. Let us through.
- Tour of inspection. Move aside.

871
01:56:15,265 --> 01:56:17,665
Move aside.

872
01:56:17,734 --> 01:56:20,100
Move aside. Move aside.
Tour of inspection.

873
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:22,661
- Move aside. Move aside.
- Move aside.

874
01:56:22,739 --> 01:56:26,072
Let us through. Move aside.
Let us through.

875
01:56:26,144 --> 01:56:29,204
We have time.
We have time. Move aside.

876
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,680
Let us through.
Move aside.

877
01:56:31,749 --> 01:56:34,775
- Move aside.

878
01:56:39,658 --> 01:56:42,092
Move aside!

879
01:57:07,455 --> 01:57:10,481
With folded hands,
I beseech all the Buddhas...

880
01:57:10,559 --> 01:57:15,258
who wish to pass away,
to please remain for countless aeons...

881
01:57:16,999 --> 01:57:21,436
and not to leave
the world in darkness.

882
01:58:06,954 --> 01:58:09,787
My foes will become nothing.

883
01:58:09,856 --> 01:58:11,949
My friends will become nothing.

884
01:58:12,025 --> 01:58:15,290
I, too, will become nothing.

885
01:58:17,098 --> 01:58:22,035
Likewise, all will become...
nothing.

886
01:59:36,117 --> 01:59:38,813
"Right will win.

887
01:59:38,887 --> 01:59:41,412
Wrong will lose."

888
01:59:49,999 --> 01:59:52,593
Just like a dream experience,

889
01:59:52,668 --> 01:59:57,401
whatever things I enjoy
will become a memory.

890
01:59:57,474 --> 02:00:01,638
Whatever is past
will not be seen again.

891
02:00:51,399 --> 02:00:54,562
I will liberate those not liberated.

892
02:00:54,636 --> 02:00:58,732
I will release
those not released.

893
02:00:58,807 --> 02:01:02,538
I will relieve
those unrelieved.

894
02:01:04,914 --> 02:01:08,350
And set living beings
in nirvana.

895
02:01:37,249 --> 02:01:41,686
We repudiate
the Seventeen Point Agreement.

896
02:01:46,693 --> 02:01:51,187
We constitute
a temporary government of Tibet,

897
02:01:51,264 --> 02:01:53,289
the only legal authority
in the land.

898
02:02:32,142 --> 02:02:36,238
The Buddhas neither wash
ill deeds away with water,

899
02:02:36,313 --> 02:02:40,647
nor remove beings' sufferings
with their hands,

900
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:44,086
nor transfer their realizations
to others.

901
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:50,491
Beings are released
through the teachings of the truth.

902
02:02:50,563 --> 02:02:52,997
The final reality.

903
02:03:21,329 --> 02:03:23,263
Shh.

904
02:03:35,779 --> 02:03:38,714
Hurry, Holiness. The Chinese are close.

905
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:51,052
Hurry, Kundun.
They are close.

906
02:05:00,685 --> 02:05:04,018
Kundun, you must walk
to lndia.

907
02:05:04,089 --> 02:05:08,116
We have won.
Come on.

908
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:12,857
Thus, by the virtue
that has collected...

909
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:14,956
through all that I have done,

910
02:06:15,033 --> 02:06:20,596
may the pain of every living creature
be completely cleared away.

911
02:06:29,549 --> 02:06:33,781
With all respect, sir,
may I ask,

912
02:06:33,853 --> 02:06:36,014
who are you?

913
02:06:36,089 --> 02:06:41,527
What you see before you
is a man, a simple monk.

914
02:06:44,498 --> 02:06:47,365
Are you the Lord Buddha?

915
02:06:47,435 --> 02:06:50,598
I think I am a reflection,

916
02:06:50,671 --> 02:06:53,367
like the moon on water.

917
02:06:53,442 --> 02:06:56,809
When you see me,
and I try to be a good man,

918
02:06:56,878 --> 02:06:59,312
you see yourself.

919
02:07:00,305 --> 02:07:06,884

2
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,954
Uh...

3
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,353
Vinny went to
the wrong hotel.

4
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,112
The wrong hotel?
Yeah.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,112
Motherfucker, how many Caesar
Palaces they got in Las Vegas?

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
He'll be here!

7
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,589
We are going to
start the weigh-in.

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,989
If Pazienza is
not here by 7:00,

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,718
he will be disqualified.

10
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,271
Shit.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,033
Ash.

12
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,234
Ash, answer the phone!

13
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,313
Hello?

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,038
Tell Vinny
they're going ahead.

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,479
They're going ahead.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,056
Just hold them off.
Tell them I'm coming.

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,115
He's coming.

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,275
Where's he at?

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,351
Where's he at?
He's on the fucking bicycle.

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,176
No, dummy. His weight.
What fuckin' weight's he at?

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,395
Where you at, Vinny?
I'm coming!

22
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,118
He's coming.

23
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,591
139 pounds
and three-quarters.

24
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,789
Fuck.

25
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,312
Tell Vinny that
Roger made weight.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,799
Where the fuck's
your boy?

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,958
What are you so worried about?
Where the hell you have to be, anyway?

28
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,838
Beating your pizza-faced,
Liberace-son back to Boston.

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,878
Hey! Hey!
We're from Providence!

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,997
He'll be here. He'll be here.
He'll be here.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,992
Don't you worry about that.
He's gonna be here. He's gonna be here.

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,559
He gonna make it?

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,591
Got a little
surprise for you.

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,234
Get your motherfucking
dick out my face!

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,472
He can't take
his eyes off me.

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,318
He still looks big.

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,311
This is gonna be close.

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,751
140 pounds even.

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,909
Yeah!

40
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,149
Behind me,
the casino here at Caesar's,

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,475
and, yes,
the eve of the big fight.

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,439
Roger Mayweather defending
against Vinny Pazienza.

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,670
For the WBC super
lightweight championship...

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,856
Bottom line is
that I'm willing

45
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,552
to die in that
ring tomorrow night.

46
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,838
I don't think he's ready
to make that sacrifice.

47
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,956
Damn straight. 'Cause
there ain 't no need to.

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,270
Boy thinking about
dying instead of boxing.

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,635
That should tell you
all you need to know.

50
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,994
Motherfucker,
tomorrow night, you gone.

51
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,071
I'm gonna rain on you
like a thunderstorm.

52
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,309
Be scared.
Yeah.

53
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,994
Do me a favor though, tomorrow
you get yourself a Tic Tac.

54
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,536
And if you're this
close to me tomorrow,

55
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
I'm gonna knock you the fuck out.
Okay.

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,313
You all right, champ?

57
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,873
Yeah, yeah.
I'm feeling good.

58
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Yeah.

59
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,878
I know you are.

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,191
You need anything?
Nah, I'm good.

61
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,790
What you doing? You going to bed?
Yeah. Big day tomorrow.

62
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,796
Hey, you should
hit the hay, too.

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Yeah, definitely, Pop.

64
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,831
Okay, good night.
Good night.

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,872
Ride the fever.
Wally Cleaver loves the beaver!

66
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,559
Blow on those.

67
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,952
Yeah!

68
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,873
Baby. You're up 100K,
all right?

69
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,313
Shouldn't you
just call it quits?

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,436
Yeah, yeah.
Just order another OJ.

71
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,794
I'm not thirsty.

72
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,790
What are you doing here?
I'm splitting 10s.

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,836
I mean,
don't you think you should be

74
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
getting some
rest for tomorrow?

75
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,475
It is tomorrow. Yeah, relax.
Just go ahead.

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,438
Okay, yeah.

77
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,354
I don't like this.

78
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,870
Too many, too many! Yes!

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,673
Baby, come on! Yeah, baby!
Vinny! Vinny!

80
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,512
God, Vinny!

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,989
Yeah. Yeah!
Too many!

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,229
Boom!

83
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,754
He's an animal.

84
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,197
Who splits 10s
on a $20,000 hand?

85
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,318
You shut up.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,797
Come on, Vinny!
Come on!

87
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,989
Solid right hand
inside by Mayweather.

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,310
Pazienza stopped
in his tracks.

89
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
Got his attention
pretty good right there.

90
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,679
What are you doing?
Get in there.

91
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,496
- Solid right hand right on the eye!
- That hurt him.

92
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,919
I question,
though,

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,719
whether we'll ever see
Pazienza in the ring again

94
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,394
after taking
a beating like this.

95
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,277
That guy's
got a lot of heart.

96
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm telling you, he's got a lot of heart.

97
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,873
More action after the bell.

98
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,119
I can take that
all day!

99
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,708
You got nothing!
Come on! Come on!

100
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,558
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I'm fine.

101
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,914
I got it. I got it.

102
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,718
I got this. I got it.

103
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Darryl,
give us your score.

104
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,230
Okay, I've got it to
eight rounds to three.

105
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,510
107-101,
favor Roger Mayweather.

106
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,960
I think he's winning the fight big,
and certainly the night.

107
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,176
Good right hand right there.

108
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,350
That was the best
right hand of the fight.

109
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,112
Why let it go any further?

110
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,550
Well, because he's a fighter.

111
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,096
- Watch him finish the fight.
- Well, that's true.

112
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,189
What's going on?

113
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,430
Nothing, Ma.
He's still in his corner.

114
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,936
I'm stopping that fight.

115
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,235
I'm not waiting for a doctor
to make the decision.

116
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,356
You're not
gonna win on points.

117
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,398
You gotta knock him out. Vinny,
you gotta knock him out.

118
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,153
Hey, champ.
Champ. You all right?

119
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,880
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
You all right? Okay.

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,430
You got this. You got this.
Now let's bury him!

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,436
Two hands, Vinny!

122
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,676
Oh, God.

123
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,115
Look at his arms.

124
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,713
You have ketosis.

125
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,317
What does that mean?
I'm just dehydrated, Pop.

126
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,433
We're in
the desert, Vinny.

127
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,239
I see a lot of dehydration cases.
This isn't that.

128
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,196
Doc, I've been doing it this way forever.
This is how it goes for me.

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,430
Well, you can't keep
doing it like this.

130
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,476
Yeah. Thank you, Doc.

131
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,709
Appreciate it.

132
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,949
It's weird, Ma.

133
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,634
It's not weird.
Don't put too much salt.

134
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,176
I'm not gonna put salt,
I'm putting parsley.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,760
If you hadn't
knocked this thing over...

136
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,216
Would you stop crying about
the fucking elephant already?

137
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,336
All right, there we go.
Honest.

138
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,416
I'm just sayin',
I'm not crying.

139
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,237
Hey, you want to
set the table, Jon?

140
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,719
Sorry.

141
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,154
Hey, Ma.
You watch the fight, yet?

142
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
No. I can't
watch you get hurt.

143
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,990
Yeah, well,
you know I don't get hurt.

144
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,433
Where's the tape at?

145
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,112
It's in the VCR.

146
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,896
Can you put
that there, please?

147
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,176
Well, will you move
this thing off the table?

148
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,430
I can't do two
things at once, can I?

149
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,198
The WBC super lightweight title.

150
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,797
If "will" and "want to" alone
was all that mattered,

151
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,438
Pazienza could beat this guy,
but "will" would only take you so far,

152
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,273
unless you can bring
some skill along with it.

153
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,830
That's called an old-fashioned
paintjob in Philadelphia.

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,272
And for about the half-dozenth time,
they scrimmage after the bell.

155
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,033
And Lou Duva goes
after Roger Mayweather.

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,192
Now that's one of the silliest
things he could ever have done.

157
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,794
Well,
Mayweather punched him!

158
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,875
We're talking about
a guy in his 60s...

159
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,678
Vinny, shut it off!

160
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,911
We're eating.
Okay. I'm coming.

161
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,736
How'd it feel to take
a shot from a world champ?

162
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,591
He hits like
a altar boy.

163
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,816
What do you think will be the
next move for Vinny after this fight?

164
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,736
Next. I don't know if
there's gonna be a next.

165
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,280
Now's not the time
for an announcement,

166
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,791
but as far as I'm concerned,
Vinny Pazienza shouldn't fight no more.

167
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,872
Now, boxing's been good to him
and he's been good to boxing,

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,136
and that's
where it should end.

169
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,559
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

170
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,072
I'm good. Vinny, darling,
come here.

171
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,275
I'll have more.

172
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,873
Ridiculous.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,376
Just be happy
with what you got.

174
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,280
It's gonna fall out of her head now,
you know...

175
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,758
Pop, stay calm,
all right?

176
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,229
I need them to
set the next fight.

177
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,270
Vinny, Angelo,
come on in.

178
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,757
Angelo. Uh...

179
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,319
What a surprise.

180
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,549
How you doing, Vinny?

181
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,795
They block
the driveway?

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,158
We need to talk.

183
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,376
You should have
called first.

184
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,336
You know I don't like to
take meetings in the house.

185
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,079
Yeah, and you should have thought
before opening your fucking mouth

186
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,833
and telling the whole world
my son should retire.

187
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,396
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, now, Lou. Let's talk.

188
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,632
Come on.
Fine. Let's talk.

189
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,236
Vinny ain't
done, Lou.

190
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,871
And even if you think he is, you've
got no business announcing it on HBO.

191
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,110
What the fuck.

192
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,395
Vinny'll decide
when he's done.

193
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,880
Well, I wish we'd spoken first,
but it's not a perfect world.

194
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,718
It's fine. It's all right.
Lou, I need another fight.

195
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,896
What's with
the deep fuckin' breath?

196
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,831
You owe him another
fight on his contract.

197
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,353
Pop.

198
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,839
Lookit, Vinny.

199
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,194
All I'm saying
is that

200
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,041
I think maybe you ought to start
thinking about more important things.

201
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,576
Your sister's getting married.
You should consider doing the same.

202
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Start a family.

203
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,240
What the fuck does that have
to do with him fighting?

204
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Pop, please.

205
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,056
Even when you win,
we end up in the hospital.

206
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,719
Who's "we"?
I ain't never seen you there.

207
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,315
Huh?

208
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,550
Lou, for fuck's sake,
say something!

209
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,268
You got heart, kid, but you
wear it on your fucking chin.

210
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,755
I seriously think you ought
to consider hanging it up.

211
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,957
I'm not done yet, all right?
I got more in me.

212
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,918
That's not the problem.
You always got more.

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,271
I'm begging you here, Lou.

214
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,191
Give me another shot.

215
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,993
Just one more.

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,752
Fuck. Shit.

217
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,754
Rough night?

218
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,876
No. Great night.

219
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,473
Rough morning.

220
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,398
You're early.

221
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,993
You're drunk.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,593
No, I'm hungover.

223
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,716
There's a
huge difference.

224
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,151
Well, you smell
like liquor.

225
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,117
And you smell
like Rhode Island.

226
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,952
What? You've never
had a big night before?

227
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,712
No. I don't drink.

228
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,869
Yeah?

229
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,393
Good for you.

230
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
Now, if we're done with the
fucking introductions...

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,911
I can't see shit
out here.

232
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,349
This is where you
trained Tyson, huh?

233
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,589
Yeah.

234
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
That is crazy.

235
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,073
This your family?

236
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,315
Yeah.

237
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,237
You guys go
to Disneyland?

238
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,551
World. In Orlando.

239
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,956
Oh... Not yet.

240
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,318
So, why did Tyson fire you?

241
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,510
What?
Was it that DUI thing?

242
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,995
What are you,
a newspaperman?

243
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,799
Nah, I'm just asking.

244
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,676
Do you not want
to be here?

245
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,398
Yeah, I'm standing here,
aren't I?

246
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,948
All right, listen.
Let's get real, Vinny.

247
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,789
Yeah.

248
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,073
You lost three in a row,
last one, a title fight,

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,515
you got nothing lined up
'cause you're not a draw,

250
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,718
your own manager, on fucking HBO,
said you should hang it up.

251
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,712
The only reason
you're standing in my gym

252
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,194
is because Lou sent you here
to put us both out to pasture.

253
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,034
So, if you want to get this over
with, let's get it over with.

254
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,553
You all set?
Yeah.

255
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,710
All right.
This is Manny.

256
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,313
How we doing?
How are you?

257
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,753
You'll be sparring
with him today.

258
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,114
Okay.

259
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,511
How much you weigh?
190.

260
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,831
You know that I fight
at junior welter, right?

261
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,832
I know. Head-gear's in
the locker by the wall.

262
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Come on.

263
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,199
That's enough!

264
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,755
That's enough!

265
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,911
Get on.
Why?

266
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,278
What, "why"? Why not?
Gotta know where we're starting.

267
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,391
I'm not in camp
or nothing.

268
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,799
I haven't been training.

269
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,679
Let's see.

270
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,988
All right.

271
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,834
There's no point.

272
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,797
I'm gonna be way over.

273
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,216
You just fought at 140 two weeks ago.
What, did you eat a horse?

274
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,800
I told you,
I haven't been training.

275
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,831
That's not what
I usually weigh.

276
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,831
I'm not at my
fight weight right now.

277
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,070
Hey, Vinny, I just
saw you use your weight.

278
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,950
It wasn't
slowing you down. At all.

279
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,478
Look, I don't need to cut corners, Kev.
I can make weight.

280
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,834
No, maybe you're
at your weight.

281
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,912
Cutting corners is
what you've been doing.

282
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,240
I won my first
world title...

283
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
As a lightweight, I know.

284
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,760
The first time I got laid was
in my high school parking lot.

285
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,917
You see me taking my wife there every
time I want to get my rocks off?

286
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,513
Look at you.

287
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,296
You're a different fighter,
your body's changed.

288
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,390
You're bigger.
You hit with more power.

289
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,313
You think I should
move up?

290
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Eh...

291
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,475
Welterweight?

292
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,837
Junior middle?
Are you nuts?

293
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,276
You're outta your head, Kev. Come on.
Nobody jumps two classes.

294
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,112
That's...
No, no, that's a huge risk,

295
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,216
which is the exact opposite
of what everybody tells me

296
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,514
I should be doing
right now.

297
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,432
It's a risk.

298
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,792
This is The Clock.

299
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,512
He's gonna teach you
how to move and time.

300
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,396
Jesus Christ, Kev!
What's that thing made out of?

301
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,754
Rock maple.

302
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,434
And you don't get to hit
The Clock back yet, neither. Not yet.

303
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,400
I only want you
to avoid him for now, all right?

304
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,915
Bend your knees.
Move your head.

305
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
Right, left.
Move your head. Left, right.

306
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,671
Throw a punch,
you move your head.

307
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,239
You look like
a two-by-four.

308
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,990
No. Come on,
Vinny. Move your head.

309
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,116
Come on.
Look at it. Anticipate it.

310
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,839
No. Punch, move.
Punch, move.

311
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,593
I got this. Come on.

312
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,794
Here we go.

313
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,240
That's it,
that's it, that's it.

314
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,629
On the side,
sit down on it.

315
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,038
Bad intentions.

316
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,589
Bad intentions.

317
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,198
Now you're moving.
Bend your knees.

318
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,072
Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up.

319
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,229
Good.

320
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,394
You're looking good now.
You're moving your head.

321
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,909
All right, stop. Okay, Vinny, that's good.
Vinny, Vinny! Stop!

322
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
What?
Stop.

323
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
What?

324
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,792
What is that?

325
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Huh?

326
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,593
What?

327
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,199
You fight the same way.

328
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,117
It's like if you're
not completely spent,

329
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,992
then you must not
have tried hard enough.

330
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,176
Yeah. I don't mind the pain.

331
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,872
Good, 'cause it's comin'.

332
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,319
I'm sayin' you don't have
to send out invitations, you know?

333
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,159
You can't brawl at this weight.
You have to box.

334
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
You have to defend.

335
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,472
Yeah, my offense
is my defense.

336
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,074
Yeah? Where'd you
come up with that gem?

337
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,390
Don Shula's autobiography?

338
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,950
Listen to me, some hits you aren't
being tough by taking.

339
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,470
So, when I say
"stop," you stop.

340
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,156
You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.

341
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,631
Put the plate down there.
You did a very good job.

342
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,239
Everything's fine.
Everything's good.

343
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,880
I think it looks lovely,
I do. I just...

344
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
Your ma
religious, Vin?

345
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,034
Yeah.

346
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,153
What do you think, Kev?

347
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,791
Spiritual.

348
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Yeah.

349
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,595
Christ and elephants.

350
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,512
Honey, you did so perfect.
The knife goes on that side.

351
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,912
You made it.

352
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,958
And honey, you look great. Great.
Thank you. Thanks.

353
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,076
And, Ma, this is Kevin.
Mrs. Pazienza.

354
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,280
Thank you for taking
such good care of my boy.

355
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,856
Yeah. It's nothing.
I like your elephants.

356
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,555
Oh, those are mine.
Yeah, I love elephants.

357
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,432
Yeah. Hi,
I'm Vinny's sister, Doreen.

358
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,590
And this is my
retarded fiancé, Jon.

359
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,159
The fuck's wrong with you?

360
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,759
Be quiet, all right?

361
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,956
And this is...
Oh, yeah, I remember.

362
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,115
Hi, Shelly.

363
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,275
Actually, it's Heather.

364
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,079
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, how are you?

365
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,275
Hi, Mr. Pazienza.

366
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,549
No. Angelo.

367
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,868
Angelo. Nice to meet you.

368
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,951
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, Pop.

369
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Champ.
Hey, how you doing?

370
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,798
Jesus, you're huge.

371
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,074
What are you at, 150?

372
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,355
154.

373
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,456
What are you doing?
No, it's a good thing. Trust me.

374
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,675
Kevin knows what
he's doing. Yeah.

375
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,736
What are we having for dinner?
I'm starving.

376
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,016
All right,
everybody sit down. Come on.

377
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,109
All right.

378
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,952
Doreen, serve the salad.
Sorry. Sit down.

379
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,952
Darling, here you go.
Yeah, there you go. That's right.

380
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,429
You sit down.
No, I got it. I got it. Sit.

381
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,078
Babe, you good?

382
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,896
What else do you need?
No, no. I think I'm good.

383
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,640
Everybody start with the salad.
All right...

384
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,073
You settled in
all right?

385
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,991
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

386
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,958
You got everything
you need?

387
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,838
That mattress is brand new
that we put in for you.

388
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,797
Oh, yeah?

389
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,439
I'm good.

390
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,154
So, let me ask you,

391
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,993
who told you to come in here
with your missionary bullshit

392
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,116
and change
the whole program?

393
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,508
Behind my back no less.

394
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,592
I mean, it wasn't a secret or nothin'.
If Vinny didn't tell you...

395
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,796
I'll deal with Vinny.

396
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,472
I'm talking to you.

397
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,233
And I'm telling you that pushing
him up two weight classes

398
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,311
is a dangerous
fucking move.

399
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,517
How do you expect the Duvas
to find him a match?

400
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,318
That's their job.

401
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,588
Vinny made this decision,
Mr. Pazienza.

402
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,056
I don't know why you're so worried
'cause he's a great fighter.

403
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,469
Yeah, I know
he's a great fighter.

404
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,198
He was a great fighter
before he met you.

405
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,798
All right, you be first.
You be first.

406
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,714
There you go.

407
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,912
All right.
That's enough.

408
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,988
That's enough.
You tired?

409
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,149
No, no, I'm good.

410
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,349
Let's go one more round.

411
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,471
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny,
that's enough.

412
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,197
- Kev...
- Don't "Kev" me. Come on.

413
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,833
All right.
See you tomorrow.

414
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,913
Hey, champ, Kev, my office.
Both of youse.

415
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,839
All right.

416
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,148
Sit.

417
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,519
The fight came in.

418
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,674
Hey.

419
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,228
And it's a fucking
title bout.

420
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,153
Are you serious?
Yeah.

421
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,073
Who?
It's the French guy. Deal.

422
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,997
Dele?
Yeah, Dele. Whatever.

423
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,753
He's back in,
with a title fight!

424
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,356
Kev, you hear that?

425
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,671
I got a title fight.
I got a title fight, baby!

426
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,910
Are you kidding me?
Come on! Hey, Vinny, Vinny.

427
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,912
Get back to work.
Get back on your game!

428
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,632
Come on! Yeah!

429
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,840
It's bad enough that
you're promoting both fighters,

430
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,359
but I know you
made a deal for Dele

431
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,056
to fight Rossi in
Europe in three months.

432
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,593
$250K.

433
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,511
And we both know he's only worth that
much if it's a unifying title fight.

434
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,749
You need Vinny to lose.

435
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,952
It's worth just as
much to us if Vinny wins.

436
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,959
We'll make
Dele-Rossi the under-card,

437
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,759
put Vinny in the ring
with Sugar Ray or Duran.

438
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,274
Duran!
That's a big fucking "if".

439
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,475
Did you buy your
tickets to Italy yet?

440
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Huh?

441
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,673
I bet you did.

442
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,636
Nah. It's too soon.

443
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,393
Forget using Vinny
as a stepping stone.

444
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,596
You're making him
a fucking doormat.

445
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,555
We had options at 140.

446
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,751
At 154, our hands are tied.

447
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,936
You said you wanted a fight.

448
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,758
Yeah, a fight.
You're sending him to the lions.

449
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,993
And I thought he was coming here
to bring us a bottle of champagne.

450
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,679
I just talked to Angelo.

451
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,479
It don't sound like nobody over
there is too upset. Just you.

452
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,959
Go home, Kev.
Relax. This is good. For who?

453
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,829
If you didn't finish his career in Vegas,
you're doing it now.

454
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,313
We are?

455
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,879
We were the ones
who asked for this?

456
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,120
We were the ones who bumped
him up two weight classes?

457
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,440
We were the ones who wanted
to make a big splash

458
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,988
so that the world
could know Rooney's back.

459
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,835
This is on you, Kev.

460
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,555
Vinnie Pazienza is hoping
to find some stability and consistency

461
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,200
at his new 154-pound home.

462
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,316
Vinnie Pazienza has perhaps one last
shot to win a world championship

463
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,437
when he takes on undefeated WBA
junior middle weight champ,

464
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,953
Gilbert Dele.

465
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,917
When Dele won
the title in February,

466
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,917
he cold-cocked
a helpless opponent

467
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,234
named Carlos Elliott.

468
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,149
Elliott left on a stretcher,
face down, with a broken jaw.

469
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,708
Well, good news is,
he hits like a girl.

470
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,236
The Providence Civic Center.

471
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,153
Fighting here has been one of
Vinny Pazienza's greatest dreams

472
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,310
since becoming
a professional boxer.

473
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,391
Well, it's no longer a dream.

474
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,870
Coming up, Vinny Pazienza,
the homecoming.

475
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,829
Gilbert is cool, nice.

476
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,990
Well, you know,
he's a very fine guy.

477
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,074
He's a fine guy, but he's a rough,
rough, rough guy.

478
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,038
What does that mean?
Does he got rough hands?

479
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,040
T ell you what, my mom owns
a salon in Cranston.

480
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,000
He can go get a manicure,
if that's the problem.

481
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,075
Gilbert says he can kick your Italian
ass in any country you like.

482
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,229
Yeah? Well, not this one,
Gilbert, all right?

483
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,958
You're stepping in
front of Providence,

484
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,758
you're stepping in
front of my people,

485
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,319
I've worked really
hard to get here.

486
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,516
I'm not going anywhere
without that belt.

487
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,357
He wishes you
the best of luck.

488
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Come on.

489
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,593
Come on, Kev, turn the music up.
I'm feeling good.

490
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,592
I want you fresh for tomorrow.
Come on. All right. All right.

491
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,749
Come on, Jon!

492
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,080
What? He asked me to hold the bag.
You want me to say no?

493
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,193
Come on, man.

494
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
What?

495
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,033
This fight...

496
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,509
We gotta be careful.

497
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,715
Yeah.

498
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,336
Kev, you bumped me
up two weight classes,

499
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,576
it's the night
before the fight,

500
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,776
you're telling
me to be careful?

501
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
No kidding.

502
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,336
Come on, what are you
doing right now?

503
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,696
How is this
supposed to help anybody?

504
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,234
I could ask you the same question.
It's 9:30.

505
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,193
I mean, come on.

506
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,395
Kev, look. I get it.
You need this win as much as I do.

507
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,391
You're damn right
I need this win.

508
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,155
But this isn't about me.
It's about you!

509
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,193
You're all in.
All the time.

510
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,032
Scares the shit outta me.

511
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,119
What do you
want me to do?

512
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,856
You want me to be half in?
Want me to be a quarter in?

513
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,096
You want me to, like, smoke a
cigarette between rounds? What?

514
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,317
I want you to understand the difference
between a risk and a gamble.

515
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,879
Yeah. Risk, gambles,
whatever.

516
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,313
No, not whatever.

517
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,868
This, what we do here,
this is calculated, okay?

518
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,355
We weigh the odds.
We make a choice.

519
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,551
This ain't
blackjack, Vinny.

520
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,432
It ain't orange juice
and tit-jobs and sunglasses.

521
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,839
This is it.

522
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,959
This is fucking it!

523
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,070
Do you think I'm
going to lose this fight?

524
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,439
No.

525
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,711
Good. Me neither.

526
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,076
They come from
opposite ends of the spectrum.

527
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,796
Suave, smooth gentleman from Paris,
the champion, Gilbert Dele.

528
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,192
Going up, the blue collar fighter
from Providence, Rhode Island,

529
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,554
Vinny Pazienza.

530
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,240
Sarah, come on,
it's starting any minute!

531
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,589
Come on, champ!

532
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,552
You be first, Vinny.
You be first!

533
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,273
He's got...

534
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,359
Go on, Vinny!

535
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,039
Come on, let's go.

536
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,869
Come on, Vin.

537
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,509
Twist off the ropes!

538
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,316
Dele nails Pazienza upstairs.

539
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,550
Again, again!
Push off! Push off!

540
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,711
Get off the ropes!
Twist off the ropes, Vinny!

541
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,113
Come on, Vinny!
What are you doing?

542
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,079
There you go.

543
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Vin...

544
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,795
Doreen,
why are you so quiet?

545
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,598
Come on! Come on!
The fuck is he doing?

546
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,916
I've been here all day. I love it.
I can do this all day, baby.

547
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,473
I'll see you
right after this.

548
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,437
What are you doing, champ?
Stop playing around!

549
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,195
Come on!

550
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,355
Give me water.

551
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,176
This wasn't
the game plan, all right?

552
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,156
Why are you going
toe-to-toe with this guy, huh?

553
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,479
Hey, Vinny, look at me.

554
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,272
You don't move and you're gonna get hurt.
You're gonna get hurt!

555
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,976
Don't let the feelings
get the better of you, okay?

556
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,434
You don't have to slug
with this guy, all right?

557
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,919
What?

558
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,069
What is it?

559
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,270
He doesn't hit
like a girl at all.

560
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,112
Jesus Christ.

561
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,150
He actually hits
pretty hard.

562
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,312
Vinny, move your head,
all right? Come on!

563
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,550
You kick his fucking ass!

564
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,117
There you go!

565
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,950
There you go! There you go!
Now you're moving!

566
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,870
Yes, baby! Yes!

567
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,395
Stay on him!
That's it. Yes!

568
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,915
Come on!

569
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,513
What are you doing, Vinny?
Come on!

570
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,275
Come on, Vinny!
Come on, finish him off!

571
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,160
This could end
in a knockout!

572
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,429
Go to your corner.

573
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,636
Ma! He did it!
Ma! He just did it!

574
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,398
He knocked him out!
He knocked him out?

575
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Oh, my God!

576
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,914
What are you doing?

577
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,794
Vinny!

578
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,275
Oh, my God!

579
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Whoo!

580
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,079
Oh, my God,
he did it!

581
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,256
You stuck it out, Vinny.

582
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,159
I did it with dogged determination
and persistent perseverance.

583
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,834
I'm back on top!
How do you feel, champ?

584
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,475
I feel like I should be on a box of
Wheaties, doing a Gatorade commercial.

585
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,677
I feel like I should be going to
Disneyland or something, I'm just...

586
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,994
I'm so happy!

587
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,555
So what?
You bulk up. No big deal.

588
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,789
It's Duran.

589
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,896
You'll have to fight
him super middleweight.

590
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,478
Yeah, you think
I can handle him?

591
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,994
I'd rather you fight
where you naturally live.

592
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,799
I don't want you to have to
starve yourself or bulk up.

593
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,916
But, yeah,
you can handle him.

594
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,036
"Handle him"?
He's gonna murder him.

595
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,839
You're too fucking nervous, Kevin.
You know that?

596
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,194
Hey. You're not
nervous enough.

597
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,509
Yo.

598
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,755
Hey, you got it?

599
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,877
She's outside.
Nice!

600
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,159
Where you going?

601
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,272
We're just going to Dunkin'.
Grab some coffee.

602
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
All right.

603
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,357
You be back for dinner.

604
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,120
Yeah, well, he just
got this new car, Pops.

605
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,718
So I might be
a little late for dinner.

606
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,671
Does this mean
we're not going to AC?

607
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,796
Nah. Gotta be back tonight.
Let's just do Foxwoods.

608
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,233
All right.

609
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,396
Hey, so did you
figure out your next fight?

610
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,993
We're gonna skip
the rematch with Dele

611
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,712
and go in straight
to something bigger.

612
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,915
How big?

613
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,795
Like Duran big.

614
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,711
Holy shit. How much?
Jimmy!

615
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,508
Vinny. Vinny. Vinny.

616
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,315
Vinny.

617
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,668
Fuck!

618
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Hey.

619
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,873
Hey! Call a
fucking ambulance!

620
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,790
You see the way he hits now?
Like a fucking bull.

621
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,199
Come on. Deal.

622
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,557
You're so quiet tonight,
Anthony.

623
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,551
I almost forgot
you were there.

624
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,758
I came to play cards, not to hear
about your fucking kid all night.

625
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,558
Yeah. Fuck you.

626
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,272
Hey, Angelo,
Vinny's on TV!

627
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,191
Jesus Christ already.

628
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,634
Good evening.
Rhode Island's own Pazmanian Devil

629
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,474
is in Kent County Memorial Hospital
tonight with a fractured neck.

630
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,388
News Watch 10 has obtained
these photographs

631
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,756
taken at the accident scene
not long after it happened.

632
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,838
They show the car in which
Vinny Pazienza was riding

633
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,148
as well as the other car...

634
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,477
...here at Kent
County Hospital

635
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,352
as friends and
family are gathering

636
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,079
to see what actually
happened in the accident.

637
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,033
Champ.

638
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,033
Champ...
No, honey, he can't.

639
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,471
They got him all drugged up
because he couldn't breathe.

640
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,348
What happened to him?

641
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,478
He got hit by a car.

642
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,079
No, what happened to him?

643
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,637
Angelo, sit down.

644
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,514
Champ?

645
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,314
Pop?
Yeah, I'm here.

646
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,512
Pop?
Champ.

647
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,028
Yeah?

648
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,190
- Your breath is killing me.
- Oh!

649
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,519
Thank you, God.

650
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,953
How do you feel?

651
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,270
Like I should be on
a box of Wheaties.

652
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,028
Why am I in this thing?

653
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,359
What?

654
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,718
You were in an accident.

655
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,033
Your neck's broke.

656
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,992
What are you talking about?

657
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,159
No, it's not.

658
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,708
Pop, I...

659
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,190
What are you talking about?
Ma, stop crying.

660
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,833
I'm gonna get the doctor.

661
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,233
I feel fine.

662
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,993
You're not
fine, Vinny.

663
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,834
The break on the C3 is less than an
eighth of an inch from your spinal cord.

664
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,992
You don't need to be a radiologist
to see this is a problem.

665
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,752
Vinny, you're
seriously injured.

666
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,235
This is going to be
a long road to recovery.

667
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,353
How much time?

668
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,998
How much time, what?

669
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,877
How much time until
I can fight again?

670
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,960
Vinny.

671
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,669
What?

672
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,040
Doc, how much time
until I can fight again?

673
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,056
Vinny, this is not the time
to be talking about this...

674
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,593
Ma, please. Let him answer.

675
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,714
I can't say with any certainty
you're going to walk again.

676
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,033
What are you talking about?
I can feel everything.

677
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,599
I feel fine, look.
Nurse...

678
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,591
I'm moving my toes.
Look, I can feel that.

679
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,272
Vinny, calm down.
Calm down.

680
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,271
I feel all this stuff.
I can move everything.

681
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,112
What are you talking about?
I can feel that.

682
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,792
I feel that! I feel fine!
Vinny!

683
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,433
Vinny! Vinny! Vinny!

684
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,919
Vinny, it's all right.
It's okay.

685
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,951
I feel fine, Doc.
You don't know... Stop.

686
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,176
You got my arm right there.
What are you talking about?

687
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,216
Okay. Kev, tell
them I'm going to fight again.

688
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,275
You tell them!

689
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,315
Kevin, just tell them...

690
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,271
How you feeling, Vinny?
Fine.

691
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,471
Listen, I want to talk to you one
more time about your options

692
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,238
before we proceed tomorrow.

693
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,151
No need.
Well...

694
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,831
If I install the halo, there's
no guarantee that it will work.

695
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,753
The halo relies solely on
your body healing on its own.

696
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,070
Well, that's good,
because I heal fast.

697
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,229
Not that fast.

698
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,480
It'll be six months until
you're really out of danger.

699
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,909
Until then,
one bump, one fall,

700
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,992
any kind of movement and your
spinal cord could sever.

701
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,496
Any doctor in the world
would be telling you

702
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,751
that spinal fusion is really
the preferred procedure

703
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,273
with this severe of an injury.

704
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,750
You already told me all this.
You and my mom would get along great.

705
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,033
If you let me
do the fusion,

706
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,438
I can guarantee you'll
be able to walk again.

707
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,193
That's not enough for me.

708
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,480
I need to be
able to fight again.

709
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,536
I need you to
understand the risks...

710
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,039
I understand.

711
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,871
I don't think you do.

712
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,311
You're not fusing my neck.

713
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,552
I want you to count
backwards from 10, Vinny.

714
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,710
Didn't they tell
you I'm a boxer?

715
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,033
Eight, seven... Not sure
if you know this, but...

716
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,070
...six, five...

717
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,475
Have you ever
been to Mexico...

718
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,233
...three, two...

719
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,157
Where's my mom?

720
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,871
Okay.
Let's lift the head.

721
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,794
Careful.
You okay?

722
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,509
Come on. Come on.

723
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,909
- There he is. There he is.
- Get out of here.

724
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,195
Get out of here.
Come on, come on, get out of here.

725
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,193
You're gonna get run over
by the car, come on.

726
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,195
Nah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

727
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,120
Ow!

728
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,394
Christ, you okay?

729
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,988
Come on, let me help you!
Let me help you, for Christ's sake!

730
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,196
Dad, get off me! Stop.

731
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,352
Come on. Come on.

732
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,353
All right.

733
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,595
Yeah.

734
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,995
Nah, I'm not getting
in that thing again.

735
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,389
Come on...
Nah. Put it away.

736
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,751
It's a...
It's a Craftmatic.

737
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,998
We got your room all set
up down here in the den.

738
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,912
Yeah, I saw that.

739
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,240
Brought your posters
down and everything.

740
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,359
Thanks, Jon.

741
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,035
What do you need?
Where's the parm?

742
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,439
I got it.

743
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,875
Look, I appreciate what you guys
are doing, but I'm not a handicap.

744
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,116
We left the wheelchair
in the car.

745
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,112
We just want to make sure that
you don't hurt yourself, Vin.

746
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,856
What are you trying to prove
getting up, anyways?

747
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,632
I'm not trying to
prove anything, Doreen.

748
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,656
If I would have asked you to
get me the parm a week ago,

749
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,716
you would have told me
to go fuck myself. Hey!

750
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,319
All right.
Yeah, that's fair.

751
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,515
There's your parm.

752
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,395
Vinny, I got two
color appointments,

753
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,616
but I'm gonna come home
and make you lunch, all right?

754
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,073
All right.
Okay.

755
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,437
Get some rest, champ.

756
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,635
I thought
the kids were gonna be...

757
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,357
Just curious. You know, you
kind ofjust wonder about these things.

758
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,590
Time may be running
out for the Red Sox. They may...

759
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,069
You like that?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I do.

760
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,351
Yeah, it's like a little jungle gym.

761
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,272
Yeah, swing around on it.
Yeah?

762
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,436
Go crazy.
I don't wanna hurt you.

763
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,028
No, you're not gonna hurt me.
Hey!

764
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,997
Give me a kiss.
Ow!

765
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,275
What? Come on.

766
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,199
Vin.
What?

767
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,918
My fuckin' hair's caught

768
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,911
in your fuckin' thing!
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

769
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Ow!

770
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,872
Yeah, I got you.
It's fine.

771
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,154
Look at my hair now!

772
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,554
You look good. I'm sorry.

773
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,311
No. I can't do this.

774
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,591
Yeah, we don't have to kiss.
We'll figure something else out.

775
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,376
- Where you going?
- Come here.

776
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,549
Come here.

777
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,715
You see, that's not nice.

778
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,576
You can't just come over
here and tease me like that.

779
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,397
Vinny...
You know I'm right.

780
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,038
I gotta tell you...
Let it go. What?

781
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,151
That thing, it's freaking me out.
Yeah?

782
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,556
I don't know what
you want me to do.

783
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,392
Call me when
it's like a sweater.

784
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,277
Are you serious?
Yeah.

785
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,672
You rest. You need to rest.
Yeah.

786
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,433
Yeah, I know. I've rested plenty.
I need to not rest.

787
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,591
Yeah, don't come back.
All right.

788
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,591
You kiss me like that...

789
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,469
Fuck.

790
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,551
...for some time,
Midnight Madness became March Madness.

791
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,393
Welcome to the Robin Hood
Basketball Redemption Tour.

792
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,231
Hey, Kev. Hey.

793
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,950
This is how you're
spending your birthday?

794
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,399
Yeah, you know.

795
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,836
Come on. Get dressed.
I'm taking you out.

796
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,993
I don't wanna.

797
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,399
Come on.

798
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,909
Nah.

799
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,393
Let's go. Come on.

800
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,911
Let's go, come on!
We're gonna have fun tonight.

801
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,514
We'll do the Elevator.
We'll do the Elevator.

802
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,158
Look at that. Come on.

803
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,115
God, Kev, you're scarring me.
Sit down.

804
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,679
Come on. Come on.

805
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,233
I can't unsee
what I just saw.

806
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,072
Get up. There you go.

807
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,879
Happy birthday, kid.
Hey, good to see you. Thank you.

808
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,592
I almost forgot.

809
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,677
All right, now hold on.
Yeah.

810
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,199
All right, come on.

811
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,835
There you go.

812
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,256
Kev, come on.
What's with all the moping?

813
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,271
Kev, come on.
Get me outta this thing!

814
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,153
Loosen up.
My God.

815
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,953
Why couldn't you
drive a minivan?

816
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,234
God.

817
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,195
All right.

818
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,993
Hey, what... Why are we going here?
What?

819
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,440
I'm gonna know
everybody in here.

820
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,816
You're not gonna know anyone.
It's a Tuesday.

821
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,956
Only skanks and
hoes work Tuesdays.

822
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,308
Or you may know everyone.

823
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,393
Surprise!

824
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,389
Happy birthday!

825
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,234
He had no idea!

826
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,319
Then why is it
called an island?

827
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,789
It's not an actual island,
it's named after an island.

828
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,189
Rhodes.
Yes. The island of Rhodes.

829
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,396
Yes. See?
Cape Cod. Nantucket.

830
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,336
What are you talking about?
It has nothing to do with...

831
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,430
Here you are, champ!

832
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,919
This is it.

833
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,240
Huh?

834
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,993
This is it.

835
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,748
Vinny!

836
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,240
Oh.

837
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,512
Yeah.
Look at that.

838
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,518
- Beautiful.
- Really nice.

839
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,435
"WBA,
Junior Middleweight Champ."

840
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
You are.

841
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,953
All right.

842
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,749
Yeah, thanks, guys.
It really means a lot to me.

843
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,713
Everybody showing up here
and supporting me.

844
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,998
I just want to say thank you,
it really means a lot.

845
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,559
To Vinny!

846
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,032
Cheers!

847
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,995
All right!

848
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,872
This whole thing's
a machine.

849
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,913
When the machine runs,
it feeds everybody.

850
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,912
When it's down, when it ain't running,
nobody eats. You understand?

851
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,509
The machine,
it don't stop for nobody.

852
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,319
Not for me, not for Don King,
not even for you.

853
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,633
Now, we know you still have three
months to defend your title...

854
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,479
We're asking you to
give that up now, Vin.

855
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,674
Defending your title in March
is just not a possibility.

856
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,399
Sometimes you gotta cut your
losses to count your gains.

857
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,993
Am I right?

858
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,631
You got your belt. Everybody
knows you're the champ.

859
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,760
It ain't personal.

860
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,908
Hey, happy birthday.

861
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,880
Thanks.

862
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,110
What'd those two
dumdums want from you?

863
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,269
Eh, nothing.

864
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,591
Huh?
Nothing.

865
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,114
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

866
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,474
What's up?

867
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,671
Hey, we're not
done here, Vinny.

868
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,072
We're not?
No.

869
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,232
We just need to figure out
what's next for you.

870
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,474
There's a whole
world outside the ring.

871
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,033
You know, Kev,

872
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,996
I'm getting pretty sick of people
talking about me like I'm dead.

873
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,350
Like I died
in that car wreck.

874
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,196
Like it's just over for me.

875
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,151
Kev, I'm gonna fight again.

876
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,832
No, you ain't, Vinny.

877
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,230
That's what
everybody here knows,

878
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,550
but are afraid
to say it to your face.

879
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,993
You're not gonna fight again.
It's over.

880
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,192
You gotta let it go.

881
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,069
Make sure my folks
get home all right.

882
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,753
Twin River.

883
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,196
Jesus, Vinny.
Hey.

884
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,033
I know. And I can't even
park in the handicap spot.

885
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,192
How you feeling, honey?
Uh, I'm feelin' good. Yeah.

886
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,759
Thank you. You look good.

887
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,400
Good to have you back, Mr. Pazienza.
Hey.

888
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,435
Hey.

889
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,113
Hey, guys, how we doing?

890
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,434
Hey. How are you?

891
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,756
I'm Vinny Paz. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?

892
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,936
Can you take
this off the table?

893
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,234
Yeah. Sure.

894
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Twenty-two.

895
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,470
Easy! Easy, Kev!
Easy, easy, easy!

896
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,000
Your cab's coming.
Stand right here.

897
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,354
I don't want a cab!

898
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,096
Yeah, I know you don't,
but you're gonna get one.

899
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,536
Just stand right here.
All right, all right!

900
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,960
I'm not gonna get in the car!
Kevin!

901
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,276
Stay away
from that car, Kevin!

902
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,035
Don't go in the car.
Kevin, don't do it!

903
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,838
You're right.
Come on back.

904
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,553
Ah, Jesus Christ.

905
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,073
Come on.

906
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,993
Hit me.

907
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,389
I'm sorry, Vinny.

908
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,080
Come on.

909
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,350
It's coming up
right up here.

910
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,550
Vinny?
What?

911
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,835
What are you
doing down there?

912
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,199
I don't know.

913
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,673
Come on, Pazman.

914
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,679
Let's go.

915
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,197
Fuck.

916
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,029
Ah!

917
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,069
Let's go. Come on.

918
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,913
Come on!

919
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,515
Come on, Vinny. Come on, Paz.

920
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,229
Come on.

921
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,188
Come on.

922
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,638
Come on. Yeah.

923
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,320
Come on, Paz.
Let's go, baby. Come on.

924
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,310
Let him sleep.
He was probably up reading.

925
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,718
Reading?

926
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,472
Why are you
this stupid?

927
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,153
Hey.
Hey.

928
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,959
What you watching?

929
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,031
Just watching
the fights a little bit.

930
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,751
So, you get any
action at county or what?

931
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,159
Fuck off.

932
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,392
Jesus.
When did you get out?

933
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,152
Nah, I never went in.

934
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,310
I got released
after 12 hours.

935
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,591
I lost my license. On probation.
It's fucking stupid.

936
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,880
Well, I'm glad you came over.

937
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,389
Nah. I should have
come by sooner.

938
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,536
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna say hi to your mom.

939
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,836
Yeah, hold on. Let me talk to
you about something real quick.

940
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,035
What?

941
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,519
I need your help.

942
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,349
What happened?
You in trouble?

943
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,996
What, gambling?
You need money? What? No, no.

944
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,672
No. None of that stuff.

945
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,871
Vinny, come on.
What? Say it. Yeah, yeah.

946
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,640
I know, I know.
I'm just going to show you.

947
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,714
Vin, come on.

948
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,030
What, did you buy
a new jean jacket?

949
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,429
I need you to start
training me again.

950
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,632
Fuck you.

951
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,429
Right?

952
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,275
Stop it.

953
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,391
I'm serious.
I see that.

954
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,800
Vinny, come on.
Sooner or later,

955
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,136
you got to start
accepting that maybe...

956
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,071
Look,
I already started, Kev.

957
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,710
Started what?
With just the bar.

958
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,795
Now, I've been
going real slow,

959
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,216
and I haven't rushed through anything,
just like you taught me...

960
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,800
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.
Whoa! Vinny, no!

961
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,114
No!
What?

962
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,798
What are you doing?
This is insane.

963
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,910
You looked in
the mirror lately?

964
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,991
You seen that
thing on your head?

965
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,753
Come on, you heard what the doctor said.
You're risking your life here.

966
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,068
What life?

967
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,828
Upstairs?

968
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,511
No, I can't do it.

969
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,552
This is a fucking
Hail Mary at best.

970
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,154
No it's...
No it's not. It's a gamble.

971
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,352
Yeah, I know that.

972
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,591
But, look, if there was a time to
roll the dice, this is it.

973
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,800
I mean, you just
don't know how to give up.

974
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,511
No, I do. Trust me, I do.
I know exactly how to give up.

975
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,795
You know what scares
the shit out of me, Kev?

976
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,518
Is that it's easy.

977
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:00,273
Something goes wrong and I'm involved,
I couldn't live with that.

978
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,476
Doreen, it's your play.
Come on.

979
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,269
Doreen.
What?

980
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,475
It's your turn.

981
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,312
I know it's my...
Give me a second.

982
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,198
I gotta figure
out what I'm doing.

983
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,440
- Doreen.
- What?

984
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,152
Come on, you're up.
Oh, my God.

985
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,030
I know it's me.
I gotta figure out something to do.

986
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,709
- Here, put this down there.
- You're awfully quiet tonight, Kevin.

987
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,873
I'm fine, Mrs. Pazienza.

988
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,558
It's your turn.
Yup.

989
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,877
Isn't Vinny doing great?

990
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,238
He's doing great.

991
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,148
What's this?

992
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,160
Kev, you think drinking is
such a good idea right now?

993
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,389
You're gonna
lecture me on moderation?

994
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,911
The balls on this kid.

995
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,672
Yeah. Since forever.

996
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,511
All right, you know, Kevin,
you're welcome to stay here on the couch.

997
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,776
You know, maybe you
shouldn't be driving.

998
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,835
No, I'm fine.

999
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,229
Ma, he can't drive.
He lost his license.

1000
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,509
Vinny.

1001
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,235
Louise?

1002
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,496
There we go.
Okay, I got my card.

1003
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,776
All right, Kevin, your turn.
Come on.

1004
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,869
Kevin, you're up.

1005
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,075
Come on.
I'm done.

1006
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,792
What do you mean?
No, no, no, no...

1007
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,231
Kev, what are you doing?

1008
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,474
Go upstairs.

1009
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,073
I'd love to.

1010
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,154
I don't think I can
make it up the stairs.

1011
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,913
Where's the bench press?

1012
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,432
I threw it in the garbage.

1013
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,752
Why would you do that?

1014
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,794
Leave it.

1015
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,238
You're a big dummy,
you know that?

1016
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,832
Bench pressing.

1017
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,794
How is that a good idea?
You should be doing shoulder work.

1018
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,070
At least that will
help with your injury.

1019
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:24,034
This way, you're gonna just look like
some I-Tal on Venice Beach.

1020
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,319
You put me in a hell of a spot,
you know that?

1021
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,276
Had to decide if it'd be worse to watch
you kill yourself or help you do it.

1022
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,550
That's, like, the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

1023
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,997
Sit down, asshole.

1024
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,636
There you go.

1025
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,040
There you go.
Straighten up the back.

1026
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,311
You get cable with that thing?
Yeah.

1027
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,878
Is this making
too much noise?

1028
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,672
Nah. We're good.

1029
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,829
Come on.

1030
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,755
Vinny?
Vinny, I got to get the Christmas box.

1031
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,149
Kev, get that box
right there. Yeah, Ma!

1032
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,595
Kev's bringing
it up to you.

1033
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,896
There you go, Mrs. Pazienza.
All right.

1034
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,275
Yeah, he's got it.
All right. Thank you.

1035
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,958
What are you two
doing down there?

1036
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,998
We're just going through
some of Vinny's old tapes.

1037
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,114
Ten more.

1038
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,800
Come on.

1039
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,190
Come on, you're not
even counting. Five.

1040
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,353
There. How do you feel?

1041
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,589
Good? All right.

1042
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,198
Hey, what happened to you?

1043
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,113
Oh, yeah, yeah, I slipped coming
out of the bathroom yesterday.

1044
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,080
Peppers.

1045
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,400
- Peppers are good.
- All right, darling.

1046
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,273
One day you're fighting
and calling each other names,

1047
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,976
now you're giggling
like a bunch of school girls.

1048
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,831
What the hell's
the matter with you two?

1049
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,200
I don't know.
I don't know, Pops.

1050
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,456
Just having
a good day, I guess.

1051
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,471
Yeah?
Well, knock it off.

1052
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,149
So, you don't mind the
construction site on his face?

1053
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,633
Construction
doesn't last forever.

1054
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,277
You know,
I'm actually kind of into it.

1055
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,032
It's like braces times 1,000.

1056
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,190
I think this
might be the one, Vin.

1057
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,034
That's it.
I told you.

1058
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,628
Come on, do it again.
Baby, come on.

1059
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,159
Oh, my God.

1060
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,598
Hey...

1061
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,272
Get out of my house.

1062
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,838
You've been training under
my roof without telling me.

1063
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,560
Pop, listen...
Right under my fucking nose.

1064
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,830
You been doing
this the whole time?

1065
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,988
Yeah.

1066
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,560
It's been the only thing that's kept
me alive these last few months.

1067
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,388
You lied to me, Vinny.

1068
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,948
I lied to you?
Where were you tonight?

1069
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,996
The fuck did you
just say to me?

1070
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,878
I'm sorry, Pop.
I didn't want you to worry.

1071
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,696
Vinny.
What are you doing?

1072
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,153
We gotta get
the show on the road.

1073
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,117
Yeah, I know.
I told her I'm good.

1074
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,277
You have to be given a sedative
for me to remove the screws.

1075
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,556
Nah. Let's just do it.

1076
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,950
Vinny. I can't do this without
giving you an anesthetic.

1077
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,856
Listen to me, Doc...
It would be excruciatingly painful.

1078
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,456
Okay, listen to me, Doc. I've never
done drugs in my life, all right?

1079
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,358
I've never taken a hit, not a bump,
not a drag on a joint.

1080
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,749
Nothing. So, I'm not
gonna start now.

1081
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,871
Just take 'em out.

1082
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,319
You ready?

1083
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,435
Yeah. Let's do it.

1084
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,318
Holy shit, Doc.
You're going the wrong way!

1085
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,112
I'm not, Vinny.

1086
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,475
Listen...
Are you sure?

1087
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,318
It feels like you're
screwing it deeper!

1088
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,320
What do you say we
give you a sedative?

1089
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,630
No, I'm good.
Come on. I'm good.

1090
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,955
Shit, Doc! It's leftie-loosey!
Do you know what you're doing?

1091
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,832
Yes. I know. Thank you.

1092
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,918
It's the calcification around
the threads breaking free.

1093
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,309
It's like a rusty
bolt with Loctite on it.

1094
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,149
Okay.

1095
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,792
All right. Let's go.

1096
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,120
Ah, fuck.

1097
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,838
Okay. Breathe.

1098
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,600
Oof!

1099
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,028
Okay, there we go.
There we go. All right. Okay.

1100
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,359
Piece of cake.

1101
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
Whoo.

1102
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,039
Okay. Got it.

1103
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,920
There you go.

1104
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,554
Come on.

1105
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,714
Hey.

1106
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,512
I think I'm gonna be all right.
Yeah?

1107
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,953
Yeah.

1108
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,752
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1109
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,736
- Thank you so much for helping out.
- You're welcome.

1110
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,716
- Hey.
- I so appreciate it.

1111
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,392
Thanks, Doc.
Thank you. Yeah.

1112
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,277
Thank you, Doc.
Let's go.

1113
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,599
Fuck me.

1114
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,799
Good. Good.

1115
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,839
How's that weight?

1116
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,188
All right?

1117
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,976
Sorry, Vinny,
it's impossible.

1118
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,070
I can't get anyone
to issue a fight.

1119
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,879
Listen to me, Lou. I've been busting
my ass over here, all right?

1120
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,320
Only one thing
got me through that.

1121
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,589
Come on.

1122
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,033
I don't care
who it's with,

1123
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,792
where it happens,
how much money it's for.

1124
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,154
None of that.

1125
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,750
I made the calls, Vinny.
No one will fight you.

1126
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,673
No one wants to be the one to
send you back to the hospital.

1127
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,536
I don't want to be
the one to say it...

1128
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,879
Then don't.

1129
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,513
Because I worked
too hard to hear it.

1130
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,153
Vinny...

1131
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,830
...tonight, any shot of
catching the Yankees,

1132
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,354
the Red Sox play three in
Detroit starting tonight.

1133
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,398
And let's face it, at six back,
they need a minor miracle,

1134
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,239
probably a major miracle
to win this wildcard race.

1135
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,536
All right. Thanks, Jo.

1136
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,552
The dream lives on, Vinny Paz
anxiously awaiting the chance

1137
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,875
to once again
pursue his boxing dream.

1138
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,589
In the meantime, the Pazman is doing
all he can to keep his body in shape

1139
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,680
as we discovered today.

1140
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,256
There was always something ironic

1141
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,998
about seeing
the Pazmanian Devil

1142
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,080
wearing a halo.

1143
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,953
But the irony is gone,
replaced by iron.

1144
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,429
Vinny Pazienza is
pumping iron again...

1145
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,599
Hey.
Hey.

1146
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,640
What did you do?

1147
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,910
Hey. I didn't know
it was gonna get this crazy.

1148
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,031
Come on.
We'll make it work. Let's go.

1149
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,720
Whoa.

1150
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,958
Hey, everybody,
how are we doing?

1151
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,508
Vinny,
how you feeling? Hey, Vinny.

1152
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,238
Good to see you guys.

1153
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,670
Getting that right there?
All right, Vinny. Come on.

1154
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,936
Okay, thank you, guys.
Go get changed.

1155
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,096
Really, really appreciate it.

1156
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,560
Give them a little show.
Okay.

1157
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,477
All right.
The champ is here.

1158
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,256
Hey, Vinny,
how you feeling?

1159
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,960
How am I feeling? I'm feeling like
a two-time world champion, Nicky.

1160
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,234
I feel like
I'm moving faster, hitting stronger.

1161
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,916
Looking good.
When's the next fight?

1162
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,434
Uh, I don't know, but it's going to be...
It's gonna be huge.

1163
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,976
All right. What's your
weight class gonna be?

1164
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,116
Uh, super heavyweight.

1165
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,936
I don't know. It's a good question.
Kev keeps fattening me up.

1166
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,296
Can we get some
footage of you in the ring?

1167
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,912
It'd be great for this piece.
Yeah.

1168
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,558
No.
Hey, love to, guys,

1169
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,359
but we didn't set up a sparring
partner for today's work, all right?

1170
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,908
Kev, you guys wanna see me spar?
Yeah!

1171
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,235
You guys wanna
see me spar? Come on.

1172
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,470
Kev, seriously,
find somebody. I'm fine.

1173
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,272
And they said I'd never walk again,
said I'd never box again.

1174
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,271
Hey, Dino.
Go a couple of rounds?

1175
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,353
What do you mean "no"?

1176
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,628
Here I am, six months later.
Had screws in my head. I got these scars.

1177
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,278
Chicks dig scars though,
right, Cindy?

1178
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,275
Jose.

1179
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,909
Hey, time flies.
Jose, let's go. Get in the ring.

1180
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,996
Coming at his head.
Come on. Come on.

1181
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,638
Kev, how we doing?

1182
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,957
I don't know, Vinny.

1183
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,355
Yeah.
What?

1184
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,233
What, nobody wants to
spar with me?

1185
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,958
Let's do it another day...
No. Come on.

1186
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,080
Hey, Tommy. Come here.

1187
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,039
Tommy, I need you
to spar with me.

1188
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,832
Nah. I can't.
Why?

1189
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,519
I just can't.

1190
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,189
Come on.

1191
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,079
Tommy.

1192
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,071
What, nobody wants to
spar with me?

1193
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,915
Hey. I'll spar with you.

1194
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,395
Yeah? Good.
You're doing a good thing. Yeah.

1195
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,433
- How tall are you?
- Like, six foot.

1196
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,391
Oh, my God,
you are huge.

1197
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,069
Come on.

1198
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,750
Wait. What are you doing,
man? Let's go.

1199
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Come on.

1200
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,836
Come on.
What are you doing? Hit me!

1201
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,148
I... I can't hit you, man.

1202
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,560
Come on,
we're not dancing, bitch!

1203
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,992
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

1204
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,240
Shit.

1205
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,712
Are you okay?

1206
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,751
Yeah, I'm good.
Thank you.

1207
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,996
Okay.
All right, champ. Way to go.

1208
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:22,196
If all goes well at the
doctor's office on the 14th,

1209
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:25,113
it won't be long until Vinny's
back here in the ring

1210
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,835
bobbing and weaving and sparring
his way to fighting form.

1211
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,714
As one of the most courageous comebacks
in boxing history continues.

1212
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,110
The familiar desire and
determination are still there.

1213
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,117
The halo that's got
a whole new appreciation...

1214
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,753
I can sell this.

1215
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,640
Come on.

1216
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,273
This is too soon.

1217
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,556
Is this Ma?
No.

1218
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,039
I mean, yeah,
we talked about it,

1219
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,078
but how many times you think
we had that conversation?

1220
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,635
No, this is different.
This is me.

1221
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,311
You don't think I'm ready?

1222
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,350
I think you're
in great shape.

1223
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,038
Then what is it?

1224
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,838
This whole thing.

1225
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,959
The accident.

1226
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,193
It woke me up.

1227
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,838
I got a taste of
what it'd be like if...

1228
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,599
Yeah, Pop.
That's what it did for me.

1229
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,159
I got a taste.

1230
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,114
When I was lying
on the cot,

1231
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,439
that's all I was
thinking about, was,

1232
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,239
"What am I gonna
do after this?"

1233
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,033
Am I gonna train
kids at the gym?

1234
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,230
You know,
bartend at night?

1235
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,829
Talk about how I used to be a fighter,
used to be world champ?

1236
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,031
No, this is what I do.

1237
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,189
And I don't know
how not to do it.

1238
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,309
Okay.

1239
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,516
Look, I know you think I've been
doing a bang-up job all these years,

1240
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,909
but that ain't exactly true.

1241
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,793
I let you put yourself
in harm's way.

1242
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,552
I... I pushed you to it.

1243
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,954
No, you didn't.
No, I did.

1244
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,952
No, you didn't do it.
I did! All right?

1245
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:22,079
And I know it's a little late
to be making a change,

1246
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,792
but...
What change?

1247
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,395
I can't be in your
corner for this one.

1248
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,231
Or any of them.

1249
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,676
I can't be part of you
getting hurt no more.

1250
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,188
Why are you
doing this right now?

1251
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,794
I should have done
it a long time ago.

1252
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,920
All right.

1253
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,790
Vinny! You got a second?

1254
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,399
Yeah. What's up, Lou?

1255
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,792
I got a hell of
an offer for you.

1256
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,416
Look, I told you I don't need a hell
of an offer, I just need a fight.

1257
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,998
Under-promise, over-deliver.

1258
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,235
Here comes the good news.

1259
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,696
Okay, first off,
we've been trying

1260
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,056
to get you
a fight this whole time.

1261
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,216
Obviously the recent
press coverage...

1262
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,240
Save it, Dan.

1263
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,632
What are you bringing us, Lou?
Roberto Duran.

1264
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,395
IBC World Super
Middleweight Title.

1265
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,756
1.6 million dollars.

1266
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,589
Biggest payday
of your career.

1267
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,598
So, we're good?

1268
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,313
I mean, it's up to...
You know, up to Kev.

1269
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,597
1.6 million...

1270
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,354
Let's get it on.

1271
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,509
Yeah, let's get it on!

1272
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,195
- All right. Let's get a fight.
- Come on.

1273
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,469
Come on.

1274
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,960
Come on...

1275
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,056
Vinny was the man,

1276
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,435
the junior middleweight
champion of the world.

1277
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:20,672
When a brutal car accident left him
inches away from complete paralysis,

1278
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,030
doctors said he'd
never box again.

1279
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,176
And the doctors told him,

1280
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,776
"You'll never even walk again,
let alone fight."

1281
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,631
He said "No, Doc,
I'm gonna fight!"

1282
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,016
Doctor says,
"You're crazy, you can't even walk."

1283
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:33,032
It's a fascinating story.
Vinny Pazienza.

1284
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,559
Say hello to him.

1285
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,716
Pazienza, Pazienza!

1286
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,154
Oh, my God!
Look at him.

1287
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,154
Oh, he looks so handsome.

1288
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,231
You broke your neck,
obviously.

1289
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,496
I see you wearing
that brace there.

1290
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,000
Then what?
The doctors told you, what,

1291
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,040
you'd never even walk again,
let alone fight again?

1292
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:57,436
Never fight again, but now
I'm about to fight Roberto Duran.

1293
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,676
June 25th at
the MGM on pay-per-view.

1294
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,536
We're a little
bit more than 48 hours away

1295
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,473
from the showdown in Las Vegas between
Vinny Pazienza and Roberto Duran.

1296
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:08,677
Duran's record, 93-9,
64 knockouts.

1297
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,197
It's scheduled for 12 rounds,
and it should be one heck of a fight.

1298
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,358
Twelve rounds of boxing

1299
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:12,797
for the IBC Super
Middleweight Title!

1300
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,197
Tonight's main
event is sanctioned

1301
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,236
by the Nevada
Athletic Commission

1302
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:20,630
and the honorable
Governor Bob Miller.

1303
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,680
First,
introducing the principals.

1304
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,475
Boxing out of the blue corner,
wearing the red trunks,

1305
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,354
weighing in at
an even 165 pounds.

1306
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,355
From Cranston, Rhode Island,

1307
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,712
this man is a former two-time
world champion!

1308
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,839
The Pazmanian Devil!

1309
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,111
Vinny Pazienza!

1310
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,837
And his opponent,
boxing out of the red corner.

1311
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,679
This man needs
no introduction.

1312
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,637
Wearing the black trunks
with a solid gold trim,

1313
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:06,159
he weighed in at a fit and
fighting-ready 165 and a half pounds.

1314
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,873
93 wins with 64
coming by knockout.

1315
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,353
He's a four-time
world champion.

1316
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:20,073
El hijo de la
República de Panamá.

1317
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,594
From Panama City, Panamá,
Manos de Piedras,

1318
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,477
the Hands of Stone,

1319
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:34,678
Roberto Duran!

1320
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,429
These are dramatic
moments for Vinny Pazienza.

1321
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,755
He has made it back
from a broken neck.

1322
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,758
Doctors telling him
he might never walk again.

1323
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,757
He wore the halo
for six months.

1324
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,395
The metal brace screwed into
his skull in four spots.

1325
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,195
That he's standing in this ring
is a minor miracle in itself!

1326
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,816
That and the fact that
he's jumped three weight classes

1327
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,239
from where he won
his first title.

1328
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,032
That makes this
a long shot at best.

1329
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,376
All right, gentlemen, you know the rules.
I'm addressing them.

1330
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,118
I want a good, clean fight.

1331
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,357
Obey my commands at all times
and protect yourselves.

1332
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,237
Now, tap gloves,
and come out fighting.

1333
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,280
And what is
on everyone's mind is,

1334
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,391
"Will the neck of
Pazienza hold up

1335
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,636
"at a 12-round
championship fight?"

1336
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,512
He's only
sparred up until now.

1337
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,956
And these are,
after all, the Hands of Stone

1338
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,991
coming at him tonight.

1339
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,393
Angelo Pazienza is
not in Vinny's corner tonight

1340
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,552
for the first time in
his son's boxing career.

1341
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,115
Come on.

1342
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,117
And down goes Pazienza!

1343
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,838
He took a huge shot
on that damaged neck!

1344
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,152
Duran putting Pazienza
on the canvas in round one!

1345
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,635
Four,

1346
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,469
five, six...

1347
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,797
Pazienza refuses
to take the entire count.

1348
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,440
Not wise but
certainly consistent.

1349
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,798
How are you
feeling? Huh?

1350
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,108
You gave him a free shot.

1351
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,474
How's the neck?

1352
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,629
I'm good.

1353
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:02,776
Every time he's
looking at that left hook,

1354
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,552
you're under,
back with a left one, okay?

1355
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:07,433
Move! You're bigger, you're stronger,
you're faster, all right?

1356
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,272
The guy can't even move!

1357
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,920
Everything off the jab.
Everything off the jab, all right?

1358
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,917
Put your punches together.
Let's go! Okay.

1359
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,708
All right.

1360
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,034
Go kill him.

1361
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,336
You can see it already.

1362
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,558
Pazienza's moving well, but Duran's
catching Vinny on the way in.

1363
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,033
He can't even get close.

1364
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:28,520
Combination by Duran!

1365
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,035
Move your head, Vinny!
Move your head!

1366
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,193
Oh, God.

1367
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,951
Vinny, what are you doing?
Keep your hands up!

1368
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,195
Give me defense!

1369
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,836
Good combination by Pazienza!

1370
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,876
Right hand from Duran!

1371
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,955
Duran with the big right hand!

1372
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,320
Come on, Vinny! Why are you
going toe-to-toe with him?

1373
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,790
And it's all Duran
here in the early going.

1374
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,237
Don't slug
with this guy.

1375
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,751
You're a better boxer.
Everything off the jab.

1376
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,998
On to round four.

1377
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,799
It's been all Roberto Duran.
Good right hand there by Pazienza.

1378
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,911
There you go!
Follow it up! Follow it up!

1379
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,913
Keep moving!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1380
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,114
Pazienza's shaken by
the right hand delivered by Duran.

1381
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,474
Use the ring!
Use the ring, damn it!

1382
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,749
What's he doing?

1383
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,755
I can't watch this.

1384
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,319
Come on! Jab!

1385
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,917
Roberto Duran
taking this fight over.

1386
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,274
Watch out for the hook!
Watch out for the hook!

1387
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,560
Every single time,
he's looking

1388
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,993
for that left hook,
I told you.

1389
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,957
I want you to move
away from it, all right?

1390
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:34,193
...as Pazienza tries to
get his rhythm going in this fight.

1391
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,195
Call it.

1392
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,831
Call the fight,
for Christ's sake.

1393
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,755
Not yet.

1394
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,115
Come on!
He's dyin' out there!

1395
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,675
Go sit down.

1396
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,390
Relax, relax,
relax, relax. Huh?

1397
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,239
Take a breath.

1398
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,033
What'd my dad say?

1399
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,040
It don't matter what
he said, all right? I can't...

1400
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,632
Hey, Vin, listen to me. Hey!

1401
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,016
If he didn't think you could
win this fight without him,

1402
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,871
he'd be here
in the corner, okay?

1403
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:23,353
Vinny, we started
this in a basement.

1404
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,595
In a fucking basement!

1405
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,200
Now, go out there
and show me how you do things.

1406
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,551
Show me how you live.

1407
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,518
Show me how you fight.

1408
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,080
Want me to show you
how I fight?

1409
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,789
Yeah.

1410
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,639
Show me who
the fuck you are.

1411
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,558
Again, Pazienza
backed into the corner.

1412
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:08,078
Duran misses!

1413
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,913
Big overhand
right from Pazienza!

1414
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,072
There you go, there you go!

1415
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,070
Move! Move!
Move! You got him, Vinny!

1416
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,631
There you go! Get him! Come on!
Get him! Get him!

1417
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,194
Through the body, Vinny.

1418
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,793
Give him a 5-6, 5-6!

1419
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,776
Pazienza turning
things around... There you go.

1420
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,800
...in the 7th round.

1421
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,832
5-5-1, Vinny.
5-5-1! Go big!

1422
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,718
Come on, kid.
Listen to me.

1423
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,911
That's how you fight. Huh?

1424
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,672
That's how you box!

1425
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,277
You're a fucking
animal, Vinny!

1426
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,954
What a round
for Vinny Pazienza!

1427
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,477
And now, this is
the Pazienza we've seen before!

1428
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,520
The brawling, powerful Pazienza!

1429
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:00,030
Pazienza laying
through the pit of Duran.

1430
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,313
You hear them? Yeah!
Yeah.

1431
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,108
You got him! Go!

1432
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:09,315
Pazienza with a wicked
shot to the side of Duran's head!

1433
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:13,272
These are huge moments
for Vinny Pazienza!

1434
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,430
Lovely combinations!

1435
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,959
Do the jab,
nice, Vinny!

1436
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,176
Pull it together!
Pull it together!

1437
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,919
Left hand
planted by Pazienza!

1438
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,310
Another left by Pazienza.
And a win by Pazienza!

1439
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,435
...I don't think any of us
thought we were going to be here now.

1440
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,876
A wild 11th round with Pazienza
making what looks like

1441
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,155
an improbable
comeback in this fight.

1442
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,993
It is a
street fight at this point.

1443
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,832
Pazienza
does not look good.

1444
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,871
He is bleeding
from everywhere.

1445
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,995
If Vinny Pazienza came in with
one plan, he's got another now.

1446
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,309
Last round. All in, Vinny!

1447
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,231
All fucking in, you hear me?

1448
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,155
Now finish it!

1449
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,196
That's what you do best.
You finish, all right?

1450
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:04,037
Three minutes,
you're champion of the world.

1451
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,191
Three minutes.
Three minutes.

1452
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,075
Let's go.

1453
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,949
And here we go
with the final round.

1454
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,718
Round 12!

1455
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,511
Come on, Vinny!
You got this guy! Come on...

1456
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,896
Beautiful combination
by Pazienza. Come on!

1457
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,056
Move your feet, Vinny!
Move your feet! There you go!

1458
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,197
Pazienza's stumbling
following a right hand by Duran!

1459
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,216
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny...

1460
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,798
Come on!

1461
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:55,397
This crowd
that was booing Vinny Pazienza

1462
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,637
from moments early in
the fight, on its feet!

1463
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,074
Come on, this is it!
This is it!

1464
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,109
Come on!

1465
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,398
I cannot believe
they're both still standing!

1466
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,433
Come on, Vinny!

1467
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,153
And it's all over!

1468
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,791
Goes the distance.

1469
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,517
And it's in
the hands of the judges.

1470
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,392
Ladies and gentlemen,

1471
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:55,758
after 12 action-packed
championship rounds of boxing,

1472
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,799
I give you the scoring
by the judges as follows.

1473
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:06,078
Judge Chuck Giampa
scores the bout 114-114.

1474
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:12,952
Judge Dave Moretti and Judge Jerry
Roth both score the bout 115-113

1475
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,393
for the winner,

1476
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:19,913
and IBC Super Middleweight
Champion of the World,

1477
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,791
Vinny, the Pazmanian Devil!

1478
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:33,675
Oh, my God!

1479
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:53,240
People are calling this one of the most
unlikely comebacks in sports history.

1480
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:55,231
What do you
attribute it to?

1481
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,320
Um...

1482
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:58,796
Yeah, I don't know.
I had a lot of help.

1483
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,756
But you've also had
a lot of adversity.

1484
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:06,470
You've had issues with management,
conflicts of interest...

1485
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,233
Yeah, well, the boxing world
looks shiny from the outside.

1486
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,076
It's filled with
promises that...

1487
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,156
Most of them
turn out to be lies.

1488
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,071
You can't rely on anyone.

1489
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:26,197
So, what would you say
the biggest deception was?

1490
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,151
What was the biggest lie
you were told?

1491
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,316
It's not that simple.

1492
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,438
Why not?

1493
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,193
No, that's the biggest
lie I was ever told.

1494
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:42,111
"It's not that simple."

1495
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:46,152
And it's a lie they tell you
over and over again.

1496
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,832
What's not simple?

1497
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:51,793
Any of it.

1498
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,159
All of it.

1499
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:58,073
It's how they
get you to give up.

1500
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:01,118
They say, "It's not
that simple, Vinny."

1501
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,191
So, what's the truth?

1502
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,833
That it is.

1503
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,915
That if you just do the thing
that they tell you, you can't,

1504
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,513
then it's done.

1505
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:20,029
And you realize
it is that simple.

1506
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,436
And that it always was.

1507
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,470
I feel like I should be
on a box of Wheaties tomorrow,

1508
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,791
doing Gatorade commercials,
going to Disneyland.

1509
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,035
I'm just so happy!

1510
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:32,709
'Cause no one in the history
of sports, to my knowledge,

1511
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,870
has ever come back
from this type of injury.

1512
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,039
I didn't want him to box. I wanted
him to be... Anything but boxing.

1513
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:40,519
He's a fighter.

1514
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:43,114
And a fighter,
you don't make fighters.

1515
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,077
Vinny's a born fighter.

1516
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,594
Lou Duva's
looking at suspension.

1517
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:51,833
That's not professional.

1518
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:01,714
And Dr. Cotter had a tear in his eye.
I could tell he felt for me.

1519
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,793
And he said, "Son, I'm sorry to
say you're not gonna box again."

1520
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:10,792
And I looked at him,
and I said, "No, Dr. Cotter. You're wrong.

1521
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,717
"I am gonna box again."

1522
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,598
I said, "You don't understand
what kind of man I am."

1523
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:35,638
This halo portion goes
around the person's head,

1524
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:40,071
and is placed
much like this.

1525
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,990
It's held in place
by these rather

1526
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,516
medieval devices
called screws...

1527
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,136
This fight was for
the people of Rhode Island,

1528
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,976
and it was for the believers
that believed in me.

1529
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,673
I think you all came out.
For the believers, I want to thank you.

1530
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,394
And I proved something to you.
I wanted to make you people proud.

1531
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,829
And for the non-believers,
I just want to tell you,

1532
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:11,198
it's time to realize that the Pazmanian
Devil is no fictitious character.

1532
01:53:12,305 --> 01:54:12,531

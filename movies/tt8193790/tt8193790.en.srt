2
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:23,942
The film you are about to see
was born under a good star.

3
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:06,628
I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life.

4
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:14,024
I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life.

5
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,240
I promise to never again wear a jacket...

6
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,217
- You know.
- For the rest of my life.

7
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,476
Now close the trunk.

8
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:41,878
<i>And if you didn't exist</i>

9
00:01:41,998 --> 00:01:45,431
<i>Tell me why I should exist</i>

10
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,036
<i>To hang around in a world without you</i>

11
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:55,914
<i>Without hope and without regrets</i>

12
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,630
<i>And if you didn't exist</i>

13
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,950
<i>I'd try to invent love</i>

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,471
<i>As a painter who sees by his hand</i>

15
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,837
<i>The birth of daylight colors</i>

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,400
DEERSKIN

17
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:19,657
<i>And can't get over it<i>

18
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:25,784
<i>And if you didn't exist</i>

19
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:29,858
<i>Tell me who I'd exist for</i>

20
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:35,776
<i>Passers-by asleep in my arms</i>

21
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:39,214
<i>Who I could never love</i>

22
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:27,380
Yes, what?

23
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,923
I called yesterday about the ad.

24
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,837
- Ah, George?
- That's right.

25
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:44,875
- It's very hot, be careful.
- Thank you.

26
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,716
- Do you take sugar?
- No. Thank you.

27
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,512
I suppose you'd like to
see it right away?

28
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:54,461
If you don't mind.
I'm super excited.

29
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,033
I understand.

30
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,201
Don't move.

31
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:13,461
No...

32
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:21,449
Ah, here we are! I have it!

33
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,317
Here's the beast.

34
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,838
100% deerskin.

35
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:36,679
Holy fuck.

36
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,948
And...

37
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,653
Not a single fringe is missing!

38
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,144
May I see the other side?

39
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,643
Fuck.

40
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,044
I wore it for about a year.

41
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:58,197
Then the fashion changed,
so I put it away.

42
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,329
One of a kind, you know!

43
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,742
It even had a label.

44
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,604
<i>Made in Italy</i>

45
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,069
I took it out because it was scratchy.

46
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,894
6300...

47
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,117
6500...

48
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,210
6700...

49
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,303
6900...

50
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:24,487
7100...

51
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,472
7300...

52
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,316
7500...

53
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:33,162
Fucking hell, I've never seen
so much dough my whole life.

54
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:35,285
I'm short 200.
It's all I could withdraw.

55
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:36,872
That's OK.

56
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,189
You know what?

57
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,592
I'll even toss in something extra.

58
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:47,719
Not only have you just acquired

59
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,406
the jacket of your dreams,

60
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,269
but as a bonus,

61
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:56,469
you get this digital camcorder.

62
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:59,147
Almost new.
Tested recently...

63
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:01,945
It works like factory new.

64
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:05,030
- Digital?
- Digital is top of the line!

65
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:08,496
Yeah.

66
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:14,156
Look at you.
What a look!

67
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,389
So, how many nights? Six, seven?

68
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,491
- One month.
- One month?

69
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:30,898
Yes, at least.

70
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,922
What? You'll be here a month?

71
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,558
Yes, I want to be alone.

72
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,751
You'll be alone.

73
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,424
So... I'll give you Room 15.

74
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,148
It's a fox paw.

75
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:49,572
How would you like to pay?

76
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:53,354
Uh... yes then, for that,
I have a small issue

77
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,999
with my bank card.

78
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,674
But that should be settled
by tomorrow, usually.

79
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,393
Therefore...

80
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,324
- How do we do this?
- You can't stay here free, sir.

81
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,271
I know, but can it wait
until tomorrow, I mean?

82
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,486
If you leave me
a valuable object,

83
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,548
then yes, you can pay
whenever you want.

84
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,740
Otherwise, I can't help.

85
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,773
I have this.

86
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,905
It's gold.

87
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,974
- Not good enough?
- Yes, this will be fine. Thank you.

88
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:32,398
- The room's on the second floor.
- Yes, thank you.

89
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:15,003
Killer.

90
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:24,588
Sick style.

91
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,130
Yes, it's me.

92
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:34,961
Why are you calling me?
What's the point?

93
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,470
To say that I'm far away...

94
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,169
That I'm gone... This is it.
Don't you want to know where I am?

95
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:45,288
No.

96
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,465
You're nowhere, George.

97
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:49,355
You no longer exist.

98
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,453
Here you go.

99
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,361
- Whisky.
- Thank you.

100
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:26,346
To your health.

101
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:28,674
Cheers.

102
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
Yes, he said that.

103
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,279
But...

104
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,808
- He'd done it before, last year?
- Yes.

105
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,455
I heard from Martine.

106
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:46,550
- Martine?
- Yeah.

107
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:54,383
I wanted to tell you but...

108
00:14:54,503 --> 00:15:01,033
I didn't know if you'd want to know or...

109
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:05,608
You're talking about my jacket?

110
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,317
You're talking about my jacket, right?

111
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,435
Uh no. No no.

112
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,036
OK. Sorry.

113
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,613
Why would we be?

114
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,955
It's just that people
often bring it up to me.

115
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,975
Sometimes...
People stop me on the street.

116
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,817
I'm used to it.
It attracts attention. Sorry.

117
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:29,095
Ah really?

118
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,382
They stop you
then say what?

119
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,832
Well... You can see
it's no ordinary garment.

120
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,604
Not from around here, are you?

121
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:42,723
I just got here.

122
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,475
He may not appreciate
our informality.

123
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,925
That's alright.
It's cool.

124
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,537
So what do you you do in life,
besides showing off your deerskin?

125
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,028
May we ask?

126
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:56,918
Right now I'm... I'm at the bar.

127
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,821
Drinking a drink.
I, uh...

128
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:02,709
I mean, as a profession,
what do you do?

129
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,359
I...

130
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:14,880
- You don't want to say?
- Yes, of course.

131
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,140
I am a filmmaker.

132
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:19,691
Ah!

133
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,327
And, you're shooting here?

134
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:26,718
Yes, possibly.
Yeah, that's downright possible.

135
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,074
It's cool.

136
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,320
Hey, Spielberg!
Can I drop you somewhere?

137
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,749
No, that's nice.
I like to walk.

138
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:53,036
If you're looking for sluts
for your pornos, I'm totally available.

139
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,250
I made a few movies, 20 years ago.

140
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm still good, eh?

141
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,399
But I don't make pornos!

142
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,482
What made you think that?

143
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:04,353
You don't seem the real cinema type.

144
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:07,591
Of course I'm in real cinema.

145
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,525
Did you take a good look?

146
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,437
Didn't notice my sick style?

147
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,258
- Alright, OK.
- Yeah?

148
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,960
- Now you understand?
- Let's drop it. Poor fool!

149
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,911
- Go away!
- OK, bye.

150
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,422
"Not the real cinema type."

151
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,301
Hey you.

152
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,632
Where are you from?

153
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,406
I'm from...
I'm from Italy.

154
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,630
I'm from Italy, I...

155
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,675
I'm from Italy.

156
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,292
I'm from Italy.

157
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:25,005
That's good.

158
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:27,617
Italy.

159
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,991
You're super classy, eh?

160
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,756
You look great on camera.

161
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,473
And you who are you?

162
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:48,229
I'm your new owner.

163
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,549
I think we'll make a good team.

164
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,192
Do you want to team up?

165
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,471
But I'll be in charge.

166
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,593
OK.

167
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,228
Good night.

168
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,400
What's all the noise? Was that you?

169
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,993
Well no. No no.

170
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,800
Nothing better to do,
than to stare at me?

171
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:40,993
Get lost.

172
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,597
What are you doing in the area?

173
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,236
I left home. Uh...

174
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:50,201
Rather early.
I drove in my car and...

175
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,876
and then I got here.

176
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,151
OK.

177
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:01,302
You withdrew
7550 euros yesterday?

178
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:04,949
Yes. Yes, yesterday.
And I need more.

179
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,159
The account was blocked this morning.
I won't be able to do much.

180
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,967
Blocked, what? By you?

181
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:16,311
No, by the person you
share this account with.

182
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,977
Ah yes.

183
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:22,749
Since when can women
block their husband's account?

184
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:25,077
Well, she <i>is</i> your wife.

185
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,800
Yes, but, I need 500.

186
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,711
I need 500 this week.

187
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:34,242
At least give me 500,
it isn't a ridiculous request.

188
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:36,396
The account is blocked, I'm sorry.

189
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,080
Shit!

190
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:07,719
Don't worry.

191
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,990
I'll find some money.

192
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,126
I'll manage.

193
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:48,852
- On the house.
- Thanks.

194
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:52,716
Your girlfriend followed me last night.

195
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:53,949
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

196
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:58,690
I think she wanted to
wind up the evening with me.

197
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:00,636
She does that with all the customers.

198
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,030
It's her job.

199
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,158
Yeah?
What is this job?

200
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:06,478
Follower?

201
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,357
Are you kidding me?

202
00:24:11,464 --> 00:24:12,464
No.

203
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:13,798
Well, a hooker.

204
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,079
Ah yes.

205
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,366
She's not really a girlfriend.
She hangs around here, that's all.

206
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:19,684
But I like her well enough.

207
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,056
So tell me, then.

208
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,700
Your shoot, what is it?

209
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,055
It's not easy to explain, actually.

210
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,552
You're here with a crew?
Sorry, I'm being familiar...

211
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,118
That's alright.

212
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,916
No, I'm alone. I'm alone...

213
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:44,617
I'm all alone
for the filming part.

214
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:48,709
But let's say there's a crew
doing other things.

215
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:51,303
- OK.
- Yeah. A fairly big team.

216
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:52,993
- Cool.
- Cool, yeah.

217
00:24:53,113 --> 00:24:54,481
I know a bit about it.

218
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,438
- Yeah?
- Yeah because I do editing.

219
00:24:57,743 --> 00:25:01,433
I'm waitressing because
I have nothing else to do in town.

220
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,596
But my passion is editing.

221
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:06,780
Editing, yeah.

222
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,358
I enjoy editing
movies that already exist.

223
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:11,954
I can change the story.
It's cool.

224
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,371
I once put <i>Pulp Fiction</i> back in order.

225
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:17,680
- You know, <i>Pulp Fiction</i>...
- Yes.

226
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,065
Yes. The concept of the film is
that it's all out of order.

227
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,309
That's what was interesting.

228
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,841
So, just to see,
I put it back in order.

229
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,236
In the end, it plain sucked.

230
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,436
It wasn't any good.

231
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,756
How do you put a film in order?

232
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,745
Do you have a special machine?

233
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:43,876
No... I have a computer.

234
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:46,644
Like anyone else.

235
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,811
And the special machine,
that's my brain.

236
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,365
- OK, yeah.
- But, you know...

237
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,158
This is all a hobby.

238
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:57,189
I'd love to do it as a real job.

239
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:01,735
That's for sure. These are great jobs.

240
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:03,432
- Yeah.
- That's for sure, yeah.

241
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:06,639
I don't realize it anymore
because I'm in it...

242
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:10,069
- When I think I get paid for this...
- Yeah.

243
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:12,196
It really is crazy.

244
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:21,069
Why did you bullshit
that stupid waitress?

245
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,711
Some kind of pick up technique?

246
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,359
Going to try to bang her?

247
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,589
But no!

248
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:34,309
She bought me a drink.
I had to be nice.

249
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,911
And it wasn't bullshit.
You see me use a camera.

250
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,718
Using a camera is like
making a movie.

251
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,559
I'm not so sure.

252
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,740
It is!

253
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,599
Denise the waitress editor

254
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
George.

255
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:39,749
George.

256
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:43,652
George.

257
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:47,799
I'm reading. What is it?

258
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,755
Want to hear my cherished dream?

259
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:01,673
We can talk later.
I'm really into this book.

260
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,157
I want to talk about it now.

261
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:08,319
It's important.

262
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:10,344
Close that book.

263
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,282
I'm listening.

264
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,599
Want to hear my cherished dream, George?

265
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:23,673
Yes, tell me.

266
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:26,751
My cherished dream, George...

267
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,393
Is to be...
The only jacket in the world.

268
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:37,629
The only one?

269
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:39,575
Yes.

270
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:42,278
The only jacket in the world.

271
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,620
I want us to be able to
walk in the streets

272
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,590
without coming across any other jackets.

273
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:54,717
That's nice because...

274
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:58,754
My cherished dream is...

275
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:04,598
To be the only one
in the world wearing a jacket.

276
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:14,238
How do you plan on making
this dream happen, George?

277
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,919
- Hey!
- Hello.

278
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:45,996
- I'm in Room 15.
- OK.

279
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,817
And I got your message.

280
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:51,420
But it's still a mess with my bank.

281
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,552
They've had computer problems
for two days.

282
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:58,032
I can't withdraw money.
My card is blocked.

283
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:00,847
So uh...

284
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,873
What do we do?

285
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,151
You can leave us
a valuable object.

286
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,275
Yes, I did this already. It's done.

287
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:09,709
I left my wedding ring
with your employee.

288
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,965
Is he here? Working today?

289
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,348
He committed suicide.

290
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:16,851
- Huh?
- The day before yesterday. Right here.

291
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,798
With a hunting rifle.

292
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,630
There were brains everywhere.

293
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,579
Disgusting.
I cleaned everything up myself.

294
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,392
It's sad, but hey,
he had no family, so it's fine.

295
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,576
But then, what do we do?
Because it's...

296
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:37,800
We put the body in Room 1 until
the undertaker comes to get it.

297
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:40,760
- If you want to say goodbye.
- Yes.

298
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,360
The door is open.

299
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,056
Room 1, yeah.

300
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,180
100% DEERSKIN

301
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,474
Oh fuck!

302
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:53,315
Bingo.

303
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:03,975
There!

304
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,131
Gross.

305
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,999
Ah!

306
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:50,810
It's gold.

307
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,152
That'll do.

308
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:53,999
I'll pay you tomorrow.

309
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,765
So listen,
I won't beat around the bush, uhh...

310
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:34,575
I got my producers on the phone.

311
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:38,425
It wasn't easy because
they're currently in Siberia.

312
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:41,919
I don't know if you know,
but it's a mess over there,

313
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:44,076
the network there is useless.

314
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:47,603
I had to call back five times.
It kept disconnecting.

315
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:49,863
In addition, they were...

316
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:52,520
in the middle of shooting
a big fight scene on a glacier,

317
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,370
so really not easy.

318
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:59,952
All this to say that I might
have good news for you.

319
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:03,178
OK. But what are you saying?

320
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,905
So, in fact, they confirmed to me

321
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:10,954
that we don't have edition
yet for my film.

322
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,531
And so, since you, you...

323
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,914
An editor? There's no editor?

324
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,246
- Yes.
- OK.

325
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:19,873
Editor... whatever.

326
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:22,819
Editor. And uh...

327
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:27,040
Since the job is open, it could
easily be yours, the editor job.

328
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:30,314
- No kidding?
- Not in the least.

329
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:35,559
Well... Yeah!

330
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,255
It's... I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say, but...

331
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,916
Just say yes.

332
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:42,841
This is great, but...

333
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:46,072
Don't you want to see my work
before hiring me?

334
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:48,435
No, I don't need to.

335
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,158
I trust you.

336
00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:51,872
However, I...

337
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:55,155
I want you to take off that jacket.

338
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,549
What?

339
00:34:57,656 --> 00:34:59,888
I'd prefer if
you didn't wear a jacket.

340
00:35:00,008 --> 00:35:01,797
Can you take it off, please?

341
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,783
No. I'm comfortable with it.

342
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,655
What's your deal?
Are you some kind of pervert?

343
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:11,046
No. I just want to be
the only one wearing a jacket...

344
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,638
Take it off, please.

345
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,116
Are you messing with me?

346
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:19,659
No, it's very serious.

347
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:23,132
It's as important to me,
as this job is to you.

348
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:24,415
Indulge me and remove it.

349
00:35:24,535 --> 00:35:26,980
I want to be the only one
wearing a jacket, it's not crazy.

350
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,666
If it's to get me naked, forget it.
It's not my thing.

351
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:33,353
I assure you it's not at all sexual.

352
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:35,311
Besides, look, I'm married.

353
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:38,580
Well, I don't have it,
but I usually wear a wedding ring.

354
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,800
I just want to be the only one
wearing a jacket, that's all.

355
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,234
Indulge me.

356
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:52,590
- There.
- OK. And when do I start?

357
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:56,520
You start now.
You're hired.

358
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:59,848
What will I edit
if I have no images?

359
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,992
I was expecting that!
I expected this question.

360
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,159
Hold on.

361
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,129
Here are some images.
Lots of them.

362
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:09,231
Ah yeah, so it's not bullshit, then?

363
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,552
Will I get a script too
at some point, or...?

364
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,720
Yeah... So... About that...

365
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,918
Now that we're partners,
I must tell you something important.

366
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,816
I have a big hassle, super problematic.

367
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:31,231
Because I got my credit card
stolen yesterday.

368
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:34,070
- Ah crap, who stole it?
- It's doesn't matter.

369
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,146
But I'm in deep shit,

370
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:39,447
because I can't buy more cassettes,

371
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,996
or get a script printed.

372
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,115
So it's really not cool.

373
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:47,424
I'm sorry to have to ask.

374
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:48,662
I don't mind.

375
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,811
We don't know each other well...

376
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:54,141
When can they repay me,
your producers?

377
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,340
As soon as I contact them.

378
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,637
Don't worry, they're serious people.
They'll write you a check.

379
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:03,152
- However, I need more than 500.
- Really?

380
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:06,126
Ah...

381
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,485
That's a lot of cassettes.

382
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,450
Fuck.

383
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,836
Sick style.

384
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,006
It's killer, eh?

385
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,160
Is real deerskin?

386
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,599
Yes, absolutely.

387
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:21,278
- Sorry, I'm late. Johnny, right?
- Yes.

388
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:24,268
I'm George.
We spoke on the phone.

389
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:25,474
OK.

390
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:28,610
I'm the filmmaker.

391
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,470
OK.

392
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,769
Today's a sort of casting?

393
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:36,137
No, it's the... It's the shoot.

394
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:37,999
Directly. There's no casting.

395
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,781
- Straight away...
- Yep.

396
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,895
- Have you done this before?
- No.

397
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:44,239
You'll see, it's super simple.

398
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:46,306
How many jackets did you bring?

399
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,066
I brought all of them...

400
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:51,590
Just like you asked.
There are nine.

401
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:54,579
You want me to try them on?

402
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:57,358
- To see which will work?
- No, it's no use.

403
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,431
Put them directly in the trunk.

404
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,998
Why?

405
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,028
Because that's the scene.

406
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,244
That's it, the scene.

407
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:12,201
The guy in the scene, he says:

408
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:15,320
"I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life."

409
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,804
I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life.

410
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:20,382
I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life.

411
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:22,707
I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life.

412
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:26,029
I promise to never again wear
a jacket for the rest of my life.

413
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:29,434
Then he puts everything
in the trunk of the car.

414
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,143
OK.

415
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:35,958
Close the trunk.

416
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,913
And... Cut.

417
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,105
That's it, Johnny. Ah?

418
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:46,313
Excuse me sir, but isn't
your film a bit weird?

419
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,990
- Not at all weird. It's genius.
- Thank you.

420
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,625
Obviously, you won't understand
all of it, but it's great.

421
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,391
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah.

422
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,670
Sir. Our jackets are in the trunk.

423
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,620
Sir!
The jackets...

424
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,358
The jackets are still in the trunk!

425
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:19,163
Ah, my jackets...
You have...

426
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:21,032
The...

427
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:23,119
And... Cut.

428
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:29,353
Here.

429
00:41:31,664 --> 00:41:33,594
This isn't 100.

430
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,982
No, but it's end of the day,
I have no money left.

431
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:38,482
I'm tapped out.

432
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:44,360
What's he still doing there?

433
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,529
This kid won't stop following me.

434
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:50,288
What are you doing there?

435
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:53,334
You're following me?

436
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,000
Are you deaf?

437
00:41:58,369 --> 00:41:59,859
Are you a deaf child?

438
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,648
He's weird, isn't he?

439
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:11,345
Why are you staring at me?
What do you want?

440
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,233
You didn't see anything.

441
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,393
I need my jackets back.

442
00:42:38,513 --> 00:42:40,479
No. Since you promised
never to wear one again.

443
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,993
I've got filmed proof.
You're screwed, I'm keeping them. Ciao.

444
00:43:50,305 --> 00:43:51,695
Hey!

445
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:54,780
- How are you?
- Fine, OK, thank you.

446
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:57,685
We can talk a few minutes?

447
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,725
Why are you filming me?
What's the shot?

448
00:44:00,845 --> 00:44:03,273
- It's my job.
- Ah yeah?

449
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:20,902
I started editing.

450
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:24,858
Yeah?

451
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:30,878
I built up a scene...

452
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:33,641
With your images,
and my special machine.

453
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:37,197
- You watched what I shot?
- Should I not have?

454
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:39,871
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- OK.

455
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:41,632
Of course. But...

456
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:46,165
- You like it?
- No, I love it.

457
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:48,594
- It's a bit like a fake documentary.
- Yeah.

458
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:51,221
There's an super interesting
rawness to it, I'm into that.

459
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,231
I'm pleased.

460
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:57,835
But to tell the truth,
it's hard working without a script.

461
00:44:57,955 --> 00:44:59,717
But I really like it.

462
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,242
And I think I can already
guess what it's about.

463
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:04,713
Ah yes?

464
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:08,910
And...
In your opinion, what's it about?

465
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,795
I may be looking too deeply,

466
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:16,110
but I think the real subject
of the film is this jacket.

467
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:17,953
Your jacket.

468
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:23,878
More specifically, the fact
we all wear a shell to hide in,

469
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:26,190
to protect us
from the outside world.

470
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:28,663
- No?
- Yeah...

471
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:32,410
Am I close,
or missing the point completely?

472
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,618
You think it should be about that?

473
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:38,060
It honestly seems like a good subject.

474
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:42,400
Maybe that's what it's about.

475
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,873
You're the one who knows.

476
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,490
- Ah shit.
- What?

477
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,320
Shit. It's blocked.

478
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,528
Here.

479
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,119
Sorry, I can't get more.

480
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,269
80, that's all?

481
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Yeah.

482
00:46:05,468 --> 00:46:07,789
I never withdraw this much.
It's blocked.

483
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,188
Don't you have savings elsewhere?

484
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,154
Like normal people? Elsewhere?

485
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:14,878
- No.
- No?

486
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,672
I'm a waitress...

487
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,226
Why have your producers
left you in the shit?

488
00:46:20,346 --> 00:46:24,688
They're in Siberia.
They're filming important stuff.

489
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:28,119
What can I do with this?
Ever seen a film shot for 80 francs?

490
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,348
- I can try again.
- Well... Go ahead.

491
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:34,188
- Can't it wait until tomorrow?
- I must shoot!

492
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:37,510
- Take it easy!
- Easy, but I have a film to make.

493
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,632
- Can't you tap the cash at work?
- No, that's dead.

494
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,076
Nothing in the register.
You're the only customer, have you noticed?

495
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,474
Shit!

496
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,606
Ciao.

497
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:52,434
Goodbye then...

498
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,751
Why are you filming me?
What's the shot?

499
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,736
It's my job.

500
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:06,150
Ah yeah? Filming people
who don't want to be filmed?

501
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,484
- What kind of job is that?
- It's called making a movie.

502
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:12,592
It's called bothering people.
Come on now, stop the camera.

503
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:15,751
- May I ask you a question?
- Leave me alone!

504
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:19,753
Would you take off your jacket
and never wear it again?

505
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:23,077
- To indulge me.
- Whatever. - No?

506
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,027
Any more stupid questions?

507
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:28,876
It may seem odd, but
it's very important to me.

508
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,694
What could I do for you to agree?

509
00:47:31,814 --> 00:47:34,737
If you kill me, I might
change my mind. Poor idiot!

510
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:36,590
Come on, leave me alone now.

511
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,159
Leave me!

512
00:47:47,428 --> 00:47:49,444
Nice camera work, George.

513
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,537
You've got a knack.

514
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,279
I know what you're
going to say, don't bother.

515
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:02,429
It was a nice tracking shot, but...
We're no closer to our dream.

516
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,271
I know.

517
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:11,584
At this rate, you'll be the only one
wearing a jacket in about 1,000 years.

518
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:12,956
I know that!

519
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:35,486
We can't let these morons
keep us from our dream, George.

520
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,717
We won't let them, but...

521
00:48:41,062 --> 00:48:43,368
It's a big dream.

522
00:48:46,484 --> 00:48:51,151
All these jackets to eliminate, it's a
huge undertaking. It'll take time.

523
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:58,774
I know what we'll do.

524
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:19,206
Oh!

525
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,230
OK but...

526
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:50,760
Planting flowers is landscaping,
not gardening, don't mix them up.

527
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,472
Maybe he does both.

528
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:57,047
No, it's not the same job.

529
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:59,122
You see, it's like...

530
00:51:09,014 --> 00:51:11,190
It's the same type of profession.

531
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,368
Wait, who's this guy?

532
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:17,859
Hello.

533
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:21,150
I do not like this, man.
What do we do?

534
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,232
I dunno.

535
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:26,634
Would you like to help me
fulfill my dream?

536
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,313
Denise,

537
00:51:50,665 --> 00:51:53,869
despite the lack of means,
I shot a scene tonight

538
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:55,518
by the sweat of my brow.

539
00:51:56,729 --> 00:51:59,710
Appreciate these images,
because they may be the last.

540
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:05,178
Indeed, something terrible
must have happened in Siberia,

541
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:08,590
for the producers to leave me
like this without any news.

542
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:11,878
I don't think I'll have the
strength to continue this film

543
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:14,017
without the financial support
it deserves.

544
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:16,952
Unless you find a way
to help me, of course.

545
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:19,630
Regards,
George.

546
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:33,680
You poor fool!

547
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,512
Come on, leave me alone now.
Leave me!

548
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:30,882
Oh!

549
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:34,930
Yes!

550
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,301
Fuck.

551
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:46,828
Yeah.

552
00:54:00,954 --> 00:54:02,140
What?

553
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:06,019
I watched the new tape.
I'm so into it.

554
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:07,655
Can we talk about it?

555
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:11,516
- You want to have a meeting?
- Yes. May I come in?

556
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:13,765
Sure, but take that off.

557
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,079
- That?
- Yes.

558
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:19,077
You know this.

559
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,419
Everything OK?

560
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,197
- And you?
- Yeah.

561
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:44,516
You notice something or not?
Do you see a stain here?

562
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,679
- No?
- No.

563
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:50,380
- It doesn't shock you?
- No.

564
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,634
Well the...

565
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:56,292
So, this meeting?

566
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,152
Here.

567
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:01,068
What's this?

568
00:55:04,464 --> 00:55:06,833
To thank you for
hiring me on your movie.

569
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:09,758
I'm so very happy you trust me.

570
00:55:09,878 --> 00:55:13,704
And I wanted to apologize for not
getting more money yesterday.

571
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:16,212
I don't want you
staying angry about that.

572
00:55:16,332 --> 00:55:18,081
You were able to get more?

573
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:21,256
Yeah. I asked my boss for an advance.

574
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,990
Your boss...
But I'm your boss, right?

575
00:55:25,558 --> 00:55:26,841
At the bar.

576
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,322
Ah yes. Yes, yes.

577
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:31,398
Alright, sure.

578
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:34,914
OK... well, thanks then.

579
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,647
- It's soft...
- Open it!

580
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,873
Oh fuck.

581
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:06,873
Do you like it?

582
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:08,233
Oh fuck.

583
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:11,358
But... No, you've gone crazy.

584
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,240
- They're...?
- Yeah, 100% deerskin.

585
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,840
Mad classy.
I love my life, thank you!

586
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,119
I thank you, George.

587
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:29,185
Wait, I'll try them on.

588
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:31,688
- I can try them on?
- Yes, of course.

589
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,079
You're crazy!

590
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:34,759
Oh no!

591
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:38,432
- Oh my!
- I'm glad you like them.

592
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,829
- It's deerskin? Sure?
- Yeah, sure.

593
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:42,074
Wow!

594
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,231
Hot damn!

595
00:56:51,985 --> 00:56:55,568
- Those are cool pants.
- Just cool? - You sure?

596
00:56:55,688 --> 00:56:57,471
- Get a closer look?
- Yeah.

597
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,530
So, I was saying,

598
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,609
I don't want to give you false hope,
but I may know where to get money.

599
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:06,787
- A lot?
- Yeah, a lot.

600
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:08,751
Enough to make the full movie.

601
00:57:10,487 --> 00:57:13,999
So... On the other hand,
I need more images.

602
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,197
So I can edit a teaser.

603
00:57:16,317 --> 00:57:18,349
And you need to film closer up.

604
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:21,318
I need more action.
I need more blood.

605
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,516
"I need... I need..."

606
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:27,079
Are you giving me orders?

607
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:28,552
Yes I am.

608
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,869
Here.

609
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:37,476
To get a few more scenes.

610
00:57:40,177 --> 00:57:41,497
Off to work, then...

611
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:31,767
Hey!

612
00:59:02,524 --> 00:59:03,611
Excuse me?

613
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:08,365
I'm completely lost.
Can you show me the way?

614
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:10,552
- Yes.
- Thank you.

615
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,054
Are you crazy or something?

616
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:14,280
George.

617
01:02:17,373 --> 01:02:18,576
George.

618
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:22,646
George!

619
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,761
- Good day.
- Good day!

620
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,735
So what's the job?

621
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,313
It's about this.

622
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,159
Here.

623
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,886
You dig me a nice hole here.

624
01:03:18,902 --> 01:03:20,749
There. OK?

625
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:22,067
And you...

626
01:03:22,446 --> 01:03:25,480
There, yeah. Then leave
without asking any questions.

627
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,287
Alright?

628
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:30,550
I'll fill it back in myself.

629
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,300
Wow.

630
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,357
My father sold his butcher shop
two years ago. He's loaded.

631
01:06:59,026 --> 01:07:01,311
- This is 50,000.
- Ah yeah.

632
01:07:01,641 --> 01:07:04,519
- I'm taking over production.
- Huh?

633
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:07,836
You need financial support
but also a guide.

634
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:10,494
You can't go on alone, it's a mess.

635
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:13,278
So I'll keep editing,
and in addition, I produce.

636
01:07:15,868 --> 01:07:18,473
Translation, you're
giving me this money or not?

637
01:07:18,593 --> 01:07:20,856
Translation, if I manage this money,

638
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:24,229
it will be better spent
and the film will be better.

639
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:26,910
You need a producer, George. Clearly.

640
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,472
Do you trust me, or not?

641
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:31,723
- You're giving me this dough or what?
- No!

642
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:35,077
George, I want this money
to go into the movie.

643
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,873
"Into the movie"!

644
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:44,129
- You have no idea what this all means?
- What?

645
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:45,776
You know nothing about it.

646
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:47,074
About what?

647
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:49,390
Siberia, that was bullshit.

648
01:07:49,624 --> 01:07:52,472
But not at all.
It's not bullshit at all.

649
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,394
They even sent a fax this morning.

650
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,493
I swear. They sent a fax.
They're all dead.

651
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:00,692
A fax?

652
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:03,885
Yes! They died in an avalanche,
that's why I couldn't reach them.

653
01:08:04,005 --> 01:08:05,654
You don't seem too sad.

654
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,469
I'm not sad because
they were work relationships.

655
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:10,959
I won't weep for them.

656
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:13,469
They're dead, but sent a fax?

657
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,032
- Yes.
- George.

658
01:08:16,982 --> 01:08:19,122
I know it's bullshit.

659
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:21,515
I knew that from the start.

660
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,359
You are nothing and nobody.

661
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,518
You have no production.

662
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,878
You're just a guy all alone.

663
01:08:33,124 --> 01:08:34,835
Yes, I'm all alone.

664
01:08:37,629 --> 01:08:39,857
You're also all alone.

665
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,782
It's true,
I'm all alone too.

666
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:45,319
And we are all alone.

667
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:48,673
Point is, we could be alone together.

668
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:50,956
And we could make a great film.

669
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:57,307
OK. You know what I'd like now?

670
01:08:58,354 --> 01:08:59,601
What?

671
01:09:10,758 --> 01:09:12,139
So?

672
01:09:19,348 --> 01:09:22,278
Otherwise, I have these,
but they're synthetic.

673
01:09:23,267 --> 01:09:26,715
- Do I look like I'd wear synthetic?
- You saw his sick style?

674
01:09:28,534 --> 01:09:29,832
Yes.

675
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:32,759
We buying them?

676
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:35,170
A very good choice.

677
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:03,078
Where are we going?

678
01:10:33,886 --> 01:10:35,067
Shoot me.

679
01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:41,198
- Shoot me.
- Wait.

680
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:47,829
- OK, shooting.
- Shoot me.

681
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,420
Now, go ahead.

682
01:10:53,328 --> 01:10:54,434
Shoot me!

683
01:10:56,573 --> 01:10:57,588
Yes!

684
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:00,662
Here!

685
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:04,188
Shoot me!

686
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:05,713
Yes, I'm shooting you!

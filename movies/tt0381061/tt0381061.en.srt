1
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,573
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:21,448
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:32,635
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:35,387
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,925
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:41,101
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,397
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,274
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,852
...wouldn't l?.

10
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:54,487
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
-Two.

11
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:13,377
Shame.

12
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:16,055
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,302
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:25,352
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,650
True.

16
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:30,941
How did he die?

17
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,652
Your contact?.

18
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,320
Not well.

19
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,198
Made you feel it, did he?.

20
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,541
Well...

21
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,960
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,049
The second is...

23
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,922
Yes.

24
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,725
Considerably.

So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?.

62
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:39,934
You asked for the introduction.

63
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,353
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

64
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,432
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

65
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,984
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

66
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:30,855
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

67
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,865
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?.

68
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,746
No.

69
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,537
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

70
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:45,036
I want no risk in the portfolio.

71
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:46,582
Agreed.

72
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,580
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?.

73
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:49,923
Yes.

74
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,062
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

75
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:13,030
...of Skyfleet stock.

76
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,069
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

77
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,406
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

78
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,368
Just do it.

79
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,618
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

80
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,790
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

81
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,012
Hes on the move.

82
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,186
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

83
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,026
Stop touching your ear.

84
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,361
-Sorry?.
-Put your hand down.

85
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,279
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

86
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:13,381
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

87
00:20:13,598 --> 00:20:15,054
...my dear general.

88
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,260
Nothing sinister.

89
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:23,933
All in.

90
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:29,853
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

91
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,106
...of making your straight.

92
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,931
When does Ellipsis expire?.

93
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:04,313
-We have less than 36 hours. I can...
-No. No, no.

94
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:07,184
That's all the time I have anyway.

95
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:11,108
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

96
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:13,656
...or throw them overboard.

97
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,003
who the hell do they think they are?.

98
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,631
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

99
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:31,084
...not to ask me what we do.

100
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:34,966
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?.

101
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,966
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

102
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,806
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?.

103
00:21:41,022 --> 00:21:43,934
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

104
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,433
Is the man deranged?.
And where the hell is he?.

105
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:49,235
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

106
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:51,062
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

107
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,148
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

108
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:11,404
You've got a bloody cheek.

109
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:13,111
Sorry.

110
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,074
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

111
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:16,951
Or yourself.

112
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,238
You stormed into an embassy.

113
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:21,956
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

114
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:23,788
...of international relationships.

115
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,832
And why?.
So you could kill a nobody.

116
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:27,754
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

117
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,218
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgement.

118
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:33,426
I did.

119
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,597
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

120
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:38,674
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

121
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,683
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

122
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,389
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

123
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,728
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?.

124
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:50,111
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

125
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,234
And thanks to your trigger finger...

126
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:55,279
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

127
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:57,827
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?.

128
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,662
The same way
I found out your name.

129
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,783
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

130
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:05,418
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

131
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:09,624
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

132
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:14,129
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

133
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:16,472
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

134
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,650
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

135
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:31,234
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

136
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:34,532
So you want me too be half monk,
half hit-man?.

137
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,614
Any thug can kill.

138
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,196
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

139
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,995
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

140
00:24:42,836 --> 00:24:45,919
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

141
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:50,708
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

142
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:52,968
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

143
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,545
...and think about your future.

144
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:57,716
Because these bastards
want your head.

145
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:01,386
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

146
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,737
And Bond...

147
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:16,739
...don't ever break into
my house again.

148
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:19,579
Ma'am.

149
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:35,117
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

150
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,366
Hey. Hey.

151
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:56,130
Hello.

152
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:58,474
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?.

153
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,016
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

154
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:48,393
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

155
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:50,232
Absolutely incredible.

156
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:31,834
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?.

157
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:35,505
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

158
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,097
Okay.

159
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:42,019
-We have an ocean-view villa.
-Perfect.

160
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:47,316
Could you do me a favor?.
I was here last night...

161
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,483
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

162
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,816
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?.

163
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,492
-Mr. Dimitrios.
-Right.

164
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,325
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

165
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,289
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

166
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:05,164
But if I felt compelled to find him?

167
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:08,376
He has a house just up the beach.

168
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,375
Thank you.

169
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:15,071
-What?
-He's in the Bahamas.

170
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:17,782
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?.

171
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:19,905
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

172
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,203
...using your name and password.

173
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,286
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?.

174
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:27,834
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

175
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,918
-Who's he looking at?
-Alex Dimitrios.

176
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,965
That slimy bugger.

177
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,433
Now known associates....

178
00:31:58,165 --> 00:31:59,621
Le Chiffre.

179
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,724
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

180
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,310
How can I assist you, sir?.

181
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,808
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

182
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,645
-Look what just happened.
-Good job, big boy.

183
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,018
Yeah.

184
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,951
Do you mind if I join?.

185
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,321
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Good evening.

186
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,793
Small blind, big blind.

187
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,712
I'm in.

188
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,807
Bet's to you.

189
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:04,309
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

190
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,105
Two hundred to you.

191
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,236
Bet's to you.

192
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:15,989
I heard you.

193
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,327
Five to call.

194
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:23,287
-Action's to you.
-Pair of sevens.

195
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:24,872
Ace high.

196
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,001
Check or bet.

197
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,669
-Check.
-And to you.

198
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,841
Five thousand.

199
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:37,257
Five to call.

200
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,362
-Check.
-Check to you, sir.

201
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:54,358
All in.

202
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:56,909
No, wait.

203
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,779
Twenty thousand.

204
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:01,539
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

205
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:08,085
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?.

206
00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:11,667
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

207
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:14,883
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

208
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,766
All right, show me, gentlemen.

209
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,235
Three kings.

210
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:41,160
There you go with my night.

211
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:42,791
Trip aces.

212
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:45,122
Aces win.

213
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,083
Oh, and the valet ticket.

214
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:55,929
Thank you.

215
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:57,548
Sir.

216
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:32,092
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

217
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,305
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

218
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:38,683
My mistake.

219
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:40,184
Can I give you a lift home?

220
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:44,180
That would really send him
over the edge.

221
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,356
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

222
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,644
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practise.

223
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:57,698
Perhaps.

224
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,704
Well' what about
a drink at my place?.

225
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,533
Your place?.

226
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:05,836
-ls it close?
-Very.

227
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:14,132
One drink.

228
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,077
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

229
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,121
Welcome to my home.

230
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:58,383
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

231
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:01,303
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

232
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:06,061
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

233
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:10,274
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

234
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:13,111
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

235
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:15,234
But I do care about my reputation.

236
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:18,404
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

237
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:20,489
He just needs the particulars...

238
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,037
...and payment.

239
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:37,594
You like married women,
don't you, James?

240
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,096
It keeps things simple.

241
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:45,769
What is it about bad men?.

242
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:48,977
You, my husband...

243
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:51,821
I had so many chances
to be happy...

244
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:54,449
...so many nice guys.

245
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:57,326
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

246
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:59,738
well, because then they'd be bad.

247
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,999
Yes.

248
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,540
But so much more interesting.

249
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,421
What makes your husband
a bad man?

250
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:18,174
His nature, I suppose.

251
00:38:18,352 --> 00:38:20,013
The nature of his work?.

252
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:23,931
A mystery, I'm afraid.

253
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:29,862
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

254
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:32,568
How afraid?

255
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:35,951
Not enough to stop.

256
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:45,703
Can I ask you a personal question?

257
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:51,008
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

258
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,586
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?.

259
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,855
Should I ask him about it?

260
00:39:05,068 --> 00:39:07,354
Perhaps later.

261
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,520
Yes, dear?

262
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,689
I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.

263
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:14,532
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

264
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:17,027
Okay, I understoand.

265
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:20,034
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

266
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:25,877
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

267
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:30,340
...so you have all night
to question me.

268
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,595
In that case...

269
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:35,930
...we're gonna need...

270
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,512
...some more champagne.

271
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,810
Good evening. Room Service.

272
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:49,853
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

273
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,275
...and the beluga caviar?.

274
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:53,899
-With everything?
-Yes, with everything.

275
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,277
-And would that be for two, sir?
-What?.

276
00:39:56,455 --> 00:39:59,743
-For two?
-No, for one.

277
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:34,570
Wait here.

278
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:41,787
There you go. Number 53.

279
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:48,122
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

280
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,167
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

281
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:53,176
...nervous and vascular systems.

282
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,118
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

283
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,078
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

284
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,417
This is edutainment.

285
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,897
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

286
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:36,030
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

287
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:53,803
Hello.

288
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:05,940
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

289
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,734
Welcome to Miami
International Airport.

290
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:12,110
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted....

291
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:50,049
-Yes.
-It's Bond. I need her now.

292
00:44:50,261 --> 00:44:53,048
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

293
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:56,510
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

294
00:44:56,684 --> 00:44:59,266
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

295
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,436
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?
-I thought you might.

296
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:09,569
Bond? What the hell are you up to?.

297
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:13,402
I'll call you back.

298
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,341
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
-What about it?.

299
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,011
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

300
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:24,393
Oh, my God!

301
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:26,182
Bond? Bond!

302
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:31,362
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

303
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:33,482
It's launching today.

304
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:37,702
I gotta go.

305
00:51:02,941 --> 00:51:04,727
Stop! Stop!

306
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:09,377
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go' let's go!

307
00:53:42,482 --> 00:53:47,226
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

308
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:52,815
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

309
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,574
Someone talked.

310
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:27,274
-You got everything you need?.
-Yeah, I have.

311
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:29,523
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

312
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:47,004
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

313
00:54:47,716 --> 00:54:50,458
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

314
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:53,298
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

315
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:56,089
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?.

316
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:57,344
No.

317
00:54:57,477 --> 00:55:01,015
-Not your name, what you were after?
-No.

318
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,603
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

319
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:04,601
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

320
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:06,274
...and people who could use them.

321
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:08,025
He worked with anyone
who had money.

322
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:11,646
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

323
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:13,816
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

324
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:17,368
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

325
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:19,325
Oh, good. You're here.

326
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:22,120
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

327
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:26,830
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

328
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,702
So you can keep an eye on me?

329
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:00,538
Yes.

330
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:08,589
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9/11...

331
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,084
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

332
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:16,089
when the stocks hit bottom on 9/12,
somebody made a fortune.

333
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:19,346
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

334
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:20,722
...or was supposed to.

335
00:56:20,938 --> 00:56:24,772
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

336
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:29,019
Instead, somebody lost over
$100 million betting the wrong way.

337
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:31,859
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

338
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:35,070
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

339
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:36,943
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

340
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:41,206
Ten players, $10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

341
00:56:41,418 --> 00:56:44,205
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

342
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,917
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

343
00:56:47,132 --> 00:56:49,088
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?.

344
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,629
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

345
00:56:53,764 --> 00:56:57,222
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

346
00:56:57,393 --> 00:57:00,226
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

347
00:57:00,396 --> 00:57:01,761
We can't let him win this game.

348
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:04,267
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

349
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,267
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

350
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:09,193
I'm putting you in the game...

351
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:12,113
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

352
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:15,822
According to villiers,
you're the best player in the service.

353
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:18,069
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

354
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:27,083
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

355
00:57:27,216 --> 00:57:30,424
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?.

356
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:32,960
No.

357
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,677
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

358
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:39,183
We'll know where you are.

359
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:40,768
You can stop pretending.

360
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:43,722
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

361
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:47,191
Well, I knew you were you.

362
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:07,329
Thank you.

363
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:15,758
I'm the money.

364
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:19,350
Every penny of it.

365
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:23,896
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

366
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:26,857
"Vesper."

367
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,607
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

368
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:31,817
Thank you.

369
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:33,698
Your boss must be well-connected.

370
00:58:33,869 --> 00:58:36,360
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

371
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,528
Or quite so stylishly.

372
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,077
May I ask you where it is?.

373
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,868
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

374
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:49,339
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

375
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,593
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

376
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:55,721
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

377
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:00,513
What looks good?.

378
00:59:07,696 --> 00:59:10,529
so you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

379
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,731
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

380
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:15,575
well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

381
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,990
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?.

382
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:22,915
You've heard the term.

383
00:59:23,045 --> 00:59:25,627
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

384
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:27,163
You play the man across from you.

385
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,711
-And you're good at reading people?.
-Yes, I am.

386
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:31,713
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

387
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:33,962
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

388
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,507
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

389
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:40,768
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?.

390
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,470
So there is a plan?

391
00:59:42,607 --> 00:59:45,314
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

392
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:47,684
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

393
00:59:47,862 --> 00:59:49,978
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

394
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:52,322
About you, Miss Lynd?.

395
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,156
Well, your beauty's a problem.

396
00:59:54,578 --> 00:59:56,569
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

397
00:59:56,788 --> 00:59:59,780
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

398
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,581
True, but this one
overcompensates...

399
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,575
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

400
01:00:03,796 --> 01:00:06,162
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

401
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,831
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanour...

402
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:12,297
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

403
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:14,757
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

404
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:17,761
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

405
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:22,225
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

406
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,603
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

407
01:00:25,777 --> 01:00:28,484
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

408
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,357
All right.

409
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:36,823
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

410
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:39,321
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

411
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:41,452
But you wear it with such disdain...

412
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:43,492
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

413
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,332
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

414
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,630
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

415
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:51,505
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

416
01:00:51,721 --> 01:00:54,178
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

417
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:56,468
...that's what I'd say you are.

418
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:02,437
Oh, you are.

419
01:01:02,857 --> 01:01:04,722
I like this poker thing.

420
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:06,690
And that makes perfect sense...

421
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,186
...since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

422
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:11,733
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

423
01:01:11,908 --> 01:01:14,149
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

424
01:01:14,286 --> 01:01:15,401
You know...

425
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:19,572
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

426
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,415
-Rolex?
-Omega.

427
01:01:22,544 --> 01:01:24,455
Beautiful.

428
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:26,662
Now, having just met you...

429
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,666
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

430
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,250
No, of course not.

431
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:33,215
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

432
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,550
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

433
01:01:35,683 --> 01:01:37,844
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

434
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,431
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

435
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:44,063
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

436
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:46,266
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

437
01:01:46,694 --> 01:01:48,230
You noticed?.

438
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:50,437
Even accountants have imagination.

439
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:51,939
How was your lamb?.

440
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:53,906
Skewered.

441
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:55,734
One sympathizes.

442
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,117
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

443
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:01,623
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

444
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:20,138
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-That's right.

445
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:24,605
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

446
01:02:38,165 --> 01:02:40,998
It's just last-minute details.

447
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:44,368
Apparently we're very much in love.

448
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:48,122
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

449
01:02:48,259 --> 01:02:51,001
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

450
01:02:51,345 --> 01:02:54,303
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

451
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:56,138
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

452
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,466
-I am not.
-You're gonna have to trust me on this.

453
01:02:58,686 --> 01:03:00,677
Oh, no, I don't.

454
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:02,849
We've been involved
for quite a while...

455
01:03:03,525 --> 01:03:05,311
...hence the shared suite.

456
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:07,817
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

457
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:10,858
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

458
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:14,279
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

459
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:16,990
Religion and a securely locked door.

460
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:19,200
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

461
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:22,120
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

462
01:03:22,377 --> 01:03:23,457
Smart?

463
01:03:24,046 --> 01:03:25,786
Single.

464
01:03:44,943 --> 01:03:47,025
welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

465
01:03:47,195 --> 01:03:50,028
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

466
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,027
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.

467
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:55,984
You represent the Treasury.

468
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:02,996
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

469
01:04:03,128 --> 01:04:04,743
I will. Thank you.

470
01:04:07,716 --> 01:04:08,922
Very funny.

471
01:04:09,093 --> 01:04:11,049
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

472
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:13,218
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

473
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:15,839
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

474
01:04:16,017 --> 01:04:18,383
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

475
01:04:18,561 --> 01:04:20,927
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

476
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:23,604
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

477
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:25,603
And now he knows
something about you.

478
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:27,938
He knows you're reckless.

479
01:04:28,571 --> 01:04:30,436
Take the next one.

480
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:33,407
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

481
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:35,442
Mr. Bond?

482
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,906
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.

483
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,687
I love you too, M.

484
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:54,992
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

485
01:05:58,373 --> 01:06:00,079
Does he know
we've been watching him?.

486
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:02,951
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

487
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:07,501
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

488
01:06:08,092 --> 01:06:10,048
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

489
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:14,004
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

490
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:17,347
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

491
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:21,307
...and spent the time re-establishing
old relationships.

492
01:06:21,814 --> 01:06:24,851
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

493
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,975
That's him, with the moustache.

494
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:28,689
Over my left shoulder.

495
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,988
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

496
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,156
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

497
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:36,989
He's not a very subtle man.

498
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:40,327
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

499
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,784
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

500
01:06:51,846 --> 01:06:53,052
I hate to say it...

501
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:57,261
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

502
01:06:58,269 --> 01:07:01,511
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

503
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:03,934
Many of them are lovely people.

504
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:08,560
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

505
01:07:08,738 --> 01:07:12,356
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

506
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:16,910
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

507
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:22,540
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

508
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,381
Yes?.

509
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:31,709
For you.

510
01:07:32,805 --> 01:07:35,387
Something you expect me to wear?

511
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,175
I need you looking fabulous.

512
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:41,644
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

513
01:07:41,814 --> 01:07:44,271
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

514
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,186
...and not about their cards.

515
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,731
Do you think you can
do that for me?.

516
01:07:48,947 --> 01:07:50,903
I'll do my best.

517
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:53,899
Thank you.

518
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,121
I have a dinner jacket.

519
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,712
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

520
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,092
This is the latter.

521
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:15,471
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

522
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,507
How...?

523
01:08:18,352 --> 01:08:19,762
It's tailored.

524
01:08:19,937 --> 01:08:22,553
I sized you up the moment we met.

525
01:09:16,163 --> 01:09:18,870
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

526
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,532
Thank you.

527
01:09:33,222 --> 01:09:35,383
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

528
01:09:35,558 --> 01:09:37,719
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

529
01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:41,682
Or is that Bond?.
I'm a little confused.

530
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,397
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?.

531
01:09:53,702 --> 01:09:55,818
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

532
01:09:55,996 --> 01:09:58,533
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

533
01:09:58,749 --> 01:10:00,705
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

534
01:10:01,168 --> 01:10:03,955
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

535
01:10:04,129 --> 01:10:05,414
...holding the stakes.

536
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:10,257
You have each deposited
$10 million buy-in.

537
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:13,340
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

538
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:15,672
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

539
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:18,679
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

540
01:10:18,811 --> 01:10:21,678
...into the encryptor, whereupon
the entire sum will be wired...

541
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:24,264
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

542
01:10:24,776 --> 01:10:26,562
Mr. Bond?

543
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:28,101
We proceed alphabetically.

544
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:30,775
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

545
01:10:39,124 --> 01:10:40,330
Six letters or more.

546
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:56,096
High card for dealer position.

547
01:11:03,107 --> 01:11:04,438
It's Signor Gallardo.

548
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:07,646
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

549
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:11,317
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$10,000.

550
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,526
Well, enjoy the game.

551
01:11:39,312 --> 01:11:40,472
Four players.

552
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:44,355
It's your bet.

553
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:47,309
Check.

554
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:49,356
Check.

555
01:11:53,702 --> 01:11:55,738
Bet. Fifty thousand.

556
01:12:08,968 --> 01:12:10,174
Call.

557
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:14,754
Fold.

558
01:12:16,976 --> 01:12:19,342
Fold. Heads up.

559
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:25,140
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

560
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,242
Bet. One hundred thousand.

561
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:45,328
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

562
01:12:45,464 --> 01:12:48,581
Was l?. Forgive me.

563
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:51,258
Good luck, darling.

564
01:12:55,099 --> 01:12:57,465
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

565
01:12:59,395 --> 01:13:00,680
Monsieur Bond?

566
01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:03,520
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?.

567
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:06,106
Call.

568
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,359
Hello.

569
01:13:12,576 --> 01:13:16,160
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

570
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:19,534
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

571
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:20,697
Champagne.

572
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,245
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

573
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:38,675
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

574
01:13:44,943 --> 01:13:48,777
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

575
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:53,656
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

576
01:13:53,785 --> 01:13:55,650
Mr. Bond?

577
01:13:58,457 --> 01:13:59,867
Fold.

578
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:09,582
Send the barman over, please.

579
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,514
A dry martini. Wait.

580
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:22,474
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

581
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:24,472
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

582
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:27,525
...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.

583
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:30,563
-You know, I'll have one of those.
-So will I.

584
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:32,776
Certainly.

585
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:37,615
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

586
01:14:38,457 --> 01:14:39,822
That's it?.

587
01:14:41,126 --> 01:14:42,662
Anyone want to play poker now?.

588
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,084
Someone's in a hurry.

589
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,046
Would you excuse me?.

590
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:09,902
You taste nice.

591
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:13,068
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.

592
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:16,906
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

593
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:18,700
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

594
01:15:18,832 --> 01:15:19,867
Good.

595
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,916
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

596
01:15:23,045 --> 01:15:24,876
...we won't be here past midnight.

597
01:15:25,047 --> 01:15:28,084
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

598
01:15:28,634 --> 01:15:30,295
Check.

599
01:15:30,845 --> 01:15:32,756
-You know, that's not half bad.
-Up to you.

600
01:15:32,888 --> 01:15:34,799
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

601
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,887
It was worth it to discover his tell.

602
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,555
What do you mean?.

603
01:15:40,855 --> 01:15:42,937
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

604
01:15:43,066 --> 01:15:47,230
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.

605
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:49,652
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

606
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,820
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

607
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:53,607
Winning was blind luck.

608
01:15:53,743 --> 01:15:55,574
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.

609
01:15:55,829 --> 01:15:57,694
Bet. One hundred thousand.

610
01:15:57,873 --> 01:15:59,409
Thank you.

611
01:16:01,168 --> 01:16:02,578
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

612
01:16:02,836 --> 01:16:05,873
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

613
01:16:06,715 --> 01:16:08,125
Call.

614
01:16:09,718 --> 01:16:11,754
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

615
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:16,805
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

616
01:16:16,976 --> 01:16:18,807
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

617
01:16:18,936 --> 01:16:23,475
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

618
01:16:52,263 --> 01:16:57,974
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

619
01:16:59,645 --> 01:17:01,510
So?

620
01:17:01,648 --> 01:17:03,855
You want to do what to me?.

621
01:17:03,983 --> 01:17:05,314
You've lost me completely.

622
01:17:05,485 --> 01:17:08,522
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. come on.

623
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:36,093
So, what's so damn important?

624
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,180
I'm sorry.

625
01:17:42,982 --> 01:17:44,518
Where is my money?.

626
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,361
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

627
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:52,731
You're holding a parcel for me.

628
01:17:57,414 --> 01:17:59,075
Thank you.

629
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:04,501
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?.

630
01:18:05,005 --> 01:18:06,836
Your money is safe.

631
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:10,423
Open that.

632
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:28,477
You'll have it tomorrow.

633
01:18:29,406 --> 01:18:30,737
All of it.

634
01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:48,127
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

635
01:18:52,638 --> 01:18:54,469
Hold out your arm.

636
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,465
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

637
01:18:58,144 --> 01:18:59,725
...or I will take your head.

638
01:19:09,614 --> 01:19:12,606
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

639
01:19:25,798 --> 01:19:26,878
Stairs.

640
01:19:31,345 --> 01:19:34,052
Not a word of protest.

641
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,131
You should find a new boyfriend.

642
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,056
Go find Mathis.

643
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:44,397
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

644
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:47,692
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

645
01:22:50,469 --> 01:22:53,176
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

646
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:57,140
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

647
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:58,636
A little.

648
01:22:58,811 --> 01:23:02,349
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

649
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:06,641
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

650
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,260
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

651
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:15,087
Here, let's see.

652
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,564
That's better.

653
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,911
You cold?.

654
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:39,571
Yeah.

655
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,615
Here.

656
01:25:38,352 --> 01:25:40,684
You have any trouble
with the bodies?.

657
01:25:41,022 --> 01:25:43,138
Less than some.

658
01:25:56,913 --> 01:26:00,656
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

659
01:26:01,543 --> 01:26:04,330
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

660
01:26:04,463 --> 01:26:06,704
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

661
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,591
How's our girl?.

662
01:26:11,095 --> 01:26:14,337
Melted your cold heart yet?.

663
01:26:32,242 --> 01:26:33,482
Call.

664
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,070
Fold.

665
01:26:35,203 --> 01:26:37,239
And call.

666
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:40,580
Three players.

667
01:26:44,213 --> 01:26:45,953
Three hundred grand.

668
01:26:46,173 --> 01:26:47,834
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

669
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:51,383
Call.

670
01:26:53,097 --> 01:26:54,086
And call.

671
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,601
Three players.

672
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:05,894
Check.

673
01:27:11,366 --> 01:27:12,606
Monsieur Bond?

674
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:24,873
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

675
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:40,851
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

676
01:27:41,064 --> 01:27:43,100
My God, James was right.

677
01:27:44,108 --> 01:27:46,144
It's up to you.

678
01:27:52,284 --> 01:27:54,616
Raise. one million.

679
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,122
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

680
01:28:05,172 --> 01:28:06,287
Fold.

681
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:08,288
Heads up, gentlemen.

682
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:10,087
It's up to you.

683
01:28:24,275 --> 01:28:25,765
Two.

684
01:28:26,528 --> 01:28:28,610
Re-raise. Two million.

685
01:28:30,532 --> 01:28:32,693
And it's up to you.

686
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:45,626
I'm all in.

687
01:28:52,972 --> 01:28:55,384
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

688
01:28:55,558 --> 01:28:57,890
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

689
01:29:00,563 --> 01:29:04,852
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

690
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:08,561
-Call.
-Call.

691
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:11,362
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

692
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:15,575
Full house. Kings and aces.

693
01:29:15,704 --> 01:29:17,740
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

694
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:34,429
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

695
01:29:38,394 --> 01:29:41,602
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

696
01:29:42,231 --> 01:29:43,437
Please.

697
01:29:43,608 --> 01:29:45,894
We will now break for one hour.

698
01:29:46,152 --> 01:29:49,440
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

699
01:29:56,913 --> 01:29:58,619
Good game.

700
01:30:26,694 --> 01:30:30,027
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

701
01:30:30,574 --> 01:30:32,940
I can't do that, James.

702
01:30:33,493 --> 01:30:35,905
Look, I made a mistake.

703
01:30:36,663 --> 01:30:39,655
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

704
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:41,281
-I'm sorry.
-sorry?.

705
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:43,826
Sorry?

706
01:30:43,962 --> 01:30:45,793
Try putting that in a sentence.

707
01:30:45,923 --> 01:30:47,254
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

708
01:30:47,466 --> 01:30:49,957
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?.

709
01:30:50,094 --> 01:30:53,177
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

710
01:30:53,306 --> 01:30:54,796
That's what this is about.

711
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,972
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

712
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,800
Then you're an idiot.

713
01:30:58,936 --> 01:31:01,803
-I'm sorry?.
-I said, you're a bloody idiot.

714
01:31:03,733 --> 01:31:05,974
Look in my eyes.

715
01:31:06,736 --> 01:31:08,522
I can beat this man, you know that.

716
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:13,781
Get your hand off my arm.

717
01:31:36,642 --> 01:31:37,882
Vodka martini.

718
01:31:38,019 --> 01:31:40,852
-Shaken or stirred?.
-Do I look like I give a damn?.

719
01:31:58,999 --> 01:32:01,285
-James.
-Get the girl out.

720
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:09,540
Funny game, right?.

721
01:32:09,718 --> 01:32:12,835
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

722
01:32:13,598 --> 01:32:16,681
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

723
01:32:18,686 --> 01:32:20,096
You should have a little faith.

724
01:32:20,271 --> 01:32:22,728
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

725
01:32:22,941 --> 01:32:25,307
Had. Excuse me.

726
01:32:25,693 --> 01:32:27,604
You're not buying in?.

727
01:32:29,322 --> 01:32:30,732
No.

728
01:32:34,035 --> 01:32:37,903
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

729
01:32:38,081 --> 01:32:40,823
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

730
01:32:41,877 --> 01:32:43,993
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

731
01:32:44,213 --> 01:32:49,082
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

732
01:32:50,428 --> 01:32:52,794
And what about the winnings?.

733
01:32:53,431 --> 01:32:56,047
Does it look like
we need the money?.

734
01:33:07,612 --> 01:33:09,694
Shall we up the blinds?

735
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:13,653
Why not?.

736
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:18,620
Bet.

737
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:22,373
Raise.

738
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:39,763
And fold.

739
01:33:42,023 --> 01:33:43,979
Excuse me, please.

740
01:33:45,693 --> 01:33:47,308
Call.

741
01:33:48,738 --> 01:33:49,978
Raise.

742
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:53,694
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

743
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,154
-Fold.
-Thank you.

744
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:01,661
Fold.

745
01:34:05,881 --> 01:34:07,496
Fold.

746
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:13,756
Thank you.

747
01:34:13,973 --> 01:34:15,008
Wins.

748
01:34:36,038 --> 01:34:37,244
Deal me out.

749
01:34:38,248 --> 01:34:41,456
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

750
01:34:43,379 --> 01:34:44,915
Small blind, please.

751
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:51,442
-Who is it?.
-It's 007.

752
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:55,609
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

753
01:35:57,831 --> 01:36:00,288
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

754
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:03,117
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

755
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:04,500
I'm all ears.

756
01:36:04,713 --> 01:36:06,294
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

757
01:36:06,548 --> 01:36:08,834
-Do we know what it is yet?
-We're still scanning.

758
01:36:14,515 --> 01:36:17,257
Attach the leads to your chest.

759
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:27,810
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

760
01:36:28,113 --> 01:36:30,946
What do we give him?. The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

761
01:36:31,116 --> 01:36:32,777
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?.

762
01:36:32,951 --> 01:36:35,658
-As soon as it reads charged...
-Lidocaine. That'll work.

763
01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:38,362
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me?. Don't push it.

764
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:40,030
His heart's gonna stop.

765
01:36:40,209 --> 01:36:42,621
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

766
01:36:43,545 --> 01:36:47,504
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

767
01:36:47,633 --> 01:36:49,965
That'll counteract the digitalis.

768
01:36:53,222 --> 01:36:55,053
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

769
01:36:55,182 --> 01:36:58,174
You need to keep your heart going.
Push the red button now, Bond.

770
01:37:04,234 --> 01:37:06,725
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!.

771
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:56,489
-You okay?.
-Me?.

772
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,407
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

773
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:06,295
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.

774
01:38:07,216 --> 01:38:08,706
As soon as I've won this game.

775
01:38:08,926 --> 01:38:11,668
You're not seriously
going back there?

776
01:38:14,181 --> 01:38:16,092
I wouldn't dream of it.

777
01:38:17,769 --> 01:38:19,350
Bet. One million.

778
01:38:23,066 --> 01:38:24,681
-All in.
-Call. All in.

779
01:38:24,859 --> 01:38:27,441
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

780
01:38:29,447 --> 01:38:31,358
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

781
01:38:35,245 --> 01:38:37,782
Queen plays. Wins.

782
01:38:46,257 --> 01:38:47,542
Oh, I'm sorry.

783
01:38:47,675 --> 01:38:50,291
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

784
01:38:51,721 --> 01:38:55,259
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

785
01:38:55,474 --> 01:38:57,305
...which means no more buy-ins.

786
01:38:57,435 --> 01:39:00,677
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

787
01:39:07,737 --> 01:39:08,943
Four players.

788
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,110
It's your bet.

789
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,320
-Monsieur Bond?
-Check.

790
01:39:18,457 --> 01:39:22,325
-Check.
-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

791
01:39:25,214 --> 01:39:27,296
Check. And check.

792
01:39:27,716 --> 01:39:29,331
All check.

793
01:39:29,677 --> 01:39:30,917
Four players.

794
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,340
-Check.
-Check.

795
01:39:43,191 --> 01:39:45,307
All in. Six million.

796
01:39:46,277 --> 01:39:48,859
Bet. Six million. AII in.

797
01:39:54,202 --> 01:39:56,568
Five million. All in.

798
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:59,325
Bet is 6 million.

799
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,205
Raise.

800
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:10,958
Raise.

801
01:40:11,178 --> 01:40:14,466
Twelve million. Heads up.

802
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:48,168
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

803
01:40:50,553 --> 01:40:52,384
Raise. All in.

804
01:41:11,324 --> 01:41:14,942
well, I think I will call you
on that one.

805
01:41:21,752 --> 01:41:22,958
Call.

806
01:41:34,807 --> 01:41:39,096
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

807
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:41,977
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

808
01:41:45,652 --> 01:41:47,608
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

809
01:41:56,121 --> 01:41:59,158
Full house. Eights full of aces.

810
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:19,426
A higher full house.

811
01:42:19,645 --> 01:42:21,135
Aces full of sixes.

812
01:42:27,112 --> 01:42:28,318
Monsieur Bond.

813
01:42:45,339 --> 01:42:47,830
Five and seven of spades.

814
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,506
A straight flush.

815
01:42:49,677 --> 01:42:51,008
Four to the eight.

816
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:53,336
The high hand.

817
01:42:58,019 --> 01:42:59,555
Monsieur Bond wins.

818
01:43:00,563 --> 01:43:02,929
-For you.
-Thank you very much.

819
01:43:05,318 --> 01:43:06,558
Congratulations.

820
01:43:06,736 --> 01:43:10,228
-He's all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.

821
01:43:17,247 --> 01:43:18,362
Congratulations.

822
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:20,531
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

823
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:23,204
You were almost dead an hour ago.

824
01:43:24,046 --> 01:43:27,083
Come on, I'm famished.

825
01:43:37,435 --> 01:43:39,346
Thank you.

826
01:43:46,986 --> 01:43:50,899
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

827
01:43:51,032 --> 01:43:53,694
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

828
01:43:54,369 --> 01:43:56,405
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

829
01:43:57,789 --> 01:43:59,620
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

830
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:03,959
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

831
01:44:06,548 --> 01:44:09,585
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.

832
01:44:10,886 --> 01:44:12,376
But you're laughing at it.

833
01:44:12,722 --> 01:44:16,965
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, that's fine then.

834
01:44:23,316 --> 01:44:24,852
I figured out what that is.

835
01:44:27,278 --> 01:44:29,564
It's an Algerian love knot.

836
01:44:29,781 --> 01:44:32,944
Really?. I thought it was
just something pretty.

837
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:34,775
No, you didn't.

838
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:37,110
Someone gave that to you.

839
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:42,623
He's a very lucky man.

840
01:44:49,093 --> 01:44:51,960
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?.

841
01:44:52,304 --> 01:44:54,545
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

842
01:44:55,099 --> 01:44:58,182
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

843
01:44:59,103 --> 01:45:01,310
I don't believe you.

844
01:45:01,981 --> 01:45:04,097
You've got a choice, you know?.

845
01:45:04,317 --> 01:45:05,932
Just because
you've done something...

846
01:45:06,152 --> 01:45:08,143
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

847
01:45:08,321 --> 01:45:11,358
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?.

848
01:45:11,533 --> 01:45:13,569
You think I can't take
my own advice?.

849
01:45:14,453 --> 01:45:17,115
I think something is driving you.

850
01:45:17,623 --> 01:45:19,705
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

851
01:45:25,631 --> 01:45:27,747
Mathis needs me.

852
01:45:28,384 --> 01:45:29,669
Good night.

853
01:45:29,885 --> 01:45:31,216
Congratoulations again.

854
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:52,355
Mathis.

855
01:47:44,317 --> 01:47:48,230
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

856
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:51,362
...my friend Mathis.

857
01:49:34,098 --> 01:49:36,840
You've taken good care
of your body.

858
01:49:49,322 --> 01:49:51,108
You know...

859
01:49:51,449 --> 01:49:54,612
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

860
01:49:54,786 --> 01:49:56,993
It's the simplest thing...

861
01:49:57,164 --> 01:50:00,782
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

862
01:50:02,252 --> 01:50:03,458
And of course...

863
01:50:03,629 --> 01:50:06,666
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

864
01:50:06,799 --> 01:50:09,506
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

865
01:50:10,136 --> 01:50:13,799
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

866
01:50:19,854 --> 01:50:21,810
The only question remains...

867
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:25,477
...will you yield in time?.

868
01:50:27,529 --> 01:50:30,692
I want the money.

869
01:50:49,385 --> 01:50:52,843
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

870
01:50:53,055 --> 01:50:55,421
So all I need from you
is the password.

871
01:51:05,193 --> 01:51:08,435
The password, please.

872
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:14,945
I've got a little itch...

873
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,031
...down there.

874
01:51:17,789 --> 01:51:19,279
Would you mind?.

875
01:51:26,924 --> 01:51:30,416
No! No! No!.

876
01:51:31,387 --> 01:51:35,096
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

877
01:51:35,224 --> 01:51:37,761
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

878
01:51:39,687 --> 01:51:41,143
Yeah!

879
01:51:42,398 --> 01:51:45,731
Yes, yes, yes.

880
01:51:51,324 --> 01:51:56,819
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

881
01:51:58,081 --> 01:52:00,117
I died?

882
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,615
-I died?.
-Yes.

883
01:52:01,752 --> 01:52:04,789
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

884
01:52:04,922 --> 01:52:06,787
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

885
01:52:07,007 --> 01:52:09,919
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

886
01:52:10,052 --> 01:52:11,417
Because if you kill me...

887
01:52:11,637 --> 01:52:13,719
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

888
01:52:13,889 --> 01:52:16,756
But you are so wrong!

889
01:52:16,934 --> 01:52:19,926
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

890
01:52:20,146 --> 01:52:22,979
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

891
01:52:24,442 --> 01:52:28,105
...because they need what I know.

892
01:52:29,322 --> 01:52:31,404
The big picture.

893
01:52:39,291 --> 01:52:41,532
Give me the password...

894
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:43,746
...and I will at least let her live.

895
01:52:47,299 --> 01:52:50,462
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

896
01:53:03,483 --> 01:53:05,690
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

897
01:53:05,819 --> 01:53:07,650
No.

898
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:11,362
So I think...

899
01:53:15,912 --> 01:53:19,370
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

900
01:53:32,513 --> 01:53:34,799
I'll get the money.

901
01:53:35,683 --> 01:53:38,220
Tell them I'll get the money.

902
01:53:38,352 --> 01:53:42,891
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

903
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:07,913
Francesco.

904
01:54:08,843 --> 01:54:10,754
Francesco.

905
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:25,515
Vesper.

906
01:54:27,362 --> 01:54:29,353
Vesper.

907
01:54:31,408 --> 01:54:33,023
No.

908
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:35,070
Not him.

909
01:54:35,287 --> 01:54:37,243
Not Mathis.

910
01:54:39,082 --> 01:54:40,197
No.

911
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:43,075
I'll get the doctor.

912
01:54:45,839 --> 01:54:47,670
Not him.

913
01:54:49,552 --> 01:54:50,758
Any ideas?.

914
01:54:54,473 --> 01:54:58,341
-What?.
-Why they left the two of you alive.

915
01:55:00,313 --> 01:55:01,723
Where is she?.

916
01:55:02,732 --> 01:55:04,723
Sleeping.

917
01:55:05,276 --> 01:55:08,564
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

918
01:55:09,614 --> 01:55:11,320
It's just odd...

919
01:55:11,449 --> 01:55:15,442
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

920
01:55:15,579 --> 01:55:18,946
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

921
01:55:20,125 --> 01:55:22,241
Get a look at the killer?

922
01:55:22,795 --> 01:55:24,535
No.

923
01:55:25,965 --> 01:55:27,455
Shame.

924
01:55:29,093 --> 01:55:30,879
Drink up.

925
01:55:34,223 --> 01:55:36,464
Anything else you remember?.

926
01:55:36,601 --> 01:55:38,683
Anything that can help us?.

927
01:55:38,853 --> 01:55:40,514
Help us?.

928
01:55:40,688 --> 01:55:42,974
or help you?.

929
01:56:23,316 --> 01:56:26,524
Hello.

930
01:56:28,154 --> 01:56:29,519
You all right?.

931
01:56:30,115 --> 01:56:32,322
I can't resist waking you.

932
01:56:32,492 --> 01:56:37,156
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

933
01:56:38,248 --> 01:56:40,284
It makes me feel reborn.

934
01:56:44,004 --> 01:56:47,167
If you'd just been born...

935
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:50,048
...wouldn't you be naked?.

936
01:56:50,845 --> 01:56:53,052
You have me there.

937
01:56:55,683 --> 01:56:58,425
You can have me anywhere.

938
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,061
I can?

939
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:06,103
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

940
01:57:07,070 --> 01:57:09,982
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?.

941
01:57:10,156 --> 01:57:12,363
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

942
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:14,066
It's just that not so long ago...

943
01:57:14,202 --> 01:57:18,070
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as....

944
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:22,199
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

945
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:25,703
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

946
01:57:26,215 --> 01:57:28,706
That is something to be afraid of.

947
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:35,088
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.

948
01:57:36,517 --> 01:57:39,259
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?.

949
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:41,470
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

950
01:57:41,606 --> 01:57:43,722
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

951
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:46,733
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

952
01:57:46,903 --> 01:57:49,064
I'm afraid not.

953
01:57:50,282 --> 01:57:53,149
If you would type in
the account number.

954
01:58:00,209 --> 01:58:01,619
And now the password.

955
01:58:02,419 --> 01:58:03,579
You can do that.

956
01:58:04,296 --> 01:58:06,287
I would if I knew what it was.

957
01:58:06,924 --> 01:58:13,295
V-E-S-P-E-R.

958
01:58:24,108 --> 01:58:25,939
The funds have been transferred.

959
01:58:26,152 --> 01:58:29,019
Sorry for disturbing you.

960
01:58:30,865 --> 01:58:34,153
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

961
01:58:40,667 --> 01:58:42,077
You know, James...

962
01:58:44,672 --> 01:58:47,630
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

963
01:58:47,758 --> 01:58:51,091
...was your smile
and your little finger...

964
01:58:51,303 --> 01:58:54,090
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

965
01:59:03,399 --> 01:59:07,142
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

966
01:59:09,990 --> 01:59:13,824
-I have no idea.
-But you're aching to find out.

967
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:21,119
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

968
01:59:21,710 --> 01:59:23,917
You've got your armor back on.

969
01:59:24,088 --> 01:59:25,328
That's that.

970
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:29,422
I have no armor left.

971
01:59:30,636 --> 01:59:33,218
You've stripped it from me.

972
01:59:34,056 --> 01:59:36,513
Whatever is left of me....

973
01:59:36,934 --> 01:59:39,846
Whatever is left of me...

974
01:59:40,688 --> 01:59:42,644
...whatever I am...

975
01:59:42,857 --> 01:59:45,348
...I'm yours.

976
02:00:46,757 --> 02:00:49,794
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

977
02:00:50,469 --> 02:00:52,300
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

978
02:00:52,471 --> 02:00:53,756
Mathis?

979
02:00:53,973 --> 02:00:56,009
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?.

980
02:00:56,184 --> 02:00:58,641
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

981
02:00:59,228 --> 02:01:00,764
That's how he wiped me out.

982
02:01:00,980 --> 02:01:04,598
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

983
02:01:04,818 --> 02:01:07,025
I can't believe it.

984
02:01:07,195 --> 02:01:08,856
No, neither could I.

985
02:01:09,322 --> 02:01:11,734
I thought he had my back.

986
02:01:12,325 --> 02:01:14,190
But there you go, lesson learned.

987
02:01:15,537 --> 02:01:17,949
Does everyone have a tell?.

988
02:01:19,833 --> 02:01:21,619
Yes.

989
02:01:24,505 --> 02:01:26,336
Everyone.

990
02:01:26,715 --> 02:01:28,580
Everyone except you.

991
02:01:33,055 --> 02:01:35,091
I wonder if that's why I love you.

992
02:01:37,101 --> 02:01:39,012
You love me?.

993
02:01:39,562 --> 02:01:41,894
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

994
02:01:42,065 --> 02:01:44,306
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

995
02:01:44,859 --> 02:01:49,023
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

996
02:01:49,864 --> 02:01:51,354
You're serious.

997
02:01:52,284 --> 02:01:54,149
Like you said...

998
02:01:54,745 --> 02:01:56,485
...you do what I do for too long...

999
02:01:56,621 --> 02:01:59,454
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

1000
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:02,533
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

1001
02:02:04,505 --> 02:02:06,666
Is that enough for you?.

1002
02:03:50,949 --> 02:03:52,860
-Come on.
-No. No.

1003
02:03:53,368 --> 02:03:56,576
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

1004
02:03:56,788 --> 02:03:58,949
What's the time?.

1005
02:04:01,168 --> 02:04:03,329
How much do we need
to float for a month?.

1006
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:05,501
I've got plenty.

1007
02:04:05,714 --> 02:04:09,627
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

1008
02:04:12,513 --> 02:04:14,970
You stopped wearing the necklace.

1009
02:04:15,099 --> 02:04:18,341
Yeah. It was time.

1010
02:04:18,478 --> 02:04:21,185
Time enough to get over someone?.

1011
02:04:25,985 --> 02:04:29,443
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

1012
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,031
Though apparently not
your employer.

1013
02:04:44,421 --> 02:04:47,663
Back in one month.

1014
02:04:48,676 --> 02:04:51,167
Come on. I'll get the money...

1015
02:04:51,345 --> 02:04:53,552
...you get supplies.

1016
02:05:23,087 --> 02:05:25,624
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

1017
02:05:50,073 --> 02:05:52,564
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.

1018
02:05:52,742 --> 02:05:54,448
Yes?

1019
02:05:54,619 --> 02:05:56,450
We'll talk about that later.

1020
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:59,617
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

1021
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:02,457
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

1022
02:06:06,131 --> 02:06:08,964
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

1023
02:06:09,093 --> 02:06:12,426
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

1024
02:06:12,638 --> 02:06:14,799
So you'll be depositing it today.

1025
02:06:15,099 --> 02:06:17,806
On my way to the bank right now.

1026
02:06:18,186 --> 02:06:20,928
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

1027
02:06:21,314 --> 02:06:22,520
Hello.

1028
02:06:22,649 --> 02:06:26,141
Mr. Mendel?. I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

1029
02:06:26,277 --> 02:06:28,233
It was transferred
to the account number...

1030
02:06:28,446 --> 02:06:30,687
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1031
02:06:33,285 --> 02:06:36,652
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1032
02:06:39,333 --> 02:06:41,244
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.

1033
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,666
St. Mark's Square.

1034
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:46,745
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?.

1035
02:08:59,437 --> 02:09:00,643
I'll kill her!.

1036
02:09:01,606 --> 02:09:02,846
Allow me.

1037
02:13:22,669 --> 02:13:24,705
I'm sorry, James.

1038
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:39,113
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1039
02:16:39,291 --> 02:16:41,407
They were very much in love.

1040
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:44,873
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1041
02:16:45,047 --> 02:16:50,041
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1042
02:16:50,261 --> 02:16:51,626
We should've picked up on it...

1043
02:16:51,804 --> 02:16:54,090
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1044
02:16:54,223 --> 02:16:55,759
...we forget to watch our friends.

1045
02:16:57,435 --> 02:16:59,266
How are you doing?.

1046
02:16:59,687 --> 02:17:01,928
She left her cell phone.

1047
02:17:02,065 --> 02:17:04,431
She must have known I'd check it.

1048
02:17:05,276 --> 02:17:07,437
She knew you were you.

1049
02:17:08,488 --> 02:17:10,774
-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.

1050
02:17:10,907 --> 02:17:12,613
-No?.
-No.

1051
02:17:12,784 --> 02:17:15,241
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1052
02:17:15,454 --> 02:17:17,820
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1053
02:17:18,624 --> 02:17:20,364
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?.

1054
02:17:20,584 --> 02:17:22,199
No.

1055
02:17:22,669 --> 02:17:24,955
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1056
02:17:25,798 --> 02:17:28,005
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1057
02:17:28,676 --> 02:17:29,916
Will do.

1058
02:17:32,138 --> 02:17:33,503
If you do need time....

1059
02:17:33,681 --> 02:17:35,012
Why should I need more time?.

1060
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:39,388
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1061
02:17:40,271 --> 02:17:42,102
James...

1062
02:17:42,732 --> 02:17:46,224
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?.

1063
02:17:46,736 --> 02:17:48,476
Isn't it obvious?

1064
02:17:48,613 --> 02:17:52,652
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1065
02:17:52,784 --> 02:17:55,025
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1066
02:17:56,496 --> 02:17:59,613
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1067
02:18:00,667 --> 02:18:03,625
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1068
02:18:03,837 --> 02:18:06,328
The trail's gone cold.

1069
02:19:33,889 --> 02:19:35,754
-Hello.
-Mr. White?.

1070
02:19:35,975 --> 02:19:37,511
We need to talk.

1071
02:19:37,727 --> 02:19:39,592
Who is this?.

1072
02:20:09,885 --> 02:20:11,876
The name's Bond.

1073
02:20:12,096 --> 02:20:14,007
James Bond.

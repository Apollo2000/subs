328
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:29,916
And that...

329
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,541
that's the only API tower
covering both this and that.

330
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,541
Look, you're like a dog with a bone.
You see it already?

331
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,833
You see what I'm talking about.

332
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,583
That's a serious score.

[Bricke] What are you gonna do
with the cash? You can't spend it.

[man scoffs] You're so American.

335

You know, there are so many other places
in this world you can spend your money.

336
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,875
The border is military protected.

337
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,791
Yeah, but most of the city
belongs to the police.

338
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:04,208
The thing is, on the night of the API,
when they do that whole thing,

339
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,625
the cops, they turn in all their weapons,

340
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:10,875
and then all the policing is done
by one fat, middle-aged...

341
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,000
Wait.
Baby, what the hell is that guy's name?

342
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,041

He's the systems manager at our tower.

It's insane the things guys will do
for a pretty girl.

And we stick this
in the right place at the right time,

350
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:42,458
and we got ourselves...
30 minutes more than the rest of America.

351
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:51,416
Thirty minutes, maybe 35, which is tight,
but just enough time

352
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,791
to get from here to there,
and then we're trillionaires.

Beaten to death by a fucking guard.

I watched it.
I couldn't do anything about it.

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,625
We should do this for Rory.

You should do it for him.

You got 24 hours.

378
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,875
If you look at your packages,

379
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:41,208
you'll see that the President has
authorized a 2% increase off your bases,

380
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,000
which means we're getting close
to 75% salary.

everyone is on full duty

when the API signal goes live.

[governor] Well, look, we realize
that any amnesty program isn't perfect.

But with API,

It's difficult to calibrate.

The signal is practically 100% effective.

Yes, you can damage the brain
enough to break the connection,

except the printer doesn't accept it
as ink,

726
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:31,833

966
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:38,125
You didn't give me shit!
You gave her everything!

967
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,958
Oh, grow up, Kevin!

968
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:41,666
Grow up? Shut the fuck up!

969
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,125
Oh, go to your party!

970
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:45,958
-Go to your party!
-Do you want my tits?

971
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,791
Do you want my shoes?

972
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,833
-You fucking bitch.
-Oh, is that the best you got?

973
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:52,041
-You fucking bitch!
-That the best you got?

974
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,125
-Go back to your party!
-Is this okay with Daddy?

975
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:56,375
-Go back to your party. Go.
-Tell him, Daddy.

976

-I'm his favorite.
-Go. Your heart is black!

977
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:02,083
Your heart is black! You're dead inside!

978
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,291
Nah, you don't-- You know what he says?

979
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:11,041
I get a call,
my father wants to apologize to me.

980
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,541
And you know, I knew it was bullshit,

981
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,958
but I wanted to believe it.
I really did. I wanted to believe it.

982
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:18,166
I wanted to believe
that he was gonna apologize to me.

983
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,666
I don't know why.
I know I'm fucking crazy.

984
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,750
You know what I got?

985
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:23,458
I got that.

986
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,833
Two bullets.

987
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:27,416
That was my fucking birthday present.

988
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,000
You tried to fucking kill me

989
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,916
like you killed my mother.

990
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,291
If you think I'm going to apologize,
you're wrong.

991
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,958
We all use each other.

992
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,666
And we all hate each other.

993
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,083
I'm sorry, Bricke.

I got fucking shot.

999

-Did you kill your father, you asshole?
-Yes, I did.

1000
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:23,041
Get me up. I got a fucking plan!

What's the fucking plan?

Why are you locking the door?

01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,250
[Kevin] Fucking son of a bitch,
you had to shoot me.

1011

All right?

1012
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:02,166
Come on. Where the fuck are they at?

Not my blood. Your boyfriend's.

1041
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,250
I know about the girl.

1042
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,333
I can explain.

1043

What?

1044
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,916
How you sold us out to the FBI?

She's my sister.

There's someone I'd like you to meet.

You're right, Bricke.

1104

I should quit.

1105

Showed me what I was made of.

Congratulations, gentlemen.

You just broke into your own jail cell.

This, in many ways,
was an all too familiar sight

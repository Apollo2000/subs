<i>I can now officially
label this person</i>

175
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,916
as an active serial killer.

176
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,251
The sheriff's office reports
they're likely looking for

177
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,923
<i>a white male in his late
30's to 40's living alone.</i>

178
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,997
I can't believe
something like this.

179
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,942
Why?

180
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,569
Is pretty frikken' big.

181
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,654
It's not that big.

182
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,614
What is it, nine towns?

183
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,281
It's ten towns.

184
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,200
Guys, how are you
not freaking out

185
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:53,285
that something's finally
happening here?

186
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,288
Because there's no way
it's gonna hit us.

187
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,131
There's a serial
killer on the loose.

188
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,135
Incoming titties, 12:00!

189
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,804
Holy shit!

190
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,939
Show her a little respect, ok?

191
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,319
Statistically, that means
she's, like, 78 percent

192
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,281
more likely to engage
in pre-marital sex.

193
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,118
You were thinking it.

194
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,672
Fuck!

195
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,972
What?

196
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,639
I'm-I'm sorry, Nikki, I-what?

197
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,183
Guys!

198
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:58,268
Cut the shit!

199
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,359
Check it out.

200
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,361
Cape May Slayer.

201
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,703
After all this time?

202
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,711
He wasn't counting on us.

203
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,711
Peek-a-boobs!

204
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,799
Get it?

205
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,804
Free porn, bro.

206
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,225
Is he just gonna take that?

207
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,792
Yo, where the hell's Sammy?

208
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,925
They must be home.

209
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,095
Let's go get the little shit.

210
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,327
No movement.

211
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,953
Or lights.

212
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,079
Oh well.

213
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,832
Oh well?

214
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:29,586
What if-

215
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:30,628
Don't even say it.

216
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,796
He's probably up at the
lake or some shit.

217
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,176
Why is their car here?

218
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,555
Who cares?

219
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,851
'Cause of the little prick
so now I can't play manhunt.

220
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,729
Whatever, I'm out.

221
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,108
Yeah, sorry Davey, I got
a book to finish anyway.

222
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,240
Congrats.

223
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,241
You're getting your calcium.

224
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,242
So what?

225
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,036
Mackey is the Cape May Slayer.

226
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,666
I blame myself.

227
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,543
No man, look.

228
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,171
Who's the missing ginger?

229
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:38,922
A few weeks ago.

230
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,083
When we were playing manhunt.

231
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:41,843
So true.

232
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,513
Just tell your parents?

233
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,412
Guys, I was only,
like, ten feet away.

234
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,187
That's him.

235
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,063
Plus, what about the Hoffmans?

236
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,024
Their lake house is only
a couple hours north,

237
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,902
but their car's still here?

238
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,111
So?

239
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,363
What if one Hoffman saw
Mackey with Dusty?

240
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,157
Who?

241
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,157
The missing ginger.

242
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,168
Fine.

243
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,090
Bullshit!

244
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,810
You know, he's also got
a room in his basement.

245
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,104
"Suspect is likely
a white male,"

246
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,483
"late 30's to 40's,
lives alone."

247
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,531
That's why it's so genius.

248
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,116
He knows police tactics.

249
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,083
It's the perfect cover.

250
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,669
Guys, if Mackey is
what I think he is.

251
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,129
Ok, Magnum PI.

252
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,341
What's your plan?

253
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,559
Which means...

254
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,561
Stake-out?

255
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,438
Who's with me?

256
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,774
This is bat shit crazy.

257
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:21,609
I'm in.

258
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,530
Operation Mack
Attack starts now.

259
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,998
Contents unknown.

260
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,421
He gets home from work at
6:25 with that same bag.

261
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,300
He always closes it.

262
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,515
No patter.

263
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,226
A lot.

264
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,939
Plants look like shit.

265
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,535
<i>Loser.</i>

266
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,288
Well, no, because most nights
he goes for a jog at 11:00

267
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,498
for about an hour.

268
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,667
Not sure where he goes.

269
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
They're bears.

270
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,659
I've still gotta see Gremlins.

271
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,635
Shit, Mackey's back!

272
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,611
Let's break into his garage.

273
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,154
No.

274
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,489
He's a cop.

275
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,448
Hey guys.

276
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:35,534
Look, at 11:00 he's
gonna go for a run.

277
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,704
Trust me, I've got a plan.

278
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,755
Guys.

279
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,552
His fucking trash?

280
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
What?

281
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,520
Do you know me at all?

282
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,289
Yeah, we're gonna get
in a lot of trouble

283
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,945
in the last two weeks
because of raccoons.

284
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,407
That's all anyone's gonna think.

285
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,829
I'm gonna be so jealous.

286
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:23,958
You guys are crazy.

287
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,382
You know you can get AIDS from
looking through trash, right?

288
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,217
The only way you're
ever getting AIDS.

289
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,302
I can't believe it.

290
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,305
Nothing.

291
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,227
Somewhere.

292
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,227
A lair?

293
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,653
For instance...

294
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,631
I'll take care of
that responsibility.

295
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,386
Try again tomorrow?

296
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,597
Night one, no luck.

297
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,391
Says you.

298
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,894
Hey, Davey.

299
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,399
Yeah, sure.

300
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,401
We'll make popcorn,
watch Close Encounters.

301
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,320
Awesome.

302
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,946
I'm gonna get my stuff.

303
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,906
I'll be over in a bit.

304
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,607
Come on.

305
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,915
I love you mom.

306
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,494
Expecting someone so late?

307
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,378
Wow.

308
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,590
I guess I haven't
been here in a while.

309
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,800
Uh, yeah.

310
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,678
Yeah, I guess, like a year ago.

311
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,434
Huh.

312
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,979
Better view of my
room than I thought.

313
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:25,199
Wow.

314
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:40,798
Uh, yeah.

315
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:41,798
Yeah.

316
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,232
Davey?

317
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,233
We're back.

318
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,861
Fuck me.

319
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,212
Thanks again for everything, Mrs.
S.

320
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,339
Any time.

321
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,049
Call when you get home so
we know you're safe, ok?

322
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,175
Yeah, it's cool, I will.

323
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,927
See you tomorrow.

324
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:56,725
You're gonna lose him!

325
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,518
Go!

326
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,853
Christ, I'm freaking out, ok?

327
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,101
She's gonna be out for hours.

328
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:07,695
It's gonna be fine.

329
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:08,945
Now, go.

330
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,156
Hurry up.

331
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,741
Keys...

332
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,217
Where were you last night?

333
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,927
I thought you were coming over?

334
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,433
Oh.

335
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,645
Nikki.

336
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,813
No way.

337
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,400
There is a parallel universe
with butt-fucking wookies

338
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,402
I'm serious!

339
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:53,865
She was-she was about to kiss
me when my parents got home.

340
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:54,575
Guys.

341
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,076
Guys, Mackey's coming out.

342
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,997
We are picking up
this convo later.

343
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,583
Yeah, ok.

344
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:15,012
Is that a fuckin' pick axe?

345
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,685
Holy shit.

346
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,909
We gotta keep following him.

347
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,161
Go-

348
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,354
We're gonna lose him.

349
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,356
Shut it, Eats.

350
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,274
Woah!

351
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:10,817
The hell, man?!

352
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,945
Great, now we lost him.

353
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:14,989
Frick this, ok?

354
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:19,159
Guys, relax.

355
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,830
That's where he's going, too.

356
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:41,514
Oh, shit.

357
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,890
Fuck.

358
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,351
Fuuuuck.

359
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,982
It's a cop.

360
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,986
Tell him you forgot it at home.

361
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,237
How am I...

362
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,948
What if it's fucking Mackey?

363
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,556
Oh shit, Officer Cole.

364
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,852
Does your mother know
you stole her car?

365
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,646
No.

366
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:29,967
We, uh, we were
just borrowing it.

367
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,113
I know, I'm so sorry.

368
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,244
I just can't bust you

369
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,079
because 'cause then
how am I gonna look

370
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,997
your mother in the
eye at church?

371
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,170
Mr. Eaton.

372
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,421
What a surprise.

373
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,507
Officer Cole.

374
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,259
We meet again.

375
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Look, guys.

376
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,185
They've been talking about
canceling the Bay Festival.

377
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,066
You got it?

378
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:15,567
Yes sir.

379
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,859
Yes.

380
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,112
Straight home.

381
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,179
Guys, shit.

382
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:49,435
That's what I mean.

383
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,575
We're onto you, Mackey.

384
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:25,053
I thought everything was fine.

385
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:43,113
I just feel like my life
has been one big lie.

386
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,625
Whatever that means.

387
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,176
People will keep stuff
like that private.

388
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:08,180
Are your parents happy?

389
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,984
Bringing you out here for this.

390
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,487
No way, never.

391
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,534
Can I tell you my secret?

392
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,662
Mmmhmm.

393
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:36,123
I think Mackey is the
Cape May Slayer.

394
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,710
Mr. Mackey?

395
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,089
Yeah, that's what he
wants you to think.

396
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,091
They go fishing.

397
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,552
Look, I know how
your brain works.

398
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,720
But you're wrong.

399
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,599
What?

400
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,726
Davey, he's a cop.

401
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,445
Listen to me.

402
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,198
You gotta stop.

403
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,243
I'm not gonna get caught.

404
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:22,211
You're like the only person left
in this town I actually like.

405
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,005
Really?

406
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,508
What about Kyle?

407
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,614
<i>Hey, uh, who wants
a freeing pop?</i>

408
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,329
One for each of
you, there you go.

409
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,373
Enjoy.

410
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,610
Oh!

411
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,367
Give it.

412
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,870
Oh.

413
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,506
Let me try it.

414
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,801
Oh.

415
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:06,565
Well, we hung out
again last night.

416
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,484
Oooh, Davey.

417
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:08,567
No way.

418
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,737
We have, like-no, we have,
like, a connection.

419
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,531
A connection?

420
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,324
Any connection I want
with her is vaginal.

421
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,159
Oral if she's into it.

422
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,246
Don't talk about her like that.

423
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,251
Mackey's still out there.

424
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:29,255
Look, Davey, <i>we've</i>
been on him for weeks.

425
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:30,776
I mean, if he was
gonna give us a clue.

426
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,034
What?

427
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,623
We gotta go in.

428
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,337
That's not totally true.

429
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,300
A whole family at Pacific Grove.

430
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:17,553
Fuck that.

431
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,555
I mean, you wanna go
in there, be my guest.

432
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,725
Dumbasses first.

433
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,999
You guys smell that?

434
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yeah.

435
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,757
I'm totally gonna
shit my Calvins.

436
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,718
Oh...

437
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,196
You guys still think I'm crazy?

438
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,758
Guys, shut up!

439
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,759
Ok?

440
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,657
Motherfuckers!

441
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:06,871
With the lights off?

442
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:08,999
I blew a fuse vacuuming
up this mess.

443
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,975
Why are you cleaning
up after their cats?

444
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,299
It's easy money, usually.

445
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
You wanna explain to me.

446
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:27,392
Um... well, Sammy was
missing so we thought.

447
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,106
You thought it was Mr. Mackey.

448
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,900
Seriously?

449
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:40,362
Wait, you were really
talking to her?

450
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,948
Ok, what's going on here?

451
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,327
You guys hooking up?

452
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:51,791
Let's just say he's more of
a man than you jerk-offs.

453
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,922
Oooh!

454
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,843
<i>Oh, man.</i>

455
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,347
<i>Can I get a picture
of you for my shrine?</i>

456
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:09,601
<i>I mean it.</i>

457
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:11,436
I know, mom.

458
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,158
Hey guys, what time are we
playing manhunt tonight?

459
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,128
Alright, here's the plan.

460
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,089
No way, you still have those?

461
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,967
While you guys are spying
we're gonna plant.

462
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:45,512
We can use the other
one to listen.

463
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,596
Smart.

464
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:48,764
Let's just not get caught, ok?

465
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:53,060
If Mackey spots you just act
like it's part of the game.

466
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,353
Now, we probably have
like two minutes

467
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,981
'til those little shits are
up our asses with flashlights

468
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,191
so let's be quick, ok?

469
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,989
Operation Manhunt starts now.

470
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,741
Let's go.

471
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:12,788
Hurry up!

472
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,749
Come on.

473
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,803
Who's got eyes on him?

474
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:28,722
I got him.

475
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:29,556
He's in the living room.

476
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,473
Over.

477
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:32,017
Let's go.

478
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:52,871
Whatever, pussy.

479
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:53,912
You two are out.

480
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,665
Ha!

481
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,792
I've got him.

482
00:47:58,793 --> 00:47:59,918
Holy fuck.

483
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,239
Guys, he's wearing
rubber gloves.

484
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,051
What?

485
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,263
What's in the bucket?

486
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:14,142
It looks like bleach,
a scrubbing brush,

487
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,399
What? Are you sure?

488
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,780
It's on his shirt.

489
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:28,822
Shit.

490
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,992
He went into the basement.

491
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:37,874
What the hell?

492
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,753
Mackey's M.I.A.

493
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:50,220
Alright, stay here.

494
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:52,055
Watch ok?

495
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,058
Shit!

496
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,984
Do you think he's onto us?

497
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:09,656
As far as he knows we were
just playing manhunt.

498
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,082
Those things were junk.

499
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,169
No way.

500
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,922
I gotta make it work.

501
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:51,864
Davey.

502
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:52,991
Hey.

503
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,787
Uh, yeah, yeah, we were
um, sorry about that.

504
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,999
Just... we were just
playing manhunt.

505
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,419
No, I get it.

506
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,387
So what's up?

507
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,640
Wait, let me guess.

508
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,017
I owe you money.

509
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,269
Uh, yeah.

510
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,189
Come on back.

511
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:44,751
There you go.

512
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:46,168
Thanks.

513
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,712
Hey, you uh... you're not using
those things for manhunt,

514
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:49,796
are you?

515
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,117
I mean, if you
want real walkies.

516
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,262
They pick up everything.

517
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,014
I- I can't right now.

518
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,432
Gotta get back to my route.

519
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,309
Alright.

520
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,227
Thanks for the offer.

521
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:04,187
Yep.

522
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,985
Uh, sorry.

523
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,905
Um, I guess they are
pretty crappy, huh?

524
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,909
Just come on by any time.

525
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,307
Oh, shit!

526
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,446
Oh, fuck.

527
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,366
Fuck.

528
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:02,327
Guys, guys, come in.

529
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,247
I'm freaking the fuck out.

530
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,167
<i>You're gonna wake up my</i> mom.

531
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:13,005
I'm serious!

532
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:16,884
Emergency meeting,
treehouse, now.

533
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,311
There's no way he knows
why we're spying on him.

534
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,542
What if Mackey catches us?

535
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,544
That's not gonna happen.

536
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:01,721
Raccoons.

537
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:03,472
Just like the garbage
in the street.

538
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,350
Just wait for him to leave.

539
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:10,188
It's... it's foolproof.

540
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,208
We gotta get closer.

541
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,252
We?

542
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,546
I'm not going by myself.

543
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,590
What are you, chicken?

544
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,385
Oh, nice try.

545
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:45,139
We have that you stole?

546
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:07,120
Noah?

547
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:14,544
Oh...

548
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,823
Hello?

549
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,325
Someone there?

550
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:18,273
That was way to friggen' close.

551
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:19,150
Shit!

552
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:21,819
What if he's going to his house?

553
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,991
<i>I repeat, we lost Mackey.</i>

554
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,994
<i>Do you copy?</i>

555
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:32,288
Fuck, Davey.

556
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,207
There's nothing here.

557
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,381
What?

558
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,476
I can't see anything.

559
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,319
I got this.

560
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,590
It's easy.

561
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,394
Unless he's killing
people with his lawnmower

562
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:41,315
we got jack shit.

563
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:05,088
Well, this whole night's
been a waste of time.

564
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,799
Until now.

565
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,593
This is Dusty Dewitt's shirt.

566
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:10,428
Who?

567
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,263
Oh, the ginger?

568
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:14,432
Shit.

569
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:22,273
Us?

570
00:57:22,274 --> 00:57:23,274
We've been trying to
call you on the CB

571
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:25,233
for like 10 minutes.

572
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:26,234
We lost him.

573
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,367
Neither are you guys.

574
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,579
Come on.

575
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,540
He keeps a car in
a storage unit?

576
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,797
It's the same reason he's
got Dusty Dewitt's shirt.

577
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,723
Noah was on the bag.

578
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:57,350
Noah?

579
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:58,434
What the hell's that?

580
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,244
What?

581
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,081
This look right?

582
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,249
Yeah, that's the same thing.

583
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,796
No, what you wrote means
absolutely nothing.

584
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:34,844
Shove it, Eats.

585
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:35,845
Stop.

586
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:55,825
Holy shit.

587
00:58:55,826 --> 00:58:57,493
Guys, look at this.

588
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,341
This sicko's using this stuff
to cover up the smell.

589
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:27,106
It's time to tell my parents.

590
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:40,744
Mackey.

591
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:43,580
He's a cop, for Christ's sake.

592
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,581
He's been our neighbour
since before you were born.

593
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,545
That milk carton.

594
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:02,349
Jesus, you have
been spying on him?

595
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,564
He goes jogging at
11:00 at night.

596
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:13,486
He keeps a spare car
in a storage unit.

597
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:17,655
But I'm-

598
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,373
I mean, it's unacceptable, boys.

599
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,374
We're trying to save people.

600
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,169
Yeah, well, you're not.

601
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,716
Alright, we're gonna go
over there right now.

602
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,601
Let's go.

603
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,614
Guys, what's going on?

604
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,408
Hey there, Wayne.

605
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,833
As you are about to be.

606
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:12,795
I'm sure whatever it
is we can work it out.

607
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,803
Um... hey, Mr. Mackey.

608
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:34,525
It was us.

609
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,945
Tell him why.

610
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:49,623
A few weeks ago I thought I
saw this boy in your house.

611
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:01,385
You were maybe the
Cape May Slayer.

612
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,598
Oh.

613
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,809
Well.

614
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,020
Uh...

615
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,360
I'm sorry, it's just the
uh, guys at the station

616
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,905
are gonna love this.

617
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:25,909
So who was the boy
that was here?

618
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,494
That was my nephew, Jamie.

619
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,090
I'm sorry.

620
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:41,217
No, no, it's fine.

621
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,387
We can clear this up right now.

622
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,140
That is not necessary at all.

623
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,854
No matter how long it takes.

624
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,648
Right?

625
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:59,859
Yes, sir.

626
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,779
Look, I appreciate the
apology but honestly,

627
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,742
I remember what it was like
to be a boy in the summer.

628
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:11,580
You are a better man than
me, Wayne, thank you.

629
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,419
Are you high?

630
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:28,429
But this is way too heavy.

631
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,974
I'm out.

632
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:33,727
Guys, go home.

633
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,441
Go-

634
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:42,194
Not you.

635
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,079
Until I say so.

636
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:20,815
Hello?

637
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:23,277
Can you come over?

638
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,200
It's so surreal.

639
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,585
Look at this one.

640
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:43,254
Can't we just burn it?

641
01:04:43,255 --> 01:04:44,214
What?

642
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,132
No way.

643
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:47,843
It's a classic.

644
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:57,519
It's wigging me out.

645
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:11,742
Hey, you're not alone.

646
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,041
I'm sorry.

647
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,086
You wanna leave?

648
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:25,963
Holy shit.

649
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:28,758
You got caught.

650
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,719
Davey!

651
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,988
I just snuck out.

652
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,200
Just a rebel without a cause.

653
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,121
Right?

654
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,752
I know I'm right about him.

655
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,754
That's the shittiest part.

656
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,841
Just let it go.

657
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,886
Believe me, I know.

658
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,015
So enjoy it while you can.

659
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:23,897
But if I'm right,
who's gonna stop him?

660
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:45,294
Davey.

661
01:06:45,295 --> 01:06:49,131
How's it going?

662
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:58,848
We can talk about it?

663
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,394
Ok.

664
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:04,896
Hey, you know that
we've got everyone

665
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:07,733
that we have looking
for this sicko, right?

666
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,194
Well, these things take time.

667
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:13,363
Sometimes years.

668
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,745
I see the paper before
anyone, remember?

669
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:21,746
You sure?

670
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,707
I can tell you have an
interest in this stuff.

671
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,793
Was there anything
else, Mr. Mackey?

672
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,964
Wow, you uh, you really
got it in for me, huh?

673
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,051
Uh... Davey, I like you.

674
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,013
Between us.

675
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,724
Yeah, me too.

676
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,774
You want me to talk to them?

677
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,095
See if I can lighten
the sentence?

678
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:53,819
No, it's... it's alright.

679
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,198
Thanks, though.

680
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,701
You've got quite
the imagination.

681
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,247
Yeah, I guess.

682
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,753
I get it.

683
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,964
That's the whole
reason I became a cop.

684
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,800
It's exciting, the
stuff that's going on.

685
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,202
Absolutely.

686
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,003
Just wait here a sec.

687
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,343
Shit!

688
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,430
Shit.

689
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,692
Place looks great.

690
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,118
My sister's in Seattle.

691
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:33,044
Hmm.

692
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:35,963
Not answering.

693
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:36,840
Jamie's big into baseball.

694
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:39,843
He might be at
practice or something.

695
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,264
Well, maybe I'll come back
later, we can try him again.

696
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:46,016
Uh, no.

697
01:09:46,017 --> 01:09:47,893
It's ok.

698
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,907
I'm gonna see if I can get
you outta this house.

699
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,827
Listen, Davey.

700
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,207
I promise.

701
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,596
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?

702
01:10:58,213 --> 01:10:59,839
There's no Jamie.

703
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,966
This proves he's guilty.

704
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,634
In the basement.

705
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:04,845
Are you crazy?

706
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:09,266
<i>Davey?</i>

707
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:12,394
Shit.

708
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:21,027
I want you to see this.

709
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:27,033
<i>The Cape May Slayer.</i>

710
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,309
<i>We are happy to
report that we have.</i>

711
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:35,959
<i>Thanks to the fine efforts of
the Ipswich Police Department,</i>

712
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:46,510
<i>No, I think it's perfect.</i>

713
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:47,929
<i>Wayne Mackey.</i>

714
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,310
I know that this is uh,
it's been a trying time

715
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,646
for our community but uh, we
hope that this announcement

716
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,648
<i>can bring a little peace</i>

717
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,026
<i>to those who have
been living in fear.</i>

718
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,653
<i>I'll be there in a few. Bye.</i>

719
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,576
<i>The Bay Festival's back on,</i>

720
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:12,662
So while we're all celebrating

721
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:15,247
I want you to think
about your actions.

722
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,626
It turns out the man across
the street is not a killer,

723
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:21,630
He's a hero.

724
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,301
A hero.

725
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,013
He's clearly guilty.

726
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,434
It can't be him.

727
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,483
To then catch the killer?

728
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,321
I'm not wrong.

729
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,699
In his basement.

730
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,328
Listen, Davey.

731
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:56,247
Even if you were to
hypothetically get

732
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:57,332
into his basement,

733
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,294
without him knowing
that it's you.

734
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,433
I know you guys all
think I'm crazy,

735
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,435
but I'm gonna prove it to you.

736
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:21,439
Look, I'll take
all the risk, ok?

737
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,280
No.

738
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,535
No.

739
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,776
Because everyone's gonna be
at the Bay Festival tomorrow.

740
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,058
You know that my parents
take me every year

741
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,100
his house.

742
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,768
With multiple layers of
protection there's no way

743
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:03,314
I get caught.

744
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:06,442
Are you with me?

745
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,486
Whatever. Fine.

746
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,617
Yeah.

747
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:19,164
This is your last shot, Davey.

748
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:28,506
I guess I'm in, too.

749
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:41,603
This is so not fair.

750
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:44,522
Punishment's a punishment, pal.

751
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:12,257
Alright guys, it's go time.

752
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:19,224
J”

753
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,208
I got eyes on him.

754
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,211
Over.

755
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,047
<i>How're you looking, Eats?</i>

756
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:12,484
What? Can't take a
little family time?

757
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,362
Fuck off, Kyle.

758
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,322
<i>Eats.</i>

759
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:22,328
<i>Are you in position?</i>

760
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:44,476
Ok.

761
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:49,355
This, too.

762
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,157
Come on.

763
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:15,964
Yeah.

764
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,591
Here.

765
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:19,760
If you see anything,
make some noise.

766
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,345
Alright?

767
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:21,971
Move over.

768
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:23,389
What for?

769
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:25,934
A serial killer's house alone.

770
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:29,604
Ok.

771
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,440
Yeah. I think so.

772
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,901
Alright, let's go.

773
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,529
I owe you one.

774
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,696
Let's just make this quick, ok?

775
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,282
Ok.

776
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,376
Because it's so easy.

777
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:59,551
Yeah, but if you're right,
who else is gonna stop him?

778
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:46,055
Oh, come on.

779
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:50,894
Is he on his way back?

780
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:52,520
<i>You were wrong.</i>

781
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:53,801
<i>You were wrong about everything.</i>

782
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:55,815
It was all for a project.

783
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,695
<i>Listen to me.</i>

784
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:03,031
<i>It's over.</i>

785
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,867
<i>But you're on your own.</i>

786
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:08,369
Maybe he's right.

787
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,668
We might as well
just check it out.

788
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,755
It's him.

789
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:23,676
Look, Eats is still in
position so we're safe.

790
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,807
I know it.

791
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,935
Ok, come on.

792
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,398
Creepiest basement ever.

793
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:29,534
Jesus fuck!

794
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:30,534
Oh, jeez.

795
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:33,578
It's just a light.

796
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,540
Are you ok?

797
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,501
Ok.

798
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,889
Take a chill pill!

799
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,102
Shine the flashlight
on the lock.

800
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,365
Shit.

801
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:26,674
Vagina!

802
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:31,803
The whole thing's off.

803
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,264
Mackey's clean, 100 percent.

804
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,017
It's a long story.

805
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:38,143
Just trust me.

806
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:39,269
It's not him.

807
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,021
Fuck that.

808
01:21:40,022 --> 01:21:41,564
I gotta hear this.

809
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:46,861
Parents again?

810
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:56,412
Yeah.

811
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,854
What the hell is this place?

812
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:26,984
You think he... keeps his
victims here or something?

813
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,283
Guys.

814
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:42,874
“To Wayne. Keep it up, slugger.
1958.”

815
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,128
Holy shit, was this his room?

816
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:52,718
I mean, these houses weren't
even built back then.

817
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:02,019
Where is it?

818
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:11,945
No, no, no, no.

819
01:23:11,946 --> 01:23:14,490
Davey, no, no.

820
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:18,743
Just make sure you're filming.

821
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,705
No, Davey, wait.

822
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:52,862
Is this enough proof for you?

823
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:55,781
Now.

824
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:57,199
Come on.

825
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,743
Wait, what's that?

826
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,838
Help...

827
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:15,801
Come on, guys.

828
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:16,219
Come on.

829
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:16,802
Are you ok?

830
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,220
Watch out, watch out.

831
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:19,679
Let's go.

832
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,182
Come on.

833
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:23,351
Davey, let's go!

834
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:23,976
Davey, come on!

835
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:25,852
We gotta get out of here!

836
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:27,437
Davey!

837
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:28,688
What are you looking at?

838
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:29,440
Holy shit!

839
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:31,234
Davey! Davey!

840
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,947
Guys, the people in the
pictures aren't his family.

841
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,034
They're his victims.

842
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,078
What?

843
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,250
I'm next.

844
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:54,048
Is this enough proof for you?

845
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:56,968
Now.

846
01:24:56,969 --> 01:24:58,678
Come on.

847
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,444
All over the freakin' walls!

848
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,239
Get out to Mackey's.

849
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,118
Bring that sick son
of a bitch to me.

850
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:24,745
Let's go.

851
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,876
That boy's alive
because of your son.

852
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:33,879
He's a hero.

853
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,232
You ok?

854
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,068
Uh, yeah.

855
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,739
My parents are giving
a report, I guess.

856
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:03,117
Hmm.

857
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,920
For the first time
in a while, so...

858
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,506
Well, that's awesome, right?

859
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,219
Because of you.

860
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,894
See ya, Davey.

861
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:05,471
I love you, pal.

862
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,374
Davey's got the sleeping
bag all set up for you.

863
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,961
She will pick you up.

864
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:42,925
You guys are safe now.

865
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,184
Well, the <i>APB'S</i>
been out for hours.

866
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,436
They'll get him.

867
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:57,148
It's just a matter of time.

868
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,485
We love you.

869
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,572
You boys are gonna be
the talk of the town.

870
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:10,035
Nothing's ever gonna
be the same again.

871
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,877
Alright, get some rest, you two.

872
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:22,214
'Night.

873
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,473
You think they'll catch him?

874
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:36,937
It's over. We got him.

875
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:18,766
Get up!

876
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:21,560
I'll untie you.

877
01:31:32,363 --> 01:31:34,615
It's Mackey!

878
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,618
I can't see shit!

879
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,245
What the fuck was that?!

880
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:45,708
We gotta get outta here!

881
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:46,543
No, no, no, no!

882
01:31:46,544 --> 01:31:49,253
Yes, we have to!

883
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:52,424
Wait-he's-he's out there.

884
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,015
Where is he?

885
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:13,070
<i>So I got a surprise for you.</i>

886
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:16,447
<i>We're gonna play manhunt.</i>

887
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,909
<i>Only now we are gonna
play it for real!</i>

888
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,412
It's ok. He can't catch
us if we keep moving.

889
01:32:22,413 --> 01:32:23,372
Alright?

890
01:32:23,373 --> 01:32:25,374
We gotta go. Let's go.

891
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:44,225
What-what the hell?

892
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:44,852
Shit!

893
01:32:44,853 --> 01:32:46,437
Come on.

894
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:03,370
It has to be.

895
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,370
Fuck.

896
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:06,430
If we-if we just keep
going, eventually-

897
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,083
Come on.

898
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:22,346
It's ok, it's ok.

899
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,347
It's ok.

900
01:33:38,822 --> 01:33:40,616
<i>I know you're close!</i>

901
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,577
We gotta get to the cruiser.

902
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:52,377
I got you into this mess, I'm
gonna get you out of it.

903
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:55,546
No, no, no!

904
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,987
I'm gonna get his attention so
you can get to the cruiser, ok?

905
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:00,343
No! No, I can't-

906
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:02,303
Hey, Wayne! Fuck you!

907
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:04,765
I am over here, you
fucking loser!

908
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,626
Stay the fuck there.

909
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:35,337
He's coming!

910
01:34:39,383 --> 01:34:40,884
Run!

911
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:55,983
Davey! Davey!

912
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:59,486
No! No!

913
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:55,042
You brought this on yourself.

914
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,091
I'm sorry.

915
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:11,600
You stole my life!

916
01:36:24,071 --> 01:36:27,949
That's not enough for you.

917
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:35,623
You have spent so much
time thinking about me.

918
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:41,546
I want you to keep
thinking about me.

919
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:50,847
When I come back for you.

920
01:40:08,295 --> 01:40:09,920
<i>But the truth is</i>

921
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:13,175
<i>the suburbs are where the
craziest shit happens.</i>

922
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:02,890
<i>Tough pill to swallow, I know.</i>

923
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:05,268
<i>But it's true.</i>

923
01:41:06,305 --> 01:42:06,481

and Princess of Wales.</i>

8
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:28,656
David, look at me.

9
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,051
Oi! You missed one, Pakkie!

10
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,119
I'm not from Pakistan.

11
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,374
Dinner is ready.

12
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,643
I'm not hungry, Mum.

13
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,080
Hmm, where are you going?

14
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,782
- Out with friends.
- A girl?

15
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,484
- Oh, Mum.
- Look at you.

16
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,955
Give your mother
a kiss.

17
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:46,157
I'm going to be late.

18
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,559
You're always late.

19
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,964
Hi, Papa.
How was work?

20
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,431
Out again, Farrokh?

21
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,200
It's Freddie now, Papa.

22
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,003
Freddie or Farrokh...

23
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,071
what difference does it make
when you're out every night...

24
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,008
no thought of the future
in your head?

25
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,010
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

26
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:08,112
That's what
you should aspire to.

27
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,047
Yes.

28
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,318
And how's that
worked out for you?

29
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,342
Yeah, they're better
than last week.

30
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:39,378
- They're a cool band.
- Yeah, not bad.

31
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,380
Yeah.

32
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:49,321
What can I get for you?

33
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:50,323
Pint of lager.

34
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,996
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

35
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,936
See you, mate.

36
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,102
Humpy Bong?

37
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:39,171
Humpy Bong.

38
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,039
They're going places.
They're gonna be big.

39
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,243
Humpy Bong?
Are you joking?

40
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:44,409
Don't do it, Tim.

41
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,544
No, I'm sorry, guys,
but...

42
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:47,212
we're not going anywhere
with this.

43
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:49,884
What? College gigs, pubs?

44
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,053
Gotta give it a go.

45
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:58,924
So I just said to him,
"No, you can't do that."

46
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:00,928
You literally
can't hear anything.

47
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,128
It's a bit silly.

48
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,034
But then everyone else was
in, like, long dresses?

49
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:09,135
How bizarre.

50
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,741
You all right?

51
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:19,977
Sorry. Oh, I was just
looking for the band.

52
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,881
They're usually out back.

53
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:31,291
I like your coat.

54
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:36,363
It's from Biba.

55
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,066
She works there.

56
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,902
Thank you.

57
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:47,705
I think he's right.

58
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:48,974
That show
was a load of bollocks.

59
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,510
Well, there was room
for improvement, yeah.

60
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,845
I've got better things to do
with my Saturday nights.

61
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,316
I could give you
their names.

62
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,852
I enjoyed the show.

63
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,390
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

64
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,761
I've been following you
for a while, actually.

65
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,960
Smile.

66
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:12,631
Makes sense
for a dental student.

67
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,032
And you're astrophysics,
aren't you?

68
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:18,001
- Yeah.
- Makes you the clever one.

69
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:19,638
Yeah, I suppose
it does, yeah.

70
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,037
I study design here.

71
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,439
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

72
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:25,744
Also, um, I write songs.

73
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,179
Might be
of interest to you.

74
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:30,482
It's just a bit of fun,
really.

75
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:32,450
Well, you're
five minutes too late.

76
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,221
Our lead singer
just quit.

77
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,224
Well, then you'll need
someone new.

78
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,261
Any ideas?

79
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,098
What about me?

80
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,800
Uh, not with those teeth,
mate.

81

85
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:21,800
I was born with
four additional incisors.

86
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:24,701
More space in my mouth
means more range.

87
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:26,906
I'll consider your offer.

88
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:33,446
Uh, do you play bass?

89
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,082
Nope.

90
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,132
Excuse me. Thanks.

91
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,700
So, you found me, then.

92
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:58,536
- How can I help you?
- Oh.

93
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,338
Um, I rather liked these.

94
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,541
Do you think
you have them in my size?

95
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,578
This is the ladies' section,
so I'm not exactly sure.

96
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,183
There wasn't a sign
or anything.

97
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:13,052
I don't think it should
really matter, do you?

98
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,195
I thought
you might like this.

99
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,029
Are you even allowed
to be in here?

100
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,232
No, not really.

101
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:33,640
One more thing.

102
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,110
May I?

103
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:49,323
You have such
an exotic look.

104
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:52,293
I love your style.

105
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,695
I think we should all
take more risks.

106
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:12,011
What do you think?

107
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:18,718
Oh, cheers.
Thank you.

108

You're late.

139
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,702
This is bollocks!

140
00:13:55,808 --> 00:13:59,009

Oh, is it?
Thank you, Brian.

142
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:02,412
Would you like to do it?
Please, feel free.

143
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:03,715
No, no, no.
Doing a good job.

144
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,683
We sold out every pub and uni
south of Glasgow...

145
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:08,753
and I'm stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

146
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,854
eating a ham sandwich!

147
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:12,356
Trouble is, we're just not
thinking big enough.

148
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:13,925
What have you
got in mind, Fred?

149
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:14,992
An album.

150
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,960
We can't afford an album.

151
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,664
Oh, we'll find a way.

152
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,469
How much do you think
we can get for this van?

153
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,139
I hope you're joking.

154
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:29,807
That's three months' wages.

155
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,075
And a perfectly good van.

156
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,710
Don't be so dramatic,
darling.

157
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:35,816
You're recording
an album tonight. Let's go!

158
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,055
Don't you think
I sound like shit?

159
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,288
No, it's good.

160
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,460
- Can we try it again?
- Sure, yeah.

161
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:49,428
Sure, it's your money.

162
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,027
Literally.

163
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:02,138
Sounds a lot better.

164
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,709
We need to
get experimental.

165
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:08,281
Try bouncing us left and right
for the ah-ah-ahs.

166
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,021
Now dead center for the last.

167
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:18,556
And then blast it!

168
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:19,623
Yes!

169
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:27,433
That's good, right?

170
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,369
Do we have time
to stack a few more?

171
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,308
The studio opens at 8:00,
so we got 30 more minutes.

172
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:41,714
Hmm.

173
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:46,853
- That sounds good, right?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,595
Oi, RT, who are these kids
in the box?

175
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:01,565
A student band
doing some weird stuff.

176
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,066
How about demos?
You got some?

177
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,704
Been up all night,
mate.

178
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,548
So the new name is Queen?

179
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,215
As in "Her Royal Highness."

180
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:20,918
And because
it's outrageous...

181
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,956
and I can't think of anyone
more outrageous than me.

182
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:34,433
This is the most
impractical bed.

183
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:47,313
That's beautiful.

184
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,994
Think it has potential.

185
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,304
- I have to go to work.
- I simply won't allow it.

186
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:16,309
You're going to support me
if I get fired?

187
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:19,577
I'll always
look after you.

188
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,111
I'm going to...

189
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:22,716
I'm going to be late.

190
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,429
How beautiful you are.

191
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,571
When I was a little girl...

192
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:51,376
I used to run around the house
and hide and...

193
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,579
he couldn't find me.

194
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,415
Clever girl.

195
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,182
Please tell your father
it's nice to meet him.

196
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,384
I have.

197
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:02,086
Then thank him
for the lovely birthday cake.

198
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,888
I have.

199
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,093
Then tell him his daughter's
an epic shag.

200
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,496
Freddie,
he can read lips.

201
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,830
Mary...

202
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,532
I can't tell you how long
I have waited for Farrokh...

203
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,301
to bring home
a nice girl like you.

204
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,503
Farrokh?

205
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,038
Did Farrokh not tell you
he was born in Zanzibar?

206
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,307
- No, he did not.
- I used to know a girl

207
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,675
- who was Zanzibari.
- One minute.

208
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,609
I thought Freddie
was born in London.

209
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,147
- Oh, he was. At the age of 18.
- Shut up.

210
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,982
Our family is
Indian Parsee.

211
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,750
- Mum. Mum, Mum.
- Mary...

212
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,084
- Mum.
- Mum, please...

213
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,351
Here. Have a look at these.

214
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,721
- Yes. Yeah.
- Please! Please.

215
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,483
- No stopping.
- We need to see those.

216
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,323
A thousand years ago,

217
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,792
the Parsees fled to India
from Persia...

218
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,427
to escape Muslim persecution.

219
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,629
Really?
That's terrible.

220
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,165
So why did you
leave Zanzibar?

221
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,367
We didn't leave.

222
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,734
He's so small.

223
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,636
We were chased out with just
the clothes on our backs.

224
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,671
He was quite a good boxer,
actually.

225
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,242
He had to be.

226
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,341
His opponents
went for his teeth

227
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,642
always trying to
punch them in.

228
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,745
Certainly a target.

229
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:04,448
So how old is he
in this photo?

230
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,616
I think three
or four years old.

231
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,617
Really?
Boxing already at that age?

232
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,885
So good.

233
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:11,624
Mercury?

234
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:13,459
No looking back.

235
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,092
Only forward.

236
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,226
So now the family name's
not good enough for you?

237
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:18,996
It's just a stage name.

238
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,967
No, it's not.

239
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,501
I changed it legally.

240
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:25,705
Got a new passport
and everything.

241
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,205
Kash, how old are you here?

242
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,440
I don't know.

243
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,809
It was before Freddie went off
to boarding school.

244
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:34,579
I sent Farrokh away to make
a good Parsee boy of him.

245
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,080
He was too wild and unruly.

246
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,380
But what good did it do?

247
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:40,384
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

248
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:43,853
You can't get anywhere

249
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:45,188
pretending to be
someone you're not.

250
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,826
Who'd like some cake?

251
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,426
Cake is always good.

252
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:50,494
Hello?

253
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:51,995
Just a moment.

254
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:52,998
Freddie Mercury.

255
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:54,965
Phone call.

256
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,667
Quite like
the sound of that.

257
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,736
Freddie tells me that you're
some sort of a scientist.

258
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,539
- Astrophysics, actually.
- Oh.

259
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,807
Yeah, my father would've
preferred it if I continued.

260
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,073
- When?
- That's very clever.

261
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,209
- He's a dentist.
- I was never a dentist.

262
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,278
That's a picture
I want to see.

263
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,482
He's a dentist.

264
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,914
I see.

265
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,382
That's also quite clever,
actually.

266
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:13,751
Kash...

267
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,285
what are you doing later?

268
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,520
Homework.

269
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:21,359
Just making conversation.

270
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,493
What kind of music

271
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:23,860
was he listening to
back in those days?

272
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:26,600
Uh, he was listening to
Little Richard.

273
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,333
- Very good.
- Richard, yeah.

274
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,301
And his first band...

275
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:33,607
I have an announcement.

276
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,275
One of the A&R men...

277
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,645
from EMI saw us recording.

278
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,617
Gave our demo
to John Reid.

279
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,449
He looks after Elton John.

280
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:47,650
Oh, my God.

281
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:48,854
Mr. Reid wants to meet us...

282
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:51,621
and possibly, even manage us.

283
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,189
- Shut up.
- You're joking!

284
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,194
Oh, my God!

285
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,702
You're sure
he said 12 o'clock?

286
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,536
Yes. "Midday at
the pub, don't be drunk."

287
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:07,603
That's what he said.

288
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:08,671
You look
a bit nervous, Brian.

289
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:09,740
John, I'm fine.

290
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:10,874
You're usually
so particular.

291
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:11,943
You just gotta be cool.

292
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,977
- Wow!
- Wanker.

293
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:15,846
I didn't know
it was fancy dress, Fred.

294
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,648
I've gotta make
an impression, darling.

295
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,250
You look like
an angry lizard.

296
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:22,619
- It's your best work.
- Very subtle.

297
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:23,890
You gonna fly away?

298
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:27,561
Can I borrow it
for Sunday church?

299
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:38,903
So, this is Queen.

300
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:42,272
And you must be
Freddie Mercury.

301
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,573
You've got a gift.

302
00:21:43,575 --> 00:21:45,310
You all have.

303
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:46,409
So tell me...

304
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:47,611
what makes Queen
any different

305
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:50,717
from all the other
wannabe rock stars I meet?

306
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:54,284
I'll tell you what it is.

307
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,753
We're four misfits
who don't belong together,

308
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,589
playing to the other misfits.

309
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,890
The outcasts right at the back
of the room...

310
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:03,196
who are pretty sure
they don't belong either.

311
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,231
We belong to them.

312
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,632
We're a family.

313
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:10,202
But no two of us
are the same.

314
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,270
Paul.

315
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:14,671
Paul Prenter...

316
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:17,041
meet Queen...

317
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,242
our new signing.

318
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:20,511
Paul will be looking after
your day-to-day.

319
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:21,579
Pleasure.

320
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:22,812
If I can get you
on the radio...

321
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,715
maybe I can get you
on television.

322
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,917
- <i>Top of the Pops?</i>
- Hopefully.

323
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:27,984
And then?

324
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:28,852
And then...

325
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:29,919
it's only the biggest

326
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,022
television program
in the country.

327
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:32,656
No one's ever even
heard of you.

328
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,625
Look, I admire
your enthusiasm.

329
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:36,327
If it goes well,
if it happens...

330
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:39,799
I've got a promotional tour
of Japan in mind.

331
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:42,465
We'll want more.

332
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:43,734
Every band wants more.

333
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:45,839
Every band's not Queen.

334
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,708
- Listen, I understand.
- Hurry up.

335
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,176
I understand that
it's the policy of the BBC.

336
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:54,878
- We have procedures.
- This is shit!

337
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,746
I need you to explain it
to the band, please.

338
00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:58,182
- Okay, let's make it quick.
- Freddie, boys.

339
00:22:58,184 --> 00:23:00,717
Look, chaps,
it is going to be playback.

340
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:01,851
Lip synch's
all that's required.

341
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:03,553
We do know how to
play our instruments.

342
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:05,122
You want me to lip synch?

343
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:07,524
I don't understand why
we can't simply perform live.

344
00:23:07,526 --> 00:23:09,092
The audience will never know
the difference.

345
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:10,593
We'll know
the bloody difference.

346
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:11,896
This is the BBC.

347
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:13,397
That's how things are done
around here. All right?

348
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,900
Don't be a nuisance.

349
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,670
Freddie, it'll be great.

350
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:22,540
You'll just have to make sure
no one's looking at your lips.

351
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,773
Well,
the way things are done

352
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:25,443
are a load of bollocks,
old chap.

353
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,676
This is the BBC.

354
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:28,378
I'm relieved.

355
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,713
You would be.

356
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:30,915
Perfect performance.

What was it like singing
for all those people?

372
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,505
When I know
they're listening...

373
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:28,941
when I know
I really have them...

374
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,778
I couldn't sing off-key
if I tried.

375
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:38,851
I'm exactly the person
I was always meant to be.

376
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,156
I'm not afraid of anything.

377
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:51,427
The only other time
I ever feel that way

378
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:52,832
is when I'm with you.

379
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,044
Don't move.

380
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,783
Don't move.

381
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:24,798
You're the love of my life.

382
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:38,243
Freddie.

383
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,951
Which finger
do I put this on?

384
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:51,288
Wedding finger.

385
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,959
Will you marry me?

386
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,101
Yes!

387
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,638
Are you gonna leave it
in the box?

388
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,611
Freddie, it's beautiful.

389
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:15,946
I love it.

390
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:18,315
Promise me
you'll never take it off.

391
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:20,251
Oh, I promise.

392
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:21,819
No matter what.

393
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:24,120
I love you, Freddie.

394
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:27,190
You're going to do
such great things.

395
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:29,228
We're going to do
great things.

396
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:34,133
Your phone's
off the hook.

397
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,665
This is Crystal.

398
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,733
Cheryl!

399
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:37,868
Oh, that's right.
My mistake.

400
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,102
Where's your loo?

401
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,671
Uh, just down the hall.

402
00:26:41,673 --> 00:26:43,741
Oh, come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

403
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:44,908
Don't mind us.

404
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,042
Hello, Mary.
How's your dad?

405
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:48,378
Yeah, pretty well.
Thanks.

406
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,679
- Good.
- What's going on, Brian?

407
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:52,182
Well, if you'd answered your
phone, you'd know already.

408
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:54,420
This really isn't
a good time, guys.

409
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,089
John Reid called today.

410
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,657
He has a little tour
in mind for us.

411
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,262
It's not little,
Brian.

412
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,965
He's booked us a tour
of America.

413
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,136
The album's hit the charts
in the U.S.!

414
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:13,673
Oh, yes!

415
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,243
Yes!

416
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,644
Yes!

417
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,181
It's happening!

418
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,987
<i>Now, who wants to take a ride?</i>

419
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:02,055
<i>We love you, Cleveland!</i>

420
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:04,957
<i>We love you, Houston!</i>

421
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:07,993
<i>We love you, Denver!
Very happy to be here!</i>

422
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,096
<i>And are the crowds big?</i>

423
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:14,430
Well, we're selling out
every night.

424
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,032
I just wish you were here
to see it.

425
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,637
<i>They really love us.</i>

426
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,373
<i>We love you, Portland!</i>

427
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:27,077
<i>He's got a big ass, too!</i>

428
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,015
<i>We love you, New Orleans!</i>

429
00:28:32,884 --> 00:28:35,053
<i>We love you, Atlanta!</i>

430
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,024
<i>Rog, come down here
and say hello.</i>

431
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,892
<i>We love you, Pittsburgh!</i>

432
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:45,161
- Roger!
<i>- Now, hit it!</i>

433
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:46,830
<i>I'm good.
I just miss you.</i>

434
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,064
What are you doing?

435
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,032
You can't possibly be having
any fun without me.

436
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,071
<i>Nothing as exciting
as America.</i>

437
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:05,784
Say hi to the boys for me.

438
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,052
I will. Love you.

439
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,555
Bye, Freddie. I love you.

440
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:10,182
Hello.

441
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,016
- You're late.
- Am I?

442
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:14,651
We saved you a seat.

443
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:15,819
- Lovely.
- Okay.

444
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,186
So, now that
we're all here...

445
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:19,156
Jim, this is Ray Foster.

446
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:21,058
Ray, this is the
band's lawyer, Jim Beach.

447
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,126
Hello.

448
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:23,526
You must stop
calling him that.

449
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:24,427
That's his name.

450
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:27,263
No, we cannot keep
calling him "Jim Beach."

451
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:30,803
No, that's absurd, not to
mention, unspeakably boring.

452
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:34,972
Miami.

453
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:38,244
From now on,
I dub thee "Miami Beach."

454
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:41,712
The sun always sets
behind you, doesn't it?

455
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,116
On Miami Beach.

456
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,215
Hmm, right.

457
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:48,417
Now that everybody's
got an acceptable name...

458
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,321
let's get to it.
Look...

459
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:52,492
we just really need
something special.

460
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:54,724
More hits...

461
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:55,861
like <i>Killer Queen...</i>

462
00:30:56,428 --> 00:30:57,426
only bigger.

463
00:30:57,428 --> 00:30:59,128
It's not bloody widgets
we're making.

464
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,367
We can't just
reproduce <i>Killer Queen.</i>

465
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,535
No.

466
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:06,505
We can do better.

467
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,048
It's opera.

468
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,082
- Opera!
- Opera!

469
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:21,419
There seems to be
an echo in here.

470
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:53,649
See, we don't want to
repeat ourselves.

471
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,718
The same formula
over and over.

472
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,155
Formulas are a complete
and utter waste of time.

473
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:00,490
Formulas work.

474
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:02,091
Let's stick
with the formulas.

475
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:03,225
I like formulas.

476
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:04,930
We'll call the album...

477
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,398
<i>A Night at the Opera.</i>

478
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,168
Are you aware that no one
actually likes opera?

479
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,405
I like opera.

480
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:16,238
- Do you?
- I do.

481
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,006
No, don't
misunderstand, darling.

482
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:19,943
It's a rock and roll record...

483
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,244
with the scale of opera...

484
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:23,280
the pathos of Greek tragedy...

485
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:25,549
the wit of Shakespeare...

486
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:29,586
the unbridled joy
of musical theater.

487
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,988
- It's a musical experience.
- Yeah.

488
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,090
Rather than just
another record.

489
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:36,192
Something for everyone...

490
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:37,430
something...

491
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:39,663
Hmm.

492
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:42,331
Something that will make
people feel belongs to them.

493
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,836
We'll mix genres,
we'll cross boundaries...

494
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:49,638
we'll speak in bloody tongues
if we want to.

495
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,707
There's no musical ghetto
that can contain us.

496
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,510
- That's it.
- No one knows what Queen means

497
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:55,781
because it doesn't mean
one thing.

498
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:00,318
What do you think, John?

499
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,787
I...

500
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:03,686
agree with the band.

501
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:04,790
Of course you do.

502
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:08,024
How about you, uh...

503
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:10,493
- Miami.
- Hmm.

504
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,031
Fortune favors the bold.

505
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:15,434
Surely, a man of your...

506
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,435
unique taste...

507
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,740
isn't afraid
of a little risk?

508
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,976
Please don't make me
regret this.

509
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:27,712
You're fun.

510
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,026
Recording studio?

511
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:45,765
Well, the idea was to get away
from all distractions.

512
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,834
Right, I know it's not
the Ritz. Not even close.

513
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:53,168
- Roger, you're in here.
- Right.

514
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,474
Freddie, this is you.
Biggest room.

515
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:58,007
Brian, that's you.

516
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:00,378
John, you're downstairs.

517
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:07,919
And...

518
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,387
this is all yours, John.

519
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,825
Smaller rooms
don't get nearly as cold.

520
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:17,396
Okay.

521
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:37,850
Hmm.

522
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:49,494
Oh, that's really good.

523
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:09,715
<i>♪ Love of my
life, you've hurt me</i>

524
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:15,450
<i>♪ You've broken my heart</i>

525
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:22,061
<i>♪ And now you leave me</i>

526
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:27,967
<i>♪ Love of my life,

527
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:33,738
<i>♪ Bring it back, bring it back</i>

528
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:37,173
<i>♪ Bring it back,
bring it back</i>

529
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:41,378
<i>♪ Don't take it away from me</i>

530
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,617
<i>♪ Because you don't know</i>

531
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:50,689
<i>♪ What it means to me ♪</i>

532
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:54,960
Hmm.

533
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:01,599
It's beautiful.

534
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:09,108
What's it called?

535
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:13,579
<i>Love of My Life.</i>
I wrote it for Mary.

536
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,548
If you say so.

537
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,690
Don't misunderstand, Paul.

538
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,561
Mary knows me in a way
that no one else ever will.

539
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,698
I know you, Freddie Mercury.

540
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,633
Is that what you think?

541
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:13,403
Oh, no, you don't know me.

542
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,939
You just see
what you want to see.

543
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:18,544
We work together.
That's all.

544
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:28,251
I put my heart and soul
into this song.

545
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:29,519
No one is disputing that.

546
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:30,586
And you don't like it

547
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:31,954
because you want
your songs on the album!

548
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,490
- It's not that, Roger.
- Then what is it?

549
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,928
<i>I'm in Love with My Car.</i>

550
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:39,796
Maybe it's not
strong enough?

551
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:41,398
What does that even
mean, "not strong enough"?

552
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,300
I know I'm late.
What did I miss?

553
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,600
Discussing Roger's
car song.

554
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:46,535
Is it strong enough?
That's all I'm asking.

555
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,805
If I'm on my own here,
then I apologize.

556
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:51,110
How does your new song go,
then, hmm?

557
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,876
"You call me sweet...

558
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:57,015
"like I'm some
kind of cheese."

559
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:59,716
- It's good.
- Wow.

560
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:01,718
"When my hand's
on your grease gun..."

561
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,086
That's very subtle,
isn't it?

562
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:04,220
It's a metaphor, Brian.

563
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:05,155
It's just a bit weird,
Roger.

564
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,856
What exactly are you doing
with that car?

565
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:09,358
Children, please.

566
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,626
We could all
murder each other...

567
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,262
but then who would be left
to record this album?

568
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:14,263
Statistically speaking,
most bands don't fail,

569
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,965
they break up.

570
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,167
Why the hell would
you say something like that?

571
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:20,604
Roger, there's only room
in this band

572
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:21,903
for one hysterical queen.

573
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:23,974
You know why
you're angry, Roger?

574
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:24,941
Why?

575
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:27,211
'Cause you know your song
isn't strong enough.

576
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,284
- Not...
- Is that strong enough?

577
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,684
What about that?

578
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,822
Not the coffee machine!

579
00:39:12,323 --> 00:39:15,191
<i>♪ Goodbye, everybody</i>

580

586
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:17,653
That was pretty damn good.

587
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:19,988
Brilliant.
I love that.

588
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,358
<i>Press the button, Freddie.</i>

589
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,925
I know,
I know where it is.

590
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,559
I know where...
Knock, knock.

591
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:25,695
Good.

592
00:40:25,697 --> 00:40:27,028
<i>It's good. Um...</i>

593
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,599
You know,
play it like you wrote it.

594
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,003
<i>Well, I did.
I wrote that part.</i>

595
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:32,669
Taking the piss.

596
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:33,972
<i>Okay. Are you happy?</i>

597
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:36,338
I think it's beautiful.

598
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,807
<i>It's almost perfect.</i>

599
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,010
<i>Almost?</i>

600
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:41,577
Yes, give it
more rock and roll.

601
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,012
<i>I'm always up for that, Fred.</i>

602
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:44,580
<i>Put your body into it.</i>

603
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:45,648
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

604
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,783
<i>Put my body into it.
I got it.</i>

605
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:47,983
Not like that.

606
00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:49,484
<i>No, I got it. I got it.
Bit more soul, yeah?</i>

607
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:50,787
All right.
Give it more heart.

608
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,254
<i>I'll do that. We good to go?</i>

609
00:40:52,256 --> 00:40:53,222
<i>Roy, you good?</i>

610
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:55,861
Oh, and then there's
the operatic section.

611
00:40:58,229 --> 00:40:59,595
You're gonna love it.

612
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:01,564
The operatic section?

613
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:03,867
- I know, it sounds crazy.
- I love it, Fred. I love it.

614
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,200
<i>I don't know.
It could be a flop.</i>

615
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:06,468
- <i>It could work.</i>
- I love it!

616
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,204
<i>What have we got to lose?</i>

617
00:41:09,206 --> 00:41:10,740
Nothing.

618
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:12,175
If you say so.

619
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:13,343
Okay, let's go.

620
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,410
Deacy.

621
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,658
<i>How was that?</i>

622
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,898
- Freddie?
- Higher.

623
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:35,932
Can you go a bit higher?

624
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:38,200
If I go any higher,
only dogs will hear me.

625
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:39,301
Try.

626
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:40,769
Freddie's note. Sorry.

627
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:42,537
<i>Go on, roll the tape.</i>

628
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:45,209
Overdub 24 of "Fred's Thing."

629
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:54,816
How was that?

630
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:56,318
- <i>Better?</i>
- Higher.

631
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,988
Jesus! How many more
"Galileos" do you want?

632
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,655
Freddie wants to do
a few more overdubs.

633
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:01,890
Do we even have
any tape left?

634
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,760
I do have to say
the tape is wearing out.

635
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:04,995
<i>It can't take much more.</i>

636
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:06,695
Yeah, we can't afford
much more.

637
00:42:06,697 --> 00:42:08,631
We're already
three weeks over schedule.

638
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:12,371
Dub 26 of "Fred's Thing."

639
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:14,506
One more, one more.

640
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,008
One more.

641
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:20,142
Again.

642
00:42:20,144 --> 00:42:21,346
Go on, roll the track.

643
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:24,315
Who even is Galileo?

644
00:42:27,952 --> 00:42:29,919
<i>My nuts feel like
they're in my chest right now.</i>

645
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:31,320
- Are we done?
<i>- That's it.</i>

646
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:32,387
<i>He loves you.</i>

647
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:38,296
That's it.

648
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:43,268
It's beautiful! Love it!

649
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:29,615
Christ.

650
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:35,117
Well...

651
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,120
I'm not entirely sure...

652
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,120
that's the album
you promised us.

653
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:41,557
No, it's better than the album
we promised you.

654
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:42,457
It's better than any album

655
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,561
anyone's ever promised you,
darling.

656
00:43:44,563 --> 00:43:45,662
It's a bloody masterpiece.

657
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,662
- Christ.
- It is a good album, Ray.

658
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:48,997
We prefer "masterpiece."

659
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:50,568
It's expensive,
and as for...

660
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:52,602
<i>"Bohemian..."</i>

661
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:53,803
<i>Rhapsody.</i>

662
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:55,403
Rhapsody.
What is that?

663
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:57,606
- It's an epic poem.
- It goes on forever.

664
00:43:57,608 --> 00:43:59,041
Six bloody minutes.

665
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:01,376
I pity your wife if you think
six minutes is forever.

666
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:04,312
And do you know what?

667
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:05,782
We're going to release it
as our single.

668
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:08,318
Not possible.
Anything over three minutes...

669
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,887
and the radio stations
won't program it, period.

670
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:14,923
And what on earth
is it about, anyway?

671
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,459
Scaramouche?

672
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:17,327
Galileo?

673
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,394
And all that
"Ismillah" business!

674
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,499
"Ishmillah"?

675
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:24,666
Bismillah.

676
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:25,901
Oh, aye.

677
00:44:25,903 --> 00:44:27,035
Bismillah.

678
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:30,041
What's it about, anyway?
Bloody Bismillah?

679
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,675
True poetry
is for the listener.

680
00:44:33,677 --> 00:44:36,079
It ruins the mystery
if everything's explained.

681
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,579
Seldom ruins sales.

682
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:39,682
Three minutes
is the standard.

683
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:41,017
John.

684
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,285
Yeah, we need radio.

685
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:44,986
Format is three minutes,
I have to agree with Ray.

686
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:47,289
I actually think
the single's <i>Love of My Life.</i>

687
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,157
No.

688
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,258
Okay, how about John's song...

689
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,928
<i>You're My Best Friend?</i>
You know?

690
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,595
"Ooh, you make me live."

691
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:55,166
Catchy, stronger.

692
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:59,167
What about
<i>I'm in Love with My Car?</i>

693
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:00,970
You're joking!
Oh, Jesus.

694
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:02,805
I love it.

695
00:45:02,807 --> 00:45:04,207
Well,
that's the kind of song...

696
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:06,742
teenagers can crank up
the volume in their car...

697
00:45:06,744 --> 00:45:08,443
and bang their heads to.

698
00:45:08,445 --> 00:45:12,213
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>
will never be that song.

699
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:14,916
It's a band decision,
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

700
00:45:14,918 --> 00:45:16,684
- That's it.
- <i>You're My Best Friend...</i>

701
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:17,852
and it's my money.

702
00:45:17,854 --> 00:45:19,423
<i>Bo-Rap,</i> period.

703
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:22,527
Or we walk.

704
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,665
<i>MacArthur Park</i>
was seven minutes long.

705
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:29,030
It was a hit.

706
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:31,834
Look, I'm not arguing
<i>Bohemian</i> whatever's...

707
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:33,135
- musicianship.
- <i>...Rhapsody.</i>

708
00:45:33,137 --> 00:45:35,070
But there's no way in hell
the station will play...

709
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:37,340
a 6-minute
quasi-operatic dirge...

710
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:39,642
comprised of nonsense words!

711
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:41,311
Bismillah? Bullshit!

712
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:44,613
I paid for this record,
so I say what goes!

713
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:46,682
Have we no legal
recourse on this?

714
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:47,684
Ray...

715
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,488
you did <i>Dark Side of the Moon,</i>
didn't you?

716
00:45:51,322 --> 00:45:52,187
I did.

717
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:54,659
Yeah, I absolutely
love that record.

718
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:57,961
Legally, no.

719
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,095
No, he's got all your balls
in a vice.

720
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,198
It's a different matter
in the court

721
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,466
of public opinion,
of course.

722
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:08,072
Ray Foster's a giant name
in the music industry, but...

723
00:46:09,173 --> 00:46:11,043
to the average person...

724
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:14,278
Say the name Queen,
on the other hand...

725
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,650
ears prick up.

726
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:31,994
We're going with
<i>You're My Best Friend.</i>

727
00:46:31,996 --> 00:46:33,062
- Done.
- No.

728
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:36,164
We know what we have,
even if you don't.

729
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,336
It's called <i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

730
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:44,743
You will forever be known
as the man who lost Queen.

731
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:58,454
Temperamental artists, eh?

732
00:46:58,456 --> 00:47:00,321
They're well aware
they're tied to a contract...

733
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:01,657
but who knows
what goes on...

734
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,959
inside the inscrutable mind
of the recording artist?

735
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:05,028
Mark these words.

736
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,762
If they're not careful...

737
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:07,930
by the end of the year...

738
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:10,668
no one will know
the name Queen.

739
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:13,405
Christ!

740
00:47:18,075 --> 00:47:20,443
You can take that
out of our royalties!

741
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:22,044
- Twat!
- Wanker!

742
00:47:22,046 --> 00:47:23,745
You can shove
your gold disks!

743
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:25,046
You made a mistake, Foster!

744
00:47:25,048 --> 00:47:26,115
Arsehole!

745
00:47:26,117 --> 00:47:27,615
You'll never have
a gold disk...

746
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:28,853
you medium talent!

747
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,220
And to think
I worked with Hendrix.

748
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:34,691
<i>In the studio today...</i>

749
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:38,695
<i>...singer Frederick Mercury!</i>

750
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:40,129
<i>So what have you
got today for us?</i>

751
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:42,231
Have you got a little taste
of the new record?

752
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,133
I'm really not supposed to.

753
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:46,705
Oh, forbidden fruit?
Don't tempt me!

754
00:47:47,972 --> 00:47:50,342
- <i>"I'm in Love with My Car!"</i>
- Other side.

755
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:54,309
<i>"Bohemian Rhapsody."</i>

756
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,979
I didn't know Freddie
knew Kenny so well.

757
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:57,213
<i>The BBC won't play it.</i>

758
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:58,347
Nor did I.

759
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:00,381
In fact, no one will play it
on the radio...

760
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:02,216
so EMI won't release it.

761
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:04,019
<i>What's wrong
with this song?</i>

762
00:48:04,021 --> 00:48:06,222
Nothing's wrong
with it at all.

763
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:08,990
Except that
it's six minutes long.

764
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:10,091
Six minutes?

765
00:48:10,093 --> 00:48:12,193
You'd have to be mad
to play it.

766
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:13,361
Oh, you'd have to be bonkers.

767
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:16,200
- I positively forbid it.
- Let's hear it.

768
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:19,035
Ladies and ladies...

769
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:21,470
a Capital Radio exclusive...

770
00:48:21,472 --> 00:48:23,673

771
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:26,343

00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:06,234
Freddie,
when do I get to see you?

00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:08,637

00:51:16,514 --> 00:51:18,079

Get dressed.

801
00:52:23,747 --> 00:52:24,912
According to Brian...

802
00:52:24,914 --> 00:52:28,018
it was the largest paying
audience in history.

803
00:52:38,996 --> 00:52:40,497
The whole night...

804
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,533
I didn't know
if they understood a thing

805
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,869
I was saying.

806
00:52:46,403 --> 00:52:48,137

00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,316
<i>♪ And now you leave me</i>

810
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,454
<i>♪ Love of my life,
can't you see?</i>

811
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:08,856
<i>♪ Bring it back, bring it back</i>

812
00:53:08,858 --> 00:53:12,928
<i>♪ Don't take it away from me ♪</i>

813
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,329
They're all singing.

814
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,668
Thousands of them.

815
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,106
All singing to you.

816
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,979
Because it's true.

817
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:38,653
Freddie, what's wrong?

818
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:40,858
<i>♪ Love of my life,
don't leave me</i>

819
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:44,028
<i>♪ You've stolen my love</i>

820
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:47,965
<i>♪ And now desert me ♪</i>

821
00:53:49,032 --> 00:53:52,536
Something's been wrong
for a while now.

822
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,813
Say it.

823
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:08,186
Say it.

824
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:17,695
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

825
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:24,869
I think I'm bisexual.

826
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:29,941
Freddie, you're gay.

827
00:54:48,191 --> 00:54:49,325
I've known for a while now.

828
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,727
I just didn't want to
admit it.

829
00:54:54,197 --> 00:54:56,833
It's funny, really. This is
what I always settle for.

830
00:54:58,403 --> 00:54:59,800
"I love you, but..."

831
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:02,970
"I love you, Mary,
but I need space."

832
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:06,941
"I love you, Mary,
but I've met someone else."

833
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:09,913
And now,
"I love you, but I'm..."

834
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:17,385
And this is the hardest,

835
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:20,157
because it's not
even your fault.

836
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:36,340
No, don't take it off.

837
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,039
Don't take it off.

838
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,977
You promised me
you'd never take it off.

839
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:45,316
What do you want from me?

840
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:53,091
Almost everything.

841
00:55:56,593 --> 00:55:59,030
I want you in my life.

842
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:01,865
Why?

843
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:08,039
We believe in each other.

844
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:11,375
And that's everything.

845
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:15,113
For us.

846
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:29,761
Your life is going to be
very difficult.

847
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:04,227
What do you think?

848
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:07,461
Gay-er?

849
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:10,099
Not this, darling, the house.

850
00:57:10,101 --> 00:57:11,932
Isn't it amazing?

851
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:13,836
Mary's already
moved in next door,

852
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:15,771
so she can visit
the cats and me.

853
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:16,838
Uh-huh.

854
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,707
Each cat will have
his own room.

855
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:20,642
Delilah's by the kitchen...

856
00:57:20,644 --> 00:57:22,109
Miko's next door.

857
00:57:22,111 --> 00:57:24,379
Tiffany, Oscar, Romeo,
all upstairs.

858
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:28,916
Lilly's room is even larger
than this one! Spoilt thing.

859
00:57:28,918 --> 00:57:29,984
Well, I'm not sure

860
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:31,820
the echo is quite
pronounced enough.

861
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:34,088
Eh-oh!

862
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:38,428
Oh, I knew
you'd appreciate it.

863
00:57:39,597 --> 00:57:41,196
Stay for dinner.

864
00:57:41,198 --> 00:57:42,664
Anything you fancy.

865
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,970
I can't.
Wife, kids, you know.

866
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:48,740
Of course.

867
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:52,541
Well, come on.
We'll eat off the floor.

868
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:54,309
It's clean enough.

869
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:55,912
Another time, Fred.

870
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,762
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mary.

871
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:17,064
- Hi.
- <i>Hello, my love.</i>

872
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,166
<i>Hi.</i>

873
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:20,836
I need you to do
something for me.

874
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:22,937
But you can't
ask any questions.

875
00:58:22,939 --> 00:58:24,338
Freddie, what are you
doing this time?

876
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,811
No, I just told you...
you can't ask any questions.

877
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:31,012
<i>Right.</i>

878
00:58:31,014 --> 00:58:33,884
I want you to go
to your bedroom window.

879
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,487
<i>Look out of it.</i>

880
00:58:45,762 --> 00:58:48,796
- Do you see me?
- <i>Yes, I do see you.</i>

881
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:50,901
Now, you do the same.

882
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:54,906
Oh...

883
00:59:02,646 --> 00:59:04,247
Keep yours on.

884
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,816
Come have a drink.

885
00:59:07,818 --> 00:59:09,387
- <i>Now?</i>
- Right now.

886
00:59:10,354 --> 00:59:11,389
It's late, Freddie.

887
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:13,821
Come on.

888
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:14,990
<i>Please.</i>

889
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:17,128
<i>Do you have something
to drink?</i>

890
00:59:17,727 --> 00:59:18,961
I suppose.

891
00:59:18,963 --> 00:59:20,995
<i>Go get it.
Pour yourself something.</i>

892
00:59:20,997 --> 00:59:23,066
<i>Pour yourself a drink,
darling.</i>

893
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,137
Do you have it?

894
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:31,007
Yes.

895
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:33,211
Cheers.

896
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:35,213
<i>Cheers.</i>

897
00:59:36,213 --> 00:59:37,981
To you, my love.

898
00:59:38,983 --> 00:59:40,885
To you, Freddie.

899
00:59:42,818 --> 00:59:44,054
Good night.

900
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:46,090
Good night.

901
00:59:57,834 --> 00:59:59,001
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Paul.

902
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:00,068
<i>Freddie?</i>

903
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,436
Sweetheart,
I want to throw a party.

904
01:00:01,438 --> 01:00:03,704
<i>Okay.
Who do you want to invite?</i>

905
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:04,838
People.

906
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,541
I want you to shake
the freak tree

907
01:00:06,543 --> 01:00:08,843
and invite anyone
who plops to the ground.

908
01:00:08,845 --> 01:00:12,012
Dwarfs and giants...

909
01:00:12,014 --> 01:00:16,517
magicians, Zulu tribesmen,
contortionists...

910
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:18,820
fire eaters...

911
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:21,155
and priests.

912
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:23,258
We're going to
need to confess.

913
01:00:33,102 --> 01:00:34,803
Fill me up, will you, Trixie?

914
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:37,004
Marvelous, Fred!
You've outdone yourself!

915
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:39,441
Thank you, John.
I'm so glad you love it!

916
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:42,443
Mmm. They say money can't
buy happiness, darlings!

917
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:45,481
But it does allow you
to give it away!

918
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:47,682
I see you and Paul
are getting along quite well.

919
01:00:47,684 --> 01:00:48,983
He's Trixie now...

920
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:50,519
'cause he's always
up to something.

921
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,387
So, tell me, Rog...

922
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:55,191
what's the sexiest part
of a car?

923
01:01:02,633 --> 01:01:03,932
Ah!

924
01:01:03,934 --> 01:01:05,600
Well, well, well!

925
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:06,801
Ah, your majesty!

926
01:01:06,803 --> 01:01:08,704
No, I'm not her majesty!

927
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,972
We're her majesty, darlings!

928
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,142
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

929
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:16,445
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

930
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:18,280
- Thank you, my loves!
- Rog.

931
01:01:18,282 --> 01:01:19,580
Where's Mary?

932
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:24,121
It's not exactly
her scene, is it, Freddie?

933
01:01:24,854 --> 01:01:26,057
Hmm.

934
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:28,856
Fabulous, isn't it?

935
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:30,160
If you say so.

936
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:34,999
Hmm.

937
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:38,166
You're starting to look
like each other.

938
01:01:38,168 --> 01:01:39,434
What's wrong with that,
Brian?

939
01:01:39,436 --> 01:01:41,169
You're supposed to be
in a rock band, Freddie.

940
01:01:41,171 --> 01:01:42,437
Not the Village People.

941
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:45,841
You might want to think about
cutting your hair one day.

942
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:47,709
Never.
I was born like this.

943
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:51,415
Come on!

944
01:01:52,548 --> 01:01:54,048
- Let's dance!
- Yes!

945
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,883
I don't dance, Freddie.

946
01:01:55,885 --> 01:01:57,586
I need a few more
of these for that.

947
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,055
It's my party,
and I demand you dance!

948
01:02:00,057 --> 01:02:01,222
We should go.

949
01:02:01,224 --> 01:02:02,758
By royal decree!

950
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,028
We're gonna go, actually.

951
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,660
Oh, God! You're dull.

952
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,262
If you were any more dull,
you'd be Deacy.

953
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:09,863
What are you
complaining about?

954
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:11,134
You've got your little pet.

955
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:14,769
I have...

956
01:02:14,771 --> 01:02:16,838
and he's loyal.

957
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,008
Loyalty's so important.
Don't you think, Dominique?

958
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,443
Careful, Fred.

959
01:02:22,979 --> 01:02:24,945
- Let's go.
- Where you going?

960
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:26,080
Home.

961
01:02:26,082 --> 01:02:27,414
Just a joke.

962
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:31,352
Freddie, sometimes
you're a total prick.

963
01:02:31,354 --> 01:02:33,523
- Good night.
- Brian.

964
01:02:37,695 --> 01:02:38,827
Forget them.

965
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:40,896
Come on!
Your guests are waiting.

966
01:02:40,898 --> 01:02:43,066
They all want a little
Mercury in their cup.

967
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:44,434
Come on.

968
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:46,568
All right!

969
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,370
My darlings...

970
01:02:49,372 --> 01:02:51,207
the time has finally come...

971
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:54,008
to get absolutely...

972
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,713
shit-faced!

973
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:04,553
Whoo!

974
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:07,358
<i>Senor,</i> where's
my marching powder?

975
01:03:31,347 --> 01:03:32,948
You've got a set of balls.

976
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,983
Go fetch me
a drink and find out.

977
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:37,285
I may work
for you tonight...

978
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:39,820
but put your hands on me
again, and I'll thump you.

979
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:41,155
Got it?

980
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:43,024
I'm terribly sorry.

981
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:45,526
I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry.

982
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,928
I won't do that again,
all right?

983
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:53,104
Let me get you a beer.

984
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:56,673
I wouldn't mind a beer.

985
01:03:58,775 --> 01:04:01,678
Can you just tell me where
we keep them?

986
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:05,379
You're very handsome.

987
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:07,784
I love a man in uniform.

988
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:11,588
So do I.

989
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:17,024
<i>So, all your friends
have left you alone.</i>

990
01:04:17,026 --> 01:04:18,626
They're not my friends.

991
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:19,630
Not really.

992
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:22,597
Just distraction.

993
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:23,932
From what?

994
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:26,504
The in-between moments,
I suppose.

995
01:04:28,104 --> 01:04:30,705
I find them intolerable.

996
01:04:30,707 --> 01:04:32,340
All of the...

997
01:04:32,342 --> 01:04:37,148
darkness you thought you left
behind comes creeping back in.

998
01:04:38,948 --> 01:04:40,351
I know what you mean.

999
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:43,320
Really?

1000
01:04:45,387 --> 01:04:46,890
What is it that
you do with them?

1001
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,928
Spend them
with real friends.

1002
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:54,697
You look like
you could use a friend.

1003
01:05:15,084 --> 01:05:16,619
I like you.

1004
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:19,456
I like you, too, Freddie.

1005
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:26,529
Come and find me when
you decide you like yourself.

1006
01:05:32,903 --> 01:05:34,738
Can I have
your name at least?

1007
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,673
It's Jim Hutton.

1008
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:40,908
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Freddie.

1009
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,680
Or should I say good morning?

1010
01:05:46,517 --> 01:05:48,216
I want a new boat.

1011
01:05:48,218 --> 01:05:49,617
This one is for me.
This one.

1012
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:50,952
Didn't you say
we were going to see him?

1013
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:52,586
- I've got an hour left.
- Wait. What about this one?

1014
01:05:52,588 --> 01:05:53,854
No, I think
we'll still make that.

1015
01:05:53,856 --> 01:05:54,923
It's a good size.

1016
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:56,427
Screw him.

1017
01:05:57,894 --> 01:05:59,563
Everyone up
on the drum risers!

1018
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:02,530
- Up on the drum risers.
- Come on!

1019
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:04,166
Thank you, Chrissie.
Showing some enthusiasm.

1020
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,600
- Wives and everyone, Brian?
- Me?

1021
01:06:05,602 --> 01:06:06,666
Yes! Come on, John. Everyone.

1022
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:08,268
- I'm not waiting any longer.
- Let's go.

1023
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:09,970
Get up.

1024
01:06:09,972 --> 01:06:11,171
- Bass?
- No, you don't need it.

1025
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:12,474
Get up.

1026
01:06:12,476 --> 01:06:14,476
- Come on, Rog, take your time.
- All right.

1027
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:15,910
What's this about?

1028
01:06:15,912 --> 01:06:16,878
You remember our last concert?

1029
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,648
The crowd were singing
our songs back to us.

1030
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:22,450
I mean, it was deafening,
but it was wonderful.

1031
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:24,318
They're becoming
a part of our show.

1032
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,421
I want to encourage that,
so...

1033
01:06:26,423 --> 01:06:29,091
I've got an idea to involve
them a little bit more.

1034
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:30,358
Let's start with this.

1035
01:06:32,729 --> 01:06:33,831
Stamp to this beat.

1036
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:36,867
Genius.

1037
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:38,736
Thank you, John.

1038
01:06:39,802 --> 01:06:40,803
Come on.

1039
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:43,707
Good.

1040
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:49,012
Now, I want you to clap
on the third beat.

1041
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:54,716
Don't speed up.

1042
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,584
Rog, keep that time.

1043
01:06:56,586 --> 01:06:59,254
No Prenter?

1044
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:01,155
It's unusual to see you
without your clone.

1045
01:07:01,157 --> 01:07:02,990
It's unusual seeing you
be so bitchy.

1046
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:04,624
It's usually me.

1047
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:06,929
Ah, you kept time, Rog.
Good.

1048
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,668
What's going on?

1049
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:13,068
You'd know
if you were on time.

1050
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:16,840
I'm a performer, darling,
not a Swiss train conductor.

1051
01:07:19,943 --> 01:07:21,675
Sorry I'm late.

1052
01:07:21,677 --> 01:07:22,679
Again.

1053
01:07:23,178 --> 01:07:24,245
All right.

1054
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:25,613
Now, will you
please tell me

1055
01:07:25,615 --> 01:07:27,215
why you're not playing
any instruments?

1056
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:31,218
I wanna give the audience
a song that they can perform.

1057
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,053
All right?
Let them be part of the band.

1058
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:34,189
So, what can they do?

1059
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:44,599
Imagine...

1060
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:46,434
thousands of people...

1061
01:07:46,436 --> 01:07:48,037
doing this in unison.

1062
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:49,736
Huh?

1063
01:07:49,738 --> 01:07:50,907
Well?

1064
01:07:51,474 --> 01:07:52,742
What's the lyric?

1065
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,454
<i>♪ Buddy, you're a boy

<i>All right! I feel like taking

1093
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:51,359
<i>Who wants to take a bite
out of me?</i>

1094
01:09:52,495 --> 01:09:54,631
<i>All right, play with me now.</i>

1095
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:57,998
Eh-oh!

1096
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,202
- Eh-oh!
- Eh-oh!

1097
01:10:03,106 --> 01:10:06,007
Never seen anyone interact
with a crowd like that.

1098
01:10:06,009 --> 01:10:08,212
Bigger than any band,
don't you think?

1099
01:10:10,513 --> 01:10:12,178
I mean, Queen...

1100
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,615
how long can that last?

1101
01:10:14,617 --> 01:10:16,251
Did he say
something to you?

1102
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,019
Not explicitly.

1103
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:20,622
But we've had some interest
from CBS Records...

1104
01:10:20,624 --> 01:10:22,259
about a solo deal.

1105
01:10:32,835 --> 01:10:34,235
Well, that's a big number.

1106
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:36,337
That's a Freddie-size number.

1107
01:10:36,339 --> 01:10:38,541
You should be the one
to propose it.

1108
01:10:39,241 --> 01:10:40,675
Hi, guys. How's it going?

1109
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:42,276
- Good.
- Everything's great.

1110
01:10:42,278 --> 01:10:43,944
John, another drink?

1111
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:45,011
Er, no, I'm fine.

1112
01:10:45,013 --> 01:10:46,579
Here's the Coke.
Coming right up.

1113
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:48,785
- Freddie.
- Oh, there you are.

1114
01:10:50,853 --> 01:10:52,723
Oh, God! Freddie!
Put me down!

1115
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,122
You were brilliant.

1116
01:10:55,124 --> 01:10:57,324
Ah, that's only because
I knew you were watching.

1117
01:10:57,326 --> 01:10:58,458
I've missed you.

1118
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,030
We have
so much to catch up on.

1119
01:11:01,197 --> 01:11:02,829
Oh, thank you.

1120
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:04,968
This is my boyfriend, David.

1121
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:07,103
David, this is Freddie.

1122
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:10,073
Magnificent show.

1123
01:11:11,073 --> 01:11:12,507
Thank you.

1124
01:11:12,509 --> 01:11:15,112
It's so kind of you,
I appreciate it.

1125
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,246
Thank you so much.

1126
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:22,885
Where's your ring?

1127
01:11:24,219 --> 01:11:26,990
I just didn't want to travel
with something so valuable.

1128
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:32,293
Freddie, there are some people
here for you to see.

1129
01:11:32,295 --> 01:11:33,597
You promised you'd say hello.

1130
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:37,301
- Oh, did I?
- Mmm-hmm.

1131
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:41,135
We should go.

1132
01:11:41,137 --> 01:11:42,139
Will I see you soon?

1133
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:46,677
Yes, of course.
Of course.

1134
01:11:47,911 --> 01:11:49,409
Mwah!

1135
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:51,111
It's a pleasure to meet you,
David.

1136
01:11:51,113 --> 01:11:52,346
And you.

1137
01:11:52,348 --> 01:11:53,616
And well done again.

1138
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:56,119
And you.

1139
01:11:56,419 --> 01:11:57,621
Bye.

1140
01:11:59,055 --> 01:12:01,521
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

1141
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:02,758
Bye.

1142
01:12:15,905 --> 01:12:18,004
Then you've got
the MTV interview...

1143
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:22,109
and the plane to Houston
for the special.

1144
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,880
Back here on Friday.

1145
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:27,284
Listen to me now.

1146
01:12:28,084 --> 01:12:30,016
Do you know who sold

1147
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:32,121
4% of all the records
purchased last year?

1148
01:12:32,656 --> 01:12:34,091
Worldwide?

1149
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:36,757
Michael Jackson.

1150
01:12:36,759 --> 01:12:39,026
Not the Jackson 5.

1151
01:12:39,028 --> 01:12:40,194
Michael Jackson.

1152
01:12:40,196 --> 01:12:43,666
And I think
you could do even better.

1153
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:47,868
In fact, I've had an offer
from CBS Records.

1154
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,136
It's a lot of money
for you, Fred,

1155
01:12:49,138 --> 01:12:52,009
and I think
you should consider it.

1156
01:12:55,644 --> 01:12:59,180
Are you asking me
to break up the band?

1157
01:12:59,182 --> 01:13:03,885
I'm just pointing out what
awaits you if you go solo.

1158
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:06,322
An end to your
frustrations.

1159
01:13:08,157 --> 01:13:09,892
My frustrations?

1160
01:13:11,326 --> 01:13:12,329
Paul?

1161
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,067
I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

1162
01:13:22,437 --> 01:13:23,837
Perhaps I misunderstood.

1163
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:25,539
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1164
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:26,673
Pull over.

1165
01:13:26,675 --> 01:13:28,044
Stop the car, pull over.

1166
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:32,113
- Get out. Out now!
- What the hell?

1167
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:33,515
Get out of this car.
You're fired.

1168
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:34,582
What're you talking about,
fired?

1169
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:35,716
I said get out.

1170
01:13:35,718 --> 01:13:37,452
- Freddie, you are high!
- I said get out!

1171
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,651
What are you
talking about?

1172
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:40,723
Out! Out or I'll kill you!

1173
01:13:42,558 --> 01:13:44,958
Get out,
you treacherous piss flap.

1174
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,025
You're not
thinking clearly.

1175
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,294
Get your ass
out of my car now.

1176
01:13:47,296 --> 01:13:48,298
Get out!

1177
01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:50,030
Out!

1178
01:13:50,032 --> 01:13:52,733
Get your ass out of my car!
Get out!

1179
01:13:52,735 --> 01:13:55,202
You're firing the
wrong snake, Freddie.

1180
01:13:55,204 --> 01:13:56,671
You'll regret it.

1181
01:13:56,673 --> 01:13:57,937
Get your ass out of here!

1182
01:14:00,043 --> 01:14:01,044
Drive!

1183
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:04,212
Hey! What the hell? Move!

1184
01:14:04,214 --> 01:14:06,881
Hey, watch it!
I'll run your ass over!

1185
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:09,019
Move!

1186
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:25,367
Did you know
anything about this?

1187
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:28,472
I warned him against it.

1188
01:14:29,238 --> 01:14:30,570
Pure greed.

1189
01:14:30,572 --> 01:14:32,472
Tried to break up
my family.

1190
01:14:32,474 --> 01:14:34,307
We can manage the band.

1191
01:14:34,309 --> 01:14:35,745
We don't need him.

1192
01:14:36,778 --> 01:14:38,915
What do you know
about what I need?

1193
01:14:40,282 --> 01:14:41,849
I know what it's like...

1194
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:43,650
not to belong.

1195
01:14:43,652 --> 01:14:47,055
A queer Catholic boy
from Belfast.

1196
01:14:47,057 --> 01:14:48,855
You know...

1197
01:14:48,857 --> 01:14:52,862
I think my father
would rather see me dead...

1198
01:14:53,795 --> 01:14:55,831
than let me be who I am.

1199
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:02,773
I'm gonna take care
of you now, Freddie.

1200
01:15:04,372 --> 01:15:05,942
If you'll let me.

1201
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,220
What are you reading?

1202
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:20,857
Just the cricket.

1203
01:15:26,129 --> 01:15:28,261
We're a rock and roll band.

1204
01:15:28,263 --> 01:15:29,596
We don't do disco.

1205
01:15:29,598 --> 01:15:31,899
- It's not disco.
- Then what is it?

1206
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:32,999
It's Queen.

1207
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,635
<i>So sorry, my darlings!</i>

1208
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:35,970
<i>Lost all track!</i>

1209
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:37,939
You fired Reid
without consulting us!

1210
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:40,074
You don't make decisions
for the band.

1211
01:15:40,076 --> 01:15:41,077
Hey.

1212
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:45,279
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
dear.

1213
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:46,349
It's done.

1214
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:48,849
Besides...

1215
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:50,784
Miami will manage us.

1216
01:15:50,786 --> 01:15:52,720
Won't you, darling?

1217
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:54,655
Erm... I'll think about it.

1218
01:15:54,657 --> 01:15:56,556
- No.
- Are you high again?

1219
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:57,992
Well done, Columbo.

1220
01:15:57,994 --> 01:15:59,226
You need to slow down, Fred.

1221
01:15:59,228 --> 01:16:01,561
Oh, don't be such a bore.
I'm here, aren't I?

1222
01:16:01,563 --> 01:16:02,629
Are you?

1223
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:03,951
I don't care
if you're shit-faced.

1224
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:06,403
As long as you can sing.

1225
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,337
No, John,
I don't wanna play it.

1226
01:16:10,339 --> 01:16:11,471
Then I'm all for it.

1227
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:12,907
What's that supposed to mean?

1228
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:14,641
I'm tired of
the bloody anthems.

1229
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:16,445
I want the energy
in the clubs.

1230
01:16:17,345 --> 01:16:18,413
The bodies,

1231
01:16:18,415 --> 01:16:20,213
- I want to make people move.
- You mean disco?

1232
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:22,182
Why not?

1233
01:16:22,184 --> 01:16:24,818
Do you mind pissing off?
This is a band discussion.

1234
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,854
Drum loops?
Synthesizers?

1235
01:16:26,856 --> 01:16:28,756
- If you say so.
- It's not us!

1236
01:16:28,758 --> 01:16:29,989
- Us?
- It's not Queen!

1237
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:31,626
Queen is whatever
I say it is!

1238
01:16:32,862 --> 01:16:35,098
Well, you can play
your own bloody drums, then.

1239
01:16:36,665 --> 01:16:37,965
Fred.

1240
01:16:37,967 --> 01:16:39,934
Okay, let's see how good
a boxer you really are!

1241
01:16:39,936 --> 01:16:41,836
Roger, take it easy!
Take it easy!

1242
01:16:41,838 --> 01:16:43,503
Take it easy.

1243
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:44,506
All right, Muhammad Ali.

1244
01:16:48,844 --> 01:16:50,046
That's...

1245
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:54,015
That's quite a cool riff,
actually.

1246
01:16:54,017 --> 01:16:56,086
Hmm. You wrote that?

1247
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,555
That's really good.

1248
01:16:59,655 --> 01:17:00,657
Yes, it will be...

1249
01:17:02,023 --> 01:17:05,327
if you all can
just shut up and play.

1250
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:08,462
- He started it.
- Oh, shut up!

Freddie!

1290
01:19:05,281 --> 01:19:08,114
Freddie! Freddie,
as the leader of Queen...

1291
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:09,449
as the leader of Queen...

1292
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:11,519
do you feel responsible
for the success of the band?

1293
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:14,756
I'm not the leader of Queen,
I'm only the lead singer.

1294
01:19:14,758 --> 01:19:16,789
Freddie!
A question for Freddie.

1295
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,124
Do you ever
doubt your talent?

1296
01:19:18,126 --> 01:19:20,293
No, that's a stupid question.

1297
01:19:20,295 --> 01:19:22,128
- Take it easy, Fred.
- What's next?

1298
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:24,198
Freddie, uh, your teeth!

1299
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,266
Why don't you
get your teeth fixed?

1300
01:19:26,268 --> 01:19:28,769
I live in Britain.
I don't want to stand out.

1301
01:19:28,771 --> 01:19:29,904
Next...

1302
01:19:29,906 --> 01:19:31,672
Why don't you have
your manners fixed?

1303
01:19:31,674 --> 01:19:33,907
That's an asshole question
to ask anybody.

1304
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:35,642
That's an asshole question.

1305
01:19:35,644 --> 01:19:37,511
In your song <i>Life Is Real,</i>

1306
01:19:37,513 --> 01:19:38,846
what do you mean
by the line...

1307
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:40,347
"Love is a roulette wheel"?

1308
01:19:40,349 --> 01:19:42,282
Are you implying that
the more partners you have...

1309
01:19:42,284 --> 01:19:44,818
the more chances
you have of...

1310
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,419
contracting something?

1311
01:19:46,421 --> 01:19:47,424
What?

1312
01:19:48,723 --> 01:19:51,158
I don't know, I haven't
figured out love yet.

1313
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,260
But it implies something else,
Freddie.

1314
01:19:53,262 --> 01:19:55,863
That might be
a better question for Rog.

1315
01:19:55,865 --> 01:19:57,565
Watch it.

1316
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,333
Freddie, concerning
your private life...

1317
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:01,068
there's lots of pictures
of you in the tabloids...

1318
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,401
looking drunk or ill.

1319
01:20:02,403 --> 01:20:04,137
Which one is it, ill or drunk?

1320
01:20:04,139 --> 01:20:06,841
I had a cold last week,
if anyone cares.

1321
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:09,510
As much as we'd love to answer
questions about colds...

1322
01:20:09,512 --> 01:20:10,810
I'd like to speak
about the album.

1323
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:12,879
If anyone's got any questions
about the music?

1324
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:14,248
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

1325
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,316
Freddie! Freddie,
your parents...

1326
01:20:16,318 --> 01:20:18,252
they're conservative
Zoroastrians.

1327
01:20:18,254 --> 01:20:20,887
I wonder, what do they make
of your public persona?

1328
01:20:20,889 --> 01:20:21,955
Is that music...

1329
01:20:21,957 --> 01:20:23,489
My parents died
in a fiery wreck.

1330
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:26,127
I happen to know
that's not true, is it?

1331
01:20:26,129 --> 01:20:29,229
I just wanted to know whether
they were proud of you.

1332
01:20:29,231 --> 01:20:31,231
Are your parents
proud of you?

1333
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:32,932
Is this what they hoped for?

1334
01:20:32,934 --> 01:20:34,101
I hope that they are.

1335
01:20:34,103 --> 01:20:35,435
I surely don't think so.

1336
01:20:35,437 --> 01:20:37,236
Anyone wanna talk
about the album?

1337
01:20:37,238 --> 01:20:38,305
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

1338
01:20:38,307 --> 01:20:39,806
Could you answer
my questions please?

1339
01:20:39,808 --> 01:20:41,708
This better be good.

1340
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:42,810
Shut up!

1341
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:45,044
Freddie, could you
tell us about the rumors

1342
01:20:45,046 --> 01:20:46,846
concerning your sexuality?

1343
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,914
What about the rumors

1344
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:49,583
concerning your lack
of sexuality?

1345
01:20:49,585 --> 01:20:52,122
I'm just a musical prostitute,
my dear.

1346
01:20:53,089 --> 01:20:55,291
Can you answer
the question?

1347
01:20:55,924 --> 01:20:57,224
What's your name, dear?

1348
01:20:57,226 --> 01:20:58,592
Shelley Stern.

1349
01:20:58,594 --> 01:20:59,827
- Shelley.
- Yes.

1350
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:01,861
That thing between your legs,
does it bite?

1351
01:21:01,863 --> 01:21:03,062
Hah!

1352
01:21:03,064 --> 01:21:04,899
Could you answer the question,
please?

1353
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:05,999
We're here as a courtesy.

1354
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:07,168
You know, there's
four of us up here.

1355
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,302
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

1356
01:21:08,304 --> 01:21:09,669
What do you want?

1357
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:10,805
What is the truth?

1358
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:12,405
Can you be honest for once?

1359
01:21:12,407 --> 01:21:14,108
Why are you lying
about your parents, Freddie?

1360
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:16,510
I'm not lying about anything.
I just, I'm...

1361
01:21:16,512 --> 01:21:18,078
Your fans deserve
to know the truth, Freddie.

1362
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,178
Can you answer the question,
please?

1363
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,547
This is my business.

1364
01:21:20,549 --> 01:21:21,949
No, you're a public figure.

1365
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:23,249
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

1366
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:24,251
- Your parents?
- Can you tell us

1367
01:21:24,253 --> 01:21:25,586
- about...
- Your sexuality?

1368
01:21:25,588 --> 01:21:26,752
What? Why, why...

1369
01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:28,055
Can you just be honest?

1370
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:29,122
Contracting something.

1371
01:21:29,124 --> 01:21:30,524
Your fans deserve
to know the truth.

1372
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:39,498
Our readers want to know.

1373
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,781
What do your readers want to
know? They want to know what?

1374
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:10,633
<i>♪ But life still goes on</i>

Can I get up now?

1385
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:45,733
What is happening?

1386
01:22:45,735 --> 01:22:47,601
No, you can't.

1387
01:22:47,603 --> 01:22:49,806
- I wanna be in it.
- Get off me!

1388
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:02,684
Freddie, you in there?

1389
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:05,321
Freddie?

1390
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,154
They're here.

1391
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:09,626
We can't put this off
any longer.

1392
01:23:13,829 --> 01:23:14,997
Freddie?

1393
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,266
<i>MTV banned our video.</i>

1394
01:23:20,268 --> 01:23:24,003
The youth of America.
We helped give birth to MTV.

1395
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:25,273
It's America.

1396
01:23:25,275 --> 01:23:27,340
They're Puritans in public,
perverts in private.

1397
01:23:27,342 --> 01:23:28,976
I'm never touring
in the U.S. again.

1398
01:23:28,978 --> 01:23:31,981
And I'm
the one being blamed for it.

1399
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:33,881
Not you, dear...

1400
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:36,419
whose idea, I believe, it was
to dress up in drag.

1401
01:23:36,952 --> 01:23:38,284
And not you.

1402
01:23:38,286 --> 01:23:40,788
Not even you,
who wrote the bloody thing.

1403
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,355
No.

1404
01:23:42,357 --> 01:23:44,757
Crazy, cross-dressing Freddie.

1405
01:23:44,759 --> 01:23:46,595
Freddie the freak.
Freddie the fag.

1406
01:23:49,697 --> 01:23:52,333
I'm tired of touring.
Aren't you?

1407
01:23:52,335 --> 01:23:54,968
Album, tour, album, tour.

1408
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,404
I want to do
something different.

1409
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,404
We're a band.
That's what bands do.

1410
01:23:58,406 --> 01:23:59,972
Album, tour, album, tour.

1411
01:23:59,974 --> 01:24:01,044
Well, I need a break.

1412
01:24:01,977 --> 01:24:03,444
I'm sick of it.

1413
01:24:03,446 --> 01:24:04,847
What are you saying,
Freddie?

1414
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:26,435
I've signed a deal
with CBS Records.

1415
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:29,202
- You've done what?
- Without telling us?

1416
01:24:29,204 --> 01:24:30,537
What kind of deal?

1417
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:33,343
Look, I'm not saying we won't
record or ever tour again.

1418
01:24:33,909 --> 01:24:35,176
Queen will go on.

1419
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:36,810
But I need to do
something different.

1420
01:24:36,812 --> 01:24:40,446
Do you know what I mean?
I need to grow.

1421
01:24:40,448 --> 01:24:43,583
What's the song?
"Fly away"?

1422
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:45,118
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

1423
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,456
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

1424
01:24:47,156 --> 01:24:48,521
A solo album?

1425
01:24:48,523 --> 01:24:49,722
Two, actually.

1426
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:51,225
- Back to back.
- Another word out of you...

1427
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:52,691
and I'll throw you out
the bloody window.

1428
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:54,727
But that's years, Freddie.
I mean...

1429
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:56,931
- that'll take years.
- Ye of little faith.

1430
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:58,766
I don't believe this.

1431
01:24:58,768 --> 01:24:59,769
How much?

1432
01:25:04,272 --> 01:25:05,974
What did they pay you?

1433
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:10,043
I wanna know how much
they paid you...

1434
01:25:10,045 --> 01:25:11,381
$4 million!

1435
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:17,184
That's more than
any Queen deal.

1436
01:25:17,186 --> 01:25:18,885
Look, the routine
is killing us.

1437
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:21,922
I mean, you must all want a
break from all the arguments.

1438
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:23,958
I mean, whose song
gets on the album...

1439
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,292
whose song's the single...

1440
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:26,493
who wrote what...

1441
01:25:26,495 --> 01:25:28,194
who gets a bigger slice
of the royalties...

1442
01:25:28,196 --> 01:25:29,596
what's on the B-side,
all of it.

1443
01:25:29,598 --> 01:25:31,198
You must need a break.

1444
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,800
Freddie, we're a family.

1445
01:25:32,802 --> 01:25:34,267
No, we're not!

1446
01:25:34,269 --> 01:25:35,569
We're not a family!

1447
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:38,038
You've got families,
children, wives.

1448
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,271
What have I got?

1449
01:25:39,273 --> 01:25:41,811
You've got $4 million. Perhaps
you can buy yourself a family.

1450
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:47,614
I won't compromise
my vision any longer.

1451
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:49,816
Compromise?

1452
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:50,950
Are you joking?

1453
01:25:50,952 --> 01:25:53,990
You were working at Heathrow
before we gave you a chance.

1454
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:58,324
And without me...

1455
01:25:58,326 --> 01:26:00,526
you'd be a dentist...

1456
01:26:00,528 --> 01:26:03,262
drumming 12/8-time blues
at the weekend

1457
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,698
at the Crown and Anchor.

1458
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,832
And you.

1459
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:08,702
Well, you would be
Dr. Brian May...

1460
01:26:08,704 --> 01:26:12,338
author of a fascinating
dissertation on the cosmos...

1461
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,776
that no one ever reads.

1462
01:26:14,744 --> 01:26:16,342
And Deacy...

1463
01:26:16,344 --> 01:26:18,146
for the life of me...

1464
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,017
nothing comes to mind.

1465
01:26:22,418 --> 01:26:24,316
I studied
electrical engineering.

1466
01:26:24,318 --> 01:26:25,821
Does that meet
your standard?

1467
01:26:26,754 --> 01:26:28,056
Perfect.

1468
01:26:36,064 --> 01:26:37,763
You just killed Queen.

1469
01:26:37,765 --> 01:26:41,001
Oh, give it a kiss one day.
She might wake up.

1470
01:26:41,003 --> 01:26:42,205
You need us, Freddie.

1471
01:26:43,339 --> 01:26:44,471
More than you know.

1472
01:26:44,473 --> 01:26:45,875
I don't need anyone.

1473
01:27:10,031 --> 01:27:11,166
<i>Hello?</i>

1474
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,867
Paul.
Can I speak to Freddie?

1475
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:16,502
Oh, Mary.
No, he can't talk right now.

1476
01:27:16,504 --> 01:27:18,571
He's working day and night,
constantly.

1477
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:20,274
Will you make sure
to tell him that I called?

1478
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:22,775
Don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

1479
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:24,746
I will certainly
tell him you called.

1480
01:27:26,013 --> 01:27:27,115
Cheers.

1481
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,965
Freddie, it's really great.

1482
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:46,035
It's shit!

1483
01:27:48,336 --> 01:27:49,401
Just leave it.

1484
01:27:49,403 --> 01:27:50,470
<i>Yeah,
hang on one second.</i>

1485
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:53,806
Give it more treble.

1486
01:27:57,179 --> 01:27:59,445
<i>Where is he? Is he
there? I wanna speak to him.</i>

1487
01:27:59,447 --> 01:28:01,347
He is working himself
to the bone.

1488
01:28:01,349 --> 01:28:03,783
I'm blue in the face trying
to get him to take a break.

1489
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:04,950
<i>Paul, listen to me.</i>

1490
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,919
<i>It's one performance
for a good cause.</i>

1491
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,590
It's a televised concert
for the famine in Ethiopia.

1492
01:28:09,592 --> 01:28:11,324
<i>They're gonna have
simultaneous performances</i>

1493
01:28:11,326 --> 01:28:12,659
in Philadelphia and London.

1494
01:28:12,661 --> 01:28:14,660
There's gonna be
a billion people watching.

1495
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:15,928
<i>Queen should be part of it.</i>

1496
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,096
<i>He's just been
really focused.</i>

1497
01:28:17,098 --> 01:28:18,633
<i>But I'll be sure
to pass it on.</i>

1498
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:21,603
Sure you will.

1499
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:26,599
Hi.

1500
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,037
Hi.
Come in, come in.

1501
01:29:30,772 --> 01:29:32,873
Why did you
come all this way?

1502
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:34,641
I just haven't heard
from you in so long,

1503
01:29:34,643 --> 01:29:36,676
and I phoned and phoned,
and then...

1504
01:29:36,678 --> 01:29:38,145
last night I just had
this terrible dream

1505
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:40,614
that something bad
had happened.

1506
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:43,115
No, no.
I've been working, that's all.

1507
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:46,485
Freddie, you're burning
the candle at both ends.

1508
01:29:46,487 --> 01:29:48,189
Yes, but the glow
is so divine.

1509
01:29:52,594 --> 01:29:54,026
Being human
is a condition

1510
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:56,898
that requires
a little anesthesia.

1511
01:29:58,032 --> 01:30:00,234
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

1512
01:30:00,236 --> 01:30:02,135
I miss you so much.

1513
01:30:02,137 --> 01:30:04,740
Listen, but I have to finish
the second album.

1514
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,742
I need you.

1515
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,642
Stay. Stay here with me.

1516
01:30:09,644 --> 01:30:11,347
Just you and me.

1517
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:14,049
I need the love of my life.

1518
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:19,455
Freddie...

1519
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:21,687
What about Queen?

1520
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:22,955
Jim told me he's been trying

1521
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:24,524
to contact you
about Live Aid...

1522
01:30:24,526 --> 01:30:26,394
and you won't
take his calls.

1523
01:30:27,696 --> 01:30:29,031
What is Live Aid?

1524
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:31,766
You haven't heard?

1525
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:33,867
Freddie,
it's the biggest concert

1526
01:30:33,869 --> 01:30:36,101
there's ever been
or ever will be.

1527
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:37,971
It's for the famine
in Africa.

1528
01:30:37,973 --> 01:30:40,407
Well, perhaps Paul thought
it wasn't a good idea.

1529
01:30:40,409 --> 01:30:41,775
A distraction from my work.

1530
01:30:41,777 --> 01:30:44,144
That's what's important,
that I finish this album.

1531
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:46,645
Stay with me, darling,
and I'll be all right.

1532
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:47,913
Freddie,
I can't stay with you.

1533
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:50,382
Of course you can.
I need you, Mary.

1534
01:30:50,384 --> 01:30:52,220
Freddie, I'm pregnant.

1535
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,035
How could you?

1536
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:10,106
How could I?

1537
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,506
Freddie, this has nothing
to do with you.

1538
01:31:13,508 --> 01:31:14,641
Come on. Let's get in.

1539
01:31:14,643 --> 01:31:16,309
I bought some nibbles.

1540
01:31:16,311 --> 01:31:17,510
Freddie.

1541
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:19,215
Sorry we're late.

1542
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:21,015
Mary.

1543
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:24,186
What a pleasant surprise.

1544
01:31:25,786 --> 01:31:28,520
Hans. Everyone, come in.

1545
01:31:28,522 --> 01:31:30,125
Milan,
make our guests comfortable.

1546
01:31:33,228 --> 01:31:36,363
I wish I knew
you were coming to stay.

1547
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:37,963
I'd have scrubbed the place.

1548
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:39,865
Actually, I'm not staying.

1549
01:31:39,867 --> 01:31:42,338
Wait. Mary, wait. Don't go.

1550
01:31:44,673 --> 01:31:46,842
You told me
you had a dream.

1551
01:31:47,843 --> 01:31:49,311
What was it?

1552
01:31:50,512 --> 01:31:53,349
I was trying
to talk to you, but...

1553
01:31:54,115 --> 01:31:56,615
it was like
talking to my father.

1554
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:59,053
You needed
to tell me something...

1555
01:32:00,022 --> 01:32:01,924
but you couldn't say it.

1556
01:32:03,457 --> 01:32:06,094
Because you had no voice.

1557
01:32:09,564 --> 01:32:12,932
Freddie, come and
say hello to our new guests.

1558
01:32:12,934 --> 01:32:15,168
They're dying to meet you.

1559
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,506
He'll be one second.

1560
01:32:19,174 --> 01:32:20,175
Mary!

1561
01:32:31,018 --> 01:32:33,388
I'm happy for you, Mary.

1562
01:32:34,856 --> 01:32:36,492
Truly, I am.

1563
01:32:41,362 --> 01:32:42,564
It's just...

1564
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:46,565
I'm frightened.

1565
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:49,235
Freddie,
you don't need to be.

1566
01:32:49,237 --> 01:32:52,638
Because no matter what,
you are loved.

1567
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,441
By me, by Brian,
Deacy, Roger...

1568
01:32:55,443 --> 01:32:57,012
your family.

1569
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:00,515
It's enough.

1570
01:33:01,616 --> 01:33:03,983
And these people...

1571
01:33:03,985 --> 01:33:07,020
they don't care about you.

1572
01:33:07,022 --> 01:33:09,491
Paul doesn't care about you.

1573
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:13,394
You don't belong here,
Freddie.

1574
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:16,899
Come home.

1575
01:33:21,303 --> 01:33:22,938
Home.

1576
01:33:46,294 --> 01:33:47,595
Freddie!

1577
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,903
What are you doing?
You'll catch your death.

1578
01:33:54,803 --> 01:33:57,606
Why didn't you tell me
about Live Aid?

1579
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,677
The Africa charity gig?

1580
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:04,644
It'll be an embarrassment.

1581
01:34:04,646 --> 01:34:06,215
I didn't wanna
waste your time.

1582
01:34:10,117 --> 01:34:11,950
You should have told me.

1583
01:34:11,952 --> 01:34:13,421
Of course I did.

1584
01:34:14,255 --> 01:34:15,321
You forgot.

1585
01:34:15,323 --> 01:34:17,957
You're always
forgetting things.

1586
01:34:17,959 --> 01:34:19,695
Come in now
and have a drink.

1587
01:34:24,031 --> 01:34:25,366
You're out.

1588
01:34:26,067 --> 01:34:27,269
What do you mean?

1589
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:31,506
I want you out of my life.

1590
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,075
'Cause I'm the only one left,

1591
01:34:36,077 --> 01:34:37,357
you're blaming me
for everything?

1592
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,448
I blame myself.

1593
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:43,285
So I'm out?

1594
01:34:43,884 --> 01:34:45,353
Just like that?

1595
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:48,957
After everything
we've been through?

1596
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:53,094
Just think of
the photos I have.

1597
01:34:54,027 --> 01:34:56,965
I know who you are,
Freddie Mercury.

1598
01:35:00,035 --> 01:35:03,138
You know when
you know you've gone rotten?

1599
01:35:05,473 --> 01:35:06,976
Really rotten?

1600
01:35:09,044 --> 01:35:10,512
Fruit flies.

1601
01:35:11,646 --> 01:35:15,347
Dirty little fruit flies.

1602
01:35:15,349 --> 01:35:18,217
Coming to feast
on what's left.

1603
01:35:18,219 --> 01:35:21,657
Well, there isn't much left
for you to feast on anymore.

1604
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:25,358
So, fly off.

1605
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,662
Do what you like with your
photographs and your stories.

1606
01:35:29,664 --> 01:35:32,401
But promise me one thing.

1607
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:35,704
That I never see
your face again.

1608
01:35:36,938 --> 01:35:38,307
Ever.

1609
01:35:39,573 --> 01:35:40,576
I didn't mean it.

1610
01:35:43,044 --> 01:35:45,247
I'm sorry!
Freddie, come back!

1611
01:35:46,147 --> 01:35:48,050
I'll make it better.

1612
01:36:03,298 --> 01:36:04,797
<i>But, Peter,
you might be right.</i>

1613
01:36:04,799 --> 01:36:06,065
<i>I'm not even hurt</i>

1614
01:36:06,067 --> 01:36:07,367
<i>by the fact that
he's let me go as a friend.</i>

1615
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:10,069
<i>But you can only be there
so much for a person.</i>

1616
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:11,738
<i>And so, Mr. Prenter...</i>

1617
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,605
<i>all these stories</i>

1618
01:36:12,607 --> 01:36:15,641
<i>about Freddie Mercury
and his lovers...</i>

1619
01:36:15,643 --> 01:36:17,278
<i>that there were so many.</i>

1620
01:36:17,812 --> 01:36:19,111
<i>Yeah?</i>

1621
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:21,113
<i>- Is it really true?
- Yes, it is.</i>

1622
01:36:21,115 --> 01:36:22,782
<i>His lovers were countless.</i>

1623
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,486
<i>Genuinely countless. Uh...</i>

1624
01:36:25,387 --> 01:36:29,087
<i>All these wild,
drug-fueled parties...</i>

1625
01:36:29,089 --> 01:36:32,525
<i>where he'd find
another lover every night...</i>

1626
01:36:32,527 --> 01:36:34,761
<i>and a routine
he couldn't get out of.</i>

1627
01:36:34,763 --> 01:36:36,663
<i>So, you really
did see behind the mask?</i>

1628
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,399
<i>I knew Freddie when
he did</i> Bohemian Rhapsody.

1629
01:36:39,401 --> 01:36:42,001
<i>And the Freddie we have now...</i>

1630
01:36:42,003 --> 01:36:44,069
<i>he doesn't have
the same passion about music.</i>

1631
01:36:46,006 --> 01:36:47,308
Hello?

1632
01:36:49,411 --> 01:36:50,412
Hello?

1633
01:36:50,879 --> 01:36:52,081
Miami?

1634
01:36:53,046 --> 01:36:54,114
Freddie?

1635
01:36:54,116 --> 01:36:55,181
<i>How are you?</i>

1636
01:36:55,183 --> 01:36:57,917
There was
this Africa concert...

1637
01:36:57,919 --> 01:36:59,851
that wants Queen to play.

1638
01:36:59,853 --> 01:37:01,520
<i>Is that still...</i>

1639
01:37:01,522 --> 01:37:02,654
You mean Live Aid?

1640
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:04,891
<i>They've announced
all the bands, Freddie.</i>

1641
01:37:04,893 --> 01:37:06,595
<i>It's too late.</i>

1642
01:37:07,795 --> 01:37:09,261
I need...

1643
01:37:09,263 --> 01:37:11,797
I need to reconnect
with the mothership.

1644
01:37:11,799 --> 01:37:14,100
Freddie, they don't want
anything to do with you.

1645
01:37:14,102 --> 01:37:16,371
<i>They're still very upset.</i>

1646
01:37:17,104 --> 01:37:19,105
Maybe if you ask them...

1647
01:37:19,107 --> 01:37:20,472
<i>they would meet me.</i>

1648
01:37:20,474 --> 01:37:22,577
<i>Tell them I want to talk.</i>

1649
01:37:23,411 --> 01:37:24,677
Just talk.

1650
01:37:28,817 --> 01:37:30,519
We're family.

1651
01:37:33,655 --> 01:37:35,157
You know, family...

1652
01:37:36,124 --> 01:37:37,793
have fights...

1653
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,396
all the time.

1654
01:37:41,896 --> 01:37:43,432
I can call.

1655
01:37:43,964 --> 01:37:45,400
Thank you...

1656
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:48,333
Jim.

1657
01:37:48,335 --> 01:37:50,236
<i>As this friend,
somebody who...</i>

1658
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:53,105
<i>probably knows Freddie Mercury
better than anybody else...</i>

1659
01:37:53,107 --> 01:37:56,612
<i>how would you describe him
inside as a person?</i>

1660
01:37:57,612 --> 01:37:59,578
<i>For me,
Freddie will always be...</i>

1661
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:02,213
<i>this frightened
little Pakkie boy...</i>

1662
01:38:02,215 --> 01:38:04,249
<i>who's afraid to be alone.</i>

1663
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:05,584
<i>I hope he sees this</i>

1664
01:38:05,586 --> 01:38:07,753
<i>and realizes
what he has lost in you.</i>

1665
01:38:07,755 --> 01:38:09,221
<i>I hope he does, too.</i>

1666
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:11,626
<i>A close and important friend.</i>

1667
01:38:27,642 --> 01:38:29,178
Where are they?

1668
01:38:29,777 --> 01:38:31,245
They're late.

1669
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,952
Hi, guys.

1670
01:38:39,954 --> 01:38:41,255
Jim.

1671
01:38:43,157 --> 01:38:45,057
If anybody wants
any tea, coffee...

1672
01:38:45,059 --> 01:38:46,460
bladed weapons...

1673
01:38:47,795 --> 01:38:49,231
just ask.

1674
01:38:50,932 --> 01:38:51,934
So...

1675
01:38:53,367 --> 01:38:54,699
who wants to go first?

1676
01:38:54,701 --> 01:38:55,870
I'll start.

1677
01:38:57,772 --> 01:38:59,305
I've been hideous.

1678
01:38:59,307 --> 01:39:01,440
I know that, and...

1679
01:39:01,442 --> 01:39:02,878
I deserve your fury.

1680
01:39:03,978 --> 01:39:05,347
I've been conceited...

1681
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,450
selfish.

1682
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,886
Well, an asshole, basically.

1683
01:39:13,888 --> 01:39:15,256
Strong beginning.

1684
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,591
Look, I'm happy to
strip off my shirt...

1685
01:39:18,593 --> 01:39:20,896
and flagellate myself
before you.

1686
01:39:23,697 --> 01:39:26,131
Or rather, I could ask you
a simple question.

1687
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:27,469
I'm good
with the flagellation.

1688
01:39:32,272 --> 01:39:35,041
What's it gonna take
for you all to forgive me?

1689
01:39:35,043 --> 01:39:36,945
Is that what you want,
Freddie?

1690
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,412
I forgive you.

1691
01:39:39,414 --> 01:39:41,282
- Is that it? Can we go now?
- No.

1692
01:39:47,254 --> 01:39:48,953
I went to Munich.

1693
01:39:48,955 --> 01:39:50,657
I hired a bunch of guys.

1694
01:39:50,659 --> 01:39:52,925
I told them exactly
what I wanted them to do...

1695
01:39:52,927 --> 01:39:54,362
and the problem was...

1696
01:39:57,197 --> 01:39:58,432
they did it.

1697
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:02,571
No pushback from Roger.

1698
01:40:04,071 --> 01:40:05,740
None of your rewrites.

1699
01:40:06,441 --> 01:40:08,309
None of his funny looks.

1700
01:40:12,847 --> 01:40:14,349
I need you.

1701
01:40:17,952 --> 01:40:19,553
And you need me.

1702
01:40:23,924 --> 01:40:25,157
Let's face it.

1703
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:26,894
We're not bad
for four aging queens.

1704
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:31,364
So, um, go ahead.

1705
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:33,335
Name your terms.

1706
01:40:34,768 --> 01:40:37,039
Could you give us a moment,
please, Fred?

1707
01:40:53,454 --> 01:40:55,020
Why'd you do that?

1708
01:40:55,022 --> 01:40:57,025
I just felt like it.

1709
01:41:09,003 --> 01:41:11,773
They'll be all right.
They just need a bit of time.

1710
01:41:13,573 --> 01:41:15,610
What if I don't have time?

1711
01:41:18,045 --> 01:41:19,848
What do you mean, Fred?

1712
01:41:25,652 --> 01:41:27,822
You can come back in now,
if you'd like.

1713
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,963
We decided...

1714
01:41:36,363 --> 01:41:37,566
What did we decide?

1715
01:41:38,099 --> 01:41:39,431
From now on...

1716
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:43,002
every song, no matter
who wrote it, music, lyrics...

1717
01:41:43,004 --> 01:41:44,503
it's by Queen.

1718
01:41:44,505 --> 01:41:47,006
Not one of us, just Queen.

1719
01:41:47,008 --> 01:41:48,908
All the money,
all the credits,

1720
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:50,810
split four ways evenly.

1721
01:41:50,812 --> 01:41:52,043
Done.

1722
01:41:52,045 --> 01:41:54,245
We have a problem
with the people around you.

1723
01:41:54,247 --> 01:41:55,648
Paul is out.
I fired him.

1724
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:57,983
- On what pretext?
- Villainy.

1725
01:41:57,985 --> 01:41:59,284
What else?

1726
01:41:59,286 --> 01:42:00,453
Bob Geldof.

1727
01:42:00,455 --> 01:42:02,521
I called to convince him
to squeeze you guys

1728
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:04,457
into the lineup
for the Live Aid concert...

1729
01:42:04,459 --> 01:42:06,426
but he wants an answer now.

1730
01:42:06,428 --> 01:42:08,530
You have to make a decision.

1731
01:42:09,964 --> 01:42:11,530
Every ticket's already sold.

1732
01:42:11,532 --> 01:42:13,432
100,000 people at Wembley...

1733
01:42:13,434 --> 01:42:16,668
100,000 people at
JFK Stadium in Philadelphia...

1734
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:20,306
a global TV audience around
the world of 150 countries...

1735
01:42:20,308 --> 01:42:22,141
13 satellites.

1736
01:42:22,143 --> 01:42:25,278
The Olympics only had three.

1737
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,312
We haven't
played together in years.

1738
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:28,814
It's kinda suicide
to play again...

1739
01:42:28,816 --> 01:42:30,682
for the first time
in front of millions.

1740
01:42:30,684 --> 01:42:33,687
Try over 1.5 billion.

1741
01:42:34,589 --> 01:42:37,355
"Who are
these four dinosaurs?"

1742
01:42:37,357 --> 01:42:38,858
"Where's Madonna?"

1743
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:41,463
It's a 20-minute set.
Everyone gets the same.

1744
01:42:41,963 --> 01:42:43,965
Jagger, Bowie...

1745
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,298
Elton...

1746
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:49,135
McCartney, The Who...

1747
01:42:49,137 --> 01:42:50,669
Led Zeppelin...

1748
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:53,575
Phil Collins,
REO Speedwagon...

1749
01:42:54,308 --> 01:42:55,941
Bob Dylan.

1750
01:42:55,943 --> 01:42:57,010
Certainly good company.

1751
01:42:57,012 --> 01:42:59,177
Anybody who is anybody
is doing this concert.

1752
01:42:59,179 --> 01:43:00,445
Look.

1753
01:43:00,447 --> 01:43:01,948
All I know...

1754
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:05,887
is that if we wake up
the day after this concert...

1755
01:43:06,487 --> 01:43:08,823
and we didn't do our part...

1756
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:13,028
we're going to regret it
till the day we die.

1757
01:43:20,101 --> 01:43:21,536
Please.

1758
01:43:28,576 --> 01:43:30,342
<i>Every day, in San Francisco,</i>

1759
01:43:30,344 --> 01:43:32,377
<i>two more men
hear the grim news...</i>

1760
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:34,046
<i>"You have AIDS,
there's no cure."</i>

1761
01:43:34,048 --> 01:43:35,914
<i>Since doctors
in France and America</i>

1762
01:43:35,916 --> 01:43:37,983
<i>isolated the virus in 1983...</i>

1763
01:43:37,985 --> 01:43:40,685
<i>research has proceeded
at a frantic pace.</i>

1764
01:43:40,687 --> 01:43:42,387
<i>The method used by the virus</i>

1765
01:43:42,389 --> 01:43:44,323
<i>to destroy
the body's immune system...</i>

1766
01:43:44,325 --> 01:43:45,691
<i>has been discovered...</i>

1767
01:43:45,693 --> 01:43:48,860
<i>but a cure still seems

Do you understand?

1781
01:45:01,035 --> 01:45:06,504
The way we go from here is
that treatments are available.

1782
01:45:06,506 --> 01:45:09,244
They're not particularly
effective, Freddie.

1783
01:45:35,335 --> 01:45:37,004
Eh-oh!

1784
01:45:46,013 --> 01:45:48,047
Eh-oh.

1785
01:46:21,982 --> 01:46:22,983
Yep.

1786
01:46:23,483 --> 01:46:24,783
Mmm-hmm.

1787
01:46:24,785 --> 01:46:26,187
- Let's call it. Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

1788
01:46:27,254 --> 01:46:28,288
Sorry.

1789
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:30,191
I sound like shit.

1790
01:46:31,692 --> 01:46:34,195
You all are lovely,
you sound good.

1791
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:36,595
Been a while.

1792
01:46:36,597 --> 01:46:38,698
My throat feels like
a vulture's crotch.

1793
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:40,733
We still got a week.

1794
01:46:40,735 --> 01:46:41,900
We'll get there.

1795
01:46:41,902 --> 01:46:43,802
Yeah, we're in
a good place, Fred.

1796
01:46:43,804 --> 01:46:45,874
You just need a bit of rest,
that's all.

1797
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,043
Yeah.

1798
01:46:48,576 --> 01:46:49,742
Get a drink, Rog?

1799
01:46:49,744 --> 01:46:50,909
Yeah,
there's a nice little pub

1800
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:52,811
- down the road, actually.
- Can I come?

1801
01:46:52,813 --> 01:46:53,878
We're just an exclusive...

1802
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,748
No, of course not.
Invite-only.

1803
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,815
Yeah,
that's kind of you.

1804
01:46:56,817 --> 01:46:58,386
Before you leave...

1805
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,687
Could I have a second?

1806
01:47:02,689 --> 01:47:04,726
Yeah. What's up?

1807
01:47:07,561 --> 01:47:09,097
I've got it.

1808
01:47:10,999 --> 01:47:12,233
Got what?

1809
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:14,334
AIDS.

1810
01:47:16,403 --> 01:47:18,772
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

1811
01:47:20,008 --> 01:47:21,873
Fred, I'm so sorry.

1812
01:47:21,875 --> 01:47:23,441
Brian, stop.

1813
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:24,812
Don't.

1814
01:47:27,348 --> 01:47:29,515
For right now...

1815
01:47:29,517 --> 01:47:30,650
it's between us.

1816
01:47:30,652 --> 01:47:32,787
All right? Just us.

1817
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,055
So, please...

1818
01:47:35,822 --> 01:47:37,922
if any of you...

1819
01:47:37,924 --> 01:47:41,793
fuss about it or frown
about it, or, worst of all...

1820
01:47:41,795 --> 01:47:44,062
if you bore me
with your sympathy...

1821
01:47:44,064 --> 01:47:46,131
that's just seconds wasted.

1822
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:48,967
Seconds that could be used
making music...

1823
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:51,837
which is all I want to do
with the time I have left.

1824
01:47:51,839 --> 01:47:54,907
I don't have time
to be their victim...

1825
01:47:54,909 --> 01:47:58,377
their AIDS poster boy,
their cautionary tale.

1826
01:47:58,379 --> 01:48:01,182
No, I decide who I am.

1827
01:48:02,282 --> 01:48:05,352
I'm going to be
what I was born to be.

1828
01:48:06,653 --> 01:48:08,854
A performer...

1829
01:48:08,856 --> 01:48:11,492
who gives the people
what they want.

1830
01:48:15,862 --> 01:48:18,332
Touch of the heavens.

1831
01:48:21,434 --> 01:48:23,772
Freddie fucking Mercury.

1832
01:48:25,839 --> 01:48:27,976
You're a legend, Fred.

1833
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:33,345
You're bloody right I am.

1834
01:48:33,347 --> 01:48:35,748
We're all legends.

1835
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,483
But you're right,
I am a legend.

1836
01:48:37,485 --> 01:48:39,318
Now, you give me a chance

1837
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,023
to get my bitchy little
vocal cords in order...

1838
01:48:43,589 --> 01:48:44,957
and we'll go and punch a hole

1839
01:48:44,959 --> 01:48:47,028
through the roof
of that stadium.

1840
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:50,596
Actually,
Wembley doesn't have a roof.

1841
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:54,800
- All right.
- No, he's right. It doesn't.

1842
01:48:54,802 --> 01:48:57,304
Then we'll punch a hole
in the sky.

1843
01:49:02,543 --> 01:49:04,909
Now, even though you're crying
like three little girls...

1844
01:49:04,911 --> 01:49:06,145
I still love you.

1845
01:49:06,147 --> 01:49:07,279
- All right, enough of this.
- All right.

1846
01:49:07,281 --> 01:49:08,681
- Drink?
- Yes!

1847
01:49:08,683 --> 01:49:09,884
Or ten?

1848
01:49:26,334 --> 01:49:27,836
What are you looking at?

1849
01:49:29,001 --> 01:49:30,604
You think
you could do better?

1850
01:49:32,606 --> 01:49:33,739
Everyone's a critic.

1851
01:49:33,741 --> 01:49:35,407
<i>It's 12:00 noon in London.</i>

1852
01:49:35,409 --> 01:49:37,176
<i>7:00 a.m. in Philadelphia.</i>

1853
01:49:37,178 --> 01:49:40,044
<i>And around the world,
it's time for Live Aid.</i>

1854
01:49:40,046 --> 01:49:41,413
<i>If you have
credit cards...</i>

1855
01:49:41,415 --> 01:49:43,047
<i>you can phone up with
the number you want to give.</i>

1856
01:49:43,049 --> 01:49:45,251
<i>But you can also pledge cash,
and it's very important.</i>

1857
01:49:45,253 --> 01:49:46,985
There is not enough money
coming in...

1858
01:49:46,987 --> 01:49:48,619
and all these people
are not playing

1859
01:49:48,621 --> 01:49:49,989
for the good of their health.

1860
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:51,856
They're playing for the good
of other people's health.

1861
01:49:51,858 --> 01:49:53,659
So get your money out now!

1862
01:49:53,661 --> 01:49:55,459
And phone up
and give us the money.

1863
01:49:55,461 --> 01:49:57,863
You've got plenty of it,
or if you got none of it...

1864
01:49:57,865 --> 01:50:00,065
get it to people
who are dying of starvation.

1865
01:50:00,067 --> 01:50:02,935
We want to get a million
pounds out of this country.

1866
01:50:02,937 --> 01:50:05,604
<i>On the telephone,
before 10:00 tonight.</i>

1867
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:26,190
Do you have any idea...

1868
01:50:26,192 --> 01:50:29,328
how many Jim Huttons
there are in London?

1869
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:31,696
Well, I didn't want to make it
too easy for you.

1870
01:50:33,634 --> 01:50:36,200
How have you been, Freddie?

1871
01:50:36,202 --> 01:50:38,438
I've been a bit lost,
to be honest.

1872
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,739
You were right.

1873
01:50:40,741 --> 01:50:42,410
I could do with a friend.

1874
01:50:43,376 --> 01:50:45,444
Would you like
to have tea with me?

1875
01:50:45,446 --> 01:50:46,447
Tea?

1876
01:51:00,126 --> 01:51:02,461
So, Jim,
how do you know Freddie?

1877
01:51:02,463 --> 01:51:05,066
Do you work together?

1878
01:51:15,977 --> 01:51:17,545
Jim's my friend.

1879
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:25,083
Wonderful to have friends.

1880
01:51:25,085 --> 01:51:27,688
Mithai. Jer made it herself.

1881
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:31,657
Thank you.

1882
01:51:31,659 --> 01:51:33,659
- Freddie?
- Your favorite, Freddie.

1883
01:51:33,661 --> 01:51:34,892
We have to go, Mum.

1884
01:51:34,894 --> 01:51:36,093
But you just got here, <i>beta.</i>

1885
01:51:36,095 --> 01:51:37,296
What do you mean, "go"?

1886
01:51:37,298 --> 01:51:39,465
We've gotta get to Wembley.

1887
01:51:39,467 --> 01:51:40,966
Would you believe it?

1888
01:51:40,968 --> 01:51:43,401
Jim's never been
to a rock concert.

1889
01:51:43,403 --> 01:51:44,269
That's true.

1890
01:51:44,271 --> 01:51:45,870
Queen are
playing at Live Aid.

1891
01:51:45,872 --> 01:51:46,939
We're all doing our bit

1892
01:51:46,941 --> 01:51:48,774
for the starving children
in Africa...

1893
01:51:48,776 --> 01:51:51,112
and nobody's
taking any money.

1894
01:51:56,217 --> 01:52:00,121
Good thoughts, good words,
good deeds.

1895
01:52:02,255 --> 01:52:04,358
Just like you taught me, Papa.

1896
01:52:19,705 --> 01:52:20,707
Love you, <i>beta.</i>

1897
01:52:22,075 --> 01:52:24,112
Bye, Kash.
Love you, too, Mama.

1898
01:52:27,347 --> 01:52:28,582
In fact...

1899
01:52:29,616 --> 01:52:30,850
I'll blow you a kiss

1900
01:52:30,852 --> 01:52:32,487
when I'm on stage.

1901
01:52:39,759 --> 01:52:41,161
Kashi...

1902
01:52:42,196 --> 01:52:44,032
put on the telly.

1903
01:53:04,918 --> 01:53:06,552
- Hello, Mary!
- Hi, Brian!

1904
01:53:06,554 --> 01:53:08,220
We just came
to wish you good luck.

1905
01:53:08,222 --> 01:53:09,624
Hello, my love.

1906
01:53:11,925 --> 01:53:13,426
Hi.

1907
01:53:13,428 --> 01:53:14,592
Mary, David...

1908
01:53:14,594 --> 01:53:16,028
this is Jim.

1909
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:17,462
Jim...

1910
01:53:17,464 --> 01:53:18,598
Mary and David.

1911
01:53:19,866 --> 01:53:21,436
It's nice to meet you.

1912
01:53:21,936 --> 01:53:23,603
- Hi.
- Hi.

1913
01:53:24,638 --> 01:53:25,639
I'll see you after.

1914
01:53:28,474 --> 01:53:30,074
I don't think
you're gonna be able to see

1915
01:53:30,076 --> 01:53:31,611
anything from here.
Join them.

1916
01:53:44,491 --> 01:53:47,562
What do we think of David?

1917
01:53:51,064 --> 01:53:52,332
Nice chap.

1918
01:53:54,567 --> 01:53:55,868
I think he's gay.

1919
01:53:57,405 --> 01:53:59,874
<i>We'll be on
in about one minute.</i>

1920
01:54:00,874 --> 01:54:03,177
<i>One, two. One, two.</i>

1921
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:05,543
That's almost us.

1922
01:54:05,545 --> 01:54:06,878
We ready?

1923
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,779
Feel good?

1924
01:54:08,781 --> 01:54:09,715
<i>So we have had</i>

1925
01:54:09,717 --> 01:54:11,419
<i>a bit of a complaint
about the noise.</i>

1926
01:54:15,455 --> 01:54:17,657

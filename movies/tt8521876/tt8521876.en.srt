<i>Some people gravitate towards no.</i>

00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,916
<i>Some people naturally lean towards yes.</i>

4
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,625
<i>I said yes to everything.</i>

5
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,041
Oh.

6
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,375
I'm up! Yes!

7
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,291
Come on! Hop on!

8
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,833
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

- Allison?
<i>- And when I met Carlos...</i>

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,750
- You're Allison?
- Yes.

11
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,166
I think I got your coffee.
I took a sip. You mind?

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,041
<i>...it was like finding a partner in yes.</i>

13
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,125
<i>- Arepa pabellón.
- Arepa parió.</i>

14
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,250
<i>- Pabellón.</i> Yeah.
<i>- Pabellón. </i>Yeah.

15
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,291
Hey, should we play hooky
and go to the beach?

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,375
Yes! I'm ready.

17
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,750
- You think? Yeah.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,708
Do you wanna meet my parents?

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,750
Oh, yeah, I wanna meet your parents.

20
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,375
Wanna go rock climbing?

21
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,750
Allison!

22
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,375
I'm coming! Carlos! Carlos!

23
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,458
I'm coming. Come here. Come. Come.

24
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,416
<i>Yes was like
the theme of our relationship.</i>

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,333
- Allison, do you take Carlos...
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

26
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,125
- Carlos, do you take...
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

27
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:50,041
<i>And although having kids is
the best thing that's ever happened to us...</i>

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,166
...<i>no became the new yes.</i>

29
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:56,958
Oh, no, no, no.

30
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:01,291
- Four, three, two, one.
- No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

31
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,791
<i>But no is part of the job.</i>

32
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,416
<i>No is the light.</i>

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,291
<i>- No is the answer.
- </i>Hey! No! No, no, no!

34
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,083
Come on! Layla's parents let her!

35
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,750
No, no, no, no, no. Ah-ah-ah. No.

36
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,666
Okay, guys, screen time's over.

37
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,000
- Wait, no, no. Wait. Five more minutes.
- Nope.

38
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,666
Hey! Mom! Mom, Mom. Mom, Mom!

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,833
<i>Saying no 50 times an hour?</i>

40
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,750
No! Absolutely not!

41
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,833
Nope on a rope!

42
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,375
Nando?

43
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,375
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh.

44
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,333
Katie, you're kidding me.
You've done half of your homework.

45
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:31,958
No!

46
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,166
No way, no how, not by a long shot,

47
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,291
under no circumstances,
not in a million years, no!

48
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,541
<i>It's called parenting.</i>

49
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,666
Hey, Cheryl, how's it going? Good morning.

50
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,625
Hey, listen, I have a quick question.

51
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,208
Um, I have a job interview this afternoon.

52
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,750
I was wondering if you could take Ellie
for a couple of hours after school?

53
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,875
What about the Girl Scouts?

54
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,708
Okay, put us down
for three boxes of Samoas.

55
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,875
Tagalongs? Who likes Tagalongs?

56
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,333
Okay, put me down. Ten boxes.

57
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Cheryl Nelson is shaking me down.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,208
Yep, I'll... I'll wait.

59
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,916
Mom? Fleekfest? Dad said
he's okay with me going if you are.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh, he did?

61
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,833
Wait, you're going to a freak fest?

62
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,250
Awesome.
You can finally be with your people.

63
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,250
It's called Fleekfest.
It's a music festival. It's cool.

64
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,000
I guess if you think it's cool,
I'm sure it's super cool.

65
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,291
- Did you hear what I asked?
- Yeah, you're 14.

66
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,708
You can't go without a parent.

67
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,750
Hi. You can? I'll put a blue note and
the check in her backpack. Thank you.

68
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,500
Nobody wants to go
to a music festival with their parent.

69
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,083
Dad, please help! Mom.

70
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,458
What... What? She said no?

71
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,625
Mm-hm.

72
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,833
If your mother says no, it's no, sweetie.

73
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,333
Really? Don't you mean if <i>we </i>say no?

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,416
Guys? Watch this.

75
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,125
I think I put the right amount
of baking soda in this time.

76
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,000
Get ready for a waffle volcano
in three, two...

77
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,333
Must've mixed the catalyst wrong.

78
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,625
You'll get it next time.

79
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,333
Can I sign your math homework?

80
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,125
Duh. Yeah, you can sign all my homework,
except for math. Whoops.

81
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,666
- You told me you finished everything.
- Hey, don't worry.

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,000
I get by on my charm.

83
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,583
Honey, I'm gonna stop by the gym
after work, okay?

84
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,833
I need to keep sculpting the Carlos.

85
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,750
- Tonight? You're stopping by the gym?
- Yeah. Tonight.

86
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,500
- Really? Tonight?
- Tonight.

87
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Oh. Tonight? No, no, not tonight.
No, tonight is, um, is our...

88
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,791
- Your... The kids'... Uh...
<i>- </i>Come on.

89
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,000
- Anniver... Birthday? Soccer?
- Really? Come on. You can do it.

90
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,666
- Parent-teacher night, Daddy.
- Ah. That one. Yeah.

91
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,291
I don't understand how you can
open this refrigerator ten times a day

92
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,208
and not see this beautiful calendar.

93
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,833
Eh, because it's gotten
a little over-complicated.

94
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,875
- It hurts my eyes.
- Growing up, things were simple.

95
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,916
You wake up, go to school or work,
and then you have to...

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,333
I know how to twerk.

97
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,958
- Does she mean <i>twerk </i>twerk?
<i>- </i>"To work," not "twerk." Is she twerking?

98
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,041
She totally is.

99
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,333
- No!
- Not side to side, Ellie. Up and down.

100
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,875
- Let me show you.
- Katie. No.

101
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,458
- Do you want me to...
- No!

102
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,958
Really loosen your hips.

103
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,916
Nobody's loosening their hips. Child!

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
Really pop it, Ellie.

105
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,666
Carlos, help me out!

106
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,291
Yo. You gotta shake your body.

107
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,916
Come on. Pop it, Ellie!

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,416
Nobody's popping it! We are late!

109
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,208
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

110
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,041
Yes!

111
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,083
The catalyst!

112
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,583
I mean, I'm so sorry.

113
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,541
You can put on your music if you want,
Daddy. I don't mind.

114
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,833
- Really, honey?
- Yup.

115
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,708
Okay. Thank you.

Bad news, Lay.
Mom gave a thumbs-down to Fleekfest.

<i>What?</i>

<i>Never mind.</i>

I don't get it. I took you two
to Taylor Swift a couple of years ago.

130
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,791
We had a blast.

131
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,833
I was 12 then. I was a little tween.

132
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:33,208
Dad said I could go. He believes in me.
He knows I can handle myself.

133
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:38,541
Your dad just wants to be the good guy
because he knows that I will say no.

134
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,875
And I do believe in you.

135
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,500
It's just that
concerts like Fleekfest bring out

136
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,458
a whole world of people
you have not been exposed to yet.

137
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,125
And it's not gonna happen
without a parent.

138
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,791
Well, when will I be able
to go to concerts alone?

139
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,875
Never. You will always have to go
to concerts with me your whole life.

140
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,916
- Even when I'm your age?
- Especially when you're my age.

Okay, I better... I better turn it down
for the school drop-off.

161
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,541
I don't wanna go to school today.

162
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
I don't wanna drop you off, but I have to.

163
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,291
You have to go to school,
and I have to go to work.

164
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,458
- No.
- Yes.

165
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,375
- No.
- Yes.

166
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,291
- No.
- Yes.

- Yes.

- No.
- Yes.

169
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,500
No drones inside, for the 50th time!

170
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,583
Sorry, Mom.

171
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,916
Oh.

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey, Mr. Torres.
I... I promise this never happens.

173
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,458
Look. Hey, I fixed it.
It's working. I fixed...

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,875
Guys. Guys, it's too loud.

175
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,875
Guys! Joan?

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Guys! Guys!

177
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,125
It's still way too loud.

178
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,041
But the ads are going to say
these speakers will melt your brains.

179
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,291
- That wouldn't hold up with a waiver.
- Fine.

180
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,708
Boo.

181
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,208
My job is to keep us from getting sued.
Bring the decibel level down.

182
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,958
Also, you're not supposed
to bring food in a testing area.

183
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,083
I have to ask you
to throw the McGriddle away.

184
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,208
Joan? Both of you.

185
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,791
Mine's finished.

186
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,958
Look, I hate saying no, but it's my job.
Okay?

187
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,625
- Mrs. Torres? Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,828
You were VP of marketing at Kulger Food?

189
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,291
For a long time. I loved that job,

190
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,708
but then I had kids,
and for a while, it was just too much.

191
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,750
I bet you're better at multitasking.

192
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,083
I never stopped working.
I just stopped getting paid for it.

193
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,958
I get it. I mean, I'm a mom too.

194
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,708
Yeah. Of course you are.

195
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:51,333
I mean, call me crazy,
but this feels so nice.

196
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,666
What do you think?

197
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,833
Listen, I would love to hire you
for something. I would, but...

198
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,000
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- Allison, this is an entry-level position.

199
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,250
I mean, I'm looking
for some entitled millennial

200
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,250
who I'd keep here until 10:00 every night.

201
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,166
Every night.

202
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,011
Who I could watch cry
while eating a gluten-free burrito

203
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,666
and hashtags,
"Hurt feelings. This job is so unfair."

204
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,083
I wouldn't want to do that to you.

205
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,333
I like you too much.

206
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,916
I like you too.

207
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:24,000
- I'm sorry about the job, honey.
- Oh, it's fine.

208
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,916
I don't know that I'm still passionate
about marketing anyway.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,375
Not enough to cry
into my gluten-free burrito.

210
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,625
Hey. If I'm gonna go back to work,

211
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,041
I need to make sure
our kids are okay without me first.

212
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Oh.

213
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,291
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Torres.

214
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,000
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you. We're getting two for one.

215
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,916
I guess we'll be home early.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,416
Is this about Nando's grades?
Because we are working on focus...

217
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,666
Uh, it's not about Nando's grades,
although, uh, they're not great.

218
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,666
Oh. Getting better.

219
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,375
We wanted to meet with you together

220
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,625
because, uh, we've noticed a common theme
in Katie and Nando's schoolwork.

221
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,458
What's the common theme?

222
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,666
Well, here's a haiku
Katie wrote in my English class.

223
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,125
"A caged bird am I.

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,291
My mother, my sweet captor.

225
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,333
Mother, let me fly."

226
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,708
"Mother, my sweet captor.

227
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,875
- Mother, let me fly.<i>"</i>
- Five, seven, five. She nailed it. Haiku.

228
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,750
I didn't think much of it at first,

229
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,750
until Mr. Chan told me about a video
that Nando made for his history class.

230
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,125
He made a video? That's pretty cool.

231
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,541
Let's just have a look at the video.

232
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,333
<i>The following program
is intended for mature audiences only.</i>

233
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,666
<i>It contains violence,
adult language, and nudity.</i>

234
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,166
<i>Viewer discretion is advised.</i>

235
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,958
Don't worry. There's no nudity.

236
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,333
Oh, okay.

237
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,416
Phew.

238
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,333
<i>Stalin, Mussolini,</i>

239
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,583
<i>and Mom.</i>

240
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,583
<i>My mother might not have
had anyone tortured or killed...</i>

241
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,875
Not yet.

242
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:58,791
Oh.

243
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,000
<i>...but in our house,
she's no less of a dictator.</i>

244
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,750
So now I'm a dictator.

245
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,208
<i>I'm not asking twice, Nando.
You will do what I say, when I say it.</i>

246
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,250
<i>I'm your mother. I don't need a reason.</i>

247
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,833
I don't, so...

248
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,625
<i>Her goal, maximum oppression.</i>

249
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,833
<i>You're not going
till you finish your homework.</i>

250
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,416
I mean, that's parenting.

251
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,500
<i>Stop. It's like </i>1984 <i>in this house.
Big Mother is always watching.</i>

252
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,083
<i>I like that nickname. It's tough.</i>

253
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,375
<i>Why can't Miss Hoffling
ever assign a happy book?</i>

254
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,500
Okay. They are depressing.
Have you ever read<i> Little Women?</i>

255
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,041
She gets scarlet fever.

256
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,125
- <i>The Little Prince?</i>
- He has no family.

257
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,125
Harry Potter's an orphan.
There are no happy books.

258
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,916
<i>Don't walk away from me.</i>

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
<i>Ow!</i>

260
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,208
<i>Nando!</i>

261
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,708
Where are you going?

262
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,125
Oh, come on, honey. You can make
anyone look bad with editing.

263
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,458
- You make me look bad.
- Me? Why me?

264
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,000
Because you get to be
the fun dad everybody loves,

265
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,583
and I am stuck being the bad cop.

266
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,375
You didn't see the dad
as the villain in that video, did you?

267
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,958
It'll probably get uploaded to YouTube.
Then I'll just be the viral psycho mom.

268
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,333
How'd you get to be the fun one?
I was the fun one.

269
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,166
Look, Ally,
I am the bad guy all day at work.

270
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,458
Every time I walk into that office,
people stop laughing and leave the room,

271
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:30,458
but when I come home, the kids,
they actually smile when they see me.

272
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah. Well, it's not fair.

273
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,666
I hear myself with the kids, and
I think I wouldn't even hang out with me.

274
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,083
I'm so sorry. I have a suggestion.

275
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:44,375
Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.
I was just eavesdropping or spying.

276
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,625
There are so many parents out there,
and I come in here to hide,

277
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,083
and then I got really hungry,
so I made a huge thing of tots.

278
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,375
Would you guys care for a tot?

279
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,750
Do you want a tot? A hot tot?

280
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,500
Come here. Have a hot tot.

281
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,375
Have a tot. They're perfectly lukewarm.

282
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,500
Who are you?

283
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,750
It's Mr. Deacon.
Katie and Nando's guidance counselor.

284
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:09,500
Yes, but thanks to budget cuts,
I'm also the PE teacher/football coach.

285
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,333
Go, Cougars! Shoot the layup
for the touchdown.

286
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,541
I don't know anything about sports.
No, I was a science major.

287
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,458
I specialized in the gastrointestinal
behavior of field mice.

288
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,500
But I do know
a thing or two about parenting,

289
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,041
both professionally and personally.

290
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,750
I have six beautiful kids at home.

291
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,958
Timmy, Tommy, Tonya,
Tanya, Tyson, and Doug.

292
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,875
How come you look like
you're just back from Tahiti?

293
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,708
You want to know what my secret is?

294
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,583
I give my kids Yes Days.

295
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,041
Yes Days? What's a Yes Day?

296
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,875
You pick a day
in the not-too-distant future,

297
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,500
and for 24 hours, you say yes
to everything that your kids want.

298
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

299
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,041
- Are you serious?
- What, you say yes to everything?

300
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,791
Well, you set some ground rules.

301
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,791
They can't ask for
something in the future,

302
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,791
and they can't kill anybody, obvi.

303
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,916
Hum.

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,458
I know it sounds crazy,
but it is a true game changer.

305
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:17,083
They liberate kids
and give them a rare sense of autonomy,

306
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,625
and it sets the parents free too.

307
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,791
Yeah, Mr. Coach Deacon,

308
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,666
I would love to just
take a day off from being a mom

309
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,666
and let my kids do whatever they want,

310
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,333
but I'd also love to find
a rainbow unicorn and fly it to the moon.

311
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,750
Then I think you'd want a pegasus.

312
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,208
More of a pegacorn.

313
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,083
The point is, you don't know our kids.

314
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Oh, these tots have turned.

315
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,458
If we tried what you're proposing,

316
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,125
it... it would be apocalyptic.

317
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,166
You're right. I don't know your kids.
I don't know everything,

318
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,250
but...

319
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,666
I will say this.

320
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,166
You should say yes to a Yes Day.

321
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
Ooh! Meatloaf!

322
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,166
"Kids who are given Yes Days
consume less sugar,"

323
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,500
not really,
"and spend less time on the Internet."

324
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,875
It doesn't make sense.
You're not falling for this?

325
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,416
Everything happens for a reason.

326
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,458
Maybe there's a reason
that guy showed up with those tater tots.

327
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:21,458
Maybe by being a little less serious,
we can make things better.

328
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,166
I mean, you said it yourself.

329
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,375
We've been trying to do it the right way.
Maybe it's time to try something new.

330
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,458
So? Tired of hearing how great I am?

331
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,333
You want to give
Steven Spielberg here a Yes Day?

332
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,791
What's a Yes Day?

333
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,500
This new thing where parents agree

334
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,958
to say yes to everything
their kids ask for for 24 hours.

335
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,291
- Radical!
- How am I just hearing about this?

336
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,875
Well, don't get too excited.
Mom probably won't let us have one anyway.

337
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,041
Well, what does that mean? Why wouldn't I?

338
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,916
Yes Days are, like, fun.

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,708
And you're, like, a fun killer.

340
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,791
- Oh.
- Come on, Katie, your mom is plenty fun.

341
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,291
She is fun.

342
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,750
I have had a very long day,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

343
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,625
- So, good night.
- No, we...

344
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,791
We still need to...

345
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,708
- It's okay.
- Honey? Tell your mom she's fun.

346
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,875
- Nando?
- You told us never to lie.

347
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,958
Yeah, Daddy.

348
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,041
Hey, guys.

349
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,416
Hey.

350
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,291
Of course you think your mom can't be fun.
You don't even know me.

351
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,625
I invented fun. I... I used to be
the funnest person I knew.

352
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,125
What happened?

353
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,250
What happened was I had three babies
that had to be kept safe and alive.

354
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,458
It was a lot of pressure,
but that's not the point.

355
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,916
The point is, I can be fun again.

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,375
Mom, really? There's no way.

357
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,083
I'll have a Yes Day.

358
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,875
We will have a super time.

359
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,791
Just you watch and see.

360
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,291
Mama can haiku too.

361
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Sorry, but you couldn't make it through
a Yes Morning, let alone a Yes Day.

362
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,750
Would you like to have
a little wager on that?

363
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,916
Know what? I'd love to.

364
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
Hm. How about this?

365
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,750
If you say no one time,

366
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,708
I get to go to Fleekfest with Layla.
No adults, no parents.

367
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,375
Just us young, underage, vulnerable girls.

368
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,083
Wait, honey. Are you sure?

369
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,291
I'll take your wager, missy,

370
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,500
because I know that I won't say no.

371
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,916
And when you lose, and you will lose,

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,166
I am so fun that
you will still get to go to your concert.

373
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,041
- Really?
- Absolutely.

374
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,166
With me.

375
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,375
I'll sit next to you,
and we'll hold hands.

376
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,618
We'll put our hands in the air
like we just don't care.

377
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,750
I want in on this.

378
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,250
Me too.

379
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,375
Let's do this.

380
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,208
<i>Arriba!</i>

381
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,583
<i>There are ground rules, though.
The Yes Day has to be earned.</i>

382
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,916
<i>Do your chores.</i>

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,583
<i>Finish your homework.</i>

384
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,666
You can do better.

385
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:19,250
<i>You can't ask to do anything
dangerous or illegal, obviously.</i>

386
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,333
- What are you guys up to over there?
- Don't worry. It's totally safe.

387
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,083
<i>You'll each have a budget,</i>

388
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,750
<i>and you can't ask to travel
more than 20 miles from home.</i>

389
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:38,333
So this rules out Magic Mountain,
Japan, and all space tourism.

390
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:42,333
Will you have to say yes
to absolutely everything?

391
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,208
Close, but there are some rules.

392
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,458
Oh man!

393
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,125
Yes, bud.

394
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,708
<i>But the last rule is the biggest,</i>

395
00:19:54,791 --> 00:20:00,333
<i>that this family has the most fun
we've ever had in our entire lives.</i>

396
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,833
Any second. Any second.
Any second. Any second. Any second.

397
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,041
It's Yes Day!

398
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,416
Everybody, wake up!

399
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
All right.

400
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,541
Come on, you sleepyheads. Get up! Come on.

401
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,125
Nando, it's too early.
We have the whole day. Go back to bed.

402
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,041
Mom?

403
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,333
- Having regrets, Mom?
- Mom?

404
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,416
Look, she's so afraid,
she can't even move.

405
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,375
What?

406
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
Who's ready for Yes Day? Whoo!

407
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,500
What've you done with our mother?

408
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,791
You know my rule
about no bouncing on the bed?

409
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,000
Wanna bounce on the bed?

410
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,875
- Yes!
- Sure!

411
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,500
Do it! Do it!

412
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,125
I know you're too mature. It's okay. Whoo!

413
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,291
- This is so much fun!
- Nando!

414
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,541
Oh hi!

415
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,458
- Get up!
- No!

416
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,375
Get up!

417
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,541
- Wake up!
- No! Get off!

418
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,708
Yes Day!

419
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,625
<i>Baste!</i>

420
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,083
Sorry, guys, no screen time today.

421
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,958
- Are you serious?
- Sorry, Mama.

422
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,375
The entire day you can't use anything
that has a screen.

423
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,583
That means no cell phones,
no laptops, no iPads, nada.

424
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,375
What? Can I at least tell them
that I'll be off the grid?

425
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,916
- Please?
- I'm not the boss.

426
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,291
Okay, fine. You have one minute.

427
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,958
- Starting 30 seconds ago. Come on!
- Okay, okay!

428
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:23,541
Hey, hey, don't ship the speakers
until I get regulatory approval.

429
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,625
Yeah, the speaker...
You know what? Forget it. I'll text you.

430
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,916
Sorry, Dad. Time's up.

431
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,666
You knew to be prepared.

432
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
And we are so glad
that you're so prepared.

433
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,458
Ellie wants to get you dressed
and do your hair and makeup.

434
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,958
I have a vision.

435
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,791
Oh, but I have this shirt.

436
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,416
- Sorry.
- Ah.

437
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,458
I'm... I'm glad
you're using your watercolors.

438
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,916
Really get it everywhere.

439
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,208
- That's a great way to blend.
- Yeah.

440
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,291
- Really? You want to use glitter?
- Yep.

441
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,833
Really? She's gonna use glitter?

442
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,916
Should we make you look
as crazy as possible?

443
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,041
Yes.

444
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,958
- Should Nando skate in the house?
- Yes.

445
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,791
Do you think we should get a dog?

446
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,791
- Hang on, that's in the future. Nice try.
- Okay.

447
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,083
- Oh yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah! I love it! That is it.

448
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,166
- We love that one.
- No.

449
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,250
No, no, no!

450
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,541
- Still not right!
- Oh, come on, Ellie, that's perfect.

451
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,791
That's the one!

452
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,458
<i>♪ Bum-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dum ♪</i>

453
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you like it, Daddy?

454
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,875
I love it.
This is the best makeover I've ever had.

455
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,125
How many makeovers have you had?

456
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,041
Before this one?

457
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:38,958
None.

458
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,166
Oh. Nice job, Ellie.

459
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,500
- Thank you.
- What's that?

460
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,583
We made a list of our five big asks.

461
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,375
For the day to be a success,
we have to make it through all five.

462
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,833
I love a list.

463
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:51,916
Number one!

464
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,250
- Is that Korean?
- Breakfast surprise!

465
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,375
To the Explorer!

466
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,750
- We gotta change first, right?
- No!

467
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,916
- Katie?
- Right?

468
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,083
Nope on a rope.

469
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,291
Hey, kids, what is it
with the sparklies around number five?

470
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,583
The main event.

471
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,416
The only thing that
we can tell you about it is nothing.

472
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,375
Not even a hint?

473
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,125
The less you know, the better.

474
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,083
Oh, okay.

475
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,833
I'll be gone for the main event.
I'll be at Fleekfest.

476
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,500
It's gonna be so much fun!

477
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,125
I've been memorizing all the lyrics to
the H-E-R songs, and they're really good.

478
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,083
Mom, it's H.E.R.

479
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,708
Oh, H.E.R.? Okay.

480
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,851
- Who's H.E.R.?
- This is H.E.R. on the radio.

481
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,708
She's the headliner for Fleekfest.

482
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,041
You know,
Katie and my girls' night tonight.

483
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,208
You're not going.

484
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,500
Layla's cousin Julie's taking us.
I told her she could have the ticket.

485
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:40,583
Oh, you might want to tell Layla's cousin
Julie not to get her hopes up.

486
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,125
Last time I checked, it was a bet,
and I'm gonna win.

487
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,208
No, you're not.

488
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,416
Yeah, I am.

489
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,166
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
- No. Not like that.

490
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,750
- So embarrassing.
- Yes. Yes.

491
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,041
- Hi, we're celebrating our first...
- No! You can't tell him it's Yes Day.

492
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,458
Okay.

493
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,666
Oh, coffee.

494
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,333
Ah, breakfast.

495
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,333
Hi. Where's the carnival?

496
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,583
Looks like Burning Man.

497
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,708
What can I get you?

498
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,291
Some acai bowls? Smoothies?

499
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,333
- Yes.
- We'd like that one, please.

500
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,875
The Gut Buster?

501
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,208
Yeah, definitely!

502
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,666
Hey, it's $40.

503
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,291
Not if you finish it in under 30 minutes.
Then it's free.

504
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,666
- That is true.
- What's in the Gut Buster?

505
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,791
Ice cream!

506
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,083
- Oh boy. I wanted a cappuccino.
- Oh my God. Wow.

507
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,625
Are you ready for this?

508
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,892
- Okay.
- Yes!

509
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,796
There's blueberries.
I love blueberries.

510
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,708
I want it.

511
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,916
So you must eat everything
inside the bowl and on the plate,

512
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,041
including ice cream, brownies,
waffle cones...

513
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:41,958
What is this?

514
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,541
Oh, just a standard contract.

515
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,083
And how many people
have lost their eyeballs?

516
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,083
You mean this month? Or all time?

517
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:51,958
He's a lawyer.

518
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,583
- Oh, is he?
- Yeah, I'm a lawyer.

519
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,166
- You have 30 minutes to finish this.
- Okay, ready.

520
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,208
I am looking forward to this.

521
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,791
Ready, set, go, go, go!

522
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,083
Ellie, go! Ellie, keep eating.

523
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,552
You guys are doing great,
but you have to pick up the pace.

524
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,250
It's a lot of ice cream.

525
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,375
Let's go! Keep it moving!

526
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,833
- Brain freeze!
- Help your brother.

527
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,458
The clown from your birthday party.
Snakes in the toilet. Summer school!

528
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,291
- Scaring's for hiccups.
- Hold his nose!

529
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,458
- Pull hard on your tongue!
- Also for hiccups!

530
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,791
Come on, family!

531
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,625
I can't do this anymore.
It's getting gross.

532
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,916
I'm gonna explode.

533
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,083
I'm full.

534
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,291
Jeez, Dad.
You're like a human ice cream vacuum.

535
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,458
I saw him eat like this once
at a HomeTown Buffet when we were dating,

536
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,083
and I knew it would pay off.

537
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll take your spoon.

538
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,041
Daddy! Daddy!

539
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,458
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

540
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,166
Daddy! Daddy!

541
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,791
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

542
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,916
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

543
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,916
Ten, nine,

544
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,958
eight, seven, six,

545
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,458
five, four, three, two, one!

546
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,833
Do you believe in miracles!

547
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,375
Are you feeling okay?

548
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,000
- That was so beautiful.
- Is it coming up?

549
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,708
Uh, section 10 of the contract says
vomiting voids the win.

550
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:15,458
- Keep it down, babe. You can do it.
- Think of the family reputation.

551
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:16,625
Settle it right down.

552
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,500
Don't think of anything gross,
like beef sticks.

553
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,750
- You can do it.
- It's up to you.

554
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,958
There's a bucket there.

555
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,916
- I'm good.
- He's fine. You got this.

556
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,916
You have to hold it. Ah.

557
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh.

558
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,250
Well, we're officially losers.

559
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,333
Oh, make it stop.

560
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,666
- I am sorry.
- Yeah, that doesn't sound good.

561
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,541
He didn't throw up! He didn't throw up!

562
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,208
It came out the other end!

563
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,041
You did it!

564
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,666
Okay, kids.

565
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,125
Look at your father. Look at this man.

566
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:56,333
He is going down as a Yes Day legend.

567
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes, but no more food, please, not today.

568
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,541
Dad, it's gonna be super chill.

569
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,625
It's relaxing.

570
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:02,875
And sanitary.

571
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,666
What could be sanitary?

572
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,750
I don't know.

573
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,250
- Are we buying toilets?
- Oh no.

574
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,916
Oh, now this is what I'm talking about.

575
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,958
A car wash is like being reborn.

576
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,125
This is exactly what I needed, kids.
Thank you.

577
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,291
- Yes.
- Yeah.

578
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah. This one's easy.

579
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,541
Hey, guys. One more thing.

580
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,583
- Windows down!
- What?

581
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,458
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
- What?

582
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,875
Well, you have to. It's Yes Day.

583
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,416
What do we do?

584
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,666
I don't know. It's your car.

585
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:50,208
Come on, Mom. You can say it.
One word. Two letters. N-O.

586
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,916
Windows down!

587
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,458
No, no, no, no, no!

588
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,916
Oh my God!

589
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:15,791
Oh!

590
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,583
Mommy, your makeup!

591
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,041
Yes Day! Oh my gosh!

592
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,458
Yes! Yes! Yes!

593
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,625
Yes Day!

594
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,541
I don't have to shower for a week!

595
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,208
You don't already!

596
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,833
- Will we make it through this day?
- They might be trying to kill us.

597
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,583
Ew. Nando, you're...

598
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,625
- Ugh.
- Gross!

599
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,625
An unexpected plus
of a windows-down car wash,

600
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,333
the mystery smell is finally gone.

601
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,333
I'd love to know where I'm driving.

602
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:10,291
Oh, sorry, Dad. The rules say
you're not allowed to know.

603
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,125
Stop asking so many questions.

604
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,416
Oh, and, guys, so, new activity,

605
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,083
new clothes.

606
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,708
Here you go, Katie.

607
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,583
And this is for Dad.

608
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,333
Are we starting a dance crew?

609
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,375
You wish we were starting a dance crew.

610
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,478
Seriously, what are we doing?

611
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,625
Are those water balloons?

612
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,333
Kablowey!

613
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,736
- Yeah!
- What's Kablowey?

614
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,750
It's capture the flag meets paintball
meets a butt ton of Kool-Aid.

615
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:45,375
A game Katie learned at camp. We played
once with the kids in the neighborhood.

616
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,750
Yeah, Mom was the first one out.
It was so embarrassing.

617
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,583
Only true warriors survive Kablowey.

618
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:53,708
- It was a disaster.
- Oh, but not today. Today we'll Kablowey.

619
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,041
- Today we'll Kablowey.
- Yes!

620
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,250
Where did you come up
with all of these people?

621
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:02,750
We told them there'd be a casting director
for a new, sexy, romantic reality show.

622
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,416
That's you, Mom.

623
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,958
Yeah,<i> Insatiable Island.</i>

624
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,000
Come on, guys. Hey, guys!

625
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:14,041
<i>Insatiable Island?</i> All right.
I'm in it to win it. Let's do this!

626
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,666
Hey.

627
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,958
Mr. Torres! You're on a Yes Day!

628
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,083
- Way to go!
- Yeah, yeah. What are you doing here?

629
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,875
Nando asked me to be here. Yeah.

630
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,875
- I'm gonna referee.
- You don't know anything about sports.

631
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:29,541
I don't know anything about sports,
but you can't say no on a Yes Day, right?

632
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,208
Okay, get in your spot.

633
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,666
Any of you jocks scared?

634
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,250
Well, you should be!

635
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:41,541
Anybody who wants to go home
to their mommy, now's your chance.

636
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,166
Sir?
Who should I give my headshot to, sir?

637
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:50,500
Sir, I was a runner-up season 12
on <i>The Bachelorette,</i> in case that helps.

638
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,375
I was, uh, season 9.

639
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,458
Season 13.

640
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,333
Whatever!

641
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,708
Each team has a color of flag to protect.
The goal is to catch the other team's flag

642
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,250
without getting hit
by their Kool-Aid balloons.

643
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,458
If you get Kablowey-ed, you're eliminated.

644
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,166
When one team has all the flags,
game's over.

645
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,458
Now, let's play some Kablowey!

646
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,916
- Big Blue! Big Blue!
- What? What?

647
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,625
- Break it down.
- What?

648
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,541
Okay.

649
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,875
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

650
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,958
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

651
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,750
That's enough of that.
That's a little awkward for everyone.

652
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,250
All right, guys, here we go.

653
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:28,166
Get your team's flag
and protect it like it's tots!

654
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,291
On the count of three,
I want you to charge!

655
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,708
Three, two...

656
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,416
Wait. No, I screwed that up. Sorry.

657
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,583
One, two...

658
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,208
three!

659
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,166
Mom's our strongest enemy.

660
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,125
Let's go get her!

661
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,333
Don't worry about red.

662
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,625
My husband's on defense.

663
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:06,208
Don't worry about green. Katie's smart.
She's gonna go after her dad. Run!

664
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,708
Okay, guys. Okay, just...
Defense is the key. Okay?

665
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,375
Wait out here. Let them eliminate
each other. I know what I'm doing.

666
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,041
Go, go! Red team. Red team.
My dad's team first!

667
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,541
This is gonna be easy.

668
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,375
You with the hair thing, outta here!

669
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,666
You in the headband, you're out!

670
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,958
The other headband.

671
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,583
- Should we take a selfie?
- Yeah, sure.

672
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,833
- Sweet.
- Tag me on Insta, 'kay?

673
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:38,291
- One, two, three. <i>Insatiable Island!</i>
- Yeah!

674
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,875
Red team, what are you doing?
It's a bloodbath!

675
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,041
Half your team is eliminated!

676
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,625
Hold on. Change of strategy.
Run for your life. Billy, get out of here!

677
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,750
I love the smell
of Kool-Aid in the morning.

678
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,708
Wait a minute.
We're taking too many losses!

679
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:06,916
You're out!

680
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:10,375
Too many casualties! Go back! Fall back!

681
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,500
Fall back, team!

682
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,250
New strategy.

683
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,250
Ma'am. Hi, my name's Eric.

684
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,916
- I'm here to make muscles, not friends.
- I'm more shredded. Check this out.

685
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,166
I have a very relatable body.
It's great for TV.

686
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,666
For TV. <i>Insatiable Island.</i>
Put your clothes on.

687
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,833
We're getting killed. I need that bag.

688
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,750
Load me up with ammo!

689
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,458
- Get her ammo!
- Bring it!

690
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:33,291
Blue, who wiped your bottoms
when you were babies?

691
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,625
- My mom!
- Our moms!

692
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,833
- Who tied your shoes when you were babies?
- Our moms!

693
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,458
Fight for your mom!

694
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,000
- Go, Blue!
- Go, Blue!

695
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,000
Nando, look out!

696
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,833
Nice job, Commander Ellie.

697
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,041
Yay!

698
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,416
You're out!

699
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,708
Go!

700
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:04,708
Do you see them?

701
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,125
Destroy my beautiful children!

702
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,333
Oh.

703
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,875
You are going down!

704
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,583
Oh, this is bad.

705
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,583
You wanted to make me a warrior?

706
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,458
I'm a warrior!

707
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,958
Listen, I think we need to team up
to take her out.

708
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,916
Deal.

709
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,125
Is that fair?

710
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:24,041
All's fair in love and Kablowey.

711
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,375
Go for it.

712
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,250
That was perfect. It's messing her up.

713
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,958
- Yeah.
- Are you playing dirty, Nando?

714
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,500
I don't see her. Where is she?

715
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,125
Do you see which way she went?

716
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:51,791
No, I didn't. Let's go.

717
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,750
Mom!

718
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,416
Yeah!

719
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,041
Oh wow! You got Kablowey-ed.

720
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,958
- Ah!
- Ha-ha! You're done!

721
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Mrs. Torres got the red flag!

722
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,500
If she gets the green flag, she wins!

723
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,541
- How'd you let that happen?
- What?

724
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,250
Hey, Brian,
can I use your phone for a sec?

725
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,833
I just gotta deal with a work thing.

726
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,083
Will you put in
a good word with your wife?

727
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,166
Sure.

728
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,208
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.

729
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:55,375
Mom, come on. It's over.
You don't even have any balloons left.

730
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,666
Then why is there fear
in your eyes, daughter?

731
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,500
No, no, you have more fear.

732
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,208
<i>Tú.</i>

733
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,375
<i>No. ¡Tú!</i>

734
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,375
<i>- ¡Tú!
- ¡Tú!</i>

735
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,541
Wait!

736
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:44,000
That's my mom! That's my mom!

737
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,083
Whoo! We did it!

738
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,958
Blue forever!

739
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,666
Whoo!

740
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,208
Yeah!

741
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,583
We shipped the nano-cams?
We don't have clearance yet.

742
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,541
Tell Alan to issue a recall.

743
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,958
- Daddy?
- Honey.

744
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,708
- Were you talking on a phone?
- No. Phone? No, no.

745
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:06,625
I was just out here looking at...
Taking in the nature. I love nature.

746
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,333
- Well, it looked like you were.
- Nope, I wasn't.

747
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,791
- No.
- Daddy, do you hear that?

748
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,791
- What?
- It must be coming from that bush.

749
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,333
- Oh.
- Oh.

750
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,750
Oh, she fell out of her nest.

751
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,958
Yeah.

752
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,416
We have to put her back.

753
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,041
- What?
<i>- </i>I thought you loved nature.

754
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,041
Yeah, honey, but it's a very tall tree.

755
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,625
If you help the birdie, Daddy,

756
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,333
I won't tell anyone
I saw you talking on a phone.

757
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,791
Wait, wait. Ah.

758
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,500
Come on, Daddy! Hurry up!

759
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,791
Oh, they're a family again, honey.

760
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,833
Yay, Daddy!

761
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:06,291
It was actually a good idea, honey.
Thank you.

762
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,416
What's this?

763
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,583
She thinks you're stealing her babies!

764
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,541
We were just trying to help!

765
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,541
Ah. Ah!

766
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,041
Allison, baby!

767
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,416
Allison!

768
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,125
- Come down, Daddy!
- I'm coming down, honey!

769
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,125
Ooh. You okay, Daddy?

770
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,750
Yeah, honey.

771
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,583
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

772
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,666
I'm okay.

773
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,500
Oh my God! Stop!

774
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,166
Stop! Call your mom!

775
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,916
Wow, that was amazing.

776
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,875
See? I'm not always a fun killer.

777
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,500
Well, not today you aren't.

778
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,291
Mom, there's no way
you'll make it through the day.

779
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,125
- I'm still saying yes, aren't I?
- Call 911!

780
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,000
- Allison!
- Is that Dad?

781
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:08,958
Yup, that's him.

782
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,958
Your brother's taking you
to get dry ice, right?

783
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:17,125
We're good. By the way,
so many people are coming tonight.

784
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,541
It's gonna be awesome.

785
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,916
<i>Fantastic.</i>

786
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,958
Are you sure you need
that much baking soda?

787
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah, it's a better catalyst.

788
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,666
Trust me. I'm an expert on catalysts now.

789
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,875
- Allison! Call 911!
- I'll have to call you right back.

790
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,958
Call 911!

791
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,833
We need a doctor, stat!
There's been a horrific bird attack.

792
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:44,333
What? Do I have rabies?

793
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:48,458
No, this hospital sucks, so I exaggerated
a little to goose 'em. No pun intended.

794
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,375
- She's kidding. You're kidding, right?
- Sure.

795
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,541
Here's a waiting room.

796
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,125
- Katie, you are in charge.
<i>- </i>Okay.

797
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,833
Everybody stay with her,
so I can find you later.

798
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:59,375
- Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Stay. It's okay.

799
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,791
Okay, Mr. Torres, you can relax.

800
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,208
The scratches are superficial.
You'll be fine.

801
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:08,500
Oh good. So no concussion,
no rabies, no bruises? He's good to go?

802
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:09,416
He's in the clear.

803
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,583
- I'll send in a nurse to discharge you.
- Thank you.

804
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,250
- You're okay. That's great.
- Yeah.

805
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,666
I will get the kids,
and you take your time.

806
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,833
Honey, I hate to be a party pooper,
but my body's done.

807
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,750
Can we finish this another day, please?

808
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,208
Really?

809
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:29,916
Yeah.

810
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,833
Yeah, I guess if you're not feeling well,
of course we'll go home.

811
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,791
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

812
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,250
Maybe I'll pop by the office,
then go home and crash.

813
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,250
- Sorry. What'd you say?
- Hm?

814
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,416
Maybe I'll pop by the office.

815
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,666
So you don't feel well enough
to finish this day for our family,

816
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,375
but you do feel well enough
to pop by the office.

817
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,625
It's a little crisis
that happened this morning.

818
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:58,625
Carlos, you want to cancel this day,
that's your choice,

819
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,041
but you're telling the kids.

820
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,375
It's your turn to be the bad guy.

821
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,416
Oh, Mrs. T. Hey, get this.

822
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,208
I told Karen I'd give her a Yes Day,
and she doesn't even want it.

823
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,208
We have an ambulance with a siren.

824
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,750
Think of the possibilities.

825
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,833
Grow up, Jean. Seriously.

826
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,500
How about you lighten up, Karen?

827
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,083
Take a chill pill.

828
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,083
Are you okay?

829
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:33,000
Yeah, I... I just got into a fight
with my husband.

830
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,166
Ah, and you want me to beat him up?

831
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,208
No, nothing like that.

832
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,541
Give him a wedgie?

833
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:42,375
No, no. It's just that today was
the first day in, like, a year

834
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,125
where I felt like
we were really in it together.

835
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,291
- Yeah.
- And then he just had to go and be a wuss.

836
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,291
Sounds like Karen.

837
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:53,416
She's mad because I took our life savings
and bought a fleet of ambulances.

838
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,458
I barely know how to drive this one.

839
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,416
But you can't force people to change.

840
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,125
You gotta do what works for you,

841
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,208
and he can either join the party,
or it's his loss. You know?

842
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,000
That's so true.

843
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,083
Oh.

844
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,041
Hey, guys.

845
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,958
Honey, can I talk to you for a second?

846
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,583
Yeah.

847
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,208
Look, I... I feel real bad.

848
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,125
I don't want to be the spoiler here.

849
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,208
Well, don't feel bad.
You are not the spoiler. You do you.

850
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,583
You can either come to this party or not.

851
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,666
Okay?

852
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,791
Hey guys, let me see what you got.
Big ask number four. Let me see.

853
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:32,250
Okay, number four. Putts N' Stuff.

854
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,333
That'd be very cool.
We'd have a great time.

855
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,375
But it does not compare

856
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,458
to Magic Mountain!

857
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,666
- What?
- Whoo!

858
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,958
But wait. What about the distance rule?

859
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,958
I've decided to make an exception.

860
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,250
And your dad has something
he wants to say.

861
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:51,291
Go ahead, Dad.

862
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,333
Well, guys, I'm feeling, um...

863
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,166
I'm... I'm feeling a little...

864
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,708
I'm feeling a little bit sick.

865
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,166
You're sick?

866
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,416
Are you going home?

867
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:12,625
I think I might be coming down
with Magic Mountain fever!

868
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:14,291
Whoo!

869
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,166
- But how are we gonna get there?
- Yeah.

870
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:22,041
Because the SUV is at the Kablowey field,
and even with traffic, it'll take forever.

871
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,458
Uh, duh. It's Yes Day!

872
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,541
Are we ready
for some roller coaster madness?

873
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,166
- Yes!
- Yeah!

874
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,041
Just so we're clear,
if an emergency comes in,

875
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,458
I gotta leave you on the side of the road.

876
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,833
Whoa!

877
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,125
- What if <i>we're </i>the emergency?
- Oh God.

878
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,791
Good one.

879
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,250
Oh boy. Hold on.

880
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,833
All right, you guys can make fun of me
if you want, but I brought clean clothes.

881
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,333
- Oh my gosh!
- Just in case!

882
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:55,791
- Thank you so much, Mom.
- That is a nice mom.

883
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,166
I know you hate when I dress you.
I took a stab.

884
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,375
Beats smelling like Kool-Aid, so...

885
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,708
Whoa!

886
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,458
It's Magic Mountain, baby!

887
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,333
Whoa!

888
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:07,500
Eyes on the road, please.

889
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:08,791
Got it. My bad.

890
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,583
Attention, park visitors.

891
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:24,375
The Torres family is here
for this Yes Day,

892
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:28,166
and I want you to say yes
and you to say yes. That is right.

893
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:34,125
It's all about those yeses,
so get ready for some fun!

894
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,583
Okay, guys. Can someone bring me a snack?

895
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,791
You gotta say yes.

00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:29,041
It's really nice to get out of the house,
with everyone.

941
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:32,000
And we have to do it more
'cause you are growing up.

942
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,500
We have to take advantage.

943
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,333
I'm gonna get cotton candy. You want some?

944
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,916
No. Thanks, honey.

945
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,291
Oh, hey, Katie. Your... Your...

946
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:53,791
Great.

947
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:02,666
I need you to text Layla right away

948
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,500
that her cousin isn't taking you
to Fleekfest. Your mother is.

949
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,958
What?

950
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,333
- Stay here with your sister. Okay?
- Okay.

951
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:12,708
She's trying to hook you up
with some older guys.

952
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:15,291
- Why were you checking my phone?
- You left it there.

953
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,750
You're overreacting
because I can't control what Layla sends.

954
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:23,458
She was responding to a text you sent.
"Guys at my school are so boring."

955
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:24,583
You were snooping.

956
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:27,125
Once I saw the picture,
yeah, I opened your phone.

957
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,041
Dad, can you please back me up here?

958
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,875
I know you want your independence.
I get that I'm the bummer,

959
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,208
but let me be clear, Katie.

960
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,625
If I don't take you
to the concert tonight, you aren't going.

961
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,375
- I'm done with Yes Day. I'm done.
- Oh, well, you're grounded.

962
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:48,375
I can't believe I let you fool me into
thinking you actually changed.

963
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,666
You really don't trust me.

964
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,125
It isn't about trust.
It's about being your parent.

965
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,666
Please, give me a break.

966
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,833
What's happening is I don't need you
anymore, and you can't handle it.

967
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,250
Katerina.

968
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,333
Enough.

969
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,733
Take your siblings to the carousel.

970
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,333
Go now.

971
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,916
Guys, come on.

972
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,958
- Where are we going?
- Carousel.

973
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:28,583
This is the best day ever!

974
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,625
- Yay!
- Yay!

975
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,500
- Yay!
- Yay!

976
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,000
- Yay!
- Yay!

977
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,416
Don't you guys get it?

978
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,375
Mom and Dad are just using this day
to take control of us.

979
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,000
They think by giving us a Yes Day,

980
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,125
we'll do what they want
for the rest of our lives.

981
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,208
Nuh-uh.

982
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,625
Yeah, nuh-uh.

983
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,916
It's all a big con.

984
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,500
If today's just a big con, I hope
I get conned for the rest of my life.

985
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:52,875
Yeah. Me too.

986
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,583
Cardinal rule.
I shouldn't have looked at her phone.

987
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:58,791
No wonder she was mad.

988
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,458
But it was right there,
and there was a picture of a boy.

989
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,541
Ugh, I hate when she hates me.

990
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,958
She doesn't hate you.
She's just individuating.

991
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,541
Individuating? It's annoying.

992
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:13,541
I just hope she understands
that it all comes from a place of love.

993
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,375
- I know.
- Don't you?

994
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,458
She's just our little girl.

995
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:18,791
She's not that little.

996
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:23,041
Look at that gorilla.

997
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:25,916
It looks like the one
Katie used to walk around with.

998
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,666
She called him "Mr. Golilla."

999
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,250
Oh yeah,
I remember it got really filthy.

1000
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,458
Well, yeah, it had its own car seat.

1001
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,708
We took it everywhere,

1002
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,750
and she was so cute with her pigtails

1003
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,958
and her overalls
and a heart on the pocket.

1004
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:38,875
Yeah.

1005
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,041
Back when she loved me
and was my little buddy.

1006
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:41,958
I know.

1007
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:45,000
- What do you say? You wanna play?
- No, it's fine. Thank you.

1008
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,416
Carlos, I wanna play.
I'm gonna win Katie that gorilla.

1009
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,416
- Then she won't be mean to me.
- You sure?

1010
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

1011
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,291
I would like to win that, please.

1012
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,041
You'll have to beat this nice lady.

1013
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,416
Oh, okay. Hi. How are you?

1014
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:02,875
I need to win this pink gorilla
for my daughter, Katie. We're in a fight.

1015
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,625
What if...
What if I want to win that gorilla?

1016
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,625
I already have
the blue and brown gorillas.

1017
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:08,875
Now I need a pink one.

1018
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,958
Oh. Well, just go easy on me, okay?
Just, girl code.

1019
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:16,916
- Katie's not five years old anymore, okay?
- I know she's not.

1020
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,208
When she sees the gorilla,

1021
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:21,291
she'll know I'm her mama
and remember everything I've done for her.

1022
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,708
All right, ready?

1023
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:26,291
- I think that we should go.
- Don't distract me. I'm on a mission.

1024
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,625
Ready?

1025
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,208
Toss!

1026
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,541
You're going down, lady.

1027
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,500
Ooh, it's so close!

1028
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:42,125
This is for driving her retainer
three hours to camp.

1029
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,166
This is for peeing every time I sneeze.

1030
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,750
- Will you be quiet?
- Okay, let's be good sports.

1031
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,166
This is for making me
sleep-train you three times.

1032
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,250
Shut up!

1033
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:55,291
- It's for my daughter, Katie!
- Quiet!

1034
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,500
I did it. Don't mess with Mama.

1035
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,958
No. No, no.

1036
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,083
I won.

1037
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:07,000
What? I just won.
I've never won anything. I just won.

1038
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,625
No, I won by, like, a nose.

1039
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,750
Ah.

1040
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,291
Come on. We all saw it. She won.

1041
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,750
It was me. I won.

1042
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,333
- Miss Cheetah?
<i>- </i>What?

1043
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:17,250
Can you tell her that I clearly won?
I was like a sniper.

1044
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,291
I <i>am </i>a freaking sniper, okay?

1045
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:23,250
- No, you are not. I won that gorilla!
- Honey!

1046
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,708
- I'm staying out of this.
- It's not worth it!

1047
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,041
This is my gorilla!

1048
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,375
You cheating suburban soccer mom!

1049
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:34,583
Hey! No, don't do this!
I got tickets here. Play again, okay?

1050
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:38,000
I shouldn't have to win it again.
You're a lawyer. You know about justice!

1051
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:40,958
That's my wife!

1052
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,000
Get down!

1053
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,083
Security!

1054
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:45,791
You...

1055
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,916
No! Lady, please, no!

1056
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,500
Calm down!

1057
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:55,166
Why does this keep happening to me? Honey.

1058
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,791
For my baby, give me the "golilla."

1059
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,750
If you are such a great mother,
then where are your kids?

1060
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,000
No!

1061
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,208
Don't talk to me about my kids!

1062
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,416
Let go, lady!

1063
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,559
- Carlos, get this "golilla" for me!
- Let go!

1064
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,625
Is that all you got?

1065
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:13,833
It's for my baby!

1066
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:19,875
- Where is that woman? Where is the...
- No, honey, stop! No, you...

1067
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
- Who's watching our kids?
- I love the law. It's why I'm a lawyer.

1068
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,351
- Profile.
- Ellie usually has a snack around now.

1069
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,309
- Thumb.
- But there are laws, and <i>laws.</i>

1070
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,625
- Ma'am?
- There are organic smoothies in my bag.

1071
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,250
- Stand still, please.
- Oh.

1072
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:38,875
- Can I do that again?
- Chin up.

1073
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,375
Go ahead, Antonio.

1074
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:46,333
I put the picture of the bad guy
right here so that I will find you.

1075
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,791
- Whatever you look like.
- Can you make him bald?

1076
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,208
Oh, I don't know. Can I

1077
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
make him bald? You know what I'm saying?

1078
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,125
He looks like you.

1079
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:55,333
Wait, what?

1080
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,250
I want a beard.

1081
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,458
Me too, you know?

1082
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:00,583
Oh, you mean... Oh, yes.
Sorry. I should've known. Uh...

1083
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:02,666
Let's see.

1084
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,184
- Nice soul patch, brother. Snap it. Okay?
- Thank you.

1085
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,333
Do you have mohawks?

1086
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:07,851
- I do.
- Give him a mohawk.

1087
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,666
Okay, wait. Uh, ha, ha!

1088
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,375
Can you make him a pirate?

1089
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:13,458
Oh, that's too elaborate, you know?

1090
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,625
It would take a really awesome officer to...

1091
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,916
- Uh-oh.
- Whoa!

1092
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Captain Poopypants right here.

1093
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,583
Pirate Town. Pirate Town.

1094
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:22,625
I mean, it <i>was </i>your gorilla, honey.

1095
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,250
- Thank you. It <i>was </i>my gorilla.
<i>- </i>Yes.

1096
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,958
I hope you're happy, ya cheater.

1097
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,708
You know what, honey? I don't think
you're mad about the gorilla.

1098
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:33,791
Really?

1099
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,666
Watching you with Katie...

1100
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,416
You're amazing.

1101
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,666
Hm.

1102
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,000
That's being a parent.

1103
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,083
All I've done is
force you to do the hard stuff, right?

1104
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,250
You don't need help from a Yes Day.

1105
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,208
What you need is a partner.

1106
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,166
That's what I'll be from now on,

1107
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:57,833
your partner.

1108
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,375
I love you, my love.

1109
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:04,416
Me too, my love. So much.

1110
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,666
Come on. Hey! Good news.
We're getting out of your hair.

1111
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,291
- Nana and Pop-Pop came to take us home.
- Those are cute nicknames.

1112
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:22,208
And really quickly,
I just wanted to say how sorry I am

1113
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:25,791
that you had to meet our parents this way.
They really are good people,

1114
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:26,875
just bad judgment.

1115
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,958
Oh, it's not your fault. You hear me?

1116
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,250
Where is Nana and Pop-Pop?

1117
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,166
What?

1118
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,000
So where is Nana and Pop-Pop?

1119
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,458
They're waiting in the car.
Yeah, they're waiting in the car.

1120
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,166
Our Pop-Pop's sciatica...

1121
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,041
really bad flareup.

1122
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:44,708
Oh <i>Dios mío, </i>no. Oh my God.
That sounds terrible. I am so sorry.

1123
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:47,791
- He's brave. Don't make him wait.
- We're gonna go. Thank you.

1124
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,958
I will sign you guys out. Best of luck.

1125
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,416
Thank you. Bye.

1126
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,458
I'll be lonely without you,
but don't worry.

1127
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,916
I have other friends.

1128
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:58,875
Hey, Julie.

1129
00:55:58,958 --> 00:55:59,833
Hey.

1130
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:03,041
Dude, I cannot believe
your parents are in jail.

1131
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,125
It's crazy, right?

1132
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,750
Are we really just gonna
leave Mom and Dad?

1133
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,458
It's not our fault
they got put in the clink on our Yes Day.

1134
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,041
But we're not supposed
to get rides from strangers.

1135
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,125
Okay, well, you guys know Layla,

1136
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,125
and Julie is Layla's cousin.

1137
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,541
I mean, look, they even put in a car seat.

1138
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,166
Think of the upside to this.

1139
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,750
Now your big main event
can be even bigger.

1140
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,333
- Awesome.
- What is this?

1141
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:36,458
What's with all the tubes and buckets?

1142
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,333
- It's just a nerd party. Hey, guys!
- Nando!

1143
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:42,250
I feel like this is something
that we should have talked...

1144
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,083
Hey, wait up!
Let's get the party started!

1145
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,875
You look pretty!

1146
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Thanks, Ellie.

1147
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,250
I can't go.

1148
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,333
What?

1149
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:13,416
I can't go.

1150
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:16,625
I'm sorry. I can't leave them.
What if something happens?

1151
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,708
I'm the oldest. It's my responsibility.

1152
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:22,166
But you've wanted
to go to this concert forever.

1153
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:25,416
And we're gonna be fine.
We won't make poor decisions. Promise.

1154
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,916
Promise to text me if something happens?

1155
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,833
Absolutely.

1156
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,083
Come on, Katie.
The guys are already there.

1157
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,208
Okay. Okay.

1158
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,416
Be safe, please.

1159
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,875
- Are the kids okay?
- Yes.

1160
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,708
And I have some phenomenal news.

1161
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,250
The park's not pressing charges.

1162
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,333
- Thank God.
- Yes!

1163
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:55,250
They looked at some security footage,
and it turns out you did win the gorilla.

1164
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,625
I knew it.
I knew I won this gorilla. I knew I...

1165
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,708
Okay.

1166
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,125
- Does she get to go too?
- In a little bit.

1167
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,208
Oh.

1168
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,125
Oh gosh. Here, you have it.

1169
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:10,458
You take the "golilla."

1170
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:12,541
You won it fair and square.

1171
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,517
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1172
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,541
Let's go.

1173
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,000
- Katie?
<i>- </i>Nando?

1174
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,666
Ellie? Where are our kids?

1175
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,500
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Nana and Pop-Pop picked them up.

1176
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,666
Nana and Pop-Pop live in Pittsburgh.

1177
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,791
But they're here on vacation?

1178
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:33,166
- No, they're not.
- You let our children leave by themselves?

1179
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,708
You see, when you say it out loud,
I... I realize that it was a mistake.

1180
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:37,625
Oh no.

1181
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:46,583
Can you believe this?

1182
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:50,166
We are actually pulling it off.
I'm gonna go check on the big surprise.

1183
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,333
Yeah. Okay. I'll see you over there, man.

1184
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:03,000
Who's ready to make some science miracles?

1185
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,291
- Name?
<i>- </i>Hailey Peterson.

1186
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,875
I live across the street.

1187
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:13,208
Sorry, not on the list.

1188
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,208
Ugh.

1189
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:17,166
Just kidding.
I can't even read. Get on in here.

1190
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,450
- Yes.
- Are you ready?

1191
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:29,250
Go, Nando! Go, Nando!
Go, Nando! Go, Nando! Go, Nando!

1192
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,416
Nando's not picking up either.

1193
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,958
We know Katie's at Fleekfest, so
Nando and Ellie must be at the main event?

1194
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,041
Whatever that is.

1195
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:40,250
Oh, oh.

1196
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:43,250
Your kids left this here.
Do you mean this main event?

1197
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,958
Nerd party.
Where would you throw a nerd party?

1198
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,833
He's 11. He's throwing it at home.

1199
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:49,791
We have to divide and conquer here.

1200
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:52,166
I go to the house and shut down the party.

1201
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,666
You realize you're gonna have to be
a bad guy to a bunch of kids.

1202
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,875
I know. I got this.

1203
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,958
- Thanks for the extra ticket.
- Oh yeah, of course.

1204
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:10,583
Well, my mom can't use it anymore
'cause she's in jail, so...

1205
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:12,666
This is so sick.

1206
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,750
- Hey.
- What's up?

1207
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,250
- What's going on?
- What's up?

1208
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,333
Hi.

1209
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,083
- Katie.
- Layla.

1210
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:31,000
Chase.

1211
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,958
Rob. Killer shirt.

1212
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,041
Thank you.

1213
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,583
- How's it coming, dude?
- Almost done.

1214
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:46,166
Once you get everybody in the backyard,
text me, and we'll add the catalyst.

1215
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,083
- Don't forget the tubes.
- I got it.

1216
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:49,791
This is gonna be awesome!

1217
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:50,875
I know.

1218
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:57,500
Tell Nando's mom
I'm never having a Yes Day, honey.

1219
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:58,583
Okay, Mom.

1220
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:13,333
Hey, look, I... I love flaring up my siren
and just absolutely flying through town.

1221
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,625
We're going very fast.

1222
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,708
But I think maybe
you might be overreacting a little bit.

1223
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,958
This is a girl
who is angry with her mother,

1224
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:22,041
and she's meeting up with some skeegy guys

1225
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,291
who probably have a mustache
and need to shave.

1226
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,750
I don't know if you know anything
about teenagers,

1227
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,916
but this is a recipe for putting yourself
in a horrible situation.

1228
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,958
I've never heard of "skeegy,"
but they sound bad.

1229
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:34,375
- You know what? I won this bet.
- Yes.

1230
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,250
I won this ticket fair and square,
and she stole it from me.

1231
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:40,833
I did not say no on Yes Day.
That was the deal.

1232
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,583
It's my first actual ride in this car.

1233
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,958
- Do you need me to drive?
- No, I'm good. I am a grown man.

1234
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:58,958
Yo! Yo! Yo!

1235
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,375
Okay.

1236
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:04,625
- You wanna fight? Let's go!
- Hey, guys! Guys, that's not cool.

1237
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,208
I'm gonna get you.

1238
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:08,083
Come on. Stop!

1239
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,500
You broke the lamp.

1240
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,833
Stop!

1241
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,500
No! What are you doing?

1242
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:17,875
Come on, Tyler!

1243
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:21,291
Ellie, don't open that.

1244
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,041
I love science!

1245
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,166
I've never even had soda.
My parents don't let me.

1246
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,458
Ellie!

1247
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,625
This is so awesome!

1248
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:37,583
Stop!
We have to get this party under control!

1249
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:40,291
How can that be fun?
I thought this was the main event.

1250
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,208
Yeah, it is, but look at this.

1251
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,291
Everybody, come to the backyard.

1252
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:48,416
The main event is in the backyard.

1253
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:53,291
How will we find her?
They're all dressed like animals.

1254
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:54,583
- Get to the stage.
- Okay.

1255
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:57,208
- Move! Move! Go! Go!
- I'm looking for my daughter!

1256
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:59,458
- It's worse than I thought.
- My ankles are weak.

1257

- Hey.
- Where were you?

1261
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:15,166
Julie got us set up at the tent.
We're gonna hang there.

1262
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,166
Why are we going to a tent?

1263
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,125
Come on, Katie. Don't be lame.

1264
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,666
Well, we just met those guys.

1265
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,750
They could be shady.

1266
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:29,958
Layla, I can't.

1267
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,250
It doesn't feel right.

1268
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,875
Um...

1269
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,458
Guess I'll see you later, then?

1270
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,916
- Excuse us, please.
- Katie?

1271
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,333
- Katie?
- Hey!

1272
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,708
Okay. I'm so sorry.
She's just freaking out.

1273
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,291
I see a security guard.

1274
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,791
- Great.
- Show him your badge.

1275
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:04,750
- Excuse me, sir?
- Sir?

1276
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,958
My daughter is here without my permission.
I need to find her.

1277
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,541
No problem.

1278
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,083
I'll just put her photo
up on the Jumbotron.

1279
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,708
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1280
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:16,708
He's being sarcastic. Smart aleck.

1281
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,958
- Katie Torres?
- Thank you! Good night!

1282
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,333
I need to get up on that stage.

1283
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:25,458
No, that's where the musicians go,
Allison.

1284
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:28,666
No, no, she'll be so angry with me
that then she'll have to come down,

1285
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,375
and then we'll have her,
and nothing else could go wrong.

1286
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,375
But what if she hates you forever?

1287
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,375
- Okay.
- Okay, uh.

1288
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,916
What is this miracle powder?

1289
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Sugar.

1290
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:41,875
Wow.

1291
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,791
The main event is out there.

1292
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,000
I have a big surprise.

1293
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:47,875
Everybody in the backyard!

1294
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,625
Hey, that's my parents' wedding album.

1295
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:52,500
- Who cares? Your parents are in jail.
- I said no!

1296
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,541
- I thought it was Yes Day.
- Stop!

1297
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,916
Oh.

1298
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,041
Oh no. What have I done?

1299
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,875
Time for the surprise!

1300
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:07,125
No! No! Ellie! Come back!

1301
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,291
No surprise!

1302
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,000
I'm gonna do it.

1303
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:10,958
Ellie, no.

1304
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,125
But it's Yes Day.

1305
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:15,041
Ellie.

1306
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,875
Give me the catalyst.

1307
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,291
I wanna see foam.

1308
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:19,875
You will, I promise.

1309
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:23,375
But we just need to attach the tubes
so it sprays into the backyard.

1310
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:25,500
Okay.

1311
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:26,666
But hurry.

1312
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,708
No!

1313
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,166
Oh my gosh.

1314
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,500
Whoops.

1315
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:41,625
I'm sorry I didn't tighten the lids,
but at least it works.

1316
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah, in the house.

1317
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:47,708
Whoa.

1318
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:51,333
My parents are gonna kill me.

1319
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:55,125
Guys, Nando set off a foam bomb upstairs!

1320
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,083
Whoa, it's coming down the stairs.

1321
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,833
- It's so much.
- Come on, guys.

1322
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:06,750
Ha-ha-ha.

1323
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,833
It's gonna eat us!

1324
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:15,125
Don't worry! It's all simple products
you'd find in your kitchen.

1325
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,416
Noo!

1326
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,916
Ha.

1327
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,958

1340

Tasha!

1341
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,416
What are you doing in Cleveland?

1342
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,750
I'm not Tasha, and we're not in Cleveland.
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1343
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,666
No! No!

1344
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,083
Does anybody have a charger?
Do you have a charger?

1345
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,000
- I've never been backstage.
- We're close.

1346
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,750
Stay focused on getting out there.

1347
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:49,125
- We need to get past this guy.
- I got it.

1348
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:51,916
- Whoa, whoa.
- Fellow man of the law. I appreciate...

1349
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,708
- Should we run past him?
- No, definitely not.

1350
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:56,000
I don't care. Tell him.

1351
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:58,375
I'm like,
"We're going on in five minutes."

1352
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,583
And that's H.E.R. Oh, my gosh, it's H.E.R.

1353
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,291
- What do you mean?
- It's H.E.R.

1354
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,958
Capital "H" H.E.R. Oh my God!

1355
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,625
We don't care.
We're around celebrities all day, so...

1356
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,750
Billie, I ripped my top.
I need a seamstress, like, ASAP.

1357
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,500
Yeah. Hey,
do we have any seamstresses backstage?

1358
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,583
Sure, sure.

1359
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,833
At least get me a sewing kit.

1360
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:18,041
I have a sewing kit.

1361
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,416
She's got... We're coming in.

1362
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,666
- I have a sewing kit. All the colors.
- She's got it. Very safe.

1363
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,666
- I can sew it.
- You okay with that?

1364
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,666
- Yes!
- Fantastic.

1365
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,000
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- I got it.

1366
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,375
I like to stay prepared.
I have three kids.

1367
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,625
You never know when something comes up.

1368
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:37,791
Listen, I have to tell you,
my daughter and I are such huge fans

1369
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:39,666
and so grateful for your artistry.

1370
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,416
We know everything about you.

1371
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,541
- Wow.
- Like a stalker.

1372
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:46,708
Thank you. Thank you so much,
and thank you for hooking me up.

1373
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:49,375
You don't know how much
of a lifesaver you are now.

1374
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,708
You should be in good shape.
Hang on. Sorry.

1375
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:52,791
Eh.

1376
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:54,958
There you go.

1377
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:58,500
I am so sorry to bother you,
and I hope this isn't inappropriate, but...

1378
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:01,750
I need you to hook me up.

1379
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:09,541
It doesn't look that bad.

1380
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,851
- Thanks for the ride, officer.
- Okay.

1381
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:35,708
Oh.

1382
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:36,791
Nando?

1383
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,500
Ellie! What's going on?

1384
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:42,916
Nando!

1385
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,625
This party's over!

1386
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:55,875
Stop!

1387
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:57,791
- Stop!
- Dad!

1388
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:09,958
I said stop!

1389
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,541
Yay, Daddy!

1390
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,833
Kids...

1391
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:25,375
...this is my house,
and I'm telling you the party's over.

1392
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:28,000
Okay? Where do you think you're going?

1393
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:30,708
I said the party's over,
but the cleanup starts now!

1394
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,083
Start to clean. Now! Gather all the foam!
Take it to the backyard.

1395
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:35,583
Come on. Come on, kids.

1396
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:38,333
Go, go, go!
Ellie, get off the table, please, my love.

1397
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:42,291
Come on! Everybody! Help everybody else!

1398
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:45,500
I'm so incredibly jazzed about tonight.

1399
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:48,500
Yeah.
This is my eighth consecutive Fleekfest.

1400
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,958
One year I got sick from nacho cheese,

1401
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,083
but other than that,
I've been to every one.

1402
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:02,041
That's a lot of people.

1403
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,083
I panicked at my karate recital.
That was only two people in front of me.

1404
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:08,583
Do you have a charger?
My phone just died. Sorry.

1405
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:11,166
Do you have a charger?
My phone died. I wanna get home.

1406
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,125
- You wanna go home?
- I wanna go home.

1407
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:16,333
Now you're home.

1408
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:19,333
What? Why would you do that? Why?

1409
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:23,208
We go on in two minutes,
so now's your chance.

1410
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,541
Oh, you're so nice.

1411
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,625
Now's your chance.

1412
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:33,916
Okay.
Please don't make me regret this. Just go.

1413
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:44,875
Um...

1414
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,166
Oh.

1415
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,333
Sorry.

1416
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:50,166
I'm so sorry. Hi, I'm just, um...

1417
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:55,250
I need to find someone,
but, um, I... I don't wanna embarrass them.

1418
01:11:55,875 --> 01:12:00,208
So if you... if you hear my voice
and you belong to me...

1419
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,916
I'm looking for my phone. Sorry, guys.

1420
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:05,476
- Sorry, I'm looking for my phone.
- Watch it!

1421
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,666
Yo, what are you doing?

1422
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,083

That's the truth.

It's just hard for moms.

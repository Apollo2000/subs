<i>- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?</i>

16
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,694
<i>I had to double check that ID

Yeah.

Um, I... I wanna be.

21
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,768
<i>And what would you study?</i>

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,237
<i>- Film.

23
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,605
<i>Huh, interesting.</i>

24
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,641
<i>So you'd like to be
on this side of the lens, huh?</i>

25
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,344
- Yeah.
- Sean!

26
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,413
Hey, you are finally here,

27
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,681
Yeah.

28

I'm, uh, I'm an old man.

Let's go.

You like Chopin?

Uh... I'm not sure.

<i>Uh, you know,
what was that like?</i>

36

Um..

37
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,038
I was young, um, 15.

38
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,574
<i>Hm. Who was he?</i>

39
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,977
My friend's older brother.

00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:42,681
Twenty five.

<i>Take whatever you want,
whenever.</i>

44
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,937
I've got sandwich meat,
string cheese, juices.

45
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,972
- Cool.
- Cheers.

46
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,974

<i>Beautiful.
Look at that body.</i>

53
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:44,811
Wanna see it?

54
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,778
Yeah.

00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,048
Show me that cock.

00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:58,423
That's it. Oh, yeah.
They're gonna love you.

57

Oh, yeah.

- Yeah. Thanks.
- Great.

62
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,537
Uh, you're gonna
sleep in here tonight?

63
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:50,475
Um... yeah.

64

<i>Good. No. Absolutely.</i>

65
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:56,115
Um, I have, uh, some errands

66
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,216
that I have to run
in the morning

67
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,219
but I will come back
and I will take to you brunch.

68
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,889
Okay?
- Sure. Thanks.

69
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:05,524
Sleep well.

70
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,628
Hey.

71
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,197
How was I?

72
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:16,436
<i>- Amazing.
- You can be honest.</i>

73
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,605
- You have something
very, very special.

74
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,644
<i>- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.</i>

75
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,533
Okay.

76
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,500
Hm.

77
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,653
Very nice.

78
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,557
<i>Everybody smile.</i>

79
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,529
Alright. Come on.
How come you're not smiling?

80
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,863
What's the matter?
This isn't fun?

81
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:21,033
Come on! Come on.
This is fun!

82
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,767
I just need
a couple of more shots, okay?

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,068
And then we're gonna get
some ice cream

84
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,570
and then you guys
just keep smiling.

85
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,171
Perfect. That's great.
That's great.

86
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:28,907
We'll get some ice cream.

87
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,174

93
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,079

No, no, no.

96
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,653
- Well, come on, it's your job.
I'm a customer.

97
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,656
<i>I wanna pay.
- Don't be silly.</i>

98
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,024
I insist.

99
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:20,759
I refuse.

100
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,678
- Okay, only
if you take Kathy out.

101
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:42,814
- What? No. I told you
that's not gonna happen.

102
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,383
- Oh, come on.
Don't say you're not interested.

103
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,317
You haven't even met her.

104
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,754
- I saw her picture.
I'm not interested.

105
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,254
Um. Oh.

106
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,825
- I can take care
of my own love life very well.

107
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,294
Thank you very, very much,
though. I really appreciate it.

108
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:57,362
You are so stubborn.

109

Where'd you come up with
that name anyway? It's great.

123
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,307
- I flipped through
a phone book.

124

Well, Brent..

125

...this is just the beginning
for you.

126
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,353
I have a feeling.

127

a big, bad cobra after all.

00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:13,838
I noticed that, uh, Brent

132
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:16,708
isn't as sweet and shy as Sean.

133

Mm-hmm.

134
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:20,346

who we are, don't you think?

135
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,014
- Yeah.
- Hm.

136
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,820
Speaking of which

137
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,787
any interest in going again?

138
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,757
Maybe do a sex scene
this time?

139
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,125
- Maybe I should get back
to San Diego.

140
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:38,463
- San Diego? For what?
You live on your mother's couch.

141
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,165
Your retail job pays you
what? Ten bucks an hour?

142
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,366
$7.25.

143
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,737
- Oh. They're taking
advantage of you.

144
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,506
You're wasting your time,
your talent.

145
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,574
You deserve so much more.

146
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:53,377
You deserve to realize
your full, true potential.

I can pay you $1000

Just a little something

This is awesome! Thank you.

00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,129
<i>uh, uh, like,
lighting and... and sound</i>

161
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:20,099
<i>and how to work the camera.</i>

162
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,612
I got to actually sit
in the editing room

163
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:35,279
for, like, ten minutes today.

164
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:37,883
<i>- Oh, that's so cool.
- Yeah.</i>

165
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,961
<i>- I'll see you next week.
Sunday?</i>

166
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,630
Actually, I found out today

167
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:56,033
I'm the only intern
they're asking to stay.

168
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,971
<i>- Ooh. Wow, that..
For how long?</i>

169
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:03,508
<i>- For, you know,
a... a, a few weeks maybe</i>

170
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,510
maybe even
the, the rest of the summer.

171
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,879
<i>- Okay.
- If that's cool with you.</i>

172
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,316
<i># Oh you're so filthy
and I'm gorgeous ##</i>

173
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:16,622
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:18,956
- What are you doin'?
- Homework.

175
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,625
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

176
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,061
This book
doesn't even make any sense.

177
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:25,297
Maybe you should
take a break.

178
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,032
What do you mean?

179
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:29,935
My girlfriend's out of town.
That's what I mean.

180
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,071
I've never done this before.

181
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:35,908
It's okay. I'll show you how.

182
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:43,649
<i># 'Cause you're filthy #</i>

183
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,519
<i># Ooh and I'm gorgeous #
# Gorgeous #</i>

184
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,656
<i># 'Cause you're filthy #</i>

00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:57,096

187
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,532
<i># Ooh and you're nasty #</i>

188
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,504
<i># And you can grab me #</i>

189
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,107
<i># Ooh 'cause you're nasty #</i>

190
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,251
<i># When you're an acid junkie

<i># Ooh and you're nasty ##</i>

196
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,747
How you doin'?

197
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,683
Have you heard of this guy,
Brent Corrigan?

198
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:55,052
His videos are selling
like hotcakes.

199
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:57,254
How do hotcakes sell?

200
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:00,692
Fast, very fast

201
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:03,995
because they're
so warm and delicious.

202
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,230
He's got nothin' on you,
baby.

203
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,133
<i>Just wait till
I make you a star.</i>

204
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,236
- Then I can get my new car?
A Viper, red.

205
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,139
There's my boy.

206
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:19,144
That's what I like.
Hungry like daddy, huh?

207
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:22,014
We just gotta save up
a little bit more money.

208
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,451
So you gotta be extra nice
to your clients, alright?

209
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,519
Who's daddy's
little piggy bank?

210
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,022
Hm?
- Joe.

211
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:32,690
- Who's daddy's
little piggy bank?

212
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:35,594
Where's my little piggy bank?

213
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:40,631
Oh! There's the piggy.
There's the piggy.

214
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:43,668
Where's my piggy?
Where's my piggy?

215
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:45,204
Where's my piggy?

216
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:47,739
<i>Come on.</i>

217
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,512
Work out like a man!

218
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,546
Don't be a little bitch, Harlow!

219
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,516
<i>- Yes, sir!
- No little bitches!</i>

220
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,583
<i>- No little bitches.
- No little bitches!</i>

221
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,786
- No little bitches!
- No little bitches!

222
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,189
<i>- No little bitches.
- No little bitches!</i>

223
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:09,727
Wow.

224
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,308
Stop. Stop. Stop.

225
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,245
You know how much
I love my tan lines.

226
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:30,548
- Are you gonna behave tonight?
- Yes.

227
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,218
- No passionate kissing
and no..

228
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,054
- No anal.
- ...anal.

229
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:40,358
What?

230
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,433
Oh, fuck.

231
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,639
Ah, fuck!

232
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,115
Shaney, come on.

233
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,716
Don't you want these shrimpies?
Come on.

234
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,820
- Hoo!
- Yeah.

235
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,824
<i>Come on, get these shrimpies.
- Oh.</i>

236
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,594
<i>Smell good, huh? Yeah.</i>

237
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,770
<i>I ran a mile for you.</i>

238
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,141
Tell me again about the navy.

239
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,913
So many sweaty, horny men.

240
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:37,915
<i>- Orgies?
- Hm, I wish.</i>

241
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,352
But the military
is a straight man's world.

242
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:42,453
That is just the way it is.

243
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,157
- Do you love me
the way you love Joe?

244
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,894
<i>Of course I do, baby.</i>

245
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,728
- I wish I saved you
like he did.

246
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,864
- Hm, you know,
he doesn't like it

247
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:55,634
when I talk to clients
about our personal life.

248
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,903
<i>I'll get off faster.</i>

249
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,871
- Just tell me again
about the navy.

250
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,407
Alright.

251
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:06,344
Well, I thought that was who
I was supposed to be

252
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,680
but I was wrong.

253
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,648
And Joe helped me
get honorary discharge

254
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,816
for being a fag.

255
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,784
A... A... A what?

256
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,589
A faggot.

257
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,297
<i>There you go.</i>

258
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,232
That was a huge load.

259
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,635
<i>You've been saving up for me,
huh?</i>

260
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:32,804
Oh, yeah.

261
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:35,874
Thank you.

262
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,778
See you next week.

263
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,686
Come on. I'll walk you out.

264
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:53,958
<i>Thank you.</i>

265
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:06,270
<i>Hey.</i>

266
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,852
You promised me
you were gonna be good.

267
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:25,890
I was good.

268
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,996
I saw the way you kissed him

269
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:32,931
the way he was looking at you.

270
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:34,899
It's a role, I mean

271
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,934
that was a role
that I was playing for him.

272
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,903
I mean, it's business.

273
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:41,305
- This... This means
anything to me!

274
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,974
You're more important to me than
any fucking amount of money!

275
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:46,311
Do you understand that?
- Fuck!

276
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:49,547
<i>What the fuck?
You wanted me to do this.</i>

277
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,048
You, you got me into this!

278
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,253
Fuck!

279
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:58,723
I'm sorry.

280
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,727
<i>It's just..</i>

281
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,266
I used to get booked.

282
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,868
- Fuck.
- Now nobody wants me.

283
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,970
They just want you.

284
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,004
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- They just want you.</i>

285
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:17,342
- They're all fuckin',
dirty old men, okay?

286
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,442
You think I fucking care?

287
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:20,012
They don't fucking mean
anything to me.

288
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,980
<i>The first time I met you..</i>

289
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:28,320
...I said I wanted you
to make me jealous.

290
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,489
Well, I guess
I got my fucking wish.

291
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,727
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

292
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,532
You're the only one
I've ever loved.

293
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:45,804
- You know, it's the same thing
for me. Look.

294
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,306
You're the only one ever.

295
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,711
I love you so fucking much.
I go crazy.

296
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:54,078
I love you, too.

297
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,768
Where's the Kiehl's counter?
I need some products.

298
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,569
I think
you've shopped enough.

299
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,107
Please? Come on.

300
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,810
Don't you want me to stay
looking young?

301
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,479
Okay. Okay. Fine.

302
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,352
<i>How was your mani-pedi?</i>

303
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:38,455
<i>- I don't know.
I've had better.</i>

304
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:39,725
<i>Oh.</i>

305
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,072
You still reading
about yourself? Obsess much?

306
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:58,143
If one more fan dedicates
a blog to me, I will just die.

307
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,146
Oh.

308
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,087
So, um, I think I wanna take
the Vegas gig.

309
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:10,955
<i>They wanna pay me five grand</i>

310
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,057
<i>just to, like,
sit and sign DVDs.</i>

311
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:13,923
No. No. No.

312
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,428
They'll just paw at you
and annoy you.

313
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,462
If they wanna see you,
they can just buy the videos.

314
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,670
Please? Pretty please?

315
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,576
- We'll see.
- That's what you said about horseback riding.

316
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,444
I wanna ride a horse.

317
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,145
- I thought you wanted to learn
how to make movies.

318
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,882
<i>- I do.
- Okay. Well..</i>

319
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:39,517
Here's the record button.
- I know.

320
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,685
- Here's the zoom and the mount, right?
- I know.

321
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:44,022
- And this is a very...
- I know. I've seen you do it enough.

322
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,490
- Well, you don't know
about auto focus

323
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:47,958
and... and w... white balance.

324
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:51,528
All those things.
- Oh, I don't? Let's find out.

325
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,897
<i>And action.
- No.</i>

326
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,933
<i>Now, what are you doing?</i>

327
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,634
No. Stop! Please.

328
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:01,639
<i>- And here we have King Cobra,
porn producer.</i>

329
00:24:03,273 --> 00:24:05,476
<i>Whose neighbors have no idea
what goes on here</i>

330
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,978
<i>in this
cookie-cutter community.</i>

331
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,480
Stop it.

332
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:11,482
<i>- Tell me about
your first time.</i>

333
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,651
- No, look.
I'm a behind-the-camera guy.

334
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:15,753
Alright?
- Please?

335
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:19,825
<i>- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.</i>

336
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,598
- Alright. I was in college.
I know, late bloomer.

337
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,769
I used to go out
with my buddies every night

338
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:34,238
my best friends, and they were always
trying to hook me up with girls

339
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,807
and I'd find some way
to mess it up.

340
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,578
I was terrified
to tell them the truth.

341
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:44,615
Well, we, uh,
we go to this house party

342
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:46,717
and there's this guy
that I've seen before

343
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,921
even had some classes with and..

344
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:53,491
I look over
and he's staring right at me.

345
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,829
I'm thinking, no way.
I mean, he's so cute.

346
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:03,835
So we, uh, we sneak out
of the party.

347
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:05,202
He takes me back to his place

348
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:08,940
and we have sex.

349
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:10,908
Well, that's fucking amazing.

350
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,745
I felt free.

351
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,583
But somebody saw us leaving

352
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,951
and told my friends about it.

353
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:22,553
They couldn't believe it

354
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:26,590
so they come over,
barge right in

355
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:28,960
see us both laying there
in bed together.

356
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:33,898
They disappeared after that.

357
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:39,103
So a few years ago

358
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:42,272
I decided to just do
what I love.

359
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:46,277
Even if people despise it,
think it's dirty, trashy

360
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:47,644
I don't give a fuck.

361
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:52,049
Same goes
for who I'm attracted to.

362
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,252
<i>People think
I'm a dirty old man</i>

363
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:57,154
<i>for liking boys
who look like you.</i>

364
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,857
Fuck 'em. Hm.

365
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,962
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

366
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:09,033
Be so confident
at such a young age.

367
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:13,704
You have the Internet,
so you never have to feel alone.

368
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,108
I just feel like I'm making up
for lost time.

369
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:20,244
It's fucking depressing.

370
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:21,580
Hey.

371
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:36,226
Seanny...

372
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,230
...please just
make me feel wanted.

373
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,815
<i>Excuse me.</i>

374
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,450
- Yeah?
- I'm your neighbor. We haven't really met yet.

375
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,350
I live next door.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:08,318
Well..

377
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:14,325
How old are you?
- Eighteen. Why?

378
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:17,327
- Well, um, I've just seen
a lot of young boys

379
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:18,462
coming and going from the house.

380
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,132
I didn't know if they're
your friends or his friends or..

381
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,703
He makes gay porn.

382
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,485
- Ah! Pretty princess finally
decided to show up for work.

383
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,486
Let's go!

384
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:46,223
- So sorry.
I didn't realize you were here.

385
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,025
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

386
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:50,228
- Brent.
- Mikey.

387
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,498
- Sean, what are you wearing?
Those are too flashy.

388
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,466
- You don't know
what Brent likes.

389
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,802
- I think it looks cool.
- Thanks.

390
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,205
<i>- You have the tape recording,
right?</i>

391
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,406
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>

392
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,375
I need to emote
what I'm thinking.

393
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,812
Okay.

394
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,984
Action.

395
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,254
<i>- Eighteen years old,
I'm stuck in the suburbs</i>

396
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,423
<i>cleaning this pool all day
for my cousin.</i>

397
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:22,459
<i>I guess I should be grateful
for this job.</i>

398
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:25,996
<i>Pool boy. Sure is nice out.</i>

399
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,865
<i>I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if I took a dip.</i>

400
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:32,569
- Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

401
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:35,273
- The water looked nice.
I wanted to get wet.

402
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,376
- You have to finish
your chores first.

403
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,311
Come here.

404
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,182
You just bought yourself
another chore, boy.

405
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:51,855
Mm..

406
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:03,934
<i>Okay, cut!</i>

407
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:08,105
<i>I said cut!</i>

408
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:10,541
Come on. We're on a schedule.
We gotta move inside.

409
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,444
Sorry.

410
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:23,855
<i>No.</i>

411
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,396
- Alright. Would you please
turn it down?

412
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,099
I'm tryin' to work.

413
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:37,602
- What?
- Turn it down!

414
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,570
- If it's too loud,
you're too old.

415
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,113
Don't you have to go home?

416
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:50,981
No.

417
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,598
So what's your deal?

418
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,567
You, like, live here
or something?

419
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:48,573
Yeah. I mean, temporarily.

420
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:53,476
- Why don't you
get your own place?

421
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:57,147
- I don't make that much money.
- You're a porn star.

422
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,150
What are you doing
with this fucking guy?

423
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,954
I don't know. I mean...

424
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,089
He takes care of me

425
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:08,526
and... he makes my videos.

426
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,963
I'll take care of you.

427
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,199
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

428
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:17,268
And I'm gonna kidnap you tonight.
- No, you're not.

429
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,668
- Yeah, I am.
- No, I can't.

430
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:22,140
- I'm gonna kidnap you.
- No, you're not. Just don't.

431
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,369
<i>- Nice ride.
You must be Jagger.</i>

432
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:56,039
- Yeah. Theo told me
to hurry up.

433
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:58,009
Good thing this Viper's fast.

434
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:00,711
Hop in.

435
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:07,184
Now get down on your knees
and suck my big cock.

436
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,288
- What the fuck
are you guys doing?

437
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:15,025
- Take off your clothes
or I'll cut you, too.

438
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,778
What are you guys doing?

439
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:38,081
I wanna play.
- Expanding the site.

440
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,819
- Blowin' up, baby.
- Cool.

441
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,389
Guess whose videos
are by far the most viewed?

442
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,794
<i>Who's daddy's little star?</i>

443
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:52,762
Sorry, I mean, big fucking star.

444
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,832
- I'm not as big of a star
as Brent.

<i>- Who?
- Brent Corrigan.</i>

446
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,038
What, have you been

You wanna know a thing
about twinks?

450
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,514
With a twink, you blink,
and they're a fucking twunk.

Okay? Washed up.
You? You're a fucking man.

What? Oh, God, no.

Alright. Just checking.

458
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:58,795
- Baby, it is so hot
that you'd rather kill me

459
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,798
than let someone else have me.

460

Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
- Yeah.

You already have

00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:21,945
Hm. Hm.

474
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:29,853
We need to talk.

475
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,455
About what?

476
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:34,658
How much I make.

477
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,995
- That sounds fair.
- Hm.

478
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:40,430
- You've been working
very, very hard.

479
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:42,900
Why don't we bump you up
to $1500 for the next video?

480
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:43,934
Ten thousand.

481
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:46,836
Pardon me?

482
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,539
Ten thousand.

483
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:53,744
Where is this coming from?

484
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:54,979
You make a lot of money
off these videos

485
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,313
and it's 'cause of me.

486
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:59,250
Oh. It's because of us.

487
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:01,918
I produce, direct, cast, edit.

488
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:03,754
There's a lot of overhead
that goes into this business.

489
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,790
There's distribution, there's,
there's taking care of you.

490
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:18,335
Two thousand for the next video,
and that's absolutely final.

491
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,503
<i>- I don't think that's fair.
- You don't know what I make.</i>

492
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:21,938
- You just bought
a fucking Maserati, Stephen.

493
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:23,908
Do you think I'm an idiot?

494
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:28,445
Oh. I see what this is.

495
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:32,915
You think I only spoil myself.

496
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:36,954
Well... get ready
to feel like a real idiot

497
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,923
for bringing this up today.

498
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,960
Happy birthday.

499
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:52,003
Hm.

500
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:59,342
- Twenty five hundred
for the next video

501
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,478
and I suggest you take it

502
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,380
because according
to the contract that you signed

503
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:07,785
I don't have to give you a raise
until we make five more videos.

504
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:11,321
<i>Read before you sign, darling.</i>

505
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:15,326
<i>You know what?</i>

506
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:18,929
I'm only gonna give it to you
under one condition.

507
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:22,532
What condition?

508
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,405
You have to tell me

509
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:32,509
that I fucked you better
than your little boy-toy, Mikey.

510
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:35,112
<i>- Oh, Jesus.
- Say it.</i>

511
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:39,050
Say I fucked you better
than he did.

512
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:55,865
- You fucked me
better than he did.

513
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:58,402
Happy?

514
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:02,772
Thank you.

515
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,394
There's a good boy.

516
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,363
Keep things nice and clean.

517
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:28,699
I have to go out
and run some errands.

518
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:31,668
Do not go outside, okay?

519
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,670
The neighbors gossip enough.

520
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:45,842
- Leave the money
on the dresser

521
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,144
and come get comfortable.

522
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:52,182
That's a good start.

523
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:10,033
- Cut. Cut.
- What..

524
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:12,168
- I'm sorry.
Can we, can we just cut?

525
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,737
- Okay, cut.
- Is everything okay?

526
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:15,873
- Yeah, I just need a second.
- Harlow?

527
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,144
Just take five.
- Yeah.

528
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:37,260
- What's this?
Where are you going?

529
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,063
Home.

530
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,699
- Hey, what's wrong, baby?
- Nothing.

531
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:44,634
- No, don't do that. Tell me.
- Nothing.

532
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,738
- Tell me. What's wrong?
Just tell me.

533
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,675
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Huh? What's wrong?

534
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,077
It... It's just that he...

535
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,280
...he reminded me of him.

536
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:58,248
Oh.

537
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,552
- The way
he look... looked at me

538
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:05,188
the way, the way he touched me
when I was younger. I..

539
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,195
- You know,
you have to come back, right?

540
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:14,231
You signed a contract.
- Fuck your contract.

541
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:16,333
Excuse me?

542
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:17,867
- I'm not
your fucking property.

543
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,801
- Alright, fine!
Get out of here.

544
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,736
Go back to your mother
and your shit job.

545
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:21,905
You'll come crawling back!

546
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:23,340
- You think
I can't get my own work?

547
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:27,644
I have a name.
- No! You are Sean Nobody.

548
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:30,079
I created Brent. I'm the one
who made the investments.

549
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:31,847
I'm not losing you to anybody.
- Fuck you!

550
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,317
You walk out that door

551
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,318
I'll tell your mother
exactly what you've been doing.

552
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:37,320
I'll tell her
that you're a whore!

553
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:44,594
Sean. Sean. Please,
listen, please. I'm sorry!

554
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:45,729
It's fine.

555
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:48,864
Listen to me.

556
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:52,635
Your stepdad
is never gonna hurt you again.

557
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:55,972
I'm here now, okay?

558
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,307
No one

559
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,344
no one is ever gonna
do that to you again.

560
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,847
Okay?

561
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:10,286
Just you and me.
Just you and me.

562
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:13,356
Fuck.

563
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:40,317
<i>My Viper.
- Do it.</i>

564
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:41,317
<i>Hey.
- What the fuck are you doing?</i>

565
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:43,353
<i>- Let it go.
- This is my fucking car!</i>

566
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,289
Hey, hey, hey.

567
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:49,259
- What?
- Hold it back. Hold it back!

568
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,694
<i>- Look, next is pepper spray
and after that is the police.</i>

569
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:53,296
<i>- You're gonna pepper spray me?
- Don't make me.</i>

570
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:55,731
- In my own fucking driveway?
- Just doin' our job, man.

571
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:57,733
Just doin' our job.
You gotta let it go.

572
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:59,869
It's hooked up, alright?

573
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:01,771
Thank you. Yeah.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

574
00:44:01,804 --> 00:44:03,406
Check again.
If not, we're pulling.

575
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,045
Goddamn it. Fuck!

576
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:09,246
- I don't understand
what even happened.

577
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:12,382
Are they really gonna take
my car? It's my fucking baby.

578
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:15,719
Look, we're just, just a little
behind on the bills, that's all.

579
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,320
- Whoa, wait, what do you mean
we're behind on the bills?

580
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:18,454
We make a lot of money, Joe.
What are you talking...

581
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:20,923
- I don't, I don't wanna change
our lifestyle, alright?

582
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:23,960
I want you to be happy.
- I don't care about our fucking lifestyle.

583
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:26,328
If we can't pay the fucking bills, I won't be happy.
- We're gonna be fine.

584
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,999
We're fine. We're gonna
be fine. We'll be fine.

585
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:31,735
- How much do we owe?
How much do we owe?

586
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:35,304
Joe, how much do we owe?
- Half a million!

587
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,876
Oh, my God.

588
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:43,879
Fuck them!

589
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:46,449
They're not gonna take
your baby. Fuck them!

590
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,486
- No. Joe. Joe, wait.
- Fuck them!

591
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:52,054
- Fuck them!
- No, Joe. Stop!

592
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:53,457
No, Joe! No! Do not...

593
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:55,024
- I'm not giving up
our lifestyle

594
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:56,492
- No!
- I'm gonna fucking kill them.

595
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:58,928
- Who, who are you gonna...
- I don't fucking know!

596
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:02,732
God!

597
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,901
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way. Move.

598
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:08,305
<i>- Joe, stop!
- Move! Move! Move! Move!</i>

599
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:22,818
Joe. Joe.

600
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:25,422
Joe, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Joe.

601
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:28,958
Please don't, please don't cry.
Don't be upset.

602
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:32,394
Come on, Joe, please. I'm sorry.
We're gonna get through this.

603
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:01,357
- Mom, I told you
I would get the heavy ones.

604
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,492
- Do not treat me
like an old woman.

605
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:05,394
You are an old woman.

606
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:06,797
- What?
- Yup.

607
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,032
- I don't see it,
Mr. Muscle man here.

608
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:11,300
What's this, scrawny arms?

609
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,469
- Okay.
- You ever heard of a gym?

610
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:16,239
- Mom!
- What? You started it.

611
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:19,476
<i>- I'm so glad you're back.
- Me, too.</i>

612
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,144
Mm, look at this place, huh?

613
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:24,815
My first apartment
was a shit hole.

614
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:26,248
It's not that nice.

615
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:30,353
- It's got charm, though,
and it's not my couch

616
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:32,922
though that will always be
available to you.

617
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,858
Thanks, but no thanks.

618
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:38,060
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

619
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:41,898
Eighteen
and already on your own

620
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:44,434
but you got rent to pay,
so get a job.

621
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,936
- I told you.
I know producers here.

622
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:48,938
I can get a PA job
in, like, a second.

623
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,508
<i>- What's a PA job?
- It's like an assistant.</i>

624
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,610
- It doesn't sound
very promising.

625
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:56,246
- I'll be fine. I promise.
- Okay.

626
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:58,380
- You look pretty today. Yeah.
- Thank you.

627
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:05,989
- Ah, Mr. Corrigan.
- Hi.

628
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,858
- Ah, good to see you.
Good to see you.

629
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:10,527
- Hey, you as well.
- Go ahead. Go get fluffed.

630
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,130
Have a seat. Awesome.
I'm a real, big fan of yours.

631
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:16,398
- Thank you.
I'm a fan of your work as well.

632
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:19,869
- So you want to play
with the big boys now, eh?

633
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:21,136
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

634
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,106
<i>Well, we want to start playing
with you.</i>

635
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,976
Uh, in fact, we can start
as, as early as next week

636
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,646
but, uh... Cobra...

637
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:31,548
- Yeah, I don't work for them
anymore.

638
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:33,516
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

639
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:36,018
- Huh, 'cause that Stephen guy
seemed to think

640
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:39,890
that he still had you under
contract as Brent Corrigan.

641
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:41,523
- Oh, well then, I mean,
that works out great

642
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,226
'cause legally my name
isn't Brent.

643
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,663
- Actually, no, that's
a problem, because the performer

644
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,900
that we wanna work with
is Brent Corrigan

645
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:50,934
and not a newcomer.

646
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:53,469
<i>I mean, hey, if you want
to change your name</i>

647
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,439
and then and start all over
again, that's fine as a newcomer

648
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:58,541
but you know,
I have a lot of newcomers

649
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:02,144
but the deal
that we wanted with you

650
00:48:02,177 --> 00:48:04,114
is only available to Brent.

651
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:08,218
I'm sorry, man,
but keep in touch.

652
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:12,221
<i>Very nice. Oh, that's good.</i>

653
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:13,657
That is good. Don't be shy.

654
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,525
Take those shorts off.
Let's get comfortable.

655
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:22,132
<i>Okay, now put your hand
behind your head.</i>

656
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, that's good.

657
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,571
You are gonna be a big star.
I have a feeling.

658
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:32,910
Pardon me.

659
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:34,543
Oh.

660
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:37,413
<i>Brent!</i>

661
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,317
So nice to hear from you.
- What the fuck is going on?

662
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:42,985
You can't stop me
from using my name.

663
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:45,387
- I already have
because it's my name.

664
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,690
I trademarked it.
- What?

665
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,960
<i>- Throw that name around
all you want.</i>

666
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,061
<i>My lawyers will shut you down
every time.</i>

667
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:54,463
Brent Corrigan
is synonymous with Cobra.

668
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:55,965
You leaving fucked me!

669
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:57,067
<i>Yeah, but if I stayed</i>

670
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:58,268
<i>I would have been
fucking myself.</i>

671
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,670
Oh, Brent Fucks Himself.

672
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:03,407
Good title for a video.
Shall we collaborate?

673
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,644
- I was 17 when we met.
- What?

674
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:11,981
- I was underage
for those first Cobra videos.

675
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:15,652
- That's bullshit.
I... I have a copy of your ID.

676
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:18,087
<i>- Yeah, well, check it again.
It's fake.</i>

677
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,523
If you, if you don't give me
my name back

678
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:23,726
I'll tell everybody
you made kiddie porn.

679
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,530
- Wait. Listen. We both know
that you would never do that.

680
00:49:27,563 --> 00:49:30,400
The news would ruin you
just as much as it would me.

681
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:32,735
<i>- Yeah, it might ruin
my career</i>

682
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:35,270
<i>but it'll ruin your life.</i>

683
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:39,075
I'd rather watch you go down
than ever make porn again.

684
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:41,244
<i>- Sean, you're the one
who lied.</i>

685
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:43,347
So give it your best shot,
you little shit.

686
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,096
<i>Listen, you don't understand.</i>

687
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,298
They're, they're,
they're taking all of my stuff.

688
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:04,800
They're taking my computer.

689
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,201
You know,
these are my personal things.

690
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:08,137
This is private, private stuff.

691
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,571
- Sir, I need you
to step outside.

692
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:12,509
- I'm in the middle of..
Okay, fine. Fine.

693
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:13,710
I'll call you back.

694
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:25,055
- Like, just, like,
please don't tell my mom.

695
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,533
<i># Handle with care.. #</i>

696
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:40,135
Fuck.

697
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:41,538
<i>Mr. Corrigan.</i>

698
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,773
I was so looking forward
to work with you.

699
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:47,110
I spoke to my investor
and it's not gonna happen.

700
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,345
- Why? I mean,
I'm... I'm 18 now.

701
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:52,715
- Oh, you kind of made
the industry look a little bad

702
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:54,751
with the whole underage thing.

703
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,420
People are pissed at you,
you know? I'm not.

704
00:50:57,452 --> 00:51:00,155
I think what you did
was fucking hot

705
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:02,125
but it's a no-go.

706
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,510
<i>Stephen.</i>

707
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:28,451
Pedophile.

708
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,422
- What?
- Pedophile.

709
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:41,264
Traci Lords.

710
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:43,432
She bounced back
after her underage scandal.

711
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:46,536
Alright? Just give it time.
Give it time.

712
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:47,471
Lorenzo!

713
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:56,813
- So what's gonna happen?
Are you gonna go to jail?

714
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,148
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

715
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,282
<i>No. I'm not going to jail.</i>

716
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:01,416
No, I have proof
that he lied, okay?

717
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:03,652
He's, he's the little shit
who should be going to jail.

718
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:05,155
He's a kid.

719
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,924
Ah! I can't believe it!

720
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,693
- Can you at least appreciate
that I'm telling you myself?

721
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,795
- I would have found out anyway.
- How?

722
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,864
<i>Do you watch gay porn?
- Sean!</i>

723
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:16,900
Oh, my God, I can't believe

724
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:20,335
I fell for this
paid internship bullshit.

725
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:22,505
Who the hell gets paid
to be an intern?

726
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:23,472
I'm sorry.

727
00:52:23,505 --> 00:52:26,475
What about that
parental release I signed?

728
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:29,846
I... I faked it.

729
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:33,782
- Oh, my God. The lies.
- I'm sorry.

730
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:36,952
- I just, I don't understand.
You're, you're so talented.

731
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:38,954
<i>What happened to you?</i>

732
00:52:38,987 --> 00:52:42,759
And how did you get involved
with pornography?

733
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,326
- There's no way
that you could understand.

734
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,329
You live in this
safe, little bubble

735
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:47,463
with your little family...

736
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:49,432
You're family. You're family.

737
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,467
<i>Everybody has stuff, okay?</i>

738
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,903
Everybody. So don't judge me,
alright? I don't judge you.

739
00:52:54,936 --> 00:52:56,705
Please, don't judge me.

740
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,507
<i>Sorry, okay? I'm sorry.</i>

741
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,210
<i>I'll say it a million more
times. I'm sorry.</i>

742
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:02,244
That won't do anything.

743
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:05,280
Oh, my God,
you were doing porn!

744
00:53:05,313 --> 00:53:06,949
I thought
you were learning a trade

745
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:11,188
a dream of yours, and instead,
you were just being a whore.

746
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:13,155
<i>What is wrong with you, baby?</i>

747
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:16,725
Since when did I raise somebody
to disrespect their body?

748
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:17,961
<i>It's not like that.</i>

749
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,262
It... It was just a way
to get out of here.

750
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:22,798
There are other ways out.

751
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:24,768
You could have taken
another route.

752
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:29,905
- Maybe, maybe
this is what I wanted.

753
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,942
Why?

754
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:35,612
Maybe I like it.

755
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:41,684
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

756
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,519
Mom, mommy, I'm sorry.

757
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:48,324
- Don't pull that
Goody Two-Shoes bullshit on me.

758
00:53:48,356 --> 00:53:50,293
I'm not a fucking idiot.

759
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:20,750
<i>Joe, this is Sean Lockhart.</i>

760
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:23,552
<i>I got your e-mail.</i>

761
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:24,620
<i>Let's meet.</i>

762
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,691
<i>Sushi Ota?
It's on Mission Drive.</i>

763
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:31,027
<i>I can meet you there
tomorrow night at 8:00.</i>

764
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:53,648
- Joe, after we make
all this money from Brent

765
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:55,550
do you think
I could get my Viper back?

766
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:57,719
- Fuck, yes.
- Yes.

767
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,756
- I'm gonna get you
that Viper back.

768
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,958
I'm gonna get you another Viper
on top of that.

769
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:05,729
Fuck, yeah.

770
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,969
<i>- Hey. There he is.
- Hm.</i>

771
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,037
- Hi.
- Hey.

772
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,974
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

773
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,108
- Hey. You look great.
- Thanks.

774
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:22,544
You look really nice, too.
- Very good to meet you, Sean.

775
00:56:22,577 --> 00:56:25,648
Alright. Finally. Have a seat.

776
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:33,588
So you like this place?

777
00:56:33,621 --> 00:56:34,757
- Yeah, it's really nice.
- Yeah.

778
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:36,925
- Yeah, this place
is really cool, right?

779
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,927
- Yeah, I really like it.
- Cool.

780
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,431
- Have you seen
any of our Viper-Boyz videos?

781
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,000
Uh, yeah. No, they're cool.

782
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:45,233
- Can I get you some early drink?
- Yeah.

783
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,670
- Um, yes, will you have the
most expensive bottle of Sake?

784
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:49,672
I have a great bottle of...

785
00:56:49,704 --> 00:56:52,541
- Get me just
the most expensive bottle, okay?

786
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:54,777
The most expensive. Thank you.

787
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:57,078
- Have, have you, uh, have you
seen all of our product..

788
00:56:57,112 --> 00:56:59,014
- He produced all of them. It was me.
- Yeah.

789
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:00,682
- Alright, listen.
- Yeah. No, it's...

790
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:02,717
- We can,
we can chitchat all night

791
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:06,189
but I just want to get down
to the point, alright?

792
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,459
I'm willing to give you $25,000

793
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,594
for one video.

794
00:57:11,626 --> 00:57:14,096
Now, I know
that sounds like a lot

795
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:16,231
but you gotta spend money
to make money.

796
00:57:16,264 --> 00:57:20,101
And I believe
a video with Harlow and Brent

797
00:57:20,135 --> 00:57:21,938
is gonna make
a shitload of money.

798
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,106
- Yeah, it will make
so much money.

799
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:26,142
And people really want to,
they'll want to see us fuck.

800
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:27,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

801
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:33,182
- Harlow.
Man, that's a great porn name.

802
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:39,088
Thank you. It's my real name.

803
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:40,990
- Really?
- Yeah.

804
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:44,126
I mean, I've, I've escorted
under so many different names

805
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,829
um, that I just lost count.

806
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:50,565
I feel like with porn,
I just wanna be myself.

807
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:52,134
You know?
- Yeah.

808
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:54,202
Finding myself in it.

809
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:56,771
- You're not afraid
of your family finding out?

810
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,143
- Yeah. No, Joe is my family.
- Yeah.

811
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:03,246
- I mean, I don't know, I would
be a little bit bummed out

812
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:04,914
if your parents found out.

813
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:07,682
A little bit 'cause they're
so cute. They're so sweet.

814
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:09,784
They are, um..

815
00:58:09,818 --> 00:58:12,221
They don't really watch.
They would never watch porn.

816
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:15,824
They're fundamentalist, they're
fundamentalist Christians, so..

817
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,662
- That's the worst.
- Careful. I used to be one.

818
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:22,632
- Hm. Joe used to be
a youth pastor.

819
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:24,534
- What?
- In a different life.

820
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,269
A long time ago.
- Okay.

821
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,237
We met in this chat room. He
was teaching me how to dance...

822
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:30,606
- Harlow, come on.
Baby, please.

823
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,076
Thank you.

824
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,179
- You guys, um, about ready
to order? Do you need more time?

825
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:39,681
- Yeah, I think we, uh..
You know we..

826
00:58:39,715 --> 00:58:42,151
Yeah, let... let's get, um

827
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:46,589
some blue Toro fin

828
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:51,159
uh, with the shaved truffles,
the shaved black truffles.

829
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:54,263
Um, let's get
the shrimp tempura roll

830
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:57,065
the dragon roll,
the rainbow roll.

831
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:59,302
You eat all, you can eat all this, right?
- Oh, yeah...

832
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:00,702
Just get us, get us

833
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:04,340
<i>a, a big boat of, a bunch of
fucking sushi or something.</i>

834
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:06,342
- Absolutely. Anything else?
- Thank you.

835
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,878
Thank you.

836
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:10,547
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

837
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:14,349
You wanna help me out?
- Oh, yeah.

838
00:59:14,382 --> 00:59:17,252
So Fox Ryder

839
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:20,088
would love to take you guys up
on your offer.

840
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:21,222
I'm sorry. Who?

841
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:23,893
Fox Ryder. It's my new name.

842
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:27,028
I beg your pardon?

843
00:59:27,061 --> 00:59:28,998
Um...

844
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:32,101
I can't really use
the name Brent right now

845
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:35,605
because, uh..

846
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:38,173
...because Cobra trademarked it

847
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:40,375
behind my back.

848
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:43,246
- Well, fuck Cobra.
You are Brent Corrigan.

849
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,615
- Yeah, but you know,
people will know it's me.

850
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:49,384
I'm Fox. You know, it's good. Don't you think...
- No. Fuck that.

851
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:52,622
Fuck. No. No Fox.
No fucking Fox.

852
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:56,626
Right, this is,
this is about branding.

853
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,961
You're Brent fucking Corrigan.
That's it, alright?

854
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:02,632
And if you can't use your name

855
01:00:02,664 --> 01:00:04,601
then there's no fucking deal.

856
01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:11,139
Look, you have to do this video.

857
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,041
We're all gonna get rich.

858
01:00:13,074 --> 01:00:16,378
You know how fucking rich
we're gonna get off of this?

859
01:00:16,411 --> 01:00:19,314
And if Stephen is the only one
standing in your way..

860
01:00:21,315 --> 01:00:25,020
...then we'll take care of it.
Okay?

861
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,657
Seriously.
- Great.

862
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:33,195
Hm. Put your money
where your mouth is.

863
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:36,632
Okay.

864
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:40,369
Ah.

865
01:00:58,253 --> 01:00:58,987
Hm.

866
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:03,425
<i>Hello?
- Stephen, it's Joe.</i>

867
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:06,961
<i>The Viper Boyz.
- Who?</i>

868
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:09,731
- Joe from Viper Boyz.
S... Surely you've heard of us.

869
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:11,400
Listen, we're big fans

870
01:01:11,432 --> 01:01:14,704
and, uh, we're gonna use Brent
in a little thing.

871
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:18,340
So, uh, I understand that
there's a, um, contract thing...

872
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,909
- Nobody works with Brent.
He's mine.

873
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,278
Alright, well.

874
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,347
Come on, I mean,
let's, let's at least discuss

875
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,717
an arrangement, right,
or an agreement...

876
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,119
- You want to come to some
sort of agreement? Alright.

877
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:33,722
<i>- Yeah.
- Pay me eighty percent of what you make and we'll talk.</i>

878
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:36,458
<i>- Eighty percent?
What the fuck?</i>

879
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,461
- Take it or leave it.
- "Take it or leave it?"

880
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,930
Fuck you! Alright? Lookit.

881
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,832
You're gonna fucking
let Brent go

882
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:44,399
or I'm gonna kick
the fucking shit out of you.

883
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:47,202
How's that?
How the fuck is that?

884
01:01:47,235 --> 01:01:48,269
<i>You fucking faggot!</i>

885
01:01:48,302 --> 01:01:49,471
- Who the fuck do you think
you are?

886
01:01:49,503 --> 01:01:51,272
<i>- The fucking Viper Boyz!
- I've never heard of you.</i>

887
01:01:51,306 --> 01:01:53,742
If you were a real producer,
I would have heard of you.

888
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:55,411
So that means your work is shit.

889
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:57,112
<i>- What the fuck?
- Go fuck yourself.</i>

890
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,815
Hello? Hello?

891
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:03,952
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

892
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:05,453
Oh, fuckin'..

893
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:08,023
Fuck! Fuck!

894
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:10,492
Fuck!

895
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:15,130
<i>- Okay, I've seen you
do it enough.</i>

896
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,132
<i>Uh, uh..</i>

897
01:02:16,164 --> 01:02:17,500
What are you doing? Stop it.

898
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:19,335
<i>- Action.
- No. Stop.</i>

899
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:23,005
<i>Please.
- Here we have King Cobra.</i>

900
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:23,838
<i>Porn producer..</i>

901
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,876
<i>...whose neighbors
have no idea..</i>

902
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:31,447
Oh.

903
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:54,135
- Stephen?
- Hey, is that you?

904
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:57,138
<i>How are you?
- Not so great, thanks to you.</i>

905
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:02,778
- Listen. I just want to say
that I am sorry.

906
01:03:07,114 --> 01:03:08,150
Me, too.

907
01:03:10,452 --> 01:03:13,088
Look, can we try and just

908
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:16,057
just put this behind us somehow?

909
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:19,360
- Stephen, I'm grateful for
everything you've done for me

910
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:21,429
but I just want to be
on my own now, okay?

911
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,467
Look, I completely understand

912
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:29,472
and, uh, I'm sorry
for being overbearing.

913
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:32,907
I think
I let my personal feelings

914
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,442
get in the way of our business.

915
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,912
I... I'm gonna call my lawyer.

916
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:38,347
I'll have him
draw up a contract

917
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,517
that, uh, will hopefully
make the both of us very happy.

918
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,287
- That would be great.
Thank you.

919
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,390
<i>You really are very special.</i>

920
01:03:48,422 --> 01:03:49,323
I just..

921
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:53,596
I got scared
at the thought of losing you.

922
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,966
<i>You'd better have
you're A game on, though.</i>

923
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,300
<i>I'm auditioning
someone tonight</i>

924
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,635
<i>and I think
he's the next Brent.</i>

925
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,173
Oh, really?

926
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:07,242
- Yeah, he's gorgeous
and, uh, very well hung

927
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:10,578
so don't be jealous.

928
01:04:10,612 --> 01:04:11,713
<i>- I'll try.
- Mm..</i>

929
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:16,918
Alright, well, I'll talk to you soon.
- Alright. Bye.

930
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:35,538
Thank you.

931
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:44,913
- Hey.
- Hey.

932
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,387
<i>You look great.
- Thanks. You do, too.</i>

933
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,689
<i>- And I like your jacket.

Thanks.

936
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,699
I read about

937
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:07,135
that whole, uh, scandal.

938
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:10,672
You were 17? That's wild.

939
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,974
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

940
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:14,275
Um, Stephen and I are settling

things are looking good.

942
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:17,680
Good.

943
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:26,221
Um, I'm starting my own site.

944
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:29,357
I'm gonna write, produce,
direct, have control.

945
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:34,997
- I thought you wanted to be
a filmmaker.

946
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,599
<i>Yeah. I am.</i>

947
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,303
Like, real filmmaking.

948
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,708

things out still. It's..</i>

you know, maybe
you'd wanna be a part of it.

952

I would, I would

953

01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:10,665
doing that stuff, so..

957

<i>No offense and no judgment.</i>

958
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,603

I understand.

959
01:06:16,538 --> 01:06:19,041
Uh, I didn't realize
you were dating someone.

960
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:23,244
- Well, it doesn't mean
we can't sit down

961
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:26,247

right?

962
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:30,686

Why don't you come on in?
The, uh, studio is downstairs.

Hm.

974
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,779
Well, you're even sexier

- Thanks. You know, all of your
performers are so hot.

976
01:07:34,815 --> 01:07:37,786
So it's an honor
to be considered.

977
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:42,790
It's my pleasure.

982
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,205

That's right. Damn.

984

Yeah, it's part of my look.

let me have a look at that ass?

Not yet.

994

<i>Yeah?</i>

996

No.

Alright, you're usually the one
that calls the shots, huh?

so fucking messy?

Fuck. You did it.

advantage of.

Let's get you cleaned up.

- And then what?
Then what do we do?

1029
01:13:11,552 --> 01:13:13,521
- Then we'll take
whatever we want..

1030
01:13:15,756 --> 01:13:17,859
...and we'll set
the fucking house on fire.

<i>his throat slashed,
and last night's fire</i>

1039
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:55,963
<i>was an attempt

<i>We also know that the victim
was involved with pornography.</i>

a specific motive

uh, but we are definitely interested
in his pornography business

have been involved with him.

1090
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:50,265
- Yes.
- That's rad, right?

1091
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:52,466
Yeah, that sounds great.

1092
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,335
<i>- Yeah.
- Awesome.</i>

1093
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:55,937
To "The Fast And The Curious. "

1094
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,446
Man, I cannot wait to direct
the shit out of this movie.

1095
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,481
- Fuck, yeah.
- Hey, photo op, huh?

1096
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:09,918
Get together with Harlow.
- Yeah.

1097
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,019
Yeah.

1098
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:14,421
<i>Alright, get in there.</i>

1099
01:18:15,756 --> 01:18:17,458
<i>That's good.</i>

1100
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,226
Alright.

1101
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,363
Do one with shirts off. Come on.

1102
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:24,398
<i>Give our customers
a little tease</i>

1103
01:18:24,431 --> 01:18:26,367
<i>of what they're getting
into here.</i>

1104
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:28,869
- Yeah.
- I've been working out extra hard for you.

1105
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:30,405
- Thanks.
- Feel.

1106
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,274
Nice.

1107
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:36,344
<i>Look at that plank.</i>

1108
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:40,314
<i>Alright.</i>

1109
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:42,918
Hot.

1110
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:47,956
A little kiss.

1111
01:18:55,262 --> 01:18:58,766
Seanny baby, what's wrong?
You gotta loosen up.

1112
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,836
- I'm sorry. I... I just,
I, I can't concentrate. Um..

1113
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:04,104
Why?

1114
01:19:04,137 --> 01:19:06,474
Can we just, y... you know

1115
01:19:06,506 --> 01:19:08,442
talk about
the elephant in the room?

1116
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:13,413
What elephant?

1117
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:15,315
Stephen.

1118
01:19:15,349 --> 01:19:18,153
Uh, What about him?
He's gone.

1119
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:20,788
I know. Why?

1120
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,556
- Maybe he pissed off
the wrong person.

1121
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:26,027
- Uh, we... we were just about
to come to an agreement.

1122
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,296
<i>- About this?
- Yeah.</i>

1123
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:34,536
No. There's no way. No way.

1124
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,571
He wasn't gonna fucking budge.

1125
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:39,507
- Please, just tell me
what happened.

1126
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:42,010
Do you want to talk?

1127
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:45,313
<i>- Yes.
- Alright. Let's talk.</i>

1128
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,486
- Haven't you guys
seen anything online?

1129
01:19:53,587 --> 01:19:56,423
You know, people think
I'm behind it.

1130
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:58,326
But it's good now.

1131
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:00,929
We'll make the movie
and be rich.

1132
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:04,532
Yeah, if you didn't do it,
then people will know soon enough.

1133
01:20:04,564 --> 01:20:05,866
- What do you mean
if I didn't do it?

1134
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:07,835
You know I didn't do it.
- Do I?

1135
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:11,907
We'll know you didn't do it
as soon as we shoot our movie.

1136
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:16,945
- When you said
you'd fix things

1137
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,913
I didn't know
this is what you meant.

1138
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:21,248
Please.

1139
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:23,918
It's exactly
what you fucking wanted.

1140
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:26,188
<i>- Yeah, I mean,
besides it's too late.</i>

1141
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:34,462
It was quick.
He never saw it comin'.

1142
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:42,369
You know, it's sick,
but seeing that fucker go down..

1143
01:20:43,904 --> 01:20:47,007
...made me feel so good inside,
like I got revenge.

1144
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,511
Revenge on who?

1145
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:54,850
My stepdad.

1146
01:20:54,882 --> 01:20:57,952
I never told anybody
that he used to rape me.

1147
01:20:57,984 --> 01:21:01,188
I didn't want to bring shame
to my family.

1148
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:03,390
When I finally got the courage

1149
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:06,394
to tell my family
that I was gay..

1150
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:10,198
...he calls me a fag
and he convinces my mom

1151
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:12,166
to kick me out of the house.

1152
01:21:14,969 --> 01:21:18,538
Anyway, let's not,
let's not talk about that shit.

1153
01:21:18,572 --> 01:21:22,176
Come on, we're celebrating.
I don't care about that shit.

1154
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:25,579
Two tears in the bucket.
Motherfuck it.

1155
01:21:26,646 --> 01:21:29,384
- So we're gonna see you
on Sunday?

1156
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,653
- Yeah, you know,
looking forward to it.

1157
01:21:36,556 --> 01:21:38,559
- And you're gonna be
a good boy, right?

1158
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:41,930
Yeah.

1159
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,137
Alright.

1160
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:51,172
Good.

1161
01:22:04,752 --> 01:22:05,687
Alright.

1162
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,672
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1163
01:22:45,025 --> 01:22:47,095
I'm sorry

1164
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:51,432
for everything
you... you went through and..

1165
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,603
...I'm here for you
no matter what, okay?

1166
01:22:57,704 --> 01:22:58,739
Thank you.

1167
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:02,310
Aw. What do you want to do?

1168
01:23:02,342 --> 01:23:04,578
I'll take you anywhere.
- I don't know.

1169
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,515
I actually kind of just
want to make dinner

1170
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:09,449
and, like, watch a movie maybe.

1171
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:12,354
- Mm-hmm. Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

1172
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,198
Hey, Joe,
do you think in heaven

1173
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:27,167
you can just eat as much
as you want and never get full?

1174
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:30,171
Sure. Whatever.

1175
01:23:38,845 --> 01:23:39,780
Hey, Joe.

1176
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,684
Do you think
Stephen went to heaven or hell?

1177
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:47,655
- Heaven.
- Really?

1178
01:23:50,623 --> 01:23:53,226
You know, I was thinkin'

1179
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,032
maybe we could join my parents
sometime at church.

1180
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,369
Oh. Whatever you want, baby.

1181
01:24:10,644 --> 01:24:13,815
Harlow... what have we done?

1182
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:18,787
- Hey. We did
what we had to do.

1183
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,190
We had to do.
- Okay.

1184
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:27,862
Alright. Alright.

1185
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:33,568
Shit! Fuck!

1186
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,304

<i>Fuck! Fuck!</i>

1189

- Listen, listen, listen.

1190
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:45,545
No matter what happens, I will
never stop loving you, okay?

1191
01:24:45,578 --> 01:24:48,782
Never. I love you.
- I love you so fuckin' much.

1192

<i>- Driver and passenger,

Fuck. Joe, put your hands up.

1194
01:24:53,686 --> 01:24:55,789
<i>- Driver, with your left hand,
open the car door.</i>

1195
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:58,359

a little bit on the floor.

Hey, what about shooting closer
to the lake? Maybe lose the tractor?

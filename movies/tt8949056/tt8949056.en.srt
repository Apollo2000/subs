Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Miss O'Donnell.

14
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:22,807
Just as I suspected:

15
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:24,310
over two-and-a-half inches
above the knee.

16
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:28,012
Dean's Office. Now!

17
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,948
- Morning, Mrs. Veda.
- Alice.

18
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,152
School mass today at 2:00.

19
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:35,687
Why don't you be
gift bearer again?

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,189
Sure.

21
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,192
Hmm.

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:47,066
OK, it's like this,
guys are like microwave ovens.

23
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,070
And ladies are like
conventional ovens.

24
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:53,671
Guys only need a few seconds,
you know, like a microwave,

25
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:55,740
to get...
switched on.

26
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:59,311
While ladies,
they typically need to...

27
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,012
preheat for a while.

28
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,681
But God created sex
with boundaries

29
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,351
and for a purpose.

30
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:07,752
Does anyone wanna take a stab
at what the boundary is?

31
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:08,920
Yes, Wade?

32
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:10,156
- Marriage.
- Very good.

33
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,324
And does anybody
know the purpose?

34
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,328
- To have children.
- Perfecto.

35
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:19,731
When a man and a woman receive
the sacrament of matrimony,

36
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,135
God calls on them to create
children in his image.

37
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,704
Any sex outside of one man,
one woman, one marriage

38
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:27,939
is against God's plan.

39
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,877
Um, what about sex
with yourself?

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,348
Can you create children
from sex with yourself?

41
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,850
- No.
- Right, so?

42
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,120
- It's against God's plan.
- Exactly.

43
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:43,988
So, is that what the
Bible means by "spilling your seed"?

44
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,491
Is it spilling if you catch it?

45
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:47,426
All right, all right.

46
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,095
We are called on to be chaste
until we are married.

47
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,399
And that means no sex...
with yourself or anyone else...

48
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,868
until you stand at that altar
and you say "I do"

49
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,904
or else it is damnation
for all eternity.

50
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,341
And remember...

51
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,008
God is always watching.

52
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,246
Capiche?

53
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:14,420
They gave us Baby Think-It-Over
in Christian Lifestyles.

54
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:17,021
I'm not even having sex, they should
just give them to the slutty girls.

55
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:20,758
Oh, have you had to watch the
partial-birth abortion video yet?

56
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,962
- It's really awful.
- No, no! Don't ruin it for me.

57
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,233
How was Morality?

58
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,866
It was fine.

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,770
Did you know that masturbating
is a sin?

60
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:36,108
Ew. Of course. Why?

61
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,478
I was just wondering.

62
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:43,449
Making me rewind <i>Titanic</i>
back to the car scene twice

63
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,551
is probably also a sin,

64
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,986
just in case you were wondering
that next.

65
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,921
Look, I only
asked you to do that

66
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,923
because I couldn't hear
what Kate whispered to Leo

67
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:53,525
- when he said, "Where to, Miss?"
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:57,962
Which just happens to be
right before they make out

69
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:02,468
and steam up that car window
that Kate slaps her hand on.

70
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,203
I didn't write it!

71
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:13,245
Hey! Hi, Gus.

72
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,066
Sit, Gus.

73
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,801
Sit.

74
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:51,450
<i>Welcome!</i>

75
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:01,360
OK. Here we go!

76
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,240
Damn it!

77
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,417
<i>Titanic!</i>

78
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,555
Yes!

79
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:31,390
<i>You've got mail.</i>

80
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,053
Mom?

81
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,659
Wet?

82
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,532
Uh...

83
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:09,147
Underwear?

84
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,130
Ohh.

85
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:28,300
What?

86
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,641
Alice!

87
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,578
Dinner!

88
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:15,213
- I confess to almighty God...
- Almighty God...

89
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,283
and to you,
my brothers and sisters,

90
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,552
that I have sinned
through my own fault,

91
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:23,422
in my thoughts and in my words,

92
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,159
in what I have done and in what
I have failed to do...

93
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,528
The Millers invited us
over to watch the game.

94
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:33,432
Great, I'll make
my cheesy potatoes.

95
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:35,801
Oh, Damn it, Ron.

96
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,536
Now I'm all wet!

97
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:42,574
Calm down, Gail,
you're not that wet.

98
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:58,824
So, uh, Alice, I heard
you got on Wade Friday night.

99
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:02,728
Stephanie told me she walked in
on you guys in my sauna.

100
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:04,830
Ooh!
Gettin' steamy in the sauna!

101
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:08,500
No, we were just back there
getting some drinks.

102
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,471
We were only gone
for like a minute!

103
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:13,605
Yeah, that's long enough
for Wade.

104
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,641
I was just messin'.

105
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,677
Listen.

106
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,446
You don't have to put out
just because you like a boy.

107
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,782
I don't like him.

108
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:26,451
And now, for the Bible
passages that back all this up...

109
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:28,620
We're gonna start
with <i>Galatians.</i>

110
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,455
Heather, why don't you
start us off?

111
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,524
The acts of the flesh
are obvious:

112
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:35,861
sexual immorality,
impurity, debauchery...

113
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:38,864
OK, so, I just bought
this Blink 182 CD

114
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,265
from Sam Goody, right?

115
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,700
Um, I upload them to my computer

116
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,868
and then I just put 'em
on here.

117
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,236
Easy as pie.

118
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,637
The album's amazing, by the way.

119
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:46,972
It's called
<i>Enema of the State.</i>

120
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,573
Get it?

121
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,475
I bet you know all about enemas,
don't you?

122
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,411
Can you not talk about enemas
near my baby, please?

123
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,813
Yeah, I'm gonna...

124
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:56,214
Thank you.

125
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,952
Such a perv.

126
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,354
What's an enema?

127
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,822
It's when you fall water skiing

128
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,323
and water shoots up your butt.

129
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:08,927
Well, look who it is.

130
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,529
Where were you this weekend?

131
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:12,330
You didn't come to my party.

132
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,533
Yeah, I heard things
got pretty crazy.

133
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,503
Everyone's been talking
about you and Wade.

134
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:21,406
- Oh?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,708
They're saying
you tossed his salad.

136
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,009
- What?
- Gross!

137
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:26,445
You tossed his salad
in my sauna?

138
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,281
What? No! No!
Who, who said that?

139
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,683
Some girl in my Geometry class
was telling a bunch of us.

140
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,385
Heather's really pissed too.

141
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:35,387
She just gave Wade
a promise bracelet.

142
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,522
OK.

143
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:42,661
I mean, I've never even heard of
dressing someone's salad! So...

144
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,597
The party was really fun.

145
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,933
Why didn't you come?

146
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,334
I was on a retreat.

147
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,469
Oh! Like a spa?

148
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,504
No, a retreat ran by the school.

149
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:56,608
It's called Kirkos and I got
this necklace on it. See?

150
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:59,045
Cool. What'd you do there?

151
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,513
We're not allowed to talk about
it with anyone who hasn't been.

152
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,050
But it totally changed my life.

153
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,284
Coming, Beth?

154
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:09,921
Yeah. I gotta go.

155
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:11,957
You guys should sign up
for the next one.

156
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,925
I think it'd be good for you.

157
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:25,003
Since when does Beth eat lunch
with Nina and those girls?

158
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,672
I have to go on that retreat.

159
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,808
Do you think she thinks
that I actually

160
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:31,710
tasted Wade's salad or whatever?

161
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:33,578
I don't know.

162
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,614
Beth's such a moron.

163
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,649
I never have any clue
what's she's talking about

164
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,785
so she probably made it up.

165
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:52,564
I'm gonna go get more milk.

166
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,973
Oh. Hey, Heather. Hey, Wade.

167
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,945
Can't have pudding without milk!

168
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,420
She's disgusting.

169
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:26,665
I think I'm going to ask Heather

170
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,867
to bear the gifts
with Jacob today.

171
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:50,589
Alice, if you want to continue
to be a gift bearer,

172
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,725
you have to conduct yourself
like one.

173
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:58,064
Your body is a gift from God.

174
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:01,399
You need to honor it.

175
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,549
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

176
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,686
Um, bless me Father
for I have sinned.

177
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,089
It has been a week
since my last confession.

178
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,790
These are my sins...

179
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:01,793
Talking back to my dad...

180
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:05,164
Not helping my mom
in the kitchen...

181
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:09,935
Forgetting to feed the dog...

182
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,937
And...

183
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,440
And anything else?

184
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:19,644
That's it.

185
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,680
For penance,

186
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,682
why don't you do
the dishes for a week?

187
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,117
Give your mom a break.

188
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,752
And ten Hail Marys
and ten Our Fathers.

189
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:33,159
God, the Father of mercies,

190
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,194
through the death
and resurrection of his Son,

191
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,229
has reconciled
the world to itself

192
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:38,830
and sent the Holy Spirit
among us

193
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:40,565
for the forgiveness of sins...

194
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,234
Give us this day
our daily bread,

195
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:44,203
and forgive us
of our trespasses,

196
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,105
as we forgive those that
trespass against us...

197
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,207
<i>Your body is a gift from God.</i>

198
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,874
<i>It's against God's plan.</i>

199
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,178
<i>You need to honor it.</i>

200
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:55,147
<i>Or else it is
damnation for all eternity.</i>

201
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,882
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in Heaven.

202
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,818
<i>It's called Kirkos.</i>

are going to be good for us.

219
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:17,229
I don't know.

220
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:19,697
Ugh!

221
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:23,601
Father looks so weird
in regular people clothes.

222
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,371
Oh, my God! Nina's here!

223
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:27,939
She must be one
of the group leaders.

224
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:29,908
Welcome, everyone.

225
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,677
Who's that?

226
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,214
Are you serious?
That's Chris.

227
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,816
He's only like the star
of the football team.

228
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,323
Welcome to Kirkos.

229
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,259

Hi! Alice, right?

239
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,923
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

240
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:22,261
I'm Nina. Come with me.
You're in my cabin. Come on.

241
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,362
Sorry.

242
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm so excited for you guys.

243
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:34,806
OK. Find the room
with your name on the door.

244
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:58,464
Oh, sorry!

245
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,032
I didn't mean to scare you!

246
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,367
You settling in?

247
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,136
I've got a sweatshirt
here for you.

248
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,703
Thanks.

249
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,973
And... next order
of beeswax is...

250
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:10,942
I'm gonna need
your cell phone and/or watch,

251
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,311
if you have 'em.

252
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,812
Did you bring either one
of those with you?

253
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:16,148
Mm-hmm.

254
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:34,933
No phone?

255
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,468
- Mm-mm.
- K.

256
00:19:36,502 --> 00:19:38,937
Don't worry,
you won't be needing

257
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,241
a watch this weekend anyway
because...

258
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:44,210
you're on Jesus' time!

259
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:46,811
See ya!

260
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,485
Please find
your small group number!

261
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,088
Cut the chit-chat, please,
and have a seat.

262
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,357
Sit at the table
with your small group number.

263
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,192
Please find
your small group number.

264
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,895
- I guess I'll see you later.
- What?

265
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,111
Group One?

266
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:21,980
Awesome!

267
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,184
I'm Chris,
Group One's Senior Leader.

268
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,285
Have a seat.

269
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,157
Group One too?
Awesome! Have a seat.

270
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,795
You are here
as a part of God's plan.

271
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:42,268
His spirit moved each of you
to sign up for this retreat,

272
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:45,471
which is a unique experience
that will challenge you

273
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:48,073
in new and profound ways.

274
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:50,276
Kirkos is a time
to find meaning

275
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,344
in the highs and lows
of your life.

276
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,313
Over these next four days

277
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:56,148
you will hear
from your classmates

278
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,350
and be invited
to open up as well.

279
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:01,320
It will strengthen your
relationship with yourself,

280
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:05,491
but most importantly,
with Jesus.

281
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:07,359
Now let's get started.

282
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:09,328
On the papers
that Mrs. Veda is handing out,

283
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,430
you're going to find
a list of feelings.

284
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:13,898
Go through them
and circle any

285
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,502
that you may have felt
in the past year or so.

286
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:20,339
There are no wrong answers.
So just, just be honest.

287
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:13,659
<i>While ladies,
they typically need to...</i>

288
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,860
<i>preheat for a while.</i>

289
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:32,977
OK. Let's finish up.

290
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,646
Pass your papers
toward the aisles.

291
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,616
And make sure that your name
is printed clearly on top.

292
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,192
Come on.

293
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,599
The other night I dreamt
that I was walking

294
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:54,966
along the beach with the Lord.

295
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,468
As we walked,

296
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,171
scenes from my life
flashed across the sky

297
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:00,639
and in each scene,

298
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,708
I noticed that there were
footprints in the sand.

299
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:05,943
In some scenes there were
two sets of footprints

300
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:09,615
and in other scenes there was
only one set of footprints.

301
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:17,389
Hey.

302
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,458
Oh. Hey.

303
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:21,693
- Hey, Sister Louise.
- Hi.

304
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:24,596
Do you mind if I snag another
stupendous Walking Taco?

305
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,033
Of course, dear.
You're a growing boy!

306
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:32,104
And Walking Tacos have lots
of protein and fiber.

307
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,173
Oh, may I have some sour cream
too, please?

308
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,674
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

309
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,510
You're welcome.
What about you, dear?

310
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,546
- Oh, no, no thanks.
- No?

311
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,750
No sour cream?
No, that is the best part.

312
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:46,485
OK.

313
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:49,421
I guess I'll have some.

314
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,423
How's everything going for you
so far, Alice?

315
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,425
It's great.

316
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:58,497
You know, it's OK if you think
things are totally weird.

317
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,200
It's supposed to be
a little weird.

318
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,135
At least at first.

319
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,571
I'll see you later, Alice.

320
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:07,239
OK, bye!

321
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,545
I come from a very big family.

322
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:18,584
I have four younger siblings
and...

323
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:21,587
an older sister...

324
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,689
Melissa.

325
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:26,525
She made honor roll
every semester

326
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,527
and she founded
Habitat for Humanity

327
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,095
at our school.

328
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:32,631
She's the star of our family.

329
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:35,701
One time,
I came home at 2:00 a.m....

330
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,670
three hours past my curfew.

331
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,810
And no one even noticed.

332
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:48,780
It felt like no one cared

333
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:52,784
if I was there or not.

334
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:54,419
Um...

335
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,088
Uh...

336
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,724
I'd now like to play
my first song.

337
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:13,372
<i>♪ You don't notice me
standing here ♪</i>

338
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:16,575
<i>♪ Wishing you
could somehow feel ♪</i>

339
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:18,777
<i>♪ I just wish
that you could feel ♪</i>

340
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,114
Last fall,
Melissa came to pick me up

341
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,483
from a friend's house
to take me home.

342
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:30,188
<i>♪ And each day we were born ♪</i>

343
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:34,793
And the next thing I remember
is waking up in the hospital

344
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,662
being told that
we were in an accident

345
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:40,465
and that I had
three broken ribs...

346
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:45,304
And the first thought
I had was...

347
00:25:49,374 --> 00:25:55,314
Maybe my parents will finally
start to notice me.

348
00:25:58,383 --> 00:26:00,752
Melissa was fine but...

349
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:02,854
my parents
were still obsessed with her.

350
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:08,760
It felt like
they blamed me for the accident.

351
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:12,531
That if she hadn't
had to come and pick me up,

352
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:15,667
she wouldn't have missed
her Science Bowl nationals.

353
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:19,738
But then,
I came on to this retreat...

354
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:26,278
And I realized
that God loves me...

355
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:28,747
my friends love me...

356
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,150
and...

357
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:36,154
I love me too.

358
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:43,582
OK, guys, circle up, circle up.

359
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,422
Now, this is one
of my favorite songs,

360
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:53,425
and while you're listening,
I want you to imagine

361
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:57,429
that the eyes in the song
are Jesus's eyes.

362
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,555
<i>♪ Love ♪</i>

363
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:32,364
<i>♪ I get so lost sometimes ♪</i>

364
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:37,636
<i>♪ Days pass ♪</i>

365
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:43,608
<i>♪ And this emptiness
fills my heart ♪</i>

366
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:47,445
<i>♪ When I want to run away ♪</i>

367
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:54,586
Would you look at how
these gorgeous pines

368
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,089
contrast against the blue sky?!

369
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:00,625
Isn't God's paint palette
just magnificent?

370
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,828
So did I tell you Nina
told me she liked my hair

371
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:05,031
- this morning at breakfast?
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,998
She said she can't do it
with her own hair

373
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:09,434
because every time she tries it
her hair gets all bumpy.

374
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,837
So I said I could
show her how I do it

375
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,939
and she said she would
invite me over sometime!

376
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,473
Isn't that cool?

377
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:16,942
Yeah.

378
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:23,415
I mean, you can come too,
of course, if you want.

379
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,883
Well, maybe I should
ask Nina first

380
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,718
if it's OK that you're there,

381
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:28,753
but I mean
do you even wanna come?

382
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,989
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

383
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,891
Are you OK?

384
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,994
Everything OK here, troops?

385
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:38,064
Ooh, comrade.

386
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:40,432
That's quite a battle wound.

387
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:41,533
Uh-huh.

388
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,435
Can you walk?

389
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:48,107
- No. No. No.
- OK. Just don't move.

390
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,178
Let's get you to the nurse, huh?

391
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:15,901
Hey.

392
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:18,037
I was just coming to let you
know we're doing the group photo

393
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,671
down by the bridge in five.

394
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:23,808
Great. I'll be there.

395
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,212
Everything OK in here?

396
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:28,147
Yep.

397
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,547
OK.

398
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,586
What was that?

399
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,628
I specifically asked you
for your phone

400
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,198
on the day you arrived.

401
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:49,901
Look, I'm gonna have
to tell Father about this.

402
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:54,439
Uh, Chris,
could you come in, please?

403
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:59,811
Hey, Alice,
what'd you have for breakfast?

404
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:01,646
Cereal.

405
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,581
Oh, you didn't have salad?

406
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,883
Like a Wade salad.

407
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:09,587
OK. Everybody say Jesus Christ!

408
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,656
Jesus Christ!

409
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,092
OK, great!

410
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,960
Guys, head up
toward the cafeteria.

411
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:17,495
We're gonna have lunch
in our small groups today, OK?

412
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:23,768
And Alice, Alice, a quick word.

413
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:30,008
Nina said you kept your phone.

414
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:34,779
You know, we have a reason
for everything

415
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:36,581
that we ask you to do here

416
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:38,783
and it's very important
that you follow our rules.

417
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:40,685
Sorry, Father.

418
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:43,722
I hope you understand I can't
let this go unpunished.

419
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:48,194
Now first, you must empty
the trash receptacles.

420
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:50,729
There are four of them.

421
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:56,102
One there... and one there...

422
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:58,737
and one there...

423
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:22,861
Come on.

424
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:58,957
What?

425
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,800
Alice!

426
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,303
- Hey.
- What's up?

427
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:48,840
Just finished cleaning.

428
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:50,708
We made S'mores after lunch.

429
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:51,943
Saved you one.

430
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:54,846
Thanks.

431
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:57,049
We pretended each marshmallow
was a different mortal sin

432
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:58,384
before burning it.

433
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,386
Yours was lust.

434
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:01,420
Oh.

435
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,492
Look, I want you to know
I'm not mad

436
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,161
about the phone thing, OK?

437
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:11,263
You're doing a real good job

438
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:14,300
and I think
you're on the right path now.

439
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,036
So, just keep up
the good work, OK?

440
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:18,204
OK.

441
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:22,074
I believe in you.

442
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:45,064
"Dear Andrew...

443
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:49,968
Remember when you were little

444
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:51,936
and Mom and I would tuck you in,

445
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,206
and you would make us kiss you
on both of your cheeks

446
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,507
at exactly the same time

447
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:58,210
or else
you couldn't fall asleep?

448
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:00,246
I always thought those
were my favorite memories

449
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:02,248
from when
we were a young family.

450
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,815
But I was wrong.

451
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:06,452
Every day is a new
favorite memory with you.

452
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,355
I love you, kiddo.

453
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:11,490
Love, Dad."

454
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:17,529
"Dear Laura...

455
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,799
Your father and I
love you so much.

456
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,801
And although
I will always cherish

457
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,205
those days
when you were little,

458
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:28,906
I love being able to do
adult things with you too...

459
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,975
like getting our nails done

460
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:34,446
and showing you how to cook
my famous baked ziti.

461
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,286
But no matter what,
you'll always be my baby girl.

462
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:42,388
I love you so much."

463
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:49,161
"Dear Alice,

464
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:51,929
You're a wonderful daughter
and the best church partner

465
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:55,301
a father could ask for.
It's so amazing

466
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,969
to watch you grow
into the wholesome young woman

467
00:37:58,002 --> 00:38:01,340
God created you to be.
I am so proud of you

468
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:06,345
for always making good choices.
Love you, Al.

469
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:07,446
Love, Dad."

470
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:28,233
Amen.

471
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,169
Amen.

472
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:35,574
All right.
Like myself

473
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,909
and my fellow senior leaders
have done,

474
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,311
we are now gonna ask

475
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:42,247
that you all share
your own stories.

476
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,050
Moments when life
was difficult,

477
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:48,620
or hard, or overwhelming.

478
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,022
Times where you felt
Jesus was far away.

479
00:38:56,328 --> 00:39:00,599
My girlfriend
dumped me last week.

480
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,967
That was really rough.

481
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,603
I thought everything
was going well,

482
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,206
and last week,
she had her friend call me

483
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,241
to break up with me for her.

484
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:11,043
And I'm pretty sure
it was a three-way call,

485
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:15,547
and she was listening,
so I acted like it was cool,

486
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:18,417
but it really sucked.

487
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,884
Thank you, Andrew.

488
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:26,991
This is really hard
to talk about.

489
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:30,462
But...

490
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:33,065
Last month...

491
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:39,071
my Grandma died.

492
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:43,075
She lived in Idaho,
so I didn't see her that often.

493
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:48,647
And like,
it makes me really sad

494
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,617
that we didn't get to talk much
before she died.

495
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,521
The saddest part is...
after her funeral,

496
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:58,657
we went back to her house,

497
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,361
and her dog was there,
just looking so sad.

498
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:04,229
It was, like,
walking around the house

499
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:07,999
looking for her.
It had no idea.

500
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:21,012
OK...

501
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,149
Um...

502
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,686
Well...

503
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:32,691
Speaking of dogs...

504
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,031
My dog... Gus...

505
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,767
died a few weeks ago.

506
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,706
Um, our neighbors put out
some chipmunk poison.

507
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:55,113
He must have got into it
through the chain-link fence.

508
00:40:55,147 --> 00:40:58,083
My family was playing basketball
in our driveway,

509
00:40:58,116 --> 00:41:00,385
and the ball
went over the fence,

510
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,588
and I went to go get it,

511
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:07,159
and... that's where
I found him...

512
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,499
lying on his side.
He wasn't moving.

513
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,323
- I thought he was just...
- Excuse me.

514
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:39,558
All right, can I have
your attention, please?

515
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,827
All eyes and ears here.

516
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,530
I'm sorry to report
that earlier this morning,

517
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:46,198
I found something
rather disturbing

518
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:48,467
on my office computer.

519
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,202
It appears that someone
has used it

520
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:53,672
to engage
in an online chat of...

521
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:56,775
well, let's just say
an explicit nature.

522
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,344
Would anyone like to take
responsibility for this?

523
00:42:04,116 --> 00:42:07,452
I didn't think so.

524
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:11,823
Now, I have no way
of knowing who did this,

525
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:17,162
but whoever it was,
even if I don't know you did it,

526
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:21,466
you do, and so does God.

527
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,136
But in keeping with the theme
of this retreat,

528
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,172
I hope that whomever did do it
feels compelled

529
00:42:27,205 --> 00:42:29,441
by the Spirit of Christ
to come forward

530
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:31,677
before the retreat is through.

531
00:43:02,574 --> 00:43:04,910
So, Alice,
how would you describe

532
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:07,245
your relationship with Jesus?

533
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:09,481
- Fine.
- Just fine?

534
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:13,885
Fine, as in good.

535
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:16,221
Do you think that there might
be something getting in the way?

536
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:18,523
Something that's preventing it
from being better?

537
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,762
OK, well, why don't you try
reflecting back

538
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:25,530
on that feelings checklist
you filled out

539
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:28,166
on your first day here.
Do any of the emotions

540
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,736
that you circled on there
bring anything up?

541
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:32,904
Um...

542
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:40,812
I was feeling envious
of my best friend

543
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:44,216
when she got a Beamer
for her birthday,

544
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:47,185
because I drive
a Buick Le Sabre.

545
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:50,889
Anything else?

546
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:53,792
She also got Oakley sunglasses
for Christmas.

547
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:58,730
What about feeling turned on?

548
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:07,506
No temptation
has overtaken you

549
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:09,675
except what is common
to mankind.

550
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,276
And God will not let you
be tempted

551
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:12,811
beyond what you can bear,
and he knows

552
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:14,613
what is truly in your heart.

553
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:19,351
OK.

554
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:24,556
So, have you ever
felt turned on?

555
00:44:28,994 --> 00:44:31,730
And did you take any action
when you had that feeling?

556
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,734
You didn't take any action?

557
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:39,237
No.

558
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,810
Nothing with
your classmate Wade?

559
00:44:47,612 --> 00:44:50,415
No.

560
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:51,983
Someone made that up.

561
00:44:55,054 --> 00:44:56,922
Alice, this retreat
isn't gonna do you any favors

562
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:58,390
if you're not honest.

563
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,438
How's this?

564
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:17,609
Wow! That one's huge.
Way to go, Alice.

565
00:45:20,746 --> 00:45:22,280
Thanks.

566
00:45:36,962 --> 00:45:39,965
And when you turn it on,
our plasma rises

567
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,000
out of this little Oak unit.

568
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:44,302
But when you press off,
it sinks back down

569
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:46,304
and a Rothko takes its place.

570
00:45:46,338 --> 00:45:48,473
Your rec room sounds amazing!

571
00:45:48,507 --> 00:45:50,675
Hey, Nina, that, um...

572
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,611
leader meeting
is about to start.

573
00:45:52,644 --> 00:45:55,047
Right, right.
I forgot about that.

574
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:57,382
Thank you. Um, I gotta go.

575
00:45:57,415 --> 00:45:59,451
OK. I'll see you
at the campfire.

576
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:12,998
Hey!

577
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:14,533
What?

578
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:19,038
What is your problem with me?

579
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:21,973
My problem? My problem is
that Heather almost dumped me

580
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:23,909
because of that disgusting rumor
you started.

581
00:46:23,942 --> 00:46:25,577
I didn't start it!

582
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,479
Yeah, well,
if you didn't, who did?

583
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:30,015
I don't know! I...

584
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:31,083
Did you start it?

585
00:46:31,117 --> 00:46:34,419
No! I have a girlfriend.

586
00:46:34,452 --> 00:46:37,556
OK. Well,
both you and I know

587
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,559
that nothing happened.

588
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:44,329
Are you telling people that?

589
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:50,502
You need to start!
Because everyone thinks

590
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:53,338
that I'm a slut,
even the teachers.

591
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:57,008
Look, you're
the only other person

592
00:46:57,043 --> 00:46:58,443
who knows what happened.

593
00:46:58,476 --> 00:47:00,946
And no one believes me!

594
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:03,115
Hey, Wade! What are you
still doing here?

595
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:04,883
Just on my way out, Father.

596
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,952
OK, good, good.
Hey, how's the old shotput arm

597
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:08,720
- doing in the off season?
- Good, Father.

598
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:10,689
Just trying not to do
too much heavy lifting.

599

611
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:50,956
I need a cup of tea.

612
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,232
I'm all done.

613
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:01,833
OK, dear.

614
00:49:01,866 --> 00:49:04,936
It is the best.

615
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,571
...and the colorful,
like, floral tops.

616
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:07,572
- The stripes, the stripes!
- Hey!

617
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:08,773
It's so good.

618
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:10,809
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

619
00:49:10,842 --> 00:49:12,211
- Um...
- I'll save you a seat.

620
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,812
OK.

621
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,185
What's up?
Nina asked me to sit with her,

622
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:21,187
so I don't want
to make her wait.

623
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,790
I saw Nina giving Adam
a blow job.

624
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:27,059
What?!

625
00:49:27,093 --> 00:49:29,128
Yeah. In the woods
after lunch.

626
00:49:34,066 --> 00:49:37,103
Why do you think it's OK
to keep making things up?

627
00:49:37,136 --> 00:49:38,903
I'm not making this up!

628
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:40,538
Gabby told me you were talking

629
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:43,109
about your dog dying
in your small group?

630
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:45,010
- Did Gus die?
- OK, look.

631
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:47,679
I just said that because...
I didn't know what to do!

632
00:49:47,712 --> 00:49:49,014
I didn't have anything to say,
and everyone had

633
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:50,582
these really sad stories...

634
00:49:50,615 --> 00:49:52,650
God,
this is just like

635
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:54,286
that time in sixth grade
when you told everyone

636
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,720
Jason gave you
a "purple nurple"

637
00:49:55,754 --> 00:49:57,056
on the bus.

638
00:49:57,089 --> 00:49:58,890
You want attention.

639
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:00,859
- OK...
- You know what?

640
00:50:00,892 --> 00:50:02,827
I bet you actually did
toss Wade's salad.

641
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:04,030
I don't even know
what that means!

642
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:05,231
Oh, my God. Quit the act.

643
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:06,865
I know you know what it means,

644
00:50:06,898 --> 00:50:08,267
just like you know
the sex scene in <i>Titanic</i>

645
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,169
comes right after
they're in the car.

646
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:16,775
You were the one
in Father's office, weren't you?

647
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:20,112
What?

648
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:24,250
It makes perfect sense.

649
00:50:24,283 --> 00:50:28,220
And I am sick of constantly
feeling embarrassed

650
00:50:28,254 --> 00:50:31,723
for being friends
with a pervy psycho.

651
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,603
Ugh.

652
00:50:50,276 --> 00:50:52,710
Ugh.

653
00:52:50,229 --> 00:52:53,265
Alice, hey.

654
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:55,301
Hey.

655
00:52:55,334 --> 00:52:56,968
Is everything all right?

656
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:59,837
Uh...

657
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,207
Do you wanna talk?

658
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:12,451
Is everything OK?

659
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,461
What are you doing?

660
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:35,307
What are you doing?!

661
00:53:37,142 --> 00:53:39,010
You know that I get turned on
like a microwave!

690
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:53,138
I used to be Catholic.
I went to Catholic school

691
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:57,309
for 12 years.
I was baptized, confirmed,

692
00:56:57,342 --> 00:57:01,113
the whole kit 'n caboodle.

693
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:03,315
You're not anymore?

694
00:57:03,348 --> 00:57:06,552
No.

695
00:57:06,585 --> 00:57:08,654
How come?

696
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:12,357
San Francisco. The '70s.

697
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,993
Sex. Women. Mm.

698
00:57:16,028 --> 00:57:20,332
Lots of reasons.
But I remember being your age

699
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:23,068
and just being scared shitless

700
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:25,471
that I was gonna wind up
in hell.

701
00:57:25,504 --> 00:57:28,005
Really?

702
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,675
- For what?
- Oh, God.

703
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:33,378
For everything.
Cheating on my homework,

704
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:37,516
for giving up sugar for Lent
and then eating a whole jar

705
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:42,488
of gumdrops underneath
my grandmother's staircase.

706
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:45,757
I literally thought
I was going to hell

707
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:48,227
for eating gumdrops.

708
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:52,364
And that there would be
a big red devil there

709
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:56,068
with a poker,
and he'd poke at me.

710
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:57,703
And my bed would be
made out of coals,

711
00:57:57,736 --> 00:58:00,539
and there'd be nothing
but peas to eat,

712
00:58:00,572 --> 00:58:03,108
'cause I hate peas.

713
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:24,730
I thought I was
gonna go to hell.

714
00:58:24,763 --> 00:58:29,601
for... rewinding <i>Titanic</i>

715
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:35,307
back to the sex scene...
three times.

716
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:40,746
You know, I thought
I was gonna go to hell

717
00:58:40,779 --> 00:58:42,514
for looking through my dad's

718
00:58:42,548 --> 00:58:44,750
<i>Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Edition.</i>

719
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:47,619
I thought I was going to hell
for having cybersex!

720
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:52,658
Yep.

721
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:02,668
You know, the truth is,
nobody knows what they're doing

722
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:05,704
any more than the rest of us.
We're all just trying

723
00:59:05,737 --> 00:59:07,339
to figure out our shit.

724
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,414
But be careful online, OK?

725
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,683
Don't give your password
out to anyone,

726
00:59:17,716 --> 00:59:19,718
not even someone who says
they work for AOL.

727
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:22,821
They don't. They just want
to give you the Melissa virus.

728
00:59:29,161 --> 00:59:31,897
Now, I got to get you back
to that Jesus camp.

729
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:36,435
I don't want any nuns showing up
at my bar looking for ya.

730
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:43,275
I know. Come on.
I'll give you a lift.

731
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:56,555
Mm.

732
00:59:56,588 --> 00:59:59,224
- Thanks.
- No problem, kid.

733
01:00:02,628 --> 01:00:07,499
Hey. Have you thought about
where you might go to college?

734
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:14,673
Um... probably State?

735
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:16,475
Why don't you
check out some schools

736
01:00:16,508 --> 01:00:19,511
on the East and West Coasts?

737
01:00:19,544 --> 01:00:22,180
You might like getting
outta this town for a bit.

738
01:00:26,652 --> 01:00:28,186
Wait!

739
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:39,364
Do you know what...
tossing someone's salad is?

740
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,607
It's means licking
someone's butthole.

741
01:00:53,979 --> 01:00:55,547
Good luck out there, kid.

742
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:47,899
Hey, how's it going?

743
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:49,835
I really miss my cat.

744
01:01:52,904 --> 01:01:56,007
Um... what's your cat's name?

745
01:01:58,376 --> 01:01:59,845
Kyoto.

746
01:01:59,878 --> 01:02:03,049
Oh, that's pretty.
What does it mean?

747
01:02:03,082 --> 01:02:05,951
It's a city is Japan.
I love Japan!

748
01:02:05,984 --> 01:02:07,719
I'm going to go with my mom
when I turn 18

749
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:09,521
as a... a graduation present.

750
01:02:09,554 --> 01:02:11,623
Cool. What are you
gonna do there?

751
01:02:11,656 --> 01:02:14,626
Try all the weird Japanese candy
and eat a ton of sushi.

752
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:15,994
I've never had sushi.

753
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:18,730
Oh, my God! It's so good.

754
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:22,901
We should go to Taki sometime.
They have the best sushi.

755
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:26,505
- Yeah.
- In this city, anyway.

756
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:49,394
Hey.

757
01:02:49,427 --> 01:02:50,796
Hey.

758
01:02:52,964 --> 01:02:55,700
So, everyone says
that it was Wade

759
01:02:55,734 --> 01:02:59,071
who used Father's computer.

760
01:02:59,105 --> 01:03:00,072
Oh.

761
01:03:00,106 --> 01:03:01,973
Yeah.

762
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:04,509
Father found his bracelet
in his office or something.

763
01:03:04,543 --> 01:03:08,047
Mm.

764
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,748
I'm sorry
I thought it was you.

765
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:15,754
It's OK.

766
01:03:15,787 --> 01:03:18,090
But now that we know
he's a perv,

767
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:20,792
he probably made up that rumor
about you guys.

768
01:03:20,826 --> 01:03:25,697
He clearly made it up
to hide the fact that he's gay.

769
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:26,765
What?

770
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:28,466
Yeah, apparently,

771
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,737
whatever he did
on Father's computer was gay.

772
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:35,107
But... he has a girlfriend.

773
01:03:35,141 --> 01:03:37,642
Yeah. A girlfriend
who doesn't even kiss

774
01:03:37,676 --> 01:03:42,081
because she's afraid
it'll lead to sex.

775
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:43,815
The perfect cover-up.

776
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:58,097
Ew.

777
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,874
We have a mantra
here at Kirkos.

778
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:12,744
Question the First,
Weep the Second,

779
01:04:12,777 --> 01:04:16,182
Accept the Third,
Live the Fourth.

780
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:19,751
It refers to
the four days of Kirkos.

781
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:21,653
Now, they're all pretty
self-explanatory,

782
01:04:21,686 --> 01:04:24,689
except for
that last one: live.

783
01:04:24,723 --> 01:04:27,459
What that means is
to take what you have learned

784
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:30,162
this weekend, what you
have discovered about yourself,

785
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:33,832
and incorporate it
into your everyday lives.

786
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:37,969
To live each day like it
is the fourth day of Kirkos.

787
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:39,838
Now, I'm going to ask
that you come up here

788
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:41,640
and speak about
your experiences this weekend

789
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:44,743
with the whole group.
There's no set order.

790
01:04:44,776 --> 01:04:47,445
Just let the Spirit of Christ
move you.

791
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:09,701
I, uh...

792
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:16,142
I gave in to temptation.

793
01:05:16,175 --> 01:05:20,011
This is not who I am,
but I let myself lose control.

794
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:21,780
This retreat has taught me,
though, that,

795
01:05:21,813 --> 01:05:25,650
through the love
of my friends, teachers,

796
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:27,119
and, most importantly, Jesus,

797
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:30,056
that there is nothing
I can't overcome.

798
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:11,529
Being in high school sucks.

799
01:06:11,563 --> 01:06:15,734
People love to talk, but...

800
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:24,210
just because you hear something
doesn't mean that it's true.

801
01:06:24,243 --> 01:06:30,548
When people spread lies
about you, it hurts.

802
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:35,854
It makes you feel alone...

803
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:38,723
and empty.

804
01:06:38,757 --> 01:06:44,196
And... sometimes...

805
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,799
you do things
that you're not proud of.

806
01:06:51,002 --> 01:06:54,572
But look...

807
01:06:54,606 --> 01:06:58,244
we're all hiding stuff.

808
01:06:58,277 --> 01:07:01,913
All kinds of stuff.
What if we just try

809
01:07:01,946 --> 01:07:07,286
to be honest and to treat
each other with respect?

810
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:09,888
That's what
Jesus wanted, right?

811
01:07:09,921 --> 01:07:15,094
And then, maybe, we can stop
feeling so guilty

812
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:18,364
about who we are all the time,
because the truth is,

813
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:20,166
we're all just trying
to figure out our shit.

814
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:26,604
Sorry, um...

815
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:07,645
Have you ever had sushi?

816
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,416
Sushi? You mean
like raw fish?

817
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:12,351
No.

818
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:13,985
Who are you gonna go
to church with

819
01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:15,920
when I go to college?

820
01:08:15,954 --> 01:08:18,257
College? That's not
for two more years.

821
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,159
A year and a half.

822
01:08:20,192 --> 01:08:22,961
I don't know.

823
01:08:28,766 --> 01:08:30,236
Maybe I'll start going
to the late service again

824
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:31,803
so your mom will come.

825
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:39,178
Besides, State's only
40 minutes away.

826
01:08:39,211 --> 01:08:41,646
Just come home
on the weekends.

827
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:15,980
Hey.

828
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:24,290
- Um...
- Hey.

829
01:09:24,323 --> 01:09:27,059
You don't have
to be scared of me.

830
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:29,761
I... I'm not scared of you.

831
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,897
It won't happen again.

832
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:36,834
Friends?

833
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:40,439
Friends.

834
01:09:42,107 --> 01:09:44,510
Hug?

835
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:45,877
Side hug.

836
01:09:53,552 --> 01:09:56,355
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

837
01:09:56,388 --> 01:09:58,823
It has been a week
since my last confession.

838
01:09:58,856 --> 01:10:01,427
These are my sins.

839
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,830
Talking back to my parents.

840
01:10:05,863 --> 01:10:08,733
Not doing my chores.

841
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,873
Is that it?

842
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:27,152
No. It's something
that happened on the retreat.

843
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:29,854
OK.

844
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,924
I watched people having sex.

845
01:10:40,165 --> 01:10:41,467
All right.

846
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,202
It was a video.

847
01:10:43,235 --> 01:10:47,573
There was a man and a woman.

848
01:10:47,606 --> 01:10:51,577
And the woman was wearing
a hot pink bra.

849
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:55,347
They were on
the hood of a car.

850
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,216
With graffiti on it.

851
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:07,359
And I did it,

852
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:11,996
even though I knew
it was a sin.

853
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:14,099
Will God still forgive me?

854
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:19,971
That's between you and God.

855
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:28,080
For penance, fifty Hail Marys
and fifty Our Fathers.

856
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:34,119
God, the Father of mercies,

857
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:36,255
through the death and
resurrection of his Son

858
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:38,590
has reconciled the world
to himself

859
01:11:38,624 --> 01:11:40,526
and sent the Holy Spirit
among us

860
01:11:40,559 --> 01:11:43,028
for the forgiveness of sins...

861
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,229
"Where to, miss?"

862
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:18,597
"Stars..."

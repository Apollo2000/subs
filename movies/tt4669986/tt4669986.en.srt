2
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,967
I'm pregnant.

3
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,494
Good.

4
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,629
That's real good.

5
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,675
There it goes.

6
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,765
Whoo! Whoo!

7
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,730
Yes. Timing's still off 'bout two degrees.

8
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,190
Looked fine to me. What you think?

9
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,817
I think we won.

10
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,322
That's fine right there. Now, come on.
Come on, now. Come on.

11
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,282
Now that's a fast car you fellas got.

12
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,118
And it's mighty fine of you
to let us boys race with y'all.

13
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,587
Whoo!

14
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,453
Get your hands out there, come on.

15
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,001
Come on, Garnet, come on.

16
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,837
Get ready to dance with old Virgil.
Come on.

17
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,195
Damn, Richard. Slow down.

18
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,708
- All right now.
- Where you going?

19
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,520
What you think? Do you like it?

20
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,570
Like what?

21
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,911
This spot. Right here.

22
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,662
This field?

23
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,914
Yeah.

24
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,250
This field not a half a mile from my house
I've been knowing all my life?

25
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,507
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,928
Yes. I like it.

27
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,189
I'm gonna put the kitchen back.
Right back here.

28
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,945
Richard, stop this!

29
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,781
I don't know what you're saying.

30
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,709
I bought it.

31
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,622
This whole acre.

32
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,462
I'm gonna build you a house.

33
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,136
Right here.

34
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,854
Our house.

35
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,325
Mildred?

36
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,333
Yes?

37
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,005
Would you marry me?

38
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,100
Garnet, come.

39
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,648
He said he'd bought the whole acre for me.

40
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,114
And then he asked me to marry him.

41
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,203
- No he didn't!
- Yes.

42
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,205
- Right out in the field?
- Uh-huh.

43
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,208
Oh, Lord, that man might be crazy.

44
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,124
Well, when you gonna do it?

45
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,046
He didn't say.

46
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,499
Soon, though.

47
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,794
Before the baby comes.

48
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,341
He gonna take my sister from me?

49
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,684
No.

50
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,222
We'll be right down the road.

51
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,002
Everything looks fine.

52
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,342
- Thank you, Miss Lola. We'll see you soon.
- We'll be here.

53
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,674
Hey, now.

54
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,853
- Hey, Momma.
- They're out back.

55
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,946
- How we doing?
- Hmm.

56
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,947
Get that board and get up under there.
See if you can get that collector loose.

57
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,013
So I'm gonna take Mildred
up to D.C. to get married.

58
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,314
So, you sure about that?

59
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,488
Yeah.

60
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,330
And you need a witness?

61
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,160
No.

62
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,743
I'm gonna ask her dad
to come up there with us.

63
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,293
Rich is gonna take Mildred
up to D.C. to get married.

64
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,046
String Bean?

65
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,009
Don't make no damn sense.
Now, you'd be fine living in the house.

66
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,799
No wife, just fine.
You don't need no wife.

67
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,260
Well, now, she gonna be your girl.
Why people wanna get married?

68
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,469
Don't make no sense, man.

69
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,186
You think they'll see us today?

70
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,231
Yeah. I called up there.

71
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,402
Seem like a long drive to me.

72
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,331
Thanks for coming, Jake.

73
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,163
Daddy, what's the city like?

74
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,047
It's fine.

75
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:43,147
Marriage is an institution
of the highest importance.

76
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,313
And it's made honorable
by faithful couples

77
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,400
who are committed to each other for life.

78
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,117
Do you have the ring?

79
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,080
By the power vested in me
by the District of Columbia,

80
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,591
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

81
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,599
I may not forgive him.

82
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,806
Come on, now.

83
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,724
You lucky if I forgive you.

84
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,058
No reason to go all the way up there
for this and not take us.

85
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,271
We took Daddy.

86
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,649
Like that means a thing.

87
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,445
Richard said there would be less
red tape in Washington. That's all.

88
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,451
You can stop looking at it,
String Bean, you know it's purdy.

89
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm turning in.

90
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,851
What you think 'bout
a bedroom in the back?

91
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,399
I'll like it however you make it.

92
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,330
I'll be in there soon.

93
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,200
Mmm-hmm.

94
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,874
I thought something like this.

95
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,414
Hey, Momma.

96
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,082
Sheriff's Deputy came by looking for you.

97
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,333
What did he want?

98
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,752
Wanted to find you.

99
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,719
Hmm.

100
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Did you tell him where I was?

101
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,769
I didn't have nothing to tell him.

102
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,668
Like me raising a barn, but, you know...

103
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,377
Thinking the kind of fuel in that car,
that was different.

104
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,882
- That car was great.
- Applesauce good.

105
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,682
But, you know...

106
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,303
What you like, Rich, Ford or Chevy?

107
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,646
Eh, don't make much difference.

108
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,016
But which one faster?

109
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,352
That depend on who built it.

110
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,560
That's what I said.

111
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,358
How much money you win with that car?

112
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,402
Boy, why you're asking
him about his money?

113
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,155
He doesn't have to answer me.

114
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,612
How many races you won, Rich?

115
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,695
Oh.

116
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,373
Uh...

117
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,832
A lot.

118
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,836
You need my hand, you need
my hand, too? Count on this one.

119
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,265
I didn't think he was gonna stop.

120
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,094
I wanna know, you know?

121
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,394
Ask that question...

122
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,712
In here!

123
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,920
What you doing in that bed, boy?

124
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,264
- Richard?
- What're you doing in bed with that woman?

125
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,218
I'm his wife.

126
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,601
That's no good here.

127
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,857
Get your pants on, boy.

128
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,777
You get out of that bed.

129
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,618
Get out of that bed!

130
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,789
All right.

131
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,414
Come on.

132
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,304
All right.

133
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,530
She goes in there.

134
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,076
It's all right.

135
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,665
- Come on!
- It's okay.

136
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,213
It's okay.

137
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,590
Richard Loving?

138
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,673
Yeah.

139
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,599
You made bail.

140
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,806
Bean?

141
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,558
Bean?

142
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,644
Richard?

143
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,857
Go on down.

144
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,988
- What about her?
- Just you.

145
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,321
What do you mean? Wait, wait. Wait!

146
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,747
Don't pull me again.

147
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,493
- Come on now.
- That's not right.

148
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,037
Bean.

149
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,339
Richard?

150
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,878
- It ain't right now!
- Come on!

151
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,678
It ain't right!

152
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,288
Sign at the bottom.

153
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,876
What about my wife?

154
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,412
You'll have to talk to the Judge
about that on Monday.

155
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,415
Monday?

156
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,032
That's good.

157
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,241
Okay. Just rest. Just rest.

158
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,538
Richard!

159
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,954
- Richard!
- Yeah?

160
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,207
Bring me that fresh water
and take this one out.

161
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,504
Okay.

162
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,207
Bear down.

163
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,343
Bear down.

164
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,677
- Here, Mom.
- Leave that down.

165
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,552
Good. Good.

166
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,134
Wait. Wait.

167
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,843
What you gonna do?

168
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,302
How did they know to come get us?

169
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,394
Somebody talked.

170
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,297
Hey!

171
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:58,836
Hey!

172
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,098
We told you to come back
on Monday and talk to the Judge.

173
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,891
I ain't gonna let her
stay there till Monday.

174
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,098
- It's not right.
- Talk to the Judge.

175
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,312
You're not allowed to bail her out.

176
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,696
- I'll get a lawyer.
- You can.

177
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,500
Hey, boy.

178
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
Come on.

179
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,188
Sit down.

180
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,828
You back here trying to bail her out?

181
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,127
You know they aren't gonna
let her out to you?

182
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,134
You best send some of
her people up here to get her,

183
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,057
because they won't let her out to you.

184
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,346
- But, she's pregnant.
- Shut your mouth about that.

185
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,308
I'll throw your ass back in there
for that. You know better.

186
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,853
It's just not...

187
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,779
What's that?

188
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,449
You do know better, don't you?

189
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,578
Nah, maybe you don't.

190
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,419
Your daddy worked for a nigger, didn't he?

191
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,920
Running timber?

192
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,300
I'm sorry for you.

193
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,007
No, I really am.

194
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,763
All you over there in Central Point
don't know up from down.

195
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,431
All mixed up.

196
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,683
Part Cherokee,

197
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,143
Rappahannock,

198
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,021
part niggra, part white.

199
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,437
Blood don't know what it wants to be.

200
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,992
You just got born in
the wrong place, is all.

201
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,285
I see you got to thinking it was fine.

202
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,369
You might think people
around here wouldn't care.

203
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,167
Hell, maybe they wouldn't,
if your dumb country ass

204
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,047
hadn't gone off
and married her, but not me.

205
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,128
You hear me?

206
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,262
That's God's law.

207
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,145
He made a sparrow a sparrow
and a robin a robin.

208
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,439
They're different for a reason.

209
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,022
No.

210
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,152
No.

211
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,783
You go on now.

212
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,993
Get on home.

213
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,462
Send some of her people
up here on Monday to get her.

214
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,928
I see you trying to bail her out
again, I'll arrest you.

215
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,504
I should put you in with her tonight.

216
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,779
Your daddy posted your bail.

217
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,387
It's all right, Bean.

218
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,768
It's all right.

219
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,268
Where's Richard?

220
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,513
He moved his things out.

221
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,936
Said they'd arrest y'all again,
if they catch him here with you.

222
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,285
Now, come on. Come on here.

223
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,665
Come on.

224
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,637
Bean?

225
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,600
Hey. It's okay.

226
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,969
Oh, I got you.

227
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,691
You okay?

228
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,444
They hurt you?

229
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,024
No.

230
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,113
I'm just scared.

231
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,205
They said I couldn't see you.

232
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,744
I know.

233
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,503
What are we gonna do?

234
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,800
I got a lawyer.

235
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,471
They say he's the best in the county.

236
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,807
He gonna get it all straightened out.

237
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,555
- I don't know.
- It's fine.

238
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:34,067
All we gotta do is just keep
to ourselves for a while.

239
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,649
And this will blow over.

240
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,606
Yeah?

241
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,171
I better go.

242
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,016
Better go.

243
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,387
We'll walk over there in a minute.

244
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,971
But I met with the Judge this morning,

245
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,679
and I worked out a deal
I think is pretty fair.

246
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,810
Judge Bazile is a friend.

247
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,069
But he is not a fan
of your particular situation.

248
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,901
If you all plead guilty,

249
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,360
the Judge is willing
to suspend any prison time.

250
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,281
Hmm.

251
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,661
We'll do it.

252
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,082
Now, in exchange for suspending
the jail time, you and your wife,

253
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,924
unless you decide to
dissolve the marriage,

254
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,760
will be forced to leave the state.

255
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,470
Leave the state?

256
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,264
What does that mean?

257
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,974
It's exactly what it sounds like.

258
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,189
You two are not allowed to be
in the state at the same time,

259
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,363
and certainly, aren't allowed
to be here together.

260
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,450
For how long? How long will that last?

261
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,570
Twenty-five years.

262
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,580
That can't be right.

263
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,829
Look, you got a year
in state penitentiary,

264
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,710
which, I remind you, could have been
up to five years at the maximum,

265
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,460
you got a year in prison on one hand,
and leaving the state on the other.

266
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,138
That's an easy choice.

267
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,486
Try not to talk unless he directly
asks you a question, which he won't.

268
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,447
Just like we talked about,
he'll ask what you plead,

269
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,996
you say guilty, and this will be
over quick enough.

270
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,035
"...the said Richard Perry Loving,

271
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:42,248
"being a white person,
and the said Mildred Dolores Jeter,

272
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,087
"being a colored person,
did unlawfully and feloniously,

273
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,921
"go out of the state of Virginia,
for the purpose of being married

274
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,218
"in the District of Columbia,
on June 2nd, 1958,

275
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,598
"and afterwards returned to,

276
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,392
"and resided in the County of Caroline,

277
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:03,438
"State of Virginia,
cohabitating as man and wife,

278
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,488
"against the peace and dignity
of the Commonwealth."

279
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,862
How do you plead?

280
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,155
Guilty.

281
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,284
Guilty.

282
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,458
The court does accept the plea of guilty,

283
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:27,384
and fixed the punishment
of both accused at one year in jail.

284
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:34,675
The court does suspend said sentence
for the period of 25 years,

285
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,721
upon the provision that both the accused

286
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,395
leave Caroline County
and the State of Virginia at once.

287
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,808
And do not return together
at the same time

288
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,733
to said county and state
for a period of 25 years.

289
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,485
Do either of you have anything to say?

290
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,568
No, sir.

291
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,404
No, sir.

292
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,825
You are released from custody.
Settle your court costs with clerk.

293
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,418
Thank you, Your Honor.

294
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,043
It's 36 dollars

295
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,342
and 29 cents apiece.

296
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,271
That's a number in Washington
for Nancy's brother Alex.

297
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,610
His wife Laura's there most days.

298
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,282
If you need to get us, just call.

299
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:37,946
Okay.

300
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,082
Daddy?

301
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,129
You okay?

302
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,484
You knew what you
was doing taking her up there!

303
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,321
You had no right for that!

304
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,080
Bean?

305
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,704
How you all doing?

306
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,335
We're fine.

307
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,417
Thank you for taking us.

308
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,544
We've got plenty of room.

309
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,921
- You remember Richard?
- Yes.

310
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,968
Thank you.

311
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,470
No. Glad to have you.

312
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,223
Come on in. Let me show you the house.

313
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,115
Yeah, they live, like, what,
two blocks over there, right?

314
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,450
I know them.

315
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,410
Okay.

316
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,062
I'll be back by dinner.

317
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,926
If the vehicle goes aloft
at too step an angle,

318
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,557
its velocity is cut by 800 feet a second.

319
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,351
Working more directly
against gravity than planned.

320
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,939
Reaching over 23,000 miles an hour,
it carries to nearly 80,000 miles.

321
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,316
Thirty times as far as ever before...

322
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,568
Another moon shot is...

323
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,131
What can I do?

324
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,635
Nothing.

325
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,138
Bean.

326
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,101
It's just...

327
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,568
I always thought your mother
would be the woman to deliver the baby.

328
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,370
Damn it.

329
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,717
Okay.

330
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,515
Okay.

331
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,554
Hey, Momma.

332
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,605
Put some wood in the stove.

333
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,620
Thank you for doing this.

334
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,002
All right.

335
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,306
All right, String Bean, it's on you now.

336
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,898
- Yes, it is.
- Drink this.

337
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,658
Rich!

338
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,036
Rich!

339
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,969
Her water broke.

340
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,435
Okay. Take a breath. Take a breath.

341
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,565
Breathe.

342
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,778
Okay. Bear down.

343
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,564
Bear down hard.

344
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,962
Thank you, Momma.

345
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,764
You never should have married that girl.

346
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,188
Well, I thought you liked her.

347
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,106
I like a lot of people.

348
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,023
That doesn't mean you should have
gone and done what you did.

349
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,072
You knew better.

350
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,137
Sidney.

351
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,931
Hi, Sidney.

352
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,478
Sidney.

353
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,609
Call the lawyer.

354
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,726
Tell that woman to come out here.

355
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,066
She ain't here.

356
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,610
She left.

357
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,284
Boy, I will split your
head into white meat,

358
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,072
and go arrest every soul in that house.

359
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,665
I won't ask you again.

360
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,850
No.

361
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,343
You are in luck.

362
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,180
The Judge is in today.

363
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,304
You'll go straight there.

364
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:35,943
For violation of your parole,
you are ordered to post a $200 bond,

365
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,696
and appear before this court...

366
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:39,902
In the next...

367
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,748
Yes, Frank?

368
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,041
We ask for leniency.

369
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,211
I incorrectly told the Lovings
it was fine for them to return home

370
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,465
for the birth of their child.

371
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,970
It... It was my mistake.

372
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,311
Your Honor, I think...

373
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,528
Fine.

374
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,222
Thank you.

375
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,681
Don't come back here again.

376
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,559
You do and you go to prison.

377
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,524
This doesn't happen a second time.

378
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,031
Sidney, Donald, come on down.

379
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,950
Hey!

380
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,165
Okay.

381
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,043
Okay.

382
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,050
Come on in.

383
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,008
You go.

384
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,304
Hi, pretty girl.

385
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:56,436
Your cousin, Gerald and Davis, are fine,

386
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,396
and Sue and Terry send their love.

387
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,695
They just had a little girl, too.

388
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,818
- Really?
- Their second.

389
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,899
Hmm.

390
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,407
Sidney, don't jump in the house.

391
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,494
They're big.

392
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,289
Yes.

393
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,876
I hate it for them.

394
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,917
It's like they're caged.

395
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,223
Not even any grass for them to run in.

396
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,343
And Daddy?

397
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,227
He's fine. Stays up in that
chair more than in the field.

398
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,228
I told Momma if he don't start
getting some work done,

399
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,856
Mr. Banks liable to find
someone else for it.

400
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,651
Clay said he'd have to stay
with me until after the party.

401
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:17,388
- Good. How are you doing?
- Where is that piece?

402
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,307
How was your sister?

403
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,527
- I need one piece.
- She's fine.

404
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,240
- I almost have it.
- Yeah? You wanna show me?

405
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,368
The long awaited march
for jobs and freedom

406
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,450
on Washington D.C., has started

407
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,457
and it's about half of the
100, 000 estimated crowd

408
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:46,086
headed off down Constitution Avenue
toward the Lincoln Memorial

409
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,255
which is where we're seated now.

410
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,713
It is here that the climax of the march...

411
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:53,760
You boys stop that wrestling.

412
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,934
Come and help Miss Laura
with her groceries.

413
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,684
...coming in around the plaza
surrounding Lincoln Memorial.

414
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,058
They say over 100,000 people are there.

415
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:07,567
...is standing by along the parade
route at 17th and Constitution.

416
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,855
Can you imagine?

417
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,613
Might as well be half way
around the world.

418
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,070
What?

419
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,535
Nothing.

420
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,372
You know what you need to do?

421
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,578
What?

422
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,123
You need to write Bobby Kennedy.

423
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,712
I'm serious.

424
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,420
I mean, that's what they up there for.

425
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,717
All this talk of civil rights.

426
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,594
You need to get you some civil rights.

427
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,971
...engaged in demonstrations before.

428
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,891
In the background, you can hear
some of the young people shouting.

429
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,687
"Freedom, freedom now."

430
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,334
Mmm.

431
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,175
- They in bed?
- Mmm-hmm.

432
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,345
I'm sorry I missed them.

433
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,768
They ask for me?

434
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,145
Peggy did,

435
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,443
but she went down fine.

436
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,402
Will you get Saturday off?

437
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,365
I hope so.

438
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,593
Sidney, get up
and strip those sheets for me.

439
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,347
My turn, my turn, my turn! My turn.

440
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,182
Don, make sure your sister gets a turn.

441
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,264
My turn, my turn, my turn.

442
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,062
Byrd residence.

443
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,357
Hello, I'm calling to speak
to Mildred Loving.

444
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,946
This is she.

445
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,452
Hello, Mrs. Loving,
my name is Bernard Cohen,

446
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,330
I'm the lawyer that was referred
to you by the ACLU.

447
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,412
Are you familiar?

448
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,209
I'm sorry. No.

449
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,543
You wrote a letter to Attorney
General Kennedy, is that right?

450
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,757
Yes.

451
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,301
He was not able to help you
with your particular case,

452
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,134
and sent your letter
to the American Civil Liberties Union.

453
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,015
The ACLU contacted me,
I'm a lawyer in Virginia,

454
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,893
and we would like to
help you with your case.

455
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,313
I see.

456
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,818
- Momma! Momma!
- Don, baby, hush.

457
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,364
Would it be possible for you
and your husband to meet with me?

458
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,041
I would have to check with my husband.

459
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,498
Okay. I'm based in Alexandria,

460
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,457
but I have an office in D.C.
If that is a concern.

461
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,589
Well, as I said in my letter,
we really can't afford a lawyer.

462
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,673
No, ma'am.
The ACLU will take care of any fees.

463
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:11,231
Mrs. Loving? Are you there?

464
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,065
- Yes, we'll see you.
- Wonderful.

465
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,193
I'll have my secretary
call you back to set up a time.

466
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,275
Nice speaking with you, Mrs. Loving.

467
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:36,749
Come here, baby.

468
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,003
I got a call from a lawyer today.

469
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,216
- A lawyer?
- Mmm-hmm.

470
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,303
From the American Civil Liberties Union.

471
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,229
Robert Kennedy told him to call us.

472
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,190
Go help your sister brush her teeth.

473
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,694
They wanna help with our case.

474
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,191
Well, we can't afford a lawyer.

475
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,695
He said they wouldn't charge us.

476
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,867
I'm gonna go see him on Thursday.

477
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,199
His name is Cohen.

478
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,518
Hello.

479
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,395
I'm Bernard Cohen. I'm in from Richmond.

480
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,773
I talked to Jim about using
his office for a few hours.

481
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,105
Yes, Mr. Cohen, do you know it?

482
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,530
- Down the hall?
- Yes.

483
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,401
My clients are Mr. and Mrs. Loving.

484
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,822
Could you send them down when they arrive?

485
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,028
Certainly.

486
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,033
Come in.

487
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,995
- Mrs. Loving.
- Hello.

488
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,372
Please, have a seat.

489
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:41,047
Bernard Cohen. It's a pleasure.

490
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,761
Thank you for coming in today.

491
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:52,303
So, as we discussed on the phone,
the ACLU would like to take on your case.

492
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,306
I was actually a charter member
of the ACLU in Virginia,

493
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,309
which is why they assigned me to you.

494
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:01,109
The bottom line is,
we wanna get you all some relief.

495
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,234
That's very generous. Thank you.

496
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:10,069
Now, the first step is to appeal
the sentence in Caroline County.

497
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,988
That will be our fastest
route to Federal Court.

498
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,744
- The problem is...
- Federal Court?

499
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,953
Yes, the goal is to try to get
the Federal Court to hear the case...

500
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,834
Excuse me, I don't understand...
Federal Court.

501
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,586
I see it as the best route...

502
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,215
Can't you just go and
speak to Judge Bazile?

503
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,970
I mean, we ain't hurting anybody.

504
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,591
- I don't think that...
- Well, just talk to him.

505
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,142
Just talk to him.

506
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,978
Just tell him if he lets
us back in the state,

507
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,516
we won't bother anybody.

508
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,528
Look, I do not think that this case

509
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,906
will be resolved in Judge Bazile's court,

510
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:56,240
or probably any other court
in the state of Virginia.

511
01:07:56,322 --> 01:08:00,744
I believe this is a court battle that could
go all the way to the Supreme Court.

512
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,254
We're listening.

513
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:17,761
Our problem is that in order
to appeal the judgment of conviction,

514
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,433
we would have needed to
do so within 60 days.

515
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,937
Now, given that it's been five
years since that conviction,

516
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,856
we have to find a way
to get it back into the courts.

517
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,900
- Are you following?
- Mmm-hmm.

518
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,527
Mmm-hmm.

519
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,278
Now, I've given this some thought,

520
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,238
and I have a somewhat unorthodox
idea on how to do this.

521
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,662
My suggestion would be for the two
of you to return to Caroline County,

522
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:45,293
get re-arrested, and then we will
have an avenue for our appeal.

523
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,341
You want us to get arrested again?

524
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,630
Yes. It's an idea.

525
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,557
I, of course, will be
there to bail you out.

526
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,103
We aren't gonna do that.

527
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,020
Right...

528
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,115
I can see how that was a mistake.

529
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,034
I understand.

530
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:22,036
Look, I need to do some more
thinking on this first issue, but,

531
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,915
bottom line is we are gonna
get you all some help.

532
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,628
We appreciate you.

533
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,631
We really do.

534
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,763
Yeah.

535
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,639
If it gets us home, we'll take their help.

536
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:31,564
Well, you get what you pay for.

537
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,744
Get off the street!

538
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,686
Lee, give him a hand!

539
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,448
You gotta pull that concrete. Yeah.

540
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,529
Pull more.

541
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,201
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got it!

542
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,536
Hey!

543
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,338
Look out!

544
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,253
Donald!

545
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,387
Momma!

546
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,518
Momma!

547
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,362
- Mildred!
- Up here!

548
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,830
What's going on?

549
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,500
Donald got hit by a car today.

550
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:58,920
What?

551
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,422
He's fine.

552
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,509
Just scraped and bruised is all.

553
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:14,640
Hey.

554
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:16,767
You okay?

555
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,916
I wanna move 'em back to the country.

556
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,882
I don't care what they do to us.

557
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,514
I won't raise my family here.

558
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:05,381
All right. Y'all get loaded up now.
Come on.

559
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,672
Thank you, Al.

560
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:07,924
Thank you, Don.

561
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,177
Thank you, Miss Laura.

562
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:12,383
Hmm.

563
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,514
You just go on.

564
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,446
I'll see you tonight.

565
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,167
- You all be good.
- Okay, Daddy.

566
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:42,807
Hey.

567
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,666
Daddy!

568
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:29,274
My cousin has a house he might rent out.

569
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:32,065
But I thought Jim's brother
said it was fine here.

570
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:36,069
I don't trust them. Too many people.

571
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,739
Where is it?

572
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,416
King and Queen County.

573
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,577
Just a farmhouse up there.

574
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:47,372
I figure it gets you out the county,
but keeps you close.

575
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,123
You'll be on your own out there.

576
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,833
It don't have no phone or nothing,

577
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,510
but no one's gonna find you
unless they know to look.

578
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,218
I can get word to you when you need it.

579
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,891
How much you think he'd want for it?

580
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,056
Ah, he'll be fair.

581
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:00,824
Hey, look.

582
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,163
Peggy!

583
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,333
Hey.

584
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,465
I'll try and get home before dark.

585
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,546
Mmm-hmm.

586
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:03,465
We'll be fine.

587
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,154
"We haven't heard anything from you
for so long we had given up hope."

588
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:30,702
Martha, call Chet Antieau's office at
Georgetown Law and try to set a meeting.

589
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,127
Yes, Mr. Cohen.

590
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:36,794
Come in.

591
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,546
I'd never seen anything like it, you know.

592
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,839
Excuse me.

593
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,923
No matter how many times I get down south,
there's always something that surprises me.

594
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,597
Oh, yes. Please bring him back.

595
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:49,014
This is good timing.

596
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,058
I want you to meet
a former student of mine.

597
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,186
He called about a case
you may find interesting.

598
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,355
Yeah, sure. What's it about?

599
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:00,234
Well, we only spoke briefly
on the phone, but, in essence...

600
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,150
Ah...

601
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,779
Hello, Professor, thanks for seeing me.

602
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,736
My pleasure.
You've come at a good time, Bernie.

603
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,032
This is Phil Hirschkop.

604
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,955
He's a brilliant civil rights lawyer.

605
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:11,870
Nice to meet you.

606
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,042
So...

607
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,041
What's the problem?

608
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:16,834
Well, I'm a bit stumped.

609
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,002
The ACLU referred me to this case
concerning an interracial couple

610
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,803
that was married in D.C.

611
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,843
They were arrested for
living together in Virginia,

612
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,550
and the judge suspended their sentence

613
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,261
under order that they
leave the state for 25 years.

614
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:34,143
I filed a motion to vacate the
judgment with Judge Bazile,

615
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,062
the original trial judge
in Caroline County,

616
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,314
but he's stonewalling me.

617
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:43,566
Of course, the ACLU sees this,
and I agree, as a potential contender

618
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:46,448
to repeal the anti-miscegenation
laws nationwide.

619
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,580
I just need to get the
ball rolling, as it were.

620
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,747
It's a very delicate
situation because by appealing,

621
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,504
you open up the possibility of
sending them both to prison.

622
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,090
I think regardless, file the 1983
motion explaining your complaint.

623
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,594
It'll force Bazile's hand and get you
in front of a federal three-judge panel.

624
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,762
All right.

625
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,305
Look, I got to catch a plane
to New York tonight,

626
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,387
but I'll work up a draft
and I'll find you on Monday?

627
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,602
Great. That's just great. Thank you.

628
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,772
Yeah. And, Bernie,
if you don't mind me asking,

629
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,403
how much experience do you have
with constitutional law?

630
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:24,030
Some.

631
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,494
Very little.

632
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:34,162
You realize this case could alter
the constitution of the United States?

633
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:36,869
I do.

634
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,044
I'll call you on Monday.

635
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,214
One, two, three!

636
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,548
I'm a good dog!

637
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,642
I can never get mine to rise.

638
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:59,396
It's not you. It's the humidity.

639
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:01,902
Just thick.

640
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,812
Come look, Meme. Come look.

641
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,944
- Peggy.
- She's fine.

642
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,116
What you want from your Meme?

643
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,573
Lilly won't share her tea.

644
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,073
She must be upset.

645
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,743
Well, she wants to sit with us out here.

646
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,188
Momma, get Peggy inside!

647
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:41,604
Bean!

648
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,940
Hey. What is it?

649
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,367
Well, I got a message for you.

650
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:52,990
What?

651
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,789
Well, that lawyer called.
Said he wanna meet with y'all.

652
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,878
Sidney! Donald!

653
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:05,757
Raymond, why you
driving so fast like that?

654
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,630
What you mean? I always drive like that.

655
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:15,676
- What?
- Richard.

656
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,643
- What is it?
- It's okay.

657
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,104
"Almighty God created
the races white, black,

658
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:30,569
"yellow, Malay, and red, and he
placed them on separate continents.

659
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,902
"And but for the interference
with his arrangement

660
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:35,113
"there would be no cause
for such marriages.

661
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:37,868
"The fact that he separated the races

662
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:40,417
"shows that he did not intend
for the races to mix."

663
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:47,003
I know it sounds strange,
but this is really wonderful.

664
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,923
By issuing this ruling, Judge Bazile
has really given us a road map

665
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,676
right to the Supreme Court.

666
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,558
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

667
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,595
He ruled against us again.

668
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,727
That's right, but now we're allowed
to appeal that ruling to the state.

669
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:07,944
From there, if the state rules against you,
we'll have a chance at the Supreme Court.

670
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,908
That sounds wonderful.

671
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,278
I have one little piece of housekeeping.

672
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,952
LIFE magazine contacted us about
sending a photographer out to you all.

673
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:23,872
Keeping the possibility of
the Supreme Court in mind,

674
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:28,377
I think it's a fair idea that we
raise the profile of your case,

675
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,841
but I, of course, want to make sure
that you are all comfortable with that.

676
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:40,723
It'll be fine.

677
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,280
Hello!

678
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,589
Grey Villet, LIFE magazine. Pleasure.

679
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,918
What you got there, a small block?

680
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,007
Yeah. Yeah.

681
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,259
What's the trouble?

682
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,427
Carburetors.

683
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,508
Oh.

684
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,054
Then you're a better mechanic than me.

685
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,440
If you rejet them,
it goes faster, though, right?

686
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,567
I'm sure you already know that.

687
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,858
Is your wife inside?

688
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,271
Uh-huh.

689
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,330
Oh. Hello.

690
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:46,076
Grey Villet. LIFE magazine.

691
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:47,911
May I?

692
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:49,541
Of course. Come in.

693
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,420
Oh. Something smells good in there.

694
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:57,758
So, I can't go back without
a photo. No photo, no job.

695
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,717
And this is LIFE magazine and
the pigeon guy isn't around.

696
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,551
- Pigeon guy?
- Pigeon guy?

697
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:03,760
That's right.

698
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,393
Looking up at this office
building and it hits me.

699
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,601
Right. I go 55 stories up

700
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,979
and I talk some office girls
into letting me look out the window.

701
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,607
Before they could do anything,
I throw open the window,

702
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,403
sit on the ledge and dangle my feet out.

703
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:22,449
They start screaming,
but I got this great shot

704
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:25,533
of my feet flying over
42nd and 5th Avenue.

705
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,793
Yeah. So what happened?

706
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,913
Security threw me out head first.

707
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:33,878
But, LIFE magazine hired me the next day.

708
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,632
That's a story, all right.

709
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,802
Yeah, that's a story, all right.

710
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,471
You go to the Virginia
State Court next, right?

711
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:48,771
Yes.

712
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,066
You nervous?

713
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:54,064
I suppose.

714
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:55,357
Hmm.

715
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,485
The lawyers told us not to expect much.

716
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,192
You think you'll lose?

717
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,611
Well, yes.

718
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,951
But I think it's all right.

719
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:10,877
We may lose the small battles,
but win the big war.

720
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:27,764
- ...coleslaw.
- Yeah.

721
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,846
And here's the surprise.

722
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,019
Some of my new homemade pickles.

723
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,274
That certainly is a wonderful surprise.

724
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:41,069
Look at that, Barney, Aunt Bee's brought
us some of her homemade pickles.

725
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,243
I see. Sure is wonderful.

726
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,237
You really shouldn't have, Aunt Bee.

727
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,992
That's right, Aunt Bee.

728
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:50,576
You go to way yonder too
much trouble to please us.

729
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,787
It's no trouble at all.

730
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,088
There's plenty. I made eight quarts.

731
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,835
Eight quarts?

732
01:28:56,915 --> 01:29:00,169
Aunt Bee made eight quarts. Eight quarts.

733
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,424
You can have some every day.

734
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,386
Well, I had an awful big breakfast.

735
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,014
I just stuffed myself something fierce.

736
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,766
Have some pickles.

737
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:11,972
Here you are.

738
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,059
And here you are.

739
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,698
Mr. Loving. Mr. Loving.

740
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,576
They just wanna ask you a few questions.

741
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,289
Uh... All right.

742
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,875
Mrs. Loving, you rolling?

743
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,673
Mrs. Loving, the Virginia Supreme Court
just ruled against you.

744
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,006
How do you feel about
what happened here today?

745
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,391
Well, I feel hopeful.

746
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:50,219
I'm hopeful.

747
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,554
And where will you go now?

748
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,607
Well, I guess we'll go back to Washington.

749
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,814
You'll go back to Washington?

750
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:02,647
Mr. Loving, do you have anything to say
about what went on in the court today?

751
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,816
No. I don't have anything to say.

752
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,118
Okay. Thank you, folks, very much.

753
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:08,654
Did you get that?

754
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,990
- I think so.
- Okay, cut, Tommy.

755
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,830
Mr. and Mrs. Loving?

756
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,878
We wanted you to know that, with all
this travel back and forth from Virginia,

757
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,086
you have my number
and if anybody arrests you,

758
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,137
you have them get in touch with us.

759
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,261
We're not gonna let you spend
one minute longer in jail

760
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,185
than it takes us to get down
there to get you out, okay?

761
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,932
Okay.

762
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,684
Good luck to you.

763
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,936
You did a good job today.

764
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,896
Well, I sure appreciate
what y'all are doing.

765
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,102
Okay.

766
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:42,232
Well, we'll see you soon.

767
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,313
Bye.

768
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,238
Thank you, gentlemen.

769
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,284
You know they aren't
going back to Washington.

770
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,496
And there's no guarantee we can
get them out if they get arrested again.

771
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:57,998
Mmm-hmm.

772
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:30,855
Sidney!

773
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,029
Sidney!

774
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,412
I want you to go next
door to the neighbor.

775
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:40,410
You gonna ask him to use the telephone

776
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,369
and you gonna call Raymond
and ask him to bring his gun, okay?

777
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,670
Go. Go on now.
Run through the woods. Go on.

778
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:52,753
Everything okay?

779
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:55,338
It's fine.

780
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,007
Richard?

781
01:33:58,091 --> 01:33:59,308
Go on inside.

782
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,765
That truck may have
just been going fishing.

783
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,979
Could be.

784
01:34:46,723 --> 01:34:49,272
You ever hear from anyone
at your work about it?

785
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,606
Not to my face.

786
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:07,952
Well, I'll tell you this, Rich,
nobody gonna tell you what you can't do.

787
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:22,804
You're all set.

788
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:24,969
Thank you.

789
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,810
Who we gonna call, Momma?

790
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,849
I don't want you calling anybody.

791
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:32,393
How did that go?

792
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,153
Doctor said she'll be fine.

793
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:35,529
Just put her on aspirin.

794
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:37,774
Who was that?

795
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:39,735
Telephone man.

796
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,078
Richard had him install a phone.

797
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:44,538
Momma, you feel okay?

798
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:45,657
Yes.

799
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,787
- You got some tea I can drink?
- Mmm-hmm.

800
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:48,868
All right.

801
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:14,861
Testing, testing. Testing.

802
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,028
What do you think you would do if you...

803
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:21,360
If you lose the case?

804
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,030
Well...

805
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:30,543
If we lose, then we would have
to go back to Washington.

806
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:34,334
And how does that make you feel
having to go back to Washington?

807
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:36,007
Mildred?

808
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:41,504
Come here.

809
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:48,553
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

810
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,785
I don't want those people here.

811
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,078
I'm done with all these cameras!

812
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,535
Well, I think it's important.

813
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:13,077
These people want to help us, Richard.

814
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:42,235
Well, actually, although I'm sure
the publicity isn't very pleasant,

815
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:46,532
if it works out for you, it will work out
for a lot of other people, too.

816
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:48,112
Yes.

817
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:50,323
I hope so.

818
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:53,496
It's the principle.

819
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:55,544
It's the law. I don't think it's right.

820
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:01,509
And if... If we do win,
we will be helping a lot of people.

821
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:03,754
Mmm-hmm.

822
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:08,012
And I knew... I know we have some enemies,

823
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:09,809
but we have some friends, too.

824
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:15,355
So it really don't make a difference
about my enemies.

825
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:35,994
Push in hard on that one.

826
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,415
You go straight down the way, okay?

827
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,042
I got it. I got it. Don't worry about it.

828
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,248
- Hey. Good ride.
- All right.

829
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,003
Make sure you get it
into second as quick as you can.

830
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:43,335
- You got it.
- All right.

831
01:38:57,849 --> 01:38:59,312
Car looks good.

832
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:00,769
Yeah, it's running all right.

833
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:06,316
You see him driving today.

834
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,868
It was like he was sitting
in the back seat.

835
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:20,124
Oh, man. I miss you, Rich.

836
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:21,918
Hell, I can say it.

837
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,295
Hey, Percy, don't you miss Rich?

838
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:24,716
Yeah.

839
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:27,796
I miss you too, Virgil.

840
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:33,142
Man. So, what's all this you got going?

841
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:35,853
- All what?
- What you got.

842
01:39:36,262 --> 01:39:38,356
You just went made it hard now.

843
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:42,568
No, no. You think I'm crazy,
but you know what hard is now, don't you?

844
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,687
Yeah.

845
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,068
Richard, you are white.

846
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,869
Now, you may think you're like
a black man, but you're white.

847
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:53,991
You hang around all these black folks,

848
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:56,073
but when you go to work,
you're still white.

849
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:58,413
But not now.

850
01:39:59,285 --> 01:40:01,413
Now you know what it feels
like now, don't you?

851
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:05,421
You're black now, ain't you?

852
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,256
- You're a damn fool.
- All right, come on now.

853
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,467
No, he needs to hear it.

854
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:13,887
Look, every nigga in here
wish they were you, Rich,

855
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,018
and you ain't got sense enough for it.

856
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:18,850
You got a fix. I ain't got no fix.

857
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,477
So yours is easy.

858
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,025
All you gotta do is divorce her.

859
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,523
Divorce her?

860
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,355
All you gotta do.

861
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,488
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Really.

862
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:35,996
- I'm gonna divorce her.
- That it.

863
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:39,534
That's all you gotta do, right?

864
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:41,210
That's all you gotta do.

865
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,880
Apologize now, Virgil.

866
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:48,693
Come to bed, Richard.

867
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:53,282
We've been

868
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,953
talking to lawyers for

869
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:01,036
near 10 years now.

870
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:12,422
Let's go to bed.

871
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:19,350
I can take care of you.

872
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:24,393
I know that.

873
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,325
I can take care of you.

874
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:45,997
I know.

875
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:52,838
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

876
01:42:53,626 --> 01:42:54,627
It's okay.

877
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:55,980
It's very good.

878
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,909
Well, I have some really terrific news.

879
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:03,783
The Supreme Court has agreed
to hear our case.

880
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:08,201
Now, of course, the state
of Virginia will mount their defense,

881
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:10,915
but we are feeling very good
about our chances here.

882
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,623
You've got the full weight
of the ACLU behind this.

883
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:17,505
- It's a miracle.
- Hmm.

884
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:21,347
What's their defense?

885
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:23,845
I'm sorry?

886
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:25,351
Virginia.

887
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,685
How are they gonna defend
what they done to us?

888
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,142
I guess we won't know until the hearing,

889
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:35,564
but it's likely that they'll use

890
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:38,193
a defense similar to something
they've used before.

891
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,112
What's that?

892
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:49,204
It's your kids.

893
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:54,584
Our kids?

894
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,297
The state of Virginia
will argue that it is unfair

895
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:04,973
to bring children
of mixed race into the world.

896
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,559
They believe the children are bastards.

897
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,656
Now, as the defendants in this trial,

898
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:28,330
you are allowed to come
and hear the arguments.

899
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,003
No. We don't need to do that.

900
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:40,838
It's a tremendous honor to sit with
the Supreme Court. Very few people...

901
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,090
No.

902
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:46,598
That's fine.

903
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:49,890
Excuse me.

904
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:04,321
Mildred?

905
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,536
I wouldn't go without him.

906
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:40,353
You know, Richard, it's, of course,
up to you not to attend but,

907
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:46,701
you should know, the Supreme Court
only hears one out of every 400 cases.

908
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,531
It's historic.

909
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:56,998
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

910
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:01,715
Well. Is there anything
you'd like me to say to them?

911
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:07,464
And by "them" I mean the Supreme
Court justices of the United States?

912
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,060
Yeah.

913
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:23,483
You can tell the judge...

914
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,197
Tell the judge I love my wife.

915
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:12,904
You okay to park? Thanks, Martha.

916
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:22,329
Number 395.

917
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:28,336
Richard Perry Loving et al, Appellants,

918
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,297
v. Virginia.

919
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:40,059
Mr. Hirschkop.

920
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:53,907
Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices,
may it please the court?

921
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:03,245
You have before you today
what we consider the most odious

922
01:49:03,328 --> 01:49:05,918
of the segregation laws
and the slavery laws,

923
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:09,127
and our view of this law,
and we hope to clearly show,

924
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:12,713
is that this is a slavery law.

925
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:19,513
We ask that the Court consider
the full spectrum of these laws

926
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,891
and not just the criminality,

927
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:25,067
because it's more than criminality
that's at point here.

928
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,024
It's the right to inherit land,

929
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:31,440
the legitimacy of children,

930
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:33,985
and many, many rights.

931
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,912
Mr. Cohen.

932
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:48,381
Mr. Chief Justice,
may it please the court?

933
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:55,097
What is the danger to the state
of Virginia of interracial marriage?

934
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:06,229
What is the state of danger
to the people of interracial marriage?

935
01:50:09,812 --> 01:50:11,189
Marriage

936
01:50:12,523 --> 01:50:14,196
is a fundamental right.

937
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:30,851
Hello?

938
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:33,938
- Mrs. Loving?
- Yes.

939
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:35,610
It's Bernard Cohen.

940
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,942
Oh, hello, Mr. Cohen.

941
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:41,198
I'm calling with great news.

942
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:43,622
- Just wanted to let you know.
- What's that?

943
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:54,295
Yes, I'm here.

944
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:58,629
That's wonderful news.

945
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:03,759
Yes, I understand.

946
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:10,645
Okay.

947
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,437
Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

948
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,240
Mr. Loving? Mr. Loving?

949
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:10,785
Mr. Loving, how does it feel
to have the Supreme Court...

950
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,165
Have you heard from the Attorney General?

951
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,334
Mrs. Loving, what does
this mean to your family?

952
01:53:15,414 --> 01:53:17,132
Do you plan to return to Virginia?

953
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:19,759
Have you talked to the Attorney General?

954
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:23,931
Several Southern states have
already announced this ruling...

955
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:40,901
Take that to your daddy.

956
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:52,659
Oh.

957
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:55,754
- Wanna help me?
- Mmm-hmm.

958
01:53:57,497 --> 01:53:58,965
You wanna brush the wall?

958
01:53:59,305 --> 01:54:59,697

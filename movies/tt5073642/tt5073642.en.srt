00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,336
<i>West of Arkham...</i>

3
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:40,473
<i>...the hills rise wild...</i>

4
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,877
<i>...and there are valleys
with deep woods</i>

5
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>that no ax has ever cut.</i>

6
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,550
<i>There are dark, narrow glens</i>

7
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:55,488
<i>where the trees
slope fantastically...</i>

8
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:01,492
<i>...where thin brooklets trickle</i>

9
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:04,831
<i>without ever having caught
the glimpse of sunlight.</i>

10
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,611
<i>When I went into the hills
and vales</i>

11
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,748
<i>to survey
for the new reservoir,</i>

12
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,985
<i>they told me
the place was evil.</i>

13
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,724
<i>They told me this in Arkham,</i>

14
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:37,394
<i>and because
that is a very old town,</i>

15
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:40,131
<i>full of witch legends,</i>

16
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,599
<i>I thought the evil
must be something</i>

17
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,635
<i>which grandams
had whispered to children</i>

18
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:47,974
<i>through centuries.</i>

19
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:01,051
<i>Then I saw the dark
westward tangle of glens</i>

20
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,956
<i>and slopes for myself...</i>

21
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,561
<i>...and ceased
to wonder at anything</i>

22
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:16,032
<i>besides its own elder mystery.</i>

23
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:56,705
Before me, Raphael.

24
00:03:56,707 --> 00:04:00,444
Behind me, Gabriel.

25
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,149
To my left...

26
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:08,853
...Uriel.

27
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:14,790
And to my right, Michael.

28
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,693
I call upon
the principalities of earth,

29
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:22,764
air, fire, water, and ether.

30
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,833
Be present with me now.

31
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,770
Spirit of fire,

32
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:33,007
continue to burn out

33
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:36,144
any trace of cancer

34
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:42,118
from the body
of Theresa Gardner, my mother.

35
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:48,625
Grant me your protection.

36
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:56,965
Grant me my freedom.

37
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:01,869
And last, not least,

38
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,603
get me out of here.

39
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,674
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to intrude.

40
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,177
- I didn't see you.
- This is private property.

41
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:10,278
Oh, I was told
this is county land.

42
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,314
County land ends at the river.
You're trespassing.

43
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:16,984
Ah. They said the mayor notified
all the property owners.

44
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:20,654
- Uh, I apologize.
- First I've heard of it.

45
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:21,521
What now?

46
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:24,825
Sorry.
I'm, uh... I'm Ward Phillips.

47
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:27,663
I'm doing a survey of the valley
for Hydrolit.

48
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,033
The hydroelectric company.

49
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,102
Cool story.

50
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:39,208
Well, thanks for
ruining my ritual, Ward.

51
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,809
- Ritual?
- Yes, ritual.

52
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:46,013
You know, will, intent,
blessed be?

53
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:48,717
Is it Wiccan or Alexandrian?

54
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:51,719
Which do you think?

55
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,589
Definitely Alexandrian.

56
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,094
That's your
second mistake today.

57
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,929
Stick to the east bank
and you'll find your way back.

58
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,101
Yeah, I will.
Thanks.

59
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:08,836
Hey, uh,
I didn't get your name.

60
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:12,805
Lavinia Gardner.

61
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:17,111
I live out here.
Unfortunately.

62
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,122
- Let's go.
- Nice knowing you.

63
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,791
Come on, Comet.

64
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,306
Where were you?

65
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,808
Are you trying to give
your mother a heart attack?

66
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,910
I just thought I'd take Comet
around the trail before dinner.

67
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,278
It's not a big deal.

68
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,247
And I thought I told you
not to go without your helmet.

69
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,982
And where are your boots?
What happened to your boots?

70
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,284
Dad, Jesus, relax.
It's not like I'm trick riding.

71
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,853
Accidents happen, Lavinny.
Someday...

72
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,223
I'll have kids of my own,
and I'll understand.

73
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,225
Exactly right. See?
Communication. Me and you, babe.

74
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,026
Now get Comet back into the barn
before your mother finds out.

75
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,730
Lavinia.

76
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,766
Have you seen your brother?
He's been gone all afternoon.

77
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,969
He's supposed to be studying,
as are you.

78
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,737
How should I know?

79
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,373
He's probably listening
to NASA recordings with Ezra.

80
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:00,310
Do you mean to tell me that
your brother is smoking dope

81
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:03,714
with that hippie reprobate,
and you didn't do anything?

82
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,249
Lavinia?
You didn't do anything?

83
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,717
- Let it go, sweetie.
- No.

84
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,418
It's fine. She's fine.
Everything is fine.

85
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,977
Benny, I can smell
your stoned ass from here.

86
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,813
- Busted.
- You're so obvious.

87
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,249
Sam!

88
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,150
Benny's little
partner in crime.

89
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:42,885
Hey, I found some more
of Grandpa's old stuff.

90
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:44,454
- Oh, no way!
- Check this out.

91
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:45,755
Let me see.

92
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:47,457
Ooh! Heh.
Dibs.

93
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,991
- No fair!
- You already got his compass.

94
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,359
I need that compass.

95
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:54,766
Oh.
Did you manage to curse us all?

96
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,267
I don't do curses.

97
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,468
They come back on you
times three.

98
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,537
Now go put Comet's tack away
so we're on time for dinner,

99
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,173
and Mom doesn't bust
any more blood vessels.

100
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:06,377
- I'm not your barn bitch.
- Actually, you are.

101
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:11,180
Witch. Sorceress.
Soul-sucking succubus.

102
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:14,016
Hey, I met some weird guy
down by the river.

103
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,551
Said he was doing a survey.

104
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,453
A survey of what?

105
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,455
The water table
or something.

106
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:22,158
Not sure.

107
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,792
He's kind of cute, though.

108
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,028
Aw.

109
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:40,242
What are you looking at,
Jack-Jack?

110
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:42,043
Dad said
if you look long enough,

111
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:43,979
you can see stars
down there.

112
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,147
Hmm!
I wouldn't hold my breath.

113
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:49,251
Dad took too much acid
back in the hippie days.

114
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:52,354
But I do see stars!

115
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,089
Your eyes are playing tricks.

116
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,891
W-What are you
doing out here, anyway?

117
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:59,261
Dad sent me for water,
but I can't untie the rope.

118
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:00,462
Jesus.

119
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:04,468
Why can't they just buy bottled
water like everyone else?

120
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,538
Thanks for cooking again,
Dad.

121
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,040
Aw, you know I love cooking
for you guys.

122
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:14,376
Oh, by the smell

123
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,879
I can tell
it's really coming a long way.

124
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:21,915
- I miss Mom's pancakes.
- Okay.

125
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:25,185
So, uh, what is for dinner?

126
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:26,353
Cassoulet.

127
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,523
Oh, no.
Gross.

128
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,891
It's a traditional French dish.

129
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:32,126
In other words, peasant food.

130
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,228
Jack, can you take the
lid off the veggies, please?

131
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,297
- Yeah.
- I think it smells great.

132
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:37,531
That's because you're high.

133
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,233
Shut up. We all know
you'd rather be eating

134
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:40,301
fast food right now,
anyway.

135
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:41,869
I love mystery meat.

136
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:45,205
Well, this is not
mystery meat, dear.

137
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:49,043
It's a mélange of duck,
pork, regional spices,

138
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,078
and it just happens to be
your mother's favorite.

139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,113
Yeah!
I love ducks!

140
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,049
Everybody loves ducks.

141
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:57,518
We are down four pips,
but we didn't get oversold.

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,020
The market came up.

143
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:03,357
No, we don't want to
be selling just yet.

144
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,259
Uh, when I took
the short position,

145
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:07,661
I was assuming that we'd get
two-to-one on it.

146
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,463
Theresa!
Dinner's ready!

147
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:12,566
Look, we have
a nice ratio confluence.

148
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,601
It's getting cold!

149
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:17,136
Just take a look
at the ratio strategy I sent,

150
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:19,505
and I'll call you
in an hour?

151
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:21,107
Great.

152
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,378
I'm coming.

153
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,513
You're not gonna
have it? Really?

154
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:30,350
Babe, can you do something
about that router?

155
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:32,952
I'm gonna start
losing clients.

156
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:36,055
It's probably the dish.
I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

157
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,423
Oh, thank you.

158
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:38,524
Hmm.

159
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:40,660
Sam, lie down.

160
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,061
Good boy.

161
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,029
- What's this?
- Cassoulet.

162
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:47,933
Although apparently our daughter
would rather have fast food.

163
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:49,535
Uh, and just
what kind of meat

164
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:51,471
do you think you're eating
at the Golden Arches?

165
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:53,171
I know
it's mechanically retrieved,

166
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,973
but it tastes like heaven.

167
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:57,477
Then just wait until you try
the alpaca meat next year.

168
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,211
Then you'll know
what heaven is.

169
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:03,281
No, I'm gonna puke.
No one eats alpacas.

170
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:05,685
They use them
to make sweaters.

171
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:08,455
I don't know why you bought them
in the first place.

172
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:18,697
Because they're the animal
of the future, remember?

173
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,032
Those Mayans knew
what they were about.

174
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,268
- That's why they went extinct.
- Lavinia, stop it.

175
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,436
Come on, eat up.

176
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:26,238
Nathan, do you think
that you could

177
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,542
go down to the basement and
choose us one of your finest?

178
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:31,578
I know just the thing.

179
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:42,219
Next time I'll cook.

180
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,956
- It's not that bad.
- Yeah.

181
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,514
There's a smell of
a conspiracy here.

182
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:17,655
What's the matter?
Hmm?

183
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,290
Nothing.
It's just...

184
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,592
I just don't think
I can handle this.

185
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,161
- Like, it's been...
- She's being moody.

186
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,563
...a year of really...

187
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:26,630
Guess what time it is?

188
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:29,098
- I mean...
- No. Don't say it. Please.

189
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,535
Guess what time it is.

190
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:35,104
- Dad.
- Time for you to do the dishes!

191
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,173
- You! You! You!
- No! Jack! Jack!

192
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,142
- No, it's you, Jack.
- No!

193
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,578
It's you, Jack.
You got to do it.

194
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,779
Now it's Lavinia!

195
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,447
No, it's not my turn.
That's not how this works.

196
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,650
We have a system in this house.
It's Jack's turn.

197
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:54,657
- Hey.
- Hi.

198
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,393
God, you know,
I hear myself with her.

199
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:59,562
I am turning into my mother.

200
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,164
Oh, God.

201
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,266
You couldn't be any more
different than your mother.

202
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:04,434
Believe me.

203
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:07,303
That's what everyone says
until they are.

204
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,372
What about me?

205
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,474
Living on
my father's old farm,

206
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,377
exactly like I said
I never would.

207
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,211
But it's the first thing
you've ever done

208
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,547
he would have approved of.

209
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,685
Yeah, I can still hear his
intellectually abusive voice

210
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,521
in my head.

211
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,388
"You're never gonna be
a painter, Nathan.

212
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,625
So you can just get the fuck
out of my sight, Nathan."

213
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,827
Stop it.
It'll fade.

214
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,863
- Just look at this place, hmm?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:36,866
I mean, he wouldn't even
recognize it.

216
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,502
It's ours.

217
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,708
Nathan, I...

218
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,677
Just...

219
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,847
It's been six months.
Don't you think we should try?

220
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,582
I...

221
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,417
I just...

222
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,256
I don't know how you can
still be interested in me.

223
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,758
You know I've always been
a leg man.

224
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:09,433
So if I have my legs cut off,
would you still love me then?

225
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,735
Bit kinky, but...

226
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:16,137
Yes!

227
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,406
Could tuck you into
my carry-on luggage

228
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,408
and enjoy you
wherever I go.

229
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,877
Ooh!
Now, that <i>is</i> sexy.

230
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,446
Mmm.

231
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,682
And look at this.

232
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:30,418
Look at us.

233
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,421
All those years in the big city,
and we finally got out.

234
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:36,157
Yeah.

235
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,660
We're living the dream.

236
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:42,597
Maybe it is a dream.

237
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:48,269
Well, a dream you dream alone
is just a dream.

238
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:52,308
A dream you dream together
is reality.

239
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,763
You are even more beautiful
to me now than ever.

240
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:53,365
It's because you took
your glasses off.

241
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:54,770
It's true.

242
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,841
I feel, um...

243
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,575
...tarnished.

244
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:04,645
Honey...

245
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:10,384
...you will always be
my golden lady.

246
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:12,919
- Really?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,422
I love you.

248
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,380
Oh, hey, Sam.
Good boy.

249
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:44,382
Good boy, Sam.

250
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:46,985
Oh, you're not interested
in the black hole, Sam?

251
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,655
Hmm?

252
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,598
Mommy?

253
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,570
Oh, baby.

254
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,641
Oh, my God.
I've missed you.

255
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:38,437
Sam?

256
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,017
Mommy?

257
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:41,397
What?!

258
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,765
What the hell is that?!

259
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:45,634
- Jack?
- Jack?

260
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,170
Jack?

261
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,872
Jack.
Look at Daddy.

262
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,774
Jack.
Jack.

263
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,377
Come here. Come here.
Come on up. Come on.

264
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:56,645
- Look at Daddy.
- Mom?

265
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,013
Look at Daddy.
What are you looking there?

266
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,014
- Dad?
- I know.

267
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:00,916
What the fuck was that?
An earthquake?

268
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,918
Just watch your language.
Can you watch your language?

269
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:09,490
God, what is that smell?

270
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,627
Holy fucking shit!

271
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,063
Benny, bring your phone.
Come on! Come on!

272
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:15,663
Smoking like crazy.

273
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:17,199
No, don't go near it.
Don't go near it.

274
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:19,500
Sam, get back inside.
Get back inside.

275
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,803
- I said go inside.
- What the hell is that?

276
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:22,905
Just go inside!

277
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,206
Jesus.
What a mess.

278
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,909
It smells.

279
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,777
Nate!

280
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,048
There's something wrong
with Jack!

281
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,622
Ohh.
It's okay, baby.

282
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:41,890
You just had a bad dream.

283
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,658
No, I think...
I think he's in shock.

284
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,859
We should take him
to the hospital.

285
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,562
No, it's over an hour away.
Jack, can you talk to Daddy?

286
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:49,130
Why does it matter
how far away it is?

287
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,566
- Look at him!
- What the hell happened?

288
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:52,700
Did you guys hear it?

289
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,235
It sounded like a propeller
plane having an aneurysm.

290
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:56,838
No, it wasn't a plane.

291
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,743
That smell.

292
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:03,811
I don't know, like, funny.

293
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,646
You can still...

294
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,215
Still smell it now.

295
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,883
I thought it was
a nuclear strike.

296
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,484
The Russians and Chinese,
dude.

297
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,020
- End-of-the-world shit.
- You wish.

298
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,022
We'd be vaporized,
become part of the reaction,

299
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,522
and convert into pure energy.

300
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,758
Maybe the meteorite
sent an alien plague

301
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,726
infecting the entire
fucking planet.

302
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,697
Seriously apocalyptic.

303
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,866
- Mommy?
- Yes, baby, I'm right here!

304
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,001
- My head hurts.
- Okay, honey.

305
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,537
Look, um,
let's get you upstairs.

306
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,706
I'll put you to bed,
and you'll be okay.

307
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,675
- I don't want to!
- Mm!

308
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:36,810
No, it's okay, baby.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

309
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,880
Oh, your son is sick, and this
is what you're gonna do, huh?

310
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,116
Well, under the circumstances,
I don't see what else I...

311
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,018
Come on.
Let's get you up.

312
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,720
You can sleep with me tonight.

313
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,092
In the morning
everything is gonna be okay.

314
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,243
Mayor Tooma.

315
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,712
Sheriff Pierce.
Thank you for coming.

316
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,047
This better be
worth my time.

317
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:17,317
I am so sorry
about the smell.

318
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,719
Can you smell it?

319
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,220
I don't smell anything.

320
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,556
Like somebody
lit a dog on fire.

321
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:26,627
Well, anyway,
that <i>was</i> my front yard.

322
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,099
Careful.
It's still hot.

323
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,568
All right.
Thanks.

324
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:38,871
Something metallic
down here.

325
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,041
What the hell happened here?

326
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,675
Well, it was last night.

327
00:22:43,677 --> 00:22:45,211
I was in bed with my wife.

328
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:49,081
It was the first time that we,
you know, since the operation,

329
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,648
and then there was this boom,

330
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,118
like... like a...
like a sonic boom,

331
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,722
and a big flash,
like a pink light.

332
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:58,357
Or, actually, I don't even know
what color it was.

333
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,825
It wasn't like any color
I'd ever seen before,

334
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:04,162
and then everything just blew up
or fell from the sky.

335
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,738
What are you doing here?

336
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,341
Think this is the result
of your little ritual yesterday?

337
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:18,678
Ha!
If only.

338
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:23,848
Are you looking at my legs?

339
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,851
What? Oh. No. Um...
No, I was...

340
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:29,120
Yeah, sure you weren't.
Come on.

341
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,060
Who's this?

342
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:37,895
Oh, this is that
weird guy I met by the river.

343
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:39,264
Sorry,
what was your name again?

344
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:40,697
Ward Phillips.

345
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,200
Let me guess.
Boston.

346
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:44,302
Providence, actually.

347
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:45,903
He's doing a survey
of the groundwater.

348
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:47,738
Um, isn't... isn't that what
you said yesterday?

349
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,773
Yeah, yeah.
I'm a... I'm a hydrologist.

350
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:52,109
Ward, do you have any idea
what's going on here?

351
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,113
Oh, excuse me.

352
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,415
- Hey, Ward.
- Hey.

353
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,151
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm Benny.

354
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,087
D-Don't get too close.

355
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,190
Uh, looks like a meteorite.

356
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:08,659
Usually they disintegrate
before they hit the ground,

357
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:09,993
but not always.

358
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:12,663
A meteorite?
Whoa.

359
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:15,933
Sheriff, we need to get
some photographs.

360
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:18,302
Nathan, would you mind
if I bring some press next time?

361
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:19,702
This can be great for tourism.

362
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:21,138
I'd just as soon
not publicize it.

363
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,906
Mayor, wait.

364
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,975
Is there a doctor around here
who's open on weekends?

365
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:26,310
My son isn't feeling well...

366
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:28,312
You can try the hospital
in Arkham.

367
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:30,447
They usually have somebody
on the emergency desk.

368
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:33,383
- Isn't there anywhere closer?
- Welcome to life in the sticks.

369
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:34,984
You know, you should have
sold this place to me

370
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:36,453
while you had the chance.

371
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:37,922
Bye-bye.

372
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,993
Isn't it insane?

373
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,128
Check it out.

374
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,731
Hurry!

375
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,735
Lavinia, can you go back inside
and check on your mother?

376
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:53,503
Dad!

377
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:55,805
It's okay.
We got this covered.

378
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:56,808
Off you go.

379
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,712
- See you later.
- Yeah.

380
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:06,482
Why don't you
go check on her?

381
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:07,651
- Be careful.
- Okay.

382
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,254
It's cooling off
really fast now.

383
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,721
Is that normal?

384
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:17,293
Smoke coming out of it,
crazy color.

385
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:19,262
- It was so cool.
- Okay.

386
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:20,496
You ever seen anything
like this before?

387
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:21,432
Um...

388
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:27,470
Hey.
Who's that guy?

389
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,237
Who?

390
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:31,474
Um, Ward something.

391
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,808
- He's a hydrologist.
- Oh.

392
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,878
- You like him, huh?
- What? No.

393
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,113
Why would you say that?

394
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,081
Oh, well, come on.
It was obvious.

395
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,884
You were practically
throwing yourself at him.

396
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:44,419
- I mean, honey...
- Mom.

397
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,921
Think... Look at the way
you're dressed.

398
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:48,223
Think of the signals
you're giving out.

399
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:49,224
Oh, God.

400
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:52,260
Do you think it's radioactive
like kryptonite?

401
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:54,429
Christ, I hope not.

402
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:56,198
Well, what about, like,
an alien virus?

403
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,532
I mean, it's from space,
right?

404
00:25:57,534 --> 00:25:59,467
Meteorites are generally
no more dangerous

405
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:02,003
than ordinary rocks.

406
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:04,339
Well, do you think
it could be valuable?

407
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,809
Now, that's something
I hadn't considered.

408
00:26:07,877 --> 00:26:11,047
Well, if you don't mind,
it's time we milked the alpacas.

409
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:17,251
Milk the what?

410
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:22,424
It's not like
milking a goat.

411
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,892
You don't get a lot of milk
from an alpaca.

412
00:26:24,894 --> 00:26:28,996
It takes great patience
and technique.

413
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:33,803
And, of course, you have to be
very gentle with the, uh, boobs.

414
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,538
But once you get them
warmed up...

415
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,274
Oh.
Nice one, dad.

416
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:44,945
Yeah, I find mixing
a little fennel into their feed

417
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:49,452
increases the yield
and improves the flavor.

418
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:52,119
- Would you like a taste?
- Oh, no.

419
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:54,457
Um, lactose intolerant.

420
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:58,394
Your loss.

421
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,163
Sweetie?

422
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,904
Can you open the door, please?

423
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:14,407
I'm so sorry.

424
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:18,413
I-I don't... I don't know
what came over me.

425
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:25,451
Lavinia, come on.
Please open the door.

426
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:29,322
Uh, is there anyone else
living on the property,

427
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,126
aside from your family?

428
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:35,561
There's Ezra, our squatter,
but he keeps to himself.

429
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:37,196
I haven't seen him in months.

430
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,531
Would it be okay
if I talk with him?

431
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,966
You can try. I mean,
Benny can show you the way.

432
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:42,201
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure.

433
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,804
But I can't promise
he's gonna talk to you.

434
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:50,376
He's, um, special.

435
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,487
Looks like
there's a storm coming in.

436
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:02,890
Yeah.

437
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,491
Are those cameras?

438
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:09,294
Yeah. Ezra used to be
an electrician back in the day.

439
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,462
He's got this whole place
wired up.

440
00:28:10,464 --> 00:28:12,397
Oh.

441
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,299
Where's his juice come from?

442
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:17,102
Solar.
Totally off the grid.

443
00:28:17,104 --> 00:28:19,104
Hey!
Ezra!

444
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:20,841
You got a visitor!

445
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,447
Oh!
It's the surveyor man!

446
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,947
I'm sorry.
I don't think we've met yet.

447
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:31,483
- I'm, uh...
- The hydrologist.

448
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:34,018
Yeah.

449
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,554
Pretty well informed.

450
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:39,524
Lot of little birdies flitting
around here in this ecosphere.

451
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:41,660
You just got to know
how to decode them.

452
00:28:41,662 --> 00:28:43,260
Come on in.

453
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,198
We'll talk about
the space metal.

454
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,669
- Want a hit?
- Oh, no, thank you.

455
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,970
I didn't think so.

456
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:54,438
Hey, some java?

457
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,539
- Yeah.
- All right.

458
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:59,510
Aw.
What's her name?

459
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:02,012
- G-spot.
- What?

460
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:04,615
What? Come on. That's
like the coolest name ever.

461
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,119
A pussy named G-spot?
It's totally hilarious.

462
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,288
Hey.
Come here, lady.

463
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,289
Hi.

464
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,624
All right.

465
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,694
Oh, yeah, you like this?
You like that?

466
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:19,230
Hey, my apologies
for the Adam's ale.

467
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,366
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

468
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:25,371
Yeah, the H2O has gone
a little brackish.

469
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:32,142
Yeah, I can't...
I can't smell anything.

470
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:34,077
It's probably just rust
from the taps.

471
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,580
Have you tried running the
faucet, see if it runs clear?

472
00:29:36,582 --> 00:29:40,049
Hey, that, my friend, is
straight from the mother's tit.

473
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,052
Yeah, we've had some
problems with the well before

474
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:44,254
but only in the summer.

475
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:45,522
Something about the aquifer.

476
00:29:45,524 --> 00:29:47,691
Right.
Yeah.

477
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:50,326
That's to do with the level
of the water table, but...

478
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,197
I don't know. Shouldn't be
happening this time of year.

479
00:29:54,332 --> 00:29:55,765
Freshest water
in the department.

480
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,768
That's what Dad always says.

481
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,836
I'm sure it's fine,

482
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,338
but if you want
I could run a test on a sample.

483
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,240
I have all my equipment
back up in the tent.

484
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:06,709
So, you know,
better safe than sorry.

485
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:09,011
Hey, knock yourself out.

486
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,352
All right!

487
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:18,086
Damn, that was close.

488
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:20,525
Tell it, baby.
Tell it, tell it!

489
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,969
It's so beautiful.

490
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,976
Lavinny, what are you doing?

491
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:43,314
Come on.
Let's go back inside.

492
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:53,591
It's drawing the lightning.

493
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:27,154
<i>In my next term

498
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,418
Hello?

499
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:01,824
Hello?

500
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:05,795
Who is that?

501
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:05,887
What the hell?

502
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:32,003
How can something that big
just disappear?

503
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:34,774
I don't know, but I'm glad.

504
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,280
Did you plant those?

505
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:46,618
No.
Maybe they're perennials.

506
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:54,226
Great.
Here comes the circus.

507
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,569
Baby.

508
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,942
<i>Could you please tell us
exactly what happened?</i>

509
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,309
<i>Well, there was a boom.</i>

510
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,745
<i>Uh, it was a couple nights ago.</i>

511
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:16,747
<i>A boom and a flash of light
and a vibration,</i>

512

<i>and we came out,
and we saw this large rock.</i>

513
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,720
Horrible. Hideous.
Oh, my God.

514
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,889
Couldn't somebody have given me
a comb? Jesus!

515
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,690
<i>I'm here with Arkham resident

517
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,827
<i>landed in his front yard

518
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,328
"UFO witness"?

519
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,530
You said UFO!
I didn't say UFO!

520
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,431
Oh, for fuck's sake.

521
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,302
Theresa, can you
get out here, please?

522
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,874
Did you see a UFO?
I didn't see any UFO.

523
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,980
<i>Right, and, uh...</i>

524
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,815
<i>We had

525

<i>not a geologist...</i>

526
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,085
Yeah, I think
the freaked-out-abductee look

527
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:56,919
suits you pretty well.

528
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:57,953
<i>Very good.</i>

529
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,088

<i>before the time
my team and I got here.</i>

532

<i>How does an object

533
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,996
Theresa, can you please
get out here?

534

536
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,969
<i>Uh, well, I mean,
I like a bit of bourbon.</i>

537
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,071
<i>Um, uh,
it comes out of Texas.</i>

538
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,473

543
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:28,950
Okay.

544
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:32,987
What part of "meteorite"
do you not understand?

545
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,634
Mom.

546

I don't know.
You're the man of the house.

562
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:37,050
Come on, Jack-Jack.
Time for bed.

563
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:40,921
Benny will look after us

564
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,024

Fuck.
What?

570
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:16,781
You were supposed
to feed the alpacas.

571
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,616
I already did.

572
00:39:18,618 --> 00:39:20,687
What are you talking about?
They're standing right there.

573
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,056
I already fed them.

- Well...
- What the...?

575
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:29,626
Get them into the barn, okay?

576
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:32,696
And lay off the weed,
all right?

577
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:34,598

I don't think
you should be drinking that.

630
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:42,536

00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:17,169
shuffling around, chattering.

641
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:20,207
See, I knew no one would believe
me unless I got it on Memorex.

642
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:31,385
What exactly am I supposed to be
listening to?

643
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,721
The people under the floor,
dude.

644
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,123
The aliens.

645
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:40,759
They're there.

646
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:44,195
Well, yeah, it is strange.

647
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:46,732
But it's probably
geothermal activity

648
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,499
- or magnetic distortions.
- No, no.

649
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:49,667
Something like that.

650
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:51,235
They came on the rock.

651
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:55,908
Look, no offense, Ezra,
but that's pretty out there.

652
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,176
You don't get it, do you?

653
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:01,548
It's not out there.
It's in here.

654
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:04,682
It's in the static.
It's in the moisture.

655
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,884
Up is down.
Fast is slow.

656
00:50:06,886 --> 00:50:09,854
What's in here is out there,

657
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:12,256
and what's out there
is in here now.

658
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:13,727
Comprendo?

659
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:18,596
Um, look,

660
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,798
why don't you think about
getting out of here for a while?

661
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,299
I'm gonna be back tomorrow.

662
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:23,701
I'll have some more equipment
with me.

663
00:50:23,703 --> 00:50:26,336
I'm sure it will all make
more sense in the morning.

664
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:28,305
Morning?

665
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:29,876
Dude, it's already morning.

666
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,480
All right. Um, stick to
bottled water, okay?

667
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:43,288
Oh, hey, I will let you know
if I see G-spot.

668
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:47,259
You might see her, but I don't
think you'll recognize her.

669
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:57,501
Nathan.

670
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:02,906
Doing okay?
We're almost there.

671
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:05,375
Yeah.
I just feel so stupid.

672
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:07,780
I mean, I just don't even know
what I was thinking.

673
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:14,417
And I don't even want to
think about

674
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:19,288
how many clients I pissed off
by not getting back to them.

675
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,658
- Mm.
- The surgery was successful.

676
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,959
That's the important thing.

677
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:24,660
Look out!
Aah!

678
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:32,535
- Christ, that was close.
- What... What...

679
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:34,603
Did you see that thing?
What was that thing?

680
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:37,506
- Did you see its eyes?
- Oh, my God.

681
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,709
What are you doing?

682
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:42,778
I-I want to call the kids,
just check that they're okay.

683
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,280
Honey, the kids are fine.

684
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:47,668
What are you doing
in my room?

685
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,403
- Where have you been?
- I was out in the back field.

686
00:53:50,405 --> 00:53:54,942
I thought I heard Sam.
I was worried about him.

687
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,676
Look, I know it sounds weird,

688
00:53:56,678 --> 00:53:59,579
but I kind of got lost
out there.

689
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,148
You know, like,
one second it was daytime,

690
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,716
then all of a sudden
it was so dark

691
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:05,052
I couldn't even
find the house.

692
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:12,091
What the hell is going on?

693
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:14,660
It's probably Dad.

694
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:16,562
At least I hope it's Dad.

695
00:54:23,104 --> 00:54:25,838
Dad?

696
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:31,746
Who was that?

697
00:54:33,715 --> 00:54:34,814
I'm not sure.

698
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:37,952
Christ, now what?

699
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:41,122
Wait, where's Jack?

700
00:54:57,471 --> 00:54:59,471
Baby, what are you doing
out here all by yourself?

701
00:54:59,473 --> 00:55:01,506
Mommy!

702
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:03,575
- Jack.
- Jack!

703
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:05,644
Oh, my God.

704
00:55:05,646 --> 00:55:08,046
What is wrong
with you two?

705
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:09,848
Why is your brother out here
by himself?

706
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,017
- No, it didn't happen that way.
- What is this?

707
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:13,919
While the cat's away,
the mice will play?

708
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,487
Isn't that right?

709
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:16,988
I'm seriously disappointed
in both of you.

710
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,691
No, there was this sound,
and I got sick,

711
00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:22,193
and then you called
and yelled at me.

712
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:25,063
Honey, what are you
talking about?

713
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:27,631
We couldn't even get through,
and believe me, we tried.

714
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,566
She's telling the truth, Dad.
Something weird is going on.

715
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:32,103
I don't want to hear
your excuses either, Benny.

716
00:55:32,105 --> 00:55:33,671
I'm gonna take him upstairs.

717
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:36,707
I'll leave you
to deal with these two.

718
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,542
Holy shit.

719
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,145
Holy shit.

720
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:42,613
They should have been put back
in the barn hours ago.

721
00:55:42,615 --> 00:55:44,014
You haven't even fed them yet,
have you?

722
00:55:44,016 --> 00:55:46,917
- Dad, I tried, but...
- What do you mean, you tried?

723
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:50,288
Do you have any idea
how much those animals cost us?

724
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,690
They are alpacas!

725
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:54,026
Alpacas.

726
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:56,195
Dad...

727
00:56:04,203 --> 00:56:06,772
I mean, should we, like,
try to warn him.

728
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:12,644
Warn him about what?

729
00:56:19,218 --> 00:56:20,616
Sam?

730
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:23,753
Come on.
Come on.

731
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,158
Sam?
Here, boy.

732
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,562
Stupid goddamn dog.

733
00:56:32,564 --> 00:56:34,731
You too, huh?

734
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:37,301
You know,
if I could just get

735
00:56:37,303 --> 00:56:40,203
a little consideration
around here,

736
00:56:40,205 --> 00:56:41,838
just a little support,

737
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,010
it would be
greatly fucking appreciated.

738
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,654
Dad's acting weird, right?

739
00:56:58,656 --> 00:56:59,924
You noticed?

740
00:57:05,997 --> 00:57:06,865
Where's Sam?

741
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,866
T-They must have got him.

742
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:12,335
They?

743
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:14,973
Uh, what the fuck
are you talking about?

744
00:57:16,107 --> 00:57:17,873
They, them, it.

745
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,941
That thing that has been
fucking this place up.

746
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:20,842
I mean, come on, Dad.

747
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:22,311
Don't pretend that
you haven't noticed.

748
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:25,248
Nothing has been
fucking this place up.

749
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,749
Why are you so in denial?

750
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:31,720
Okay, you know, I've had it
with your drama, Lavinia,

751
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:34,923
so do me a favor and get
the fuck out of my sight, okay?

752
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:37,893
No, no, actually,
I'll save you the trouble

753
00:57:37,895 --> 00:57:40,164
and get the fuck
out of yours!

754
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,035
Look, he doesn't mean it.

755
00:57:48,638 --> 00:57:52,908
Do you still have
that girlfriend in Aylesbury?

756
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:54,309
Well, she wasn't
my girlfriend,

757
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:56,744
and I haven't seen her
in months.

758
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:58,880
Why?

759
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:04,088
Because we need to get
the hell out of here.

760
00:58:05,955 --> 00:58:07,055
Look.

761
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:09,657
Make him really scary.

762
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:10,593
Oh, yes.

763
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:14,728
What?

764
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,730
Uh, are you okay?

765
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:18,866
No, I just blew up
at Lavinia.

766
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:21,669
I don't think I'll be winning
any "father of the year" awards.

767
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:24,575
Oh, she's that age.
She's just impossible.

768
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:11,117
Aah!

769
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,353
Aah!

770
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:18,725
Aah!

771
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,994
No, baby.
No more.

772
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:23,263
We need to call a plumber
or an exterminator.

773
00:59:23,265 --> 00:59:26,266
Drains got shit
growing in them.

774
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:28,168
So many crumbs on the bed.

775
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:30,470
Do you think
Sam is with Grandpa?

776
00:59:30,472 --> 00:59:33,873
No, baby, Grandpa is in heaven,
and Sam just,

777
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,209
I don't know, he found a friend
or went for a walk.

778
00:59:36,211 --> 00:59:38,844
But he was scared.
He was growling.

779
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,913
I could see all of his teeth
like this.

780
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:45,817
- Don't do that face.
- Oh, God. What is that smell?

781
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:49,154
What smell?
We washed everything.

782
00:59:49,156 --> 00:59:52,090
What is it, like...
like damp or drains?

783
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,459
No, I-I've been smelling it

784
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:57,896
ever since the night
that thing hit the farm.

785
00:59:57,898 --> 01:00:01,099
Maybe it's, like, the black mold
in the basement coming up.

786
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,935
It's exactly the same smell

787
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:04,537
as the cancer ward
where my father was.

788
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,505
You know, death, disinfectant.

789
01:00:06,507 --> 01:00:08,507
The cancer smell. Rotting milk.
You know the smell.

790
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:10,108
You know the cancer smell
better than anybody.

791
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,211
And now the dog has vanished
off the face of the Earth,

792
01:00:12,213 --> 01:00:13,011
so connect those dots.

793
01:00:13,013 --> 01:00:14,813
I told you
Sam was with Grandpa!

794
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:17,082
No, he's not.
Oh, my God, I just...

795
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:18,817
Ugh!
Stop saying that!

796
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:21,153
No, no, no, Jack, Jack,
Sam is fine.

797
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:22,054
Is he really?

798
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:23,788
Honey, would you please
take it easy?

799
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,357
It's a miracle the hospital
even let you go home.

800
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,526
I just have to get online.
All right?

801
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:29,927
I have so much work
I have to do.

802
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:31,963
- Daddy?
- Yeah, I'll take care of...

803
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:33,133
Everything's gonna be A-OK.

804
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,009
Everything's gonna be A-OK.

805
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:57,388
<i>Be careful not to
overwater all the plants.</i>

806
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,524
<i>Mount the spray to remind
you... it's easy to forget...</i>

807
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:06,430
<i>so try setting a timer to make
sure overwatering never occurs.</i>

808
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:10,468
<i>Even, steady watering is
every master gardener's secret</i>

809
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:12,303
<i>and the key to harvesting</i>

810
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:15,406
<i>those plump, juicy,
flavorful tomatoes</i>

811
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:16,973
<i>that last
throughout the season.</i>

812
01:01:16,975 --> 01:01:22,346
Just look at you beauties.
And a month early.

813
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:25,349
<i>...makes for
a perfect arrangement.</i>

814
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:32,856
Peaches!

815
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:33,825
Heh.

816
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:46,336
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

817
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:49,406
You do that very well,
Theresa Peach.

818
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:53,076
If we went to 143-9
and kept it under the 10 handle,

819
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:54,944
that could actually...

820
01:01:54,946 --> 01:01:57,580
What?
Not dollars.

821
01:01:57,582 --> 01:02:01,651
Euros?
Christ, uh, um...

822
01:02:01,653 --> 01:02:06,423
Then there should be
at least a two-pip spread.

823
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:09,659
What? What?

824
01:02:09,661 --> 01:02:11,528
Can you hear me?

825
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,662
Hello?

826
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:15,966
Fuck!

827
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:21,638
You have got to do something
about that dish.

828
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,239
I am literally
hemorrhaging clients.

829
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,609
It should be working, sweetie.
I just checked it this morning.

830
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:29,912
No, it's garbling the fuck
out of everything I say.

831
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:32,548
Nate?

832
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:38,587
Nate, are you
listening to me?

833
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:41,190
You know, I did everything
I was supposed to do!

834
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:43,392
I followed every fucking rule
in the book,

835
01:02:43,394 --> 01:02:46,995
and they still fucking taste
like shit, so you know what?!

836
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,664
Fuck that.

837
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:51,133
Okay!
Coming up!

838
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,469
Okay, stop it!
Stop.

839
01:02:53,471 --> 01:02:55,002
Slam dunk!

840
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:58,242
You know what?! Just do
something about that dish.

841
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:00,975
All right.
Do you know what?

842
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,312
I'm gonna go and lie down.

843
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:08,417
But just fix that dish,
okay?!

844
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,153
Yeah, I think
it's a good idea, sweetie.

845
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,105
I should have grown barley.

846
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,109
Ain't that right, Dad?

847
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:39,147
<i>That is why,
in my next term as your mayor,</i>

848
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:43,351
<i>we will be undertaking the
largest infrastructure project</i>

849
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:45,720
<i>in our city's history
with the construction</i>

850
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:48,456
<i>of a freshwater reservoir
on the Miska...</i>

851
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,491
<i>Well, Katie,
you also have people</i>

852
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,593
<i>with different views on this.</i>

853
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,228
<i>You have scientists
who very much dispute it.</i>

854
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:59,332
<i>So is there climate change?</i>

855
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:01,669
<i>Will it go back?
Will it change back?</i>

856
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,607
<i>Probably.
I believe so.</i>

857
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:09,610
<i>Mankind...
I mean men and women...</i>

858
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:44,437
Dad?

859
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:28,145
- Whoa.
- Mm.

860
01:06:28,147 --> 01:06:29,749
Pretty beautiful, huh, buddy?

861
01:06:50,502 --> 01:06:52,204
Help me.

862
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,375
Protect me.

863
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:14,625
Get me out of here.

864
01:07:37,815 --> 01:07:39,417
Jack?

865
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:44,420
Jack?

866
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,277
Jack?

867
01:08:10,648 --> 01:08:12,182
Jack?

868
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,214
What's happening to them?

869
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:50,520
Uh, I-I don't know.

870
01:09:14,677 --> 01:09:17,313
Go. Go. Go!

871
01:09:19,682 --> 01:09:21,917
- Go!
- Oh, my God!

872
01:09:27,089 --> 01:09:28,758
Mom!

873
01:09:41,402 --> 01:09:42,638
Benny?

874
01:09:44,774 --> 01:09:46,307
Benny.

875
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,386
Oh, my God.

876
01:10:08,763 --> 01:10:11,063
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

877
01:10:11,065 --> 01:10:12,700
Oh, my God.

878
01:10:14,636 --> 01:10:15,668
Let's...

879
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:19,307
...take them in the house.

880
01:10:21,543 --> 01:10:23,676
Benny, call 911.
Call an ambulance.

881
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:24,911
Okay.

882
01:10:24,913 --> 01:10:27,547
Come on, hurry up.
Get the operator.

883
01:10:30,652 --> 01:10:33,119
It's not working.
I can't get a dial tone.

884
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:34,821
What do you mean,
you can't get a dial tone?

885
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:36,557
Just give it to me.

886
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:40,827
All this static.

887
01:10:40,829 --> 01:10:41,994
- Fuck!
- There's nothing there.

888
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:44,163
- I can't get a dial tone.
- How hard can it be to dial 911?

889
01:10:44,165 --> 01:10:45,998
Yeah, I told you.
There's no one there!

890
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,102
- What are we gonna do?
- What are these sounds?

891
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,704
Fuck!

892
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,073
- Lavinny.
- Vinny.

893
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:56,675
Lavinia, what did you do
to yourself?

894
01:10:56,677 --> 01:10:58,612
Lavinny.

895
01:11:23,203 --> 01:11:26,838
You cocksucker.
You fucking cocksucker!

896
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,107
You cocksucker!
You cocksucker!

897
01:11:29,109 --> 01:11:31,843
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

898
01:11:31,845 --> 01:11:34,545
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

899
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:37,581
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

900
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:41,621
Aah! Aah! Aah!

901
01:12:26,265 --> 01:12:28,667
Looks like she's absorbing him.

902
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:34,539
Trying to reassimilate him
into her body.

903
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:38,643
Don't say that.

904
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:43,181
Shh, it's okay.

905
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:54,125
I'm here, Mom.

906
01:12:56,828 --> 01:12:58,928
I'm right here.

907
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,731
I mean, how can any of this
even be possible?

908
01:13:01,733 --> 01:13:03,833
That thing from
the meteorite happened to them.

909
01:13:03,835 --> 01:13:05,103
It changes
everything around it.

910
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:09,107
Not just matter.

911
01:13:10,774 --> 01:13:13,142
Time as well.

912
01:13:13,144 --> 01:13:15,911
Time,
it stretches around it,

913
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:18,214
like when you're approaching
a black hole, right?

914
01:13:18,216 --> 01:13:20,116
I mean... I mean, how long
have we been sitting here?

915
01:13:20,118 --> 01:13:22,553
How long has it been since Dad
went out to the car?

916
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,293
God, I think she's trying
to talk to us.

917
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:35,030
What was that, Mom?

918
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:38,200
No, this is useless.

919
01:13:38,202 --> 01:13:39,568
- We've got to get help.
- No, wait.

920
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,671
We're gonna die
in this fucking place.

921
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:47,809
The, uh,

922
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:52,116
car is not happening.

923
01:13:54,118 --> 01:13:56,218
What do you mean,
the car is not happening?

924
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,452
What does that mean?

925
01:13:57,454 --> 01:14:00,855
Something sucked the charge
out of the battery overnight.

926
01:14:00,857 --> 01:14:01,922
Probably the same thing

927
01:14:01,924 --> 01:14:05,060
that's screwing with the cells
and the computers.

928
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:09,097
It's like
an electromagnetic field.

929
01:14:09,099 --> 01:14:11,667
And you believe me now?

930
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:16,037
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

931
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:24,680
Why do they keep making
that sound?!

932
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,956
I don't think they like
the sunlight, Dad.

933
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:38,793
- I think it's hurting them.
- We've got to do something.

934
01:14:38,795 --> 01:14:40,997
Help me get them
up the stairs.

935
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:53,340
Easy does it.

936
01:14:53,342 --> 01:14:54,774
You got her?
You got her?

937
01:14:54,776 --> 01:14:55,844
Yeah.

938
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:10,424
Lavinia,
put the mattress down.

939
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:24,904
Mom.

940
01:15:37,885 --> 01:15:40,686
Uh, we're here, Mom.

941
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,090
It's gonna be okay.

942
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:47,893
Daddy...

943
01:15:59,407 --> 01:16:01,306
You want me to get you
some water?

944
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:14,054
Something's happening
to the alpacas.

945
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:26,999
You two stay here with Jack
and your mother.

946
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:29,069
Everything's under control.

947
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:40,013
Dad?

948
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:46,751
You son of a bitch.

949
01:16:46,753 --> 01:16:49,086
You're gonna
leave my family alone now.

950
01:16:49,088 --> 01:16:52,323
You're gonna
leave my family alone.

951
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:54,158
Haven't we been through
enough?

952
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,227
Haven't we?

953
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,540
Aah!

954
01:17:50,515 --> 01:17:52,415
Aaah!

955
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,452
Aaah!

956
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:56,519
Aaaah!

957
01:18:00,993 --> 01:18:02,261
Aah!

958
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,165
Aah!
Aaaah!

959
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,025
Shooting stopped.

960
01:18:36,027 --> 01:18:38,360
I hope he's okay.

961
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:39,895
Him?

962
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:42,564
And are we okay?
Is any of this okay?

963
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:49,073
I can't take this.

964
01:18:55,879 --> 01:18:58,079
Make it stop.

965
01:18:58,081 --> 01:18:59,548
We've got to get
off this farm.

966
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:01,117
Tonight.

967
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:13,161
Dad.

968
01:19:13,163 --> 01:19:15,999
Go downstairs, both of you.

969
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:27,277
- But...
- Just do as I say, please.

970
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:33,883
What are you gonna do?

971
01:19:38,621 --> 01:19:40,023
Handle it.

972
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:53,035
Like you handled
the alpacas?

973
01:19:54,704 --> 01:19:56,138
Get out.

974
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:13,320
Come on.

975
01:20:13,322 --> 01:20:15,190
You've done all you could.

976
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:19,693
I'm sorry, Mom.

977
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:22,028
Sorry, Jack.

978
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,633
- Love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

979
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:34,141
Theresa baby,

980
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:38,110
I'm really trying
to do my best.

981
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:39,615
Shh.

982
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:18,386
You will always be
my golden lady.

983
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:22,521
Now, you want to know
what I'm gonna do?

984
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:26,525
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm
gonna find you some help.

985
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:28,794
I promise.

986
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:31,530
And then we're gonna take that
trip we've been talking about.

987
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:33,266
Okay, baby?

988
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:37,335
Oh, yeah.

989
01:21:37,337 --> 01:21:39,538
That's what we're gonna do.

990
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,342
Holy shit,
that's what we're gonna do.

991
01:21:46,446 --> 01:21:48,315
That's what
we're gonna do.

992
01:22:06,099 --> 01:22:08,366
I don't care about
someone identifying

993
01:22:08,368 --> 01:22:11,101
fucking contamination
in the groundwater!

994
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:14,472
The contracts have already
been signed.

995
01:22:14,474 --> 01:22:17,675
- Do you think those...
- If you'll follow me.

996
01:22:17,677 --> 01:22:20,143
Would you like
a glass of water?

997
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:21,546
No, thank you.

998
01:22:21,548 --> 01:22:23,615
That's actually
why I'm here.

999
01:22:23,617 --> 01:22:26,318
...half the drinking
water for the East Coast!

1000
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:36,460
Ward!

1001
01:22:36,462 --> 01:22:37,797
Can you come here for a sec?

1002
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,566
You know Jake.

1003
01:22:42,568 --> 01:22:43,700
Tell him.

1004
01:22:43,702 --> 01:22:46,305
Found these
by the Gardner place.

1005
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:52,211
Oh, my God.

1006
01:22:56,248 --> 01:22:59,716
What happened to them?
They look burned.

1007
01:22:59,718 --> 01:23:00,784
I don't know.

1008
01:23:00,786 --> 01:23:02,386
Jake said he found them
bunched up

1009
01:23:02,388 --> 01:23:04,521
like they were
running from something.

1010
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:07,691
Got a couple birds in there,
a white-tail, rabbit.

1011
01:23:07,693 --> 01:23:09,260
Got a fucking cat.

1012
01:23:10,496 --> 01:23:13,231
It looks like
radiation burns.

1013
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:38,489
Shut up!

1014
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:46,262
What's your problem?
Come on.

1015
01:23:46,264 --> 01:23:48,631
Go get the tack.

1016
01:23:48,633 --> 01:23:50,666
Well, I, uh...

1017
01:23:50,668 --> 01:23:52,702
It's real dark
back there, so...

1018
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,904
And?

1019
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:57,673
I'll just
go get the tack, then.

1020
01:23:57,675 --> 01:24:00,643
Benny, just be careful.

1021
01:24:00,645 --> 01:24:02,645
I don't want to
lose you too.

1022
01:24:02,647 --> 01:24:04,279
Come on.
Shh, shh, shh.

1023
01:24:04,281 --> 01:24:08,218
Leech. Nightmare.
Leprous spellcaster.

1024
01:24:09,887 --> 01:24:11,488
Asshat.

1025
01:24:19,831 --> 01:24:22,666
Comet.

1026
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:27,802
Don't look.

1027
01:24:27,804 --> 01:24:29,206
Don't look.

1028
01:24:35,245 --> 01:24:36,878
Whoa!
Steady, boy. Steady.

1029
01:24:45,154 --> 01:24:47,656
Comet, steady.
Be steady.

1030
01:24:47,658 --> 01:24:50,492
Steady.

1031
01:24:50,494 --> 01:24:52,894
Jesus, Benny, you nearly
gave me a heart attack.

1032
01:24:52,896 --> 01:24:54,696
Com, steady.
Come on.

1033
01:24:54,698 --> 01:24:56,397
- Comet...
- What's wrong with the horse?

1034
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:57,666
There's nothing wrong
with the horse.

1035
01:24:57,668 --> 01:24:59,768
Right now Comet is the last
thing you need to be afraid of.

1036
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:03,404
Fuck!
No, Comet.

1037
01:25:03,406 --> 01:25:04,808
Fuck.

1038
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,680
Looks like we're gonna
have to walk out of here.

1039
01:25:12,682 --> 01:25:14,248
In the dark?

1040
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,452
Through 12 miles
of ancient woodland?

1041
01:25:24,627 --> 01:25:26,694
Sam?

1042
01:25:26,696 --> 01:25:28,629
Sam?

1043
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:31,432
What are you doing?
We have to get out of here.

1044
01:25:31,434 --> 01:25:32,700
Sam, is that you?

1045
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:34,704
Benny.
Benny!

1046
01:25:35,705 --> 01:25:37,205
Fuck!

1047
01:25:38,808 --> 01:25:39,873
He sounds hurt.

1048
01:25:44,914 --> 01:25:46,479
Hold on, boy!

1049
01:25:46,481 --> 01:25:48,648
- What are you doing?
- We can't just leave him.

1050
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,583
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1051
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:51,819
I have to, all right?

1052
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:53,921
I'll put him in the bucket,
and then you can pull him up.

1053
01:25:53,923 --> 01:25:55,823
No, Benny...

1054
01:25:55,825 --> 01:25:58,357
- Whoa! Whoa.
- Fuck this.

1055
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:00,560
No, give me your hand.
It is just a dog.

1056
01:26:00,562 --> 01:26:02,361
- Please give me your hand.
- It's gonna take two minutes.

1057
01:26:02,363 --> 01:26:03,665
- Come back up, please.
- It's gonna take two minutes.

1058
01:26:04,933 --> 01:26:06,968
Idiot.

1059
01:26:09,571 --> 01:26:10,839
Benny!

1060
01:26:11,706 --> 01:26:13,339
God, jeez.

1061
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:15,908
Smells like something died
down here.

1062
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:22,849
Sam?

1063
01:26:22,851 --> 01:26:24,986
Come on!

1064
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:29,021
I-I can see him moving.

1065
01:26:29,023 --> 01:26:30,455
What is it?
What do you see?

1066
01:26:36,898 --> 01:26:38,497
No!
No, no, no!

1067
01:26:38,499 --> 01:26:39,732
No!

1068
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:51,910
Benny!

1069
01:26:51,912 --> 01:26:54,846
No!

1070
01:26:54,848 --> 01:26:56,748
No.

1071
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,983
Aah!

1072
01:26:57,985 --> 01:27:01,453
I have been looking all over
for you!

1073
01:27:01,455 --> 01:27:03,655
You expect me to do
everything on my own, huh?

1074
01:27:03,657 --> 01:27:04,489
The both of you.

1075
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:05,524
I mean, whatever happened

1076
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:08,426
to the good old-fashioned
concept of teamwork?!

1077
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:10,462
If we could all just
pull together

1078
01:27:10,464 --> 01:27:12,063
just once
for the sake of your mother.

1079
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:15,969
Daddy!
You're hurting me!

1080
01:27:17,604 --> 01:27:21,505
Honey.
Honey, I'm not that.

1081
01:27:21,507 --> 01:27:24,676
No, I'm not a monster.

1082
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:27,779
I know I'm not my dad.
I know.

1083
01:27:27,781 --> 01:27:30,716
Please don't make me
go in there.

1084
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:36,854
I promise.
I'll do whatever you want.

1085
01:27:36,856 --> 01:27:42,495
I'll... I'll...
I'll clean up my language.

1086
01:27:45,464 --> 01:27:47,967
I'll even
clean up my room.

1087
01:27:50,703 --> 01:27:54,905
Well, it's like I said,
Lavinia.

1088
01:27:54,907 --> 01:27:56,841
- We're a family.
- No.

1089
01:27:56,843 --> 01:28:01,612
Now, if there's one thing that
families do, they stay together.

1090
01:28:01,614 --> 01:28:05,182
Now feed your mother.

1091
01:28:05,184 --> 01:28:06,984
Dad!

1092
01:28:08,486 --> 01:28:09,655
Please!

1093
01:28:10,823 --> 01:28:12,825
Please!

1094
01:28:14,593 --> 01:28:15,895
But, Dad!

1095
01:28:31,943 --> 01:28:34,111
You seeing this?

1096
01:28:34,113 --> 01:28:35,778
Wait,
is that Lavinia's horse?

1097
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:05,977
I put
your favorite movie on.

1098
01:29:07,112 --> 01:29:09,645
I know this one by heart.

1099
01:29:09,647 --> 01:29:11,147
<i>You have a little something
in your eyes, you know?</i>

1100
01:29:11,149 --> 01:29:11,915
<i>Oh.</i>

1101
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:17,688
I think
after Roman Colosseum...

1102
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:22,925
...we should go Corsica,

1103
01:29:22,927 --> 01:29:27,131
Malta, Greek Isles.

1104
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,768
Greek Isles are the best.

1105
01:29:32,803 --> 01:29:35,771
Dad!

1106
01:29:35,773 --> 01:29:38,874
Please!

1107
01:29:52,122 --> 01:29:54,524
Lavinia!

1108
01:29:57,627 --> 01:29:59,560
Lavinia!

1109
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:01,696
Lavinia!

1110
01:30:15,878 --> 01:30:17,146
You never know.

1111
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:27,223
Mr. Gardner?

1112
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:31,158
Lavinia?

1113
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,129
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1114
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:44,771
It's you.
Toxologist.

1115
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:46,240
I'm the hydrologist, sir,
yeah.

1116
01:30:46,242 --> 01:30:49,210
Um, we came to make sure
you're okay.

1117
01:30:49,212 --> 01:30:50,777
That's very kind of you.

1118
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,580
We've been having a hard time,
you know?

1119
01:30:53,582 --> 01:30:58,219
The car and telephone
and Wi-Fi.

1120
01:30:58,221 --> 01:31:00,720
Heh.
Life in the sticks.

1121
01:31:00,722 --> 01:31:02,256
Come in.

1122
01:31:02,258 --> 01:31:04,758
Theresa will be happy
to see you.

1123
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:07,260
I'm hungry!

1124
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:12,599
I'm hungry.

1125
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:15,068
Mom. Mom.

1126
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:17,973
- Mommy!
- I'm hungry.

1127
01:31:20,342 --> 01:31:21,708
What happened to your arms?

1128
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,779
It's just a rash.

1129
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,151
Where's your wife?

1130
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:32,820
She's right there.

1131
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:44,963
And the rest
of your family?

1132
01:31:44,965 --> 01:31:48,702
Everybody's here.
We all stick together.

1133
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,804
What?

1134
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:56,376
Theresa says,
"Except for Benny.

1135
01:31:56,378 --> 01:32:00,181
Benny lives
in the well now."

1136
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:08,053
Drink?
I'm having one.

1137
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:10,124
- Lavinia!
- Mom!

1138
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:13,725
Lavinia!

1139
01:32:13,727 --> 01:32:15,062
Mom, stop!

1140
01:32:16,897 --> 01:32:18,663
Ward!

1141
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:19,666
Out of the way.

1142
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,006
No!

1143
01:32:28,008 --> 01:32:29,807
Please, Mommy!

1144
01:32:29,809 --> 01:32:31,676
No, no!

1145
01:32:55,902 --> 01:32:57,770
Daddy...

1146
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,149
They're not my family.

1147
01:33:11,884 --> 01:33:13,086
Daddy...

1148
01:33:19,058 --> 01:33:22,260
Lavinia.
Lavinia! Lavinia.

1149
01:33:22,262 --> 01:33:23,396
Come here.

1150
01:33:25,797 --> 01:33:28,865
All right.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1151
01:33:28,867 --> 01:33:31,067
You're gonna be okay.
I mean...

1152
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:32,503
Fuck!
I'm gonna carry you.

1153
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:34,505
I'm gonna carry you outside
in the patrol car, okay?

1154
01:33:34,507 --> 01:33:36,275
I got you.
Oh, God.

1155
01:33:39,278 --> 01:33:41,478
You're okay.

1156
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,916
Okay, we're almost there.

1157
01:33:50,455 --> 01:33:52,391
The color.

1158
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,061
Ward!

1159
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,862
No!

1160
01:33:59,864 --> 01:34:01,133
Dad!

1161
01:34:05,137 --> 01:34:08,205
Fuck!
You shot my dad! Look!

1162
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:10,309
Look what you did!

1163
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:14,011
Dad.

1164
01:34:23,821 --> 01:34:25,723
Beautiful.

1165
01:34:26,991 --> 01:34:28,991
Like a flower.

1166
01:34:28,993 --> 01:34:30,793
It's gonna be okay, Dad, now.

1167
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:34,063
You can help us.

1168
01:34:34,065 --> 01:34:36,999
Three Charlie one seven.
I've got a code 33.

1169
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:39,034
D-Don't...

1170
01:34:39,036 --> 01:34:40,869
Don't...

1171
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:43,807
Please don't leave me.

1172
01:34:47,011 --> 01:34:48,312
Daddy?

1173
01:34:50,348 --> 01:34:52,083
Daddy?

1174
01:34:55,519 --> 01:34:58,287
I'm not getting anything.
We've got to get out of here.

1175
01:34:58,289 --> 01:34:59,954
We're not
getting out of here.

1176
01:34:59,956 --> 01:35:02,324
None of us are.

1177
01:35:02,326 --> 01:35:06,094
That thing won't let us.

1178
01:35:06,096 --> 01:35:08,196
Come on, look, that...
that's silly.

1179
01:35:08,198 --> 01:35:09,964
There's nothing stopping us
from getting up and leav...

1180
01:35:15,171 --> 01:35:17,405
What the hell was that?

1181
01:35:17,407 --> 01:35:19,943
It sounded like it came
from Ezra's cabin.

1182
01:35:22,212 --> 01:35:23,845
We can't leave him out there
on his own.

1183
01:35:23,847 --> 01:35:25,348
Ward, give me a hand.

1184
01:35:27,317 --> 01:35:29,183
Lavinia.

1185
01:35:29,185 --> 01:35:31,021
I'm not going with you.

1186
01:35:32,856 --> 01:35:34,455
We've got to go.

1187
01:35:34,457 --> 01:35:37,360
I'm sorry, we've got to go.
You... You can't stay here.

1188
01:35:42,032 --> 01:35:43,832
I live here.

1189
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:50,638
I'm gonna come back for you.

1190
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,342
I'll be back.

1191
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,022
<i>Nothing.</i>

1192
01:36:09,992 --> 01:36:14,528
<i>Nothing.
Nothing.</i>

1193
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,997
<i>Nothing.</i>

1194
01:36:16,999 --> 01:36:19,399
- Ezra?
- <i>Cold and wet.</i>

1195
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:20,434
You in there?

1196
01:36:20,436 --> 01:36:23,305
<i>But it burns.</i>

1197
01:36:26,175 --> 01:36:27,609
I'm going in.

1198
01:36:29,144 --> 01:36:33,215
<i>Sucking the life
out of everything.</i>

1199
01:36:34,982 --> 01:36:39,018
<i>It came down in the rock.</i>

1200
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,986
Ezra?

1201
01:36:40,988 --> 01:36:42,988
<i>It lives in the well.</i>

1202
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:45,257
<i>It grew down there.</i>

1203
01:36:45,259 --> 01:36:47,527
Ezra?

1204
01:36:47,529 --> 01:36:50,566
<i>Poisoning everything.</i>

1205
01:36:52,668 --> 01:36:56,936
<i>Changing everything</i>

1206
01:36:56,938 --> 01:37:00,573
<i>into something like the world
it came from.</i>

1207
01:37:00,575 --> 01:37:06,579
<i>Into what it knows.</i>

1208
01:37:06,581 --> 01:37:12,186
<i>We all know it's coming,
but we can't get away.</i>

1209
01:37:13,388 --> 01:37:18,491
<i>It's got everything
that lives.</i>

1210
01:37:18,493 --> 01:37:22,028
<i>They all drunk the water.</i>

1211
01:37:23,431 --> 01:37:26,365
<i>It got strong.</i>

1212
01:37:26,367 --> 01:37:27,700
Sheriff.

1213
01:37:27,702 --> 01:37:31,071
<i>Fed itself on them.</i>

1214
01:37:32,205 --> 01:37:34,573
<i>It came from the stars...</i>

1215
01:37:34,575 --> 01:37:37,443
Skin's all...

1216
01:37:37,445 --> 01:37:41,415
<i>...where things
ain't like they are here.</i>

1217
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:46,618
<i>It's just a color.</i>

1218
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:50,723
<i>But it burns.</i>

1219
01:37:50,725 --> 01:37:56,728
<i>It sucks, and it burns.</i>

1220
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:58,365
Sheriff!
No! Sheriff!

1221
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:02,235
<i>It burns.</i>

1222
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,040
Sheriff?

1223
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:11,711
Sheriff?

1224
01:38:34,066 --> 01:38:35,234
Lavinia?

1225
01:38:37,603 --> 01:38:40,573
It's so beautiful.

1226
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:34,117
Lavinia!

1227
01:40:55,438 --> 01:40:57,872
<i>No, Jack!</i>

1228
01:40:57,874 --> 01:41:00,307
<i>It's you, Jack.</i>

1229
01:41:00,309 --> 01:41:03,310
<i>Now it's Lavinia.</i>

1230
01:41:03,312 --> 01:41:04,913
<i>There's something wrong
with Jack!</i>

1231
01:41:04,915 --> 01:41:08,217
<i>Why does it matter how far away
it is? Look at him.</i>

1232
01:41:18,494 --> 01:41:21,962
Are you looking
at my legs?

1233
01:41:21,964 --> 01:41:23,764
You're dead, Nathan!

1234
01:41:23,766 --> 01:41:25,566
It's no big deal.

1235
01:41:39,214 --> 01:41:40,848
Don't make... Stay away.

1236
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:41,717
<i>Daddy!</i>

1237
01:41:50,926 --> 01:41:53,228
No! No!

1238
01:44:43,762 --> 01:44:47,096
<i>I hope the dammed water
that covers this place</i>

1239
01:44:47,098 --> 01:44:49,067
<i>will be very deep.</i>

1240
01:44:50,669 --> 01:44:52,504
<i>But even then...</i>

1241
01:44:54,906 --> 01:44:57,042
<i>...I will never drink it.</i>

1242
01:45:26,837 --> 01:45:31,008
<i>There are only a few of us that
remember the strange days now.</i>

1243
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,678
<i>What touched this place
cannot be quantified</i>

1244
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,850
<i>or understood
by human science.</i>

1245
01:45:47,224 --> 01:45:53,630
<i>It was just a color
out of space...</i>

1246
01:45:54,832 --> 01:46:00,002
<i>...a messenger from realms
whose existence stuns the brain</i>

1247
01:46:00,004 --> 01:46:03,671
<i>and numbs us with the gulfs</i>

1248
01:46:03,673 --> 01:46:07,610
<i>that it throws open
before our frenzied eyes.</i>

1249
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:50,132

1
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,914
Norway 1363.
It's been ten years ago since...

2
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:02,286
...the Black Death killed almost
a half of the population.

3
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:08,368
The country is deserted
and lawlessness prevails.

4
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:16,455
Some defy danger and go away
to find a better life.

5
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,874
Good.

6
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,582
Signe?
Do you want to try?

7
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,040
Do you have a view on the...

8
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,124
Aim along the arrow.

9
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,124
- Nice. You are just a bit...
- Impatient.

10
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,124
Food is ready!

11
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,749
Tormod?

12
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,249
Look at this

13
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,457
- What's going on?
- Some stones...

14
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,749
Stay here!

15
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,415
No, do not look!

16
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,999
I'll take care of you.

17
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,665
- Wasn't just two of them?
- Kids!

18
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,165
Help!

19
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,665
Run! Run, Tormod!

20
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,499
- Boy!
- I got him.

21
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,832
NO!

22
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,457
You got her father.
She's mine.

23
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,124
Wait.

24
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,082
Take her.

25
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,415
Something to warm up with.

26
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,665
Careful.

27
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,832
Frigg?

28
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,165
Hello!

29
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,165
- Have you been good?
- Yes.

30
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,290
I have to ask.
Are you excited about what I brought you?

31
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,749
Let's see.

32
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,499
Why is she here?

33
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,124
Here.

34
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,374
Look at that! Nice?

35
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,040
Now, you were lucky.

36
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,665
You can have...

37
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,415
The horse is yours.

38
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,790
Frigg?

39
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:47,665
What is your name?

40
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:58,957
Do not be afraid of them.
They don't dare to touch you...

41
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,999
...as long as I forbid them.

42
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,207
I'm so thirsty.

43
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,374
You're not like them.

44
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,124
Frigg? What are you doing?

45
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:44,082
Every time she tries something,
you cut off a finger.

46
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,249
Enough of beating her.

47
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,290
Good.

48
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,832
You, come here.

49
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,999
She deserved it, right?

50
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,165
Come.

51
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,582
Go to bed.

52
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:46,707
I can not have children anymore, and
Frigg wants to have a sister.

53
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,707
A little sister.

54
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,540
There is one thing you must understand.

55
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,124
Frigg means everything to us.

56
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,749
Shit Kid and the Witch
can burn in hell!

57
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,499
Do not feel sorry for her.

58
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,374
Frigg, look at me.

59
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,540
She wants us evil.

60
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:26,249
There are people, people like her,
who chased us out of the forest.

61
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,124
- Do not talk to her.
- I'm not a child anymore, Dagmar.

62
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,707
You know that you can tell mom, right?

63
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,790
Quiet, or I cut your throat.

64
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,915
Not a sound!

65
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,624
I was the one who found her.

66
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,999
- Dagmar said no.
- We do everything for her.

67
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,040
She is our reward.

68
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,124
You must remember one thing...

69
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,749
Do you hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

70
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,207
- Dagmar?
- Wait a minute.

71
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,999
It is enough.

72
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,499
That's enough, I said!

73
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,749
You're getting old, Arvid.

74
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,415
I have said that it is enough.
Are you deaf?

75
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,707
You...

76
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,832
What did I say about this?

77
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,290
Witch!

78
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,749
I missed your little brother's heart.

79
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,040
He has probably spent hours
to bleed to death.

80
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:37,749
Maybe he is still screaming for help!

81
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,124
I just can not wait until tomorrow.

82
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,707
I'll send the boys on you,
one by one.

83
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,582
That's what I would say.

84
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,624
You know what you have to do
when the sun rises in the morning?

85
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,082
- Say it.
- I'll cut off her finger.

86
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,415
Yes. Good.

87
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,499
Go.

88
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,124
- Stop!
- Come!

89
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,874
Arvid!

90
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,249
She runs away!

91
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,582
Frigg? Frigg!

92
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,957
Come on!

93
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,915
Come.

94
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,290
They are not here!

95
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,540
- Frigg!
- Frigg!

96
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:54,624
- We ran past them.
- Search through the forest.

97
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,457
Find them.

98
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,624
Here!

99
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,540
At the ravine!

100
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,582
Help me!

101
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,374
- I got her.
- Wait!

102
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,582
Frigg, stay there! I'll get you.

103
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,957
Frigg?

104
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:03,374
We cross further down.

105
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,457
Come.

106
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,915
They're going to catch us.
We must get away from the trail.

107
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,999
Come.

108
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:03,290
- We spread ourselves. Then we meet here.
- What do we do with them?

109
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,874
Bring Frigg here.

110
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,332
And the other girl?

111
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,290
Do whatever you want to.

112
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,332
We find a different one.

113
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:05,415
You still have not said thanks for that
l helped you to set free.

114
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,332
I do not know how to survive here.

115
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:14,582
If you want to live, you better turn around.
They can take much better care of you.

116
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:18,374
I can take care of myself.

117
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:05,290
The girl has probably threatened Frigg
to follow.

118
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:11,832
We'll just find her
and take her home.

119
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,332
Where is Loki?

120
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,249
Take my hand.

121
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,124
That's it.

122
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,249
Hurry!

123
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,165
Come!

124
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,124
Calm down.

125
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,082
You'll me mine anyway.

126
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,499
It will be fine.

127
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,165
Hello! Get out!

128
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:34,499
Otherwise ... I cut your throat.

129
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,999
Let's see.

130
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,790
I should have killed her in the ravine.

131
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,249
They can be anywhere.

132
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:21,249
Want to see Frigg again?

133
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:25,457
I just want Frigg to be all right.

134
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,457
You have personally been on the run.

135
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,540
What would you do?

136
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,457
I would have followed the valley.

137
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,749
Along the river.

138
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:52,249
And try to find people.

139
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,374
What if there's someone there.

140
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,957
Only dead people.

141
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,207
Yes.

142
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:52,374
Where are your parents?

143
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,499
The  real one

144
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,749
Dagmar told me...

145
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,582
... I was alone when they found me.

146
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:21,582
The Black Death had taken the mother and father.

147
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:25,749
Only I survived on the farm.

148
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:32,249
Do you remember anything?

149
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:10,207
You said you'd take care of me.

150
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,374
What are you doing here?

151
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,915
Answer!

152
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:06,457
We wanted to warm up.
We leave now.

153
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,665
Stop!

154
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:18,040
You can never be too careful
up here.

155
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:26,749
I saw the smoke from the house ...
I thought it was robbers.

156
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:32,249
Are you hungry?

157
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,165
We went down into the valley.

158
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:44,790
Then we found the farm ...

159
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,499
And decided to rest here until tomorrow.

160
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,082
I'm sorry to hear about your family.

161
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,665
How many men were there?

162
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,832
Five men.

163
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,499
But woman was their leader.

164
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,624
Dagmar.

165
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,374
Dagmar?

166
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,249
- Do you know who she is?
- Everyone around here knows her.

167
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,582
<i> When Black Death came to the valley... </i>

168
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:25,165
<i> ...people thought it was Dagmar's making. </i>

169
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:29,457
They thought Dagmar had tossed
a curse on the village.

170
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:46,165
<i> She and her daughter were
 subjected to the water test. </i>

171
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,082
- She had a child?
- Yes.

172
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,540
Five years old.

173
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:16,040
<i> You could say that
 they took it away from her. </i>

174
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:23,040
<i> After the girl had drowned
 it was her turn. </i>

175
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:36,290
But when they would pull up, the body was gone.

176
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:41,124
<i> They were looking at the bottom of the river,
 but found nothing. </i>

177
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,290
What do you do?

178
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:04,374
- Takes care of the weapon.
- What's it for?

179
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,540
Bear.

180
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,832
How?

181
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:13,874
- It interest you?
- Yes.

182
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:18,540
First, you get the bear
to run after you...

183
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:21,374
Then you lie down and wait.

184
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,165
Let him come very close...

185
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:29,207
And bring up the spear,
aiming at its chest, and...

186
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:59,082
Signe?

187
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:07,790
There is a village two days from here.

188
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,999
- I have to bury my brother.
- It is not safe now.

189
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:16,207
I'll find someone in the village
that follow you there

190
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,249
Do you know someone
who can take care of Frigg?

191
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,290
Yes.

192
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:24,374
You.

193
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,582
Me? No.

194
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,665
I can barely take care of myself.

195
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:32,915
You got her away from them.

196
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:36,999
Maybe you can do more than you think?

197
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,040
Frigg?

198
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,707
Frigg, where are you?

199
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:53,999
Frigg!

200
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,624
Frigg...

201
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,665
What is it?

202
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:08,499
Did you think we had left you?

203
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,874
No.

204
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,290
Who is he?

205
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,665
Does not matter.

206
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:41,957
We kill him and the girl.
Frigg gets her punishment in the camp..

207
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,707
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

208
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,624
Ready.

209
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,040
Yes, I'm ready.

210
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,249
Watch!

211
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,707
Stop! Back!

212
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,665
Drop the knife!

213
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:46,332
Get all back in the yard.
Get them out!

214
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:47,874
All back in the yard.

215
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,332
- Now!
- Come out!

216
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:03,707
- Get ready to run.
- Let him go!

217
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:21,665
- Let Frigg go, and we 'll leave.
- Put down your weapons.

218
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:24,165
Frigg?

219
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:28,915
Come out, or I will kill you!

220
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:50,874
Come!

221
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:26,249
I know the injustice that was done
towards you and the child...

222
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,957
But these girls are innocent.

223
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,665
Just as you and your was.

224
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,207
Dagmar ...

225
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:45,332
We let go Frigg.

226
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,957
We let go Frigg.

227
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,374
NO!

228
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,249
Out the back door! Hurry up.

229
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,249
- We're not leaving without you.
- Do it now!

230
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:51,832
Come!

231
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,124
Around the house!

232
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,582
Come, Frigg.

233
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:19,415
- I jump!
- No ...

234
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:51,790
I know I've done so many ...

235
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:54,707
...terrible things.

236
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:59,457
But I promise to change.

237
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:04,499
Everything should be fine now.

238
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,915
We start all over again,
just me and you.

239
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:16,957
- Will you let Signe to go?
- Course.

240
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:29,874
Never forget who you are, Frigg.

241
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,749
NO!

242
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,415
What carve you?

243
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,957
Here.

244
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,415
Along the arrow.

245
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:22,082
- You have been in the river before.
- You too.

246
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,290
Die!

247
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,290
Mom!

248
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,999
What did you say?

249
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,290
Mom.

250
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,707
My girl...

251
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,790
Come.

252
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:16,332
I could not take care of him.

253
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,749
A rune?

254
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,540
"Odal".

255
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:34,415
What does it mean?

256
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,207
Family

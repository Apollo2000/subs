00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,807
Are you following me?

3
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,966
Um... no.

4
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,480
Um, what are you doing?

5
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,920
I live here.

6
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,080
No. I live here.

7
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,243
No. 3715.

8
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,645
Really?

9
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,810
See?

10
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,680
Um, excuse me?

11
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,921
Uh...

12
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,120
This is my house.

13
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,327
No. Listen, this is my house.

14
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,651
We know each other.

15
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,522
Oh.

16
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,847
I don't know you.

17
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,921
We must have lost our memories.

18
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,565
Well...

19
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,209
I wonder how we're gonna get those back.

20
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,040
Well,

21
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,720
obviously we should have sex

22
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,880
and just hope for the best.

23
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,851
- Wait.
- What?

24
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,680
What if we're brother and sister?

25
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,139
You're ruining this.

26
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,482
Hey.

27
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,531
Mmm.

28
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,609
I'm gonna go to bed.

29
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,847
Okay. I'll be in in a little bit.

30
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,364
No, come now.

31
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,651
Okay.

32
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,763
I love you.

33
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,283
I love you, too.

34
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,726
Hey.

35
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,285
Hmm?

36
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,884
I really do.

37
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,805
Good.

38
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,929
Hey, will you grab the light?

39
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,410
Hey, babe?

40
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,280
Are you kidding me?

41
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,320
This team doesn't care about winning.

42
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,600
They're thinking about one thing
and that is the draft.

43
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm not saying they're tanking,
but the last thing they want is a win.

44
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,440
This team's hope for the future
is on draft day.

45
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,280
Hey, babe. Where are you?

46
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,820
I don't remember what you said
you were doing today, but, uh...

47
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,480
call me, okay?

48
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,370
All right. Love you.

49
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Hi, Darcy?

50
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,011
Um, listen, have you spoken
with Claire today?

51
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
Okay.

52
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
Um, no, no, everything's fine.

53
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
I just don't know where she is.

54
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,609
I'm sure she told me
and I'm just forgetting.

55
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,967
And, hey, listen, if you hear from her,

56
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,000
could you... Okay, great.

57
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,570
Thanks, see ya.

58
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Hey, Mr. York, sorry.

59
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,360
Um, it's David, Claire's boyfriend.

60
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
Is she working today?

61
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,840
She works tomorrow, not today.

62
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,000
All right. And you haven't seen her?

63
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,491
No.

64
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
- Claire?
- Hey, what the fuck?

65
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,408
Sorry, I'm looking for Claire.
Have you seen her?

66
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,000
- You ruined my prints, man.
- Have you seen her?

67
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,605
No.

68
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,365
Shit.

69
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,320
Did you guys have a fight before she left?

70
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,320
- No, everything was fine.
- And what about recently?

71
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,920
Did you guys have any disagreements?

72
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
No.

73
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,884
Have you, uh, have you called her parents?

74
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,320
Claire?

75
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,640
She doesn't have any family, actually.

76
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,520
Okay. And you've spoken to her friends?

77
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,682
Yes, I've spoken to her friends.

78
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,360
Because sometimes people don't
even realize something was wrong.

79
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,966
Nothing was was wrong, all right?

80
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
- We're happy, so...
- Okay.

81
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Okay, well, what... What should I do?

82
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,840
Anything helps.

83
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,400
You know, reach out
to people that know her.

84
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,440
If this isn't resolved in a few days,
we'll get you a printout of the report.

85
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,240
A lot of people like to flyer
the neighborhood.

86
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
You know, telephone poles and everything.

87
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,489
Whoa, wait, wait. Flyer the neighborhood?

88
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,480
- That's it?
- Hopefully, it won't come to that.

89
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,211
Okay, I promise you
we're gonna do everything we can.

90
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Are you following me?

91
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,240
What?

92
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,401
No.

93
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,522
Of course not.

94
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

95
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,920
You live here?

96
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,480
Uh, yeah.

97
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Oh, that's embarrassing.

98
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,640
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

99
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,000
You know, it's just that for a second
you're gonna kill me.

100
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,880
Wow, well, I definitely would not do that.

101
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
I know, you're probably like a...

102
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,128
like a school teacher or something.

103
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,160
No, I'm not a school teacher.

104
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,720
But... I like to think
I'm a pretty good guy.

105
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,086
Yeah, I can see that now.

106
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,601
Uh, I'm Claire.

107
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
David.

108
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,643
Hi, David, I just moved into 103.

109
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,040
The Twisted Sister fan.

110
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
Oh.

111
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm in 203, right above you.

112
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,680
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I can make it up to you.

113
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,331
I can get you a gift or something.

114
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

115
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
No, listen, I'm kidding, seriously.

116
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,208
I mean, you can get me gifts,
by all means, but don't worry about it.

117
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,766
Welcome to the building, Claire.

118
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,360
- Hey, David.
- Hi, Colleen.

119
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,320
How you doing?

120
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm... I'm good.

121
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,040
Well, I really hate to do this to you,

122
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,080
but, um, I really can't wait any longer.

123
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
Uh, I'm so sorry.

124
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,760
It's, you know, if it were up to me...

125
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,240
I understand.

126
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,481
Okay.

127
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,489
All right, see ya.

128
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,201
Hello?

129
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,720
Sorry for dropping in without any warning.

130
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I didn't think I was gonna be
here more than an hour.

131
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,320
Don't worry about it.
It's good to see you.

132
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,120
It's nice to actually talk
to someone who really knew her.

133
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,880
It's... It's been too long.

134
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,769
I know, I know. I'm sorry about that.

135
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,000
How have you been doing?

136
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,820
Just the same, you know.

137
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,120
It's just... It...

138
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,884
It's too brutal, man, you know?

139
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
It's unreal.

140
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,160
Yeah, you know, best-case scenario

141
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,320
is that she just left.

142
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,920
And cops said that happens.

143
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,685
That's the easiest thing
for me to imagine.

144
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,680
I mean, the...
You know, the least painful.

145
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,520
'Cause it's either that
or she... was killed,

146
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,000
or she was taken.

147
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,128
- Shit.
- Yeah.

148
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,400
So, there were never
any leads or anything?

149
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,686
No.

150
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,048
Do you think it's possible that...

151
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,640
you know, that she was unhappy?

152
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
Fuck, man.

153
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,610
I mean, she was the happiest
I'd ever seen her with you.

154
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,200
You're a good match.

155
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,490
And with Claire? I don't think
that was an easy thing to find.

156
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,364
To Claire.

157
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,520
Thanks for letting me crash, man.

158
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,080
Yeah.

159
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,520
So, where are you off to tomorrow?

160
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm going to the French Alps, man.

161
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,840
Friend of mine has
an adventure-guide service thing.

162
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,889
Take rich tourists climbing,
camping, make it feel dangerous.

163
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,169
I'm gonna do a few trips with him,
make some money, and then...

164
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,128
Hey, what are you doing?

165
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,360
You think I can make it?

166
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,080
Not without breaking your neck.

167
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
Come on.

168
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
Hey! Hey!

169
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
What? You don't think I'll do it?

170
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,080
You're being an idiot.

171
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,571
Now, come on before someone see you.

172
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,730
Dare me.

173
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,480
Dare me.

174
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,289
I dare you.

175
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,360
Jesus.

176
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,200
What the fuck is wrong with you?

177
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,960
My leg.

178
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,720
Is it broken?

179
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,809
Aw, Jesus.

180
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,560
Come on, man.

181
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,800
Come on, let's get you home.

182
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's get you home.

183
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:36,129
Now, come on. There you go.

184
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,009
I got you.

185
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,449
Shit.

186
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,165
There he is. How you feeling?

187
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,362
Hey, um...

188
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
sorry about last night.

189
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,280
I was just... you know, I was just drunk.

190
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,489
No shit. You all right?

191
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,600
Yeah, I'm just a little,
you know, bruised up,

192
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,640
but I'll be fine.

193
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,210
Okay.

194
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,450
Okay.

195
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,880
So, what's your plan today?

196
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,450
My flight's not until 4:00.

197
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
Oh, um...

198
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,164
you know, actually,
I have a bunch of errands to run.

199
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't think I'll be back before then.

200
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,280
But, you know, you can stay as you want.

201
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Just... you can just lock the door
when you leave, you know?

202
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,720
Awesome, man. Thanks.

203
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,087
- Yeah, no problem.
- Yeah.

204
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,160
- Hi.
- Hello.

205
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,560
Are you busy?

206
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,680
Uh, no, not really.

207
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
Do you wanna eat?

208
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,480
I kinda owe you.

209
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,642
Come on.

210
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry about the mess.

211
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
No, I... I like your place.

212
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,760
Really? Do you want a beer or something?

213
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
Sure. Thank you.

214
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,723
So, um...

215
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,410
what do you do, Claire?

216
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,480
Well, I'm currently pursuing
a career in dry cleaning.

217
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,440
Doing what?

218
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,480
I work at a dry cleaners.

219
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,971
Oh.

220
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,480
Did you take these?

221
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,480
Yeah, it's a... it's a hobby of mine.

222
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,600
Oh. I really like them.

223
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,080
Where is that?

224
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,840
I... Vancouver.

225
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,160
What do you do?

226
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,960
Graphic design sort of stuff.

227
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,640
Nothing too exciting, but...

228
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,449
Cool.

229
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,405
What is that you got there?

230
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,120
Dinner, and it should be ready in,
ooh, three and a half minutes.

231
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,201
My God, that's not long.

232
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,000
- Claire, that's not food.
- Sure, it is.

233
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,003
You've been eating stuff like that?

234
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,480
- Yeah, I mean...
- Put that down.

235
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,440
Okay, I... I know
a little thing about food.

236
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,440
Do you wanna come with me?
Can I make you something?

237
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,164
Come here.

238
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,211
End of the line, son.

239
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,689
Can I just stay on for a while?

240
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
What, this ain't a shelter, buddy.

241
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,442
It's for getting
where you need to go, huh?

242
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,840
Hey! Hey!

243
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,520
What the fuck?

244
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,120
Oh...

245
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,560
you're home early.

246
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,400
You said you'd be gone all day.

247
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
What are you doing?

248
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,605
Oh, man, David. I'm sorry.

249
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
What the fuck is this?

250
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,487
I'm just looking for something.

251
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,841
That's all. I can't find it.

252
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,361
You weren't supposed to come home.

253
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,845
I don't understand.

254
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,680
Yeah, Boulder really wasn't for me.

255
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
Kind of ski bum, beer pong situation.

256
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,200
I didn't make a ton of friends.

257
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,760
Mmm, my God, this is so good.

258
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,760
So, uh, where did you grow up?

259
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,120
Salt Lake City. Pretty happening spot.

260
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,441
Yeah. Birthplace of jazz.

261
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
- Hmm?
- Nothing. Never mind.

262
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,280
Um, your family still there?

263
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,920
Family's not really part of the picture.

264
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,280
Where are you from?

265
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,880
San Jose, California.

266
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
And your parents, they still live there?

267
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
My, uh, my mom does, but my dad,

268
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,360
he actually died when I was a kid.

269
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,880
Which is a hilarious thing to talk about.

270
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,600
But long story short, my mom,

271
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,280
after he died, she, uh,

272
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,600
she found, um, Jesus.

273
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,600
Mmm.

274
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm... I'm aware of him.

275
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,640
Yeah, well, apparently,
he was in San Jose,

276
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,040
of all places, and now, you know,

277
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,480
she collects these little baby figurines.

278
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,960
Yeah, like...

279
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,800
Like, you know, anything baby,

280
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,520
like little baby sculptures.

281
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,520
Anyways, now the house is filled

282
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,800
with millions of little babies everywhere.

283
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Like, little angel babies.

284
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,480
Yeah, it's, uh, it's a little...

285
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
It's a little creepy.

286
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
Also the whole place is kind of, um,

287
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,280
kind of depressing, not just my...

288
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,320
Not just my house,
but San Jose in general.

289
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,960
I don't...

290
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,360
It's a boring place.
I don't really like it there.

291
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,520
You know, it's, uh...

292
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,280
I go there sometimes, you know.

293
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,000
Not as often as I should.

294
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,923
But, yeah.

295
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,600
I wanted to do that.

296
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,489
That's, uh, that's okay.

297
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,640
Oh, jeez.

298
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm still chewing my food.

299
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,760
That's... No, wait, that's disgusting.

300
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,360
His name is Buck Cameron.

301
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,680
So, he's a friend?

302
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,360
A friend of my girlfriend's from college.

303
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,120
Is your girlfriend here?
Can I speak with her?

304
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,040
No, she's not here.

305
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
She, um,

306
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,883
she disappeared a little over a year ago.

307
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,403
She's missing.

308
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,520
Hey, David.

309
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,440
Hey. Detective Sloan.

310
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I heard what happened. You all right?

311
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,400
Oh, yeah. My head hurts.

312
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,560
Yeah, I bet.

313
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,840
Doc said the CAT scan looks fine,

314
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,888
gave me some medicine for the pain, so.

315
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,960
Good. Look, the reason why I'm here

316
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,960
is I figured rather than letting you get
the runaround from God knows who,

317
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,960
I'd take a look for you.

318
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,440
Your pal Buck never flew out yesterday,
not under that name at least.

319
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,440
What do you mean under that name?

320
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,400
You said he went
to the University of Colorado

321
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
in Boulder, is that right?

322
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, that's where Claire met him.

323
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,200
There's no record of him there.

324
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,040
That's gotta be a mistake.

325
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,560
I don't think it is, David.

326
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,440
On a hunch, I checked.
Claire didn't go there, either.

327
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,000
Wait, wait. What do you...
what do you mean?

328
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,360
Listen, David, you can tell me honestly.

329
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,840
Do you know what he was looking for?

330
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,240
No.

331
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,766
So, you don't know if he found it, either.

332
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,606
Do you know what he was looking for?

333
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,120
You found me.

334
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,120
Wow, this place is cool.

335
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,123
Yeah.

336
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,766
What's this?

337
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,160
Oh, I made you some lunch.

338
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,880
That's so sweet.

339
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,089
Yeah, there's a little something inside.

340
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,280
So, um, what have you been working on?

341
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,240
Ugh, I've been looking at it all day.

342
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,120
Well, I haven't. Let me see.

343
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,320
You can see it when I do
something good, okay?

344
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Fine.

345
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,245
When I'm done. Okay?

346
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,251
Excuse me.

347
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,483
Hey, sorry, uh, sorry
to bother you, but, um...

348
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,880
have you seen this girl?

349
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,930
Do you recognize her? No?

350
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
- Jesus.
- You're not allowed back here.

351
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,240
This is off-limits.

352
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,480
I'm sorry, I was just looking around.

353
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,527
Get out of here now.

354
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,120
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

355
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,240
Who is this?

356
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,640
This is no one. He is confused.

357
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,883
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait.

358
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,689
Is there something
that we can help you with?

359
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,200
Yeah, have you, um,

360
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,169
have you seen this girl?

361
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,720
Do you recognize her?

362
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,485
Fisnik, let go of the poor boy.

363
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,960
This girl, how do you know her?

364
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,240
Well, she's my girlfriend.

365
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,530
She was my girlfriend. She disappeared.

366
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,282
I see.

367
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,522
That is very sad.

368
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,360
Do you... Do you know her?

369
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,840
No.

370
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
Why would I know her?

371
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,000
Look, I don't know. I just..

372
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,880
Why do you come here
looking for this girl, huh?

373
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,362
Uh, I was looking everywhere.

374
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,881
But why do you come here?

375
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,560
Uh... hey.

376
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,600
She just spent a lot of time in this,

377
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
in this area, so I thought maybe...

378
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,560
What is your name?

379
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,160
My name's David.

380
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,483
Now you have a problem, David.

381
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,200
What do you mean? What's my problem?

382
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,044
I don't believe you.

383
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
Hey, wait, I think we just have

384
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,400
a bit of a misunderstan... Wait a minute.

385
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,680
David, David. Look at me.

386
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,684
You have to convince me now.

387
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm telling you the truth.

388
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,843
Look, maybe... Let me just go home,
okay? I'll just go home.

389
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,849
What do you do, David? What is your job?

390
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,080
I, uh... I do graphic design.

391
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
I design for websites.

392
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,680
Ah.

393
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,046
I believe that.

394
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,090
Sit down.

395
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,925
All right.

396
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,046
Now... the truth.

397
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,560
I don't... I don't know what to say.

398
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,531
Don't pay attention to him.
Pay attention to me.

399
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,722
What do you want?

400
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,560
Why did you come here?

401
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,080
I'm looking for my girlfriend.
She disappeared.

402
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,640
I am starting to lose patience, David.

403
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,360
I know that you are looking for this lady.

404
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,560
Why here?

405
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,449
I'm looking everywhere.

406
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:36,361
Hey, hey, hey...

407
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
So?

408
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,680
Uh...

409
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,280
I saw this address written down, okay?

410
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,040
It was written on a piece
of paper in her handwriting.

411
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,407
You know, I was just
cleaning out her things and...

412
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,760
You know, I thought I'd just come here.

413
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,640
I was just, just hoping that maybe...

414
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,765
What is her name?

415
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,843
Her name is Claire.

416
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,121
Claire.

417
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,124
Maybe it would be better for you
if you stopped looking for her.

418
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,285
Maybe you don't like what you find.

419
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,323
Detective Sloan?

420
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
Yeah, um,

421
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,880
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

422
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,328
I was hoping you could check
on a few things for me.

423
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,200
Can I ask you a question?

424
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,282
Sure.

425
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,440
You always change the subject

426
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,323
whenever I ask you about
your family or anything.

427
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,862
That's not a question.

428
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,560
Why can't we talk about it?

429
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,560
Why are you so interested in it?

430
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,371
Well, I don't know, because...

431
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,130
I'm in love with you.

432
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,040
You are?

433
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,531
Yeah.

434
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,803
I mean, should I not be?

435
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,242
Well, it's kind of out
of my control, so...

436
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,207
What is it that you want?

437
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,970
What are you after?

438
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,689
You.

439
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,963
Oh, shit.

440
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,481
Does, uh, does your head hurt?

441
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,760
You want some of these?

442
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,047
It helps.

443
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,040
I want you to answer
a few questions first,

444
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,282
and then I'll give it to you.

445
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,920
Why did you come here?

446
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,241
I'm not gonna talk to you.

447
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,600
Okay.

448
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,966
All right.

449
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,920
You're not gonna use that.

450
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,685
How do you know?

451
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,960
Just a feeling you get.

452
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,640
What feeling?

453
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,520
Fear.

454
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,887
And you're not afraid right now?

455
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,601
No.

456
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,929
What about now?

457
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,525
Do you know how much this hurts?

458
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,400
Yeah, well, I do.

459
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,970
Why did you come here?

460
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,160
For information.

461
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,920
What information?

462
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,520
Anything I could find.

463
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,840
Or get out of you.

464
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,160
I don't know anything.

465
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,720
You'd be surprised what you know.

466
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,480
Do you know what happened to Claire?

467
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,800
Huh?

468
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,680
Did you do something to her?

469
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,362
You think I know something?

470
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,880
We're the same, David.

471
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,320
We're both looking for the same thing.

472
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,880
Yeah? What?

473
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,731
Her.

474
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,640
- Hey, David.
- Hey.

475
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,085
Can I come in?

476
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah, uh...

477
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,048
Jesus Christ.

478
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,164
Yeah. Sorry about... the mess.

479
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,320
I did some digging around like you asked.

480
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,084
Called in some favors.

481
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,289
Why don't you sit down?

482
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,128
She was lying to you.

483
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Okay.

484
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,880
She didn't go to school in Boulder.

485
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
She didn't grow up
in Salt Lake City, either.

486
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,400
Found no record of her parents there.

487
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,680
Why would Claire lie about that?

488
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,960
I mean, I'm looking into it,

489
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,044
but listen, this girl's fucked up.

490
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,920
You know, she was clearly
a part of something,

491
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,440
or she just wasn't
who you thought she was.

492
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,160
No, not really.

493
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,280
No, I paid for a lot of things,

494
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,251
but, you know,
she just didn't make that much.

495
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,280
Right.

496
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,000
Look, I think the best thing for you to do

497
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,800
is to put her out of your head, move on.

498
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,163
Uh... fucking cats.

499
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,760
It's just clumsy.

500
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,003
Hey, you know, thanks for your help.

501
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Look, if anything else pops up,

502
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,410
I'll let you know.

503
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,046
Hey, hey, hey.

504
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,083
Come on.

505
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,566
All right.

506
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,760
How do you know Claire?

507
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,440
I don't know her.

508
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,490
Why are you looking for her?

509
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,491
Open my shirt.

510
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,600
- What?
- Open my shirt.

511
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,411
You want to know why, open my shirt.

512
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,330
Pull it open.

513
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,326
There's two more in my stomach.

514
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,326
She didn't expect me to live.

515
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,960
No.

516
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,849
No, that's not right.

517
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,800
Claire couldn't...

518
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,121
Claire?

519
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,244
Eve is what she call herself.

520
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,400
It was my brother she was after.

521
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,120
He wasn't as lucky I was.

522
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,120
They met in a bar in Chicago.

523
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,880
He pick her up.

524
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,928
The Hotel Marlaina.

525
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,800
You know it?

526
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,724
Yeah. It's nice.

527
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,760
Also a good place to go

528
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,760
if you're looking to pick up
high-end whore.

529
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,649
And he was.

530
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,481
Not my brother's typical taste, but...

531
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,127
She put a knife in him.

532
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,801
Do you have any brothers?

533
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,283
What would you do if you found her?

534
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,561
What would you do?

535
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,520
My people are going to come
looking for me soon.

536
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,524
Good. Then they can cut you loose.

537
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,602
Oh. How much is this?

538
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,400
They're not going to be happy
with what you've done.

539
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,160
Well, maybe you can put in
a good word for me.

540
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,920
All right. What's your name?

541
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,890
- Aleksander.
- Aleksander.

542
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,720
I'm David.

543
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,723
Let's hope we never meet again.

544
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,409
One ticket to Vancouver, please.

545
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,800
Here we are. Lots of light.

546
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,609
- Mm.
- Just painted.

547
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,960
Yeah, it's, uh, it's wonderful.

548
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,283
Yeah, all these houses
were built in the '20s.

549
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,160
This one's 1916.

550
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,600
Bought this place and the one next door

551
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,200
about ten years ago, fixed 'em up.

552
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,726
Please, take a look around.

553
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,320
So, what do you think?

554
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,920
I like it.

555
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,760
- What are you doing?
- Here.

556
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,160
I'm just showing you how to do it right.

557
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,480
I like how I do it.

558
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,640
Yeah, but it's wrong.

559
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,000
It's not gonna look as good.

560
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,280
I know how to paint.

561
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,200
Mmm, I don't know if you do.

562
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,520
Oh? Gonna be an asshole?

563
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,760
Hey, I'm never an asshole.

564
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,520
Uh, right now you are.

565
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,524
Mmm, not really. I'm just kinda,
you know, being normal.

566
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,240
Well, agree to disagree, I guess.

567
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,800
Baby, we just have so much to do,

568
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,560
and the ceiling is gonna take forever.

569
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,400
You know what? I'll do the ceiling.

570
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,880
You just relax.

571
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,960
You're not going to do the ceiling.

572
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,240
Why not?

573
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,840
Because it's gonna be all messy and bad.

574
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,040
Like your wall, which... sucks.

575
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,320
You know what?

576
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,765
I'm gonna do the ceiling right now,

577
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,600
and it's gonna be incredible.

578
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,560
Okay. If you say so.

579
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,600
Yeah. Maybe you should go have a beer.

580
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,440
You're getting very worked up
about the paint job.

581
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,040
Hey.

582
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,320
Word. Great.

583
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,920
I'm all about that.

584
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,764
Yeah, yeah.

585
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,531
David, I'm done.

586
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,160
Wow.

587
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,520
That's, uh, that's beautiful.

588
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,410
♪ Ta da ♪

589
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,130
You mind?

590
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,130
This is gonna be hell to paint over.

591
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,600
- Tomorrow.
- Okay.

592
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,527
Gimme your hand.

593
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,408
I don't get it.

594
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,565
"Sarah?"

595
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,600
It's a joke.

596
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Isn't Sarah the name of the waitress

597
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,001
that you like at what's-it-called?

598
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,805
What? Sophie's?

599
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,520
- Is her name Sarah?
- Yeah, right?

600
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,000
It's a joke.

601
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,084
Ah, it's incredibly hilarious.

602
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,168
Much better.

603
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,170
Yeah.

604
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,806
So I got sort of a strange question.

605
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,440
Do you, uh,

606
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,040
recognize this guy?

607
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,724
You know who he is?

608
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,006
What's this about?

609
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,080
Well, I, um, I got these photos

610
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,680
off an old camera that I bought,

611
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,320
and I thought maybe I could
get them back to their rightful owner.

612
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,000
Any ideas?

613
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,520
That's Mr. Garan.

614
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,880
Mr. Garan. Does he work here?

615
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,200
He used to.

616
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,880
Mr. Garan passed five years ago.

617
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,280
He was a good man.

618
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,407
All right.

619
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,880
Well, I'm sorry to... Sorry to hear that.

620
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,645
Thank you.

621
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,889
Do you know, was he married?

622
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,880
Hello. My name is David.

623
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,600
Are you a reporter?

624
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,400
No, no, absolutely not.

625
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,640
Look, this is a little hard
to explain, but, um,

626
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,200
my girlfriend, she disappeared

627
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:14,280
a little over a year ago,
and ever since then I, um...

628
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,280
Look, I'm sorry. I just know that
she spent a lot of time here in Vancouver

629
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,240
before I knew her, and I know

630
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,760
that she was really interested
in your... in your husband.

631
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,200
Um, look, I'm just grasping
at straws here,

632
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,920
and I just...

633
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,844
Do you... Do you recognize her?

634
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,761
I met a lot of people with Richard.

635
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,360
- I'm sorry.
- Well, her name was...

636
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,640
I don't know her.

637
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,405
I'm very sorry. Good luck.

638
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,360
Agh! Aah!

639
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,800
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

640
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,248
No, stop! Stop! Please!

641
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,245
Oh...

642
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,440
Stop.

643
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,440
No, please! Help me!

644
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,680
Help me! No, no, no! Please!

645
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,720
Don't move. Get down on your knees.

646
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,450
Down on your knees.

647
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,644
Where are we going?

648
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,684
Get out.

649
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,165
David, how do you do? John Hall.

650
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,485
Thanks, guys.

651
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,607
I apologize. We must have frightened you.

652
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,000
What do you want?

653
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,280
I wanna talk to you.

654
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,964
And who the fuck are you?

655
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,363
I work for the government. Defense.

656
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,760
I tell ya...

657
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,880
I don't usually go in for this
nature shit, but God damn.

658
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,560
This is something, huh?

659
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,324
Take a look at that.

660
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,809
Makes your heart go.

661
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,169
Yeah, you're looking
for your ex-girlfriend.

662
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,360
You knew her, I guess?

663
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,965
Yes.

664
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,600
I'm here to answer
a few of your questions.

665
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,365
The ones I can, at least.
Give you some closure.

666
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,521
But none of this is gonna be easy, David.

667
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,405
Okay?

668
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,480
Claire worked for us
in a variety of capacities.

669
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,160
- Like what?
- Mmm.

670
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,926
It was required that she establish
a cover, a life,

671
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,883
one that would allow
for a great deal of travel,

672
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,367
one that wouldn't draw a lot of attention.

673
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,366
So, where is she?

674
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,040
July of last year,
she was called in for an assignment.

675
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,522
She was killed in action 36 hours later.

676
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,881
I'm sorry, David.

677
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,920
No.

678
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,040
See, you're lying.
That doesn't make sense.

679
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,249
I really am sorry to tell you.

680
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,720
Okay.

681
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,531
Okay, well, do you have any...

682
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,680
any proof, huh?

683
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,840
Of any of this?

684
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,925
I mean, you're so interested
in giving me closure.

685
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,120
Open this if you have to,
but I've seen what's inside,

686
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,960
and I wouldn't, if I were you.

687
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,690
I mean it.

688
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,723
We need you to stop
digging around her past, David.

689
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,240
She handled sensitive material.

690
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,880
Sensitive situations
that don't need stirring

691
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,724
by your inexpert hands.

692
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,927
It's dangerous. For you, for all of us.

693
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,920
Just let it go, okay?

694
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,005
You're still on the outside. Stay there.

695
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,731
I can't guarantee your safety otherwise.

696
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,046
Take your time.

697
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,091
Hey.

698
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,525
Babe.

699
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,970
Hey.

700
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,244
Hey, Claire.

701
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,040
Babe.

702
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,407
Babe. Let me in.

703
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,050
What's wrong?

704
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,570
Claire.

705
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,680
Answer me.

706
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,404
Claire, open the door.

707
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,690
Claire, open the door, please?

708
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,849
Cl... Claire.

709
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,241
Claire!

710
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,800
Hey. Hey, hey.

711
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,640
Oh. Ah, Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God, what happened?

712
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:51,080
I got mugged. I was stupid,
I... I tried to fight back.

713
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,520
No, no, no, no.

714
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,080
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

715
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,044
Come here. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

716
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,570
So, what was her name?

717
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,484
Was it Claire?

718
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,849
Can I ask you a question?

719
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,242
What brought you to Garan's house?

720
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,960
Just photos.

721
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,600
Old photos she had before I knew her.

722
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,040
Regular Philip Marlowe, am I right?

723
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,920
So, who was he?

724
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,684
You tell me.

725
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,240
Some rich venture capitalist?

726
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,480
That's right.

727
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,769
Weekends, he liked to put on a red hood,

728
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,080
convince discontented teens
to join the cause

729
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,650
of white supremacy.

730
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,760
He put enough cash in the right pockets

731
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,000
to keep that fact secret.

732
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,051
So what, you just... had him killed?

733
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,411
Richard Garan died of a heart attack.

734
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,560
Oh, yeah.

735
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,120
I had a run in with some
Columbian mercenaries

736
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,960
a couple years back.

737
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,441
More metal than man at this point.

738
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,840
That must've been a long recovery.

739
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,120
Oof. Two years physical therapy

740
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,400
before I stopped walking like
a zombie from those bad movies.

741
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,440
What, were you, like, on crutches

742
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,240
for a while or something?

743
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,401
A cane.

744
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,240
You said you have those photos
on your computer?

745
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,720
You mind if I take a look?

746
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,245
Did I say that?

747
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,886
Yeah. You mind if I take a look?

748
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,481
No, um...

749
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,804
Thanks.

750
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,969
Hmm.

751
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,520
I'm asking myself, "Why is he
so interested in my rehab?"

752
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,003
But I realize you haven't been
completely honest with me, have you?

753
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,840
David...

754
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,127
Where are the negatives?

755
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,807
No. Really?

756
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,440
Son of a bitch.

757
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,160
It's amazing how things change so quick.

758
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,722
What was it, a minute ago,
80 seconds tops,

759
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,080
you made that comment about
my leg and tipped your hand.

760
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,760
You were gonna go home, live a life,

761
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,560
meet a girl probably, have a couple kids.

762
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,560
She's still alive.

763
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,529
Hmm?

764
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,000
She's alive. Isn't she?

765
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,243
She's dead.

766
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,201
Take this left.

767
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,806
Where'd you get that?

768
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,960
Let me out.

769
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,480
Here. Pull over.

770
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,961
No, don't. Don't pull over, Michael.

771
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,000
What a mess.

772
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,243
Nothing's gone as I intended,
not one thing.

773
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,491
Hey.

774
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,128
Hey.

775
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,167
I tried you at the darkroom.

776
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,280
I had my headphones on.

777
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,442
Mmm. How was it?

778
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,806
It was fine.

779
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,440
Did you bring anything back?

780
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,520
No.

781
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,161
There wasn't anything good enough to save.

782
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,244
Is something wrong?

783
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,001
I'm just tired.

784
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,649
And that's the end of it.

785
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,451
Just tired, David.

786
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,608
What, you wanna have
a whole conversation about that?

787
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,880
I just haven't seen you all day.

788
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,720
I was working.

789
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,400
No, I, uh, I know.

790
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,040
You've been working every night

791
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,088
for the past three weeks.

792
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,360
I haven't seen you.

793
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,800
I'm sorry that I wanna have
a conversation with you when I do.

794
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,560
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
that I wanna sleep when I'm tired.

795
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,280
Wow, you're being such a bitch right now.

796
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,200
What?

797
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,920
Fuck you.

798
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,604
Hey.

799
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:08,320
Hey, does this have to do
with what happened?

800
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,200
What are you talking about?
Does what have to do with it?

801
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,720
The fact that you won't speak to me.

802
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,680
That you're a million miles away

803
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,360
and I can't bring you back.

804
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,600
Don't be such a drama queen.

805
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,240
I'm right here.

806
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,005
Then why does it feel like
as close as I get to you,

807
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,720
- I'm not even...
- I don't know, David.

808
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,440
Maybe I'm broken that way.
Maybe it's impossible.

809
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,842
It sure fucking seems like it, Claire.

810
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,520
Yeah, well...

811
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,960
I'm glad that we figured that out.

812
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,407
I'm gonna go to sleep.

813
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,329
All right.

814
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,726
Good night.

815
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,240
Can I help you?

816
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,200
Hi, um...

817
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,600
I was wondering if I could talk
to you for a minute.

818
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,000
Okay.

819
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,650
It's about Dana.

820
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,048
Have a seat.

821
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,605
Thanks.

822
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,280
Oh, did you get married?

823
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,040
Yeah. Elise.

824
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,120
Year ago next week.

825
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,080
So...

826
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,245
So... you and Dana.

827
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,560
She went missing five years ago?

828
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,400
Yeah. Vanished.

829
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,164
You two were happy?

830
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,720
I don't know.

831
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,920
I thought we were.

832
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,600
What are you getting at?

833
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,760
I'm sorry.

834
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,920
I met her

835
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,641
about four years ago.

836
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,523
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

837
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,240
Is she, uh...

838
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,240
She's gone.

839
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,960
It was a bad car accident.

840
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,883
It was about a year ago.

841
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,888
And ever since then, I...

842
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,608
started looking into her past,
which led me to you.

843
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,920
And I just thought
that you'd want to know,

844
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,800
just so you could stop looking

845
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,962
in case you were.

846
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,560
Yeah.

847
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,291
Fuck, I'm...

848
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,920
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't...

849
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,360
I didn't expect to be
thinking about this today.

850
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,922
She talk about me?

851
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,491
She didn't tell me much about her past.

852
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,083
Sounds like her.

853
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,680
I did look for her for a while,

854
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,206
but who walks out like that?

855
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,280
Maybe I was an asshole? I think about it.

856
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,520
I think maybe I... Maybe I was
a little too hard on her.

857
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:32,040
She just... You know,
we just weren't a good match.

858
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,690
Doesn't mean you walk out, though.

859
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,040
You don't let a person wonder,

860
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,720
even if she hated me.

861
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,087
She didn't.

862
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,880
I'm certain she loved you.

863
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,531
You can't fake that.

864
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,890
Well, this is all I have.

865
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,690
Dana took those.

866
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,320
Well, listen, I appreciate you coming,

867
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,760
but I should get to work.

868
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,410
Of course, yeah.

869
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,840
Hey, Charlie.

870
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,888
This guy here.

871
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,600
That's Kyle.

872
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,080
That's Dana's friend from home.

873
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,600
That's Kyle.

874
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,080
You two stay in touch?

875
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,480
I mean, not really since she left.

876
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,160
We talked a few times, but you know.

877
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:48,531
You got a number for him?
I'd like to reach out.

878
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,600
Hey, Kyle. Or Buck.

879
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,960
Or whatever the fuck your name is.

880
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,120
This is David Larraine.

881
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,647
Yeah, I got your number,
fuckshit, and, hey, listen,

882
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,680
you know that thing you were
looking for at my place?

883
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,640
Well, guess what? I have it.

884
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,600
If you want it, you're gonna meet me

885
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,960
on the southwest corner
of Blake and Van Nuys

886
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,960
the morning of the sixth, 3:00 a.m.

887
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,480
Come alone, and, I don't know,

888
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,520
bring a million dollars with you.

889
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,480
If not, these pictures
are going everywhere,

890
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,040
and I have a feeling if that happens,

891
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,160
you're gonna wind up in a ditch someplace.

892
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,280
Am I right?

893
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,566
See you Friday.

894
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,960
- Hello?
- Hey, Aleksander. This is David Larraine.

895
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,400
If you wanna know where Eve is.

896
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,560
I'm meeting her at 3:00 a.m.

897
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,405
She'll be in a black SUV parked in a lot

898
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,680
on the south side of Van Nuys
just east of Blake.

899
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,081
She's all yours.

900
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,324
What the fuck is this?

901
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,640
Shit.

902
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,160
Where is she?

903
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,522
- David?
- Throw your phone in the gutter

904
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,320
and head up Van Nuys,
enter the parking structure.

905
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,680
On the left, there'll be a car parked

906
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,320
with its door open.

907
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,800
Get in.

908
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:42,000
I want to be left alone. Okay?

909
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,440
I will go away,

910
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,320
and you will never hear from me again.

911
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,560
I have what you're looking for,

912
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,560
but you're never gonna find it.

913
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:55,760
If I die, everybody finds it.

914
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,600
That's not how this works.

915
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,920
How does it work?

916
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,200
You are just a scared guy

917
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,760
that threw me in the back
of a blacked-out Beemer.

918
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,120
We're something else.

919
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,520
We're a different category of person.

920
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,400
You wanna keep those pictures
as an insurance policy?

921
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,280
People like I work for can't live
with that in this world.

922
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,840
If I die, they get out.

923
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,680
To who, David? Hmm?

924
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,040
You haven't thought this through.

925
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,770
The New York Times?

926
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,040
They won't know what the fuck they are.

927
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,920
I'm sorry, David.

928
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,120
Sarah was a threat.
You are just a loose end.

929
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,240
And there is a bullet
coming your way right now.

930
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,448
It is cutting through this world,

931
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,880
and it can only end up in one place.

932
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,880
No.

933
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,120
I'll find a way.

934
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,560
You underestimate me, Buck.

935
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,800
You have every step of the way.

936
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,600
Mm, no, not this time.

937
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,047
Smart, blacking out the windows,

938
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,240
no one can see in.

939
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,560
Trouble is, you can't see out, either.

940
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,440
You have no idea what's coming.

941
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,960
- Out of the car! Get out of the car!
- Hand in the air!

942
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,327
One the ground! Don't move!

943
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,885
Are you mad?

944
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,804
Come here.

945
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,524
Have I really been a million miles away?

946
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,089
Mm-hmm.

947
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,242
I got lost.

948
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,240
It happens now and then.

949
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,000
Okay.

950
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,527
But you can't leave me out there, though.

951
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,842
You gotta bring me back.

952
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,048
I always will.

953
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,404
Promise?

954
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,524
No matter what.

955
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,089
David. We meet again.

956
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,611
Where's the film?

957
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,324
I'm not going to tell you.

958
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:02,680
Okay. That's what I thought you'd say.

959
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,880
I'm gonna send a man in here.

960
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,040
It's his job to get information

961
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,880
from reluctant sources.

962
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,720
Usually he's working
with trained operatives

963
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,040
who've been prepared for such treatment

964
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,248
and who believe if they
give up the information,

965
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,520
it will cost many of their
countrymen their lives,

966
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:24,083
not to mention compromise
their own place in the afterlife.

967
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,920
You, on the other hand,

968
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,680
are protecting the whereabouts
of a roll of film,

969
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,843
the significance of which
you don't understand,

970
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,880
for a dead girl who lied to you,

971
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,281
used you, and made a fool of you.

972
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,000
Anyway, I'm gonna walk out.

973
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,120
He's gonna come in, and in a few minutes

974
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,400
he's gonna leave with what he came for.

975
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:53,329
Or you could tell me now,
spare yourself the discomfort.

976
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,044
All right.

977
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,280
You're very brave, David.

978
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,640
I admire that. Truly.

979
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,409
Thanks for coming.

980
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,887
David? My name's David.

981
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,809
Where's the film?

982
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,567
I don't... I don't have it.

983
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,800
Where's the film?

984
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,040
I don't have it.
I don't have it. I don't...

985
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:48,760
Please, please, stop! Stop! Stop!

986
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,923
Where's the film?

987
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,241
Stop! St...

988
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,080
What's going on?

989
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,447
Do not move!

990
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,683
David.

991
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,880
What did he do to you?

992
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,530
Where have you been?

993
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,770
Why did they do this?

994
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,040
I came looking for you.

995
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,240
I just got so close.

996
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,840
How?

997
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:10,320
The film in the garden.

998
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,890
Your film.

999
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,131
Where is it?

1000
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,560
Home.

1001
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,085
It's at our home.

1002
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,760
- We have to get out of here.
- Wait, wait.

1003
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,320
David, there's no time for that.

1004
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,760
We gotta go.

1005
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,969
You can use one of these? Come on.

1006
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,920
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1007
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,286
Come on.

1008
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,001
Jesus Christ.

1009
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,080
Damn it. Shit.

1010
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,801
We gotta get out of here. Get out!

1011
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,763
Shit.

1012
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,563
Stay here.

1013
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,283
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1014
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,443
Get off the bike. Off the bike.

1015
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:45,246
Get out of here, come on.
Come on, let's go.

1016
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,644
Where is it, David? The film?

1017
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,169
In the mail.

1018
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,200
Well, that's not good.

1019
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,680
What is it?

1020
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,280
It's proof that Hall had been turned.

1021
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,691
It was...

1022
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,884
This was my only protection.

1023
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,800
- Claire...
- We have to get out of here.

1024
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:06,760
Claire. Wait. Stop.

1025
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,720
- They'll be looking for us...
- Stop.

1026
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,280
I haven't seen you.

1027
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,840
Are you hurt?

1028
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,000
- Where? David?
- Oh.

1029
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,880
David. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

1030
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,806
Who are you?

1031
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:40,561
I'm a lot of different people.

1032
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,840
I looked for you.

1033
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,000
I know.

1034
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,800
I didn't think you'd understand.

1035
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,247
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

1036
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:57,080
If you come with me,

1037
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,049
we can never, ever come back.

1038
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,286
Stay here.

1039
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,120
Shit.

1040
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,204
- What?
- We're surrounded.

1041
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,727
So, what do we do now?

1042
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,125
We fight.

1043
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:31,687
Hey. Look at that.

1044
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,643
I didn't know you could still see it.

1045
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,884
Me, neither.

1046
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:48,286
Hey. Where we gonna go?

1047
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,320
Anywhere you want.

1048
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,720
Well, I wanna go someplace warm,

1049
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,160
somewhere I've never been.

1050
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,760
Far away?

1051
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,200
Yeah.

1052
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,521
When?

1053
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,720
Let's go right now.

1054
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,691
Hall's men are out back.
Aleksander's are out front.

1055
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,326
What do you think our best chances are?

1056
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,080
Not good either way.

1057
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,401
All right.

1058
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,400
You choose.

1059
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,760
No, you.

1060
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,760
Okay, fine.

1061
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,684
Um... South America?

1062
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,560
Are we really gonna do this?

1063
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,000
Yes.

1064
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,760
We have to.

1065
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,009
Okay.

1066
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,404
Ready?

1067
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:04,480
On three.

1068
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,440
Hey, babe?

1069
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,600
I love you.

1070
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,440
Hey.

1071
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:13,080
Let's live.

1072
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,810
Yeah.

1073
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,800
- Okay.
- Ready?

1074
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:22,850
One, two, three.

1074
01:46:23,305 --> 01:47:23,263

2
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,891
Fuck.

3
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,829
<i>I race the sun
home in the morning...</i>

4
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,064
<i>and the moon up at night.</i>

5
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,970
<i>There's just today,</i>

6
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:18,340
<i>and then there's tonight.</i>

7
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:22,778
<i>Anything can happen,</i>

8
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,846
<i>then anything does.</i>

9
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:29,251
<i>Get through it.</i>

10
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:34,389
You've got 10 minutes to get out of my
house before my sisters get up for school.

11
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:41,463
I-I-It's some
Jewish people holiday.

12
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:45,134
Ain't no school.
Then you got five minutes.

13
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:49,704
Yeah?

14
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:00,415
All right.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,196
<i>I ain't seen this one before.</i>

16
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:23,038
<i>He probably won't kill me.</i>
<i>It ain't happened yet.</i>

17
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:45,894
<i>But it's like when people tell</i>
<i>you that their dog doesn't bite.</i>

18
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:48,197
<i>How do they know?</i>

19
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:05,314
<i>Oh, and nobody's coming</i>
<i>to save my ass.</i>

20
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:08,217
<i>It took me a minute to get that.</i>

21
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:12,321
<i>The man in the white hat,</i>
<i>the man on the white horse--</i>

22
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:16,358
<i>yeah, he ain't coming.</i>

23
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:47,089
<i>I remember when I was 10 somebody
gave me a diary for a present,</i>

24
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:50,192
<i>and I felt like
it was too late...</i>

25
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,029
<i>so I didn't write in it.</i>

26
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:56,131
<i>Too much had already happened.</i>

27
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:02,837
<i>So it wouldn't be
the whole story.</i>

28
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,740
<i>I feel that way again,</i>

29
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,709
<i>and I'm 14.</i>

30
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,147
<i>But nobody'd believe it.</i>

31
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,552
<i>Ain't nobody to tell.</i>

32
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:22,558
<i>If a girl falls in the city
and nobody sees it,</i>

33
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,196
<i>did it happen?</i>

34
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,502
Get up.

35
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,572
<i>Shit.</i>

36
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:41,010
Get up.

37
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:43,312
<i>Is it cold?</i>

38
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,348
Not really.
Wash your face, stinky.

39
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,195
Where's
your little sister?

40
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:18,247
Sheila's.

41
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,517
What?

42
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:24,486
That's where she's at.
Who?

43
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,355
Cammie.

44
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:29,325
I asked you that,
like, an hour ago.

45
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,059
Yeah, well,
she's at Sheila's.

46
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,363
Even though Sheila's mom says
she can't stay there no more...

47
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,299
'cause she can't afford to
feed seven kids, only six.

48
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,901
Like,
what's the big whoop?

49
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:43,505
But Cammie keeps going over
there every day after school,

50
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:46,007
and by the time Sheila's mom gets home
from her second job at the dog track--

51
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,909
lame--

52
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:51,046
she doesn't have enough energy to wake
Cammie up and kick her out in the street.

53
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:55,016
Cammie's fuckin' little.
She don't take up that much room.

54
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,985
Yeah, but she eats up
all their food.

55
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:58,987
Good for her.
Maybe she'll grow.

56
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,823
What are you gonna do
today?

57
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:03,925
Nothin'.

58
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:07,463
Well,
deliver these papers.

59
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,665
Go bum food
at Kelly's mom's.

60
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,569
Oh, and I got this book report on
a book I probably read in utero.

61
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,739
And play my sax.

62
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:20,742
How 'bout take a bath?

63
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,944
Mom here?
Yeah.

64
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,946
Then no.

65
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,638
Hey, Bee!
Wait up!

66
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:51,473
You coming back?

67
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,642
You making breakfast?

68
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,611
I could make
macaroni and cheese,

69
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:59,047
although we don't make
any milk or any butter.

70
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:01,549
Orange-water macaroni?

71
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:04,419
I found some nacho cheese
Doritos from last night.

72
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,857
I can smash 'em up in
the bowl with water and--

73
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:08,114
Nah.
That doesn't work.

74
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:10,158
- It kinda does.
- Not!

75
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:13,729
- Does.
- I'd rather eat dirt.

76
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,997
One hour.

77
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,967
One hour, queer bait.

78
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:22,370
<i>Bee poured out
all the liquor in the house once.</i>

79
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,506
<i>That went over real well.</i>

80
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,697
<i>He kissed me...</i>

81
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,767
<i>about a week ago.</i>

82
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,495
Are you breaking into
people's houses now?

83
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:36,731
Fuck you.

84
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,835
I was rollin' bones
behind Ju-Ju's.

85
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:43,471
Them niggers
don't know how to act.

86
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,406
Well, you tell 'em.

87
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:47,809
You win, at least?

88
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:52,347
I rolled hard eights for an
hour straight, little girl.

89
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,816
You didn't answer
my question.

90
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:57,752
I'm tryin' to told you.

91
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,854
You just didn't heard me.

92
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:06,528
You count it.

93
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,852
<i>And I kissed him back.</i>

94
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:46,000
Here, my girl.
Supposed to start shootin' folks now?

95
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:49,471
If you want to.
Who would you shoot first?

96
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,806
You.

97
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:54,542
What's the matter?
Don't like McDonald's no more?

98
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,444
I'm gonna eat it.

99
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:59,314
Don't worry about it
wit' your black ass.

100
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,951
You got jokes.

101
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,422
Three hundred and--
Eighty-two dollars.

102
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:12,026
Man, them niggers shouldn't mess
with the kid. Think they slick.

103
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,962
What day is today?

104
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,632
<i>Well, it used to be
called Monday,</i>

105
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:21,135
but after the rebirth
of the cool tonight--

106
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:23,071
Uh, no.

107
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,139
after the rain falls down
like a mighty river--

108
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:29,310
Calm down, reverend. I got it.
You got a game tonight.

109
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,412
<i>A game?</i>

110
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,581
Baby, don't you
read the papers?

111
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,951
This is the ladies'
conference championship...

112
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,789
in the guise of an ass-whippin'
of biblical proportions.

113
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:49,931
Calm your narrow ass down.

114
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:57,204
I read about you
in the papers, girl.

115
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:59,206
What did it say?

116
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:02,144
That you love me.

117
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:04,112
And?

118
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:13,722
And that you was fixin' to open a can of
whup-ass on the basketball court tonight.

119
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:15,890
<i>So you can read.</i>

120
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,062
Do you still love me?

121
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:25,133
Of course I do.

122
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:34,342
What's goin' on
with the freaks?

123
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,383
I kicked some big-headed nigger
out of here a little while ago.

124
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:44,385
Alfred.

125
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,587
I didn't ask him
his name.

126
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,222
Tommy.

127
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,425
<i>I don't know. I never saw him before.
What?</i>

128
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,561
You deaf too?
I said, I never saw him before.

129
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:55,730
Oh, hell, no.

130
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:59,100
This double-trick bitch
owes somebody some money.

131
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,207
Sarah!

132
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:09,144
Hey, baby.
Get your ugly ass up, bitch.

133
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:12,446
I was waiting for you.
You got my fuckin' money?

134
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,665
I don't wanna hear shit, bitch.
What, you drink supper?

135
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:15,842
And open a fuckin' window!

136
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,752
Smells like
somebody's ass!

137
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,286
What the fuck you think this is?
You know I don't play games.

138
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:20,947
Oh, come on!

139
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,457
Bitch!

140
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:25,727
<i>I don't want no
part of what goes on in there.</i>

141
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,896
Yeah, that's right, ho.

142
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:31,399
Shut the fuck up.

143
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,936
<i>But I sure do like being kissed.</i>

144
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:48,750
$442.

145
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,057
You ain't gon' eat it?

146
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:59,427
I don't give a fuck
about no Egg McMuffin.

147
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,429
Suit yourself, little girl.

148
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,524
Cammie. Cammie?

149
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,931
Mama says
you gotta go.

150
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,635
Fuck.

151
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:43,337
What time is it?
Don't matter.

152
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,774
Mama says
you gotta go.

153
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:54,448
- Go, go, go! Do it! Do it!
- Ray!

154
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,550
Home! Home! Home!

155
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:00,688
I got it!

156
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:02,991
Ray!

157
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:17,038
Jesus! What's going on?

158
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:20,008
Hey, y'all
better stop playin'!

159
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:22,577
Mama!
Mike hit me!

160
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:26,238
Goddamn it, what
the hell's going on?

320
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:13,394
Mother of God! Lord Jesus
fuckin' Christ almighty!

321
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:15,863
Somebody shut the door!

322
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:19,199
<i>White girl! Is you deaf?
See to the door!</i>

323
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:22,169
Okay, Stymie. Geez!

324
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,514
"No time ago
or else a life,

325
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:51,385
"walking in the dark
I met Christ.

326
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:53,453
"Jesus.

327
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:56,957
"My heart flopped over and
lie still while he passed.

328
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,694
"As close
as I am to you,

329
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:02,863
"yes, closer,

330
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:06,066
made of nothing
except loneliness."

331
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:44,705
Come on, light for me, baby.
Hey, Popeye!

332
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:47,341
How you doin' this fine day?
Shit!

333
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:50,143
Oh, fair to middlin'.

334
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:53,079
Let me light this one cancer
stick, and I will be golden.

335
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:55,716
How you doin', big girl?

336
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:58,284
I'm fine too.

337
00:30:58,353 --> 00:31:00,153
Hey, Meatball.
Hey.

338
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,155
Fixin' to move.

339
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:04,190
Say what?

340
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:07,027
I was just sayin', 'cause you might
not be seeing me around much more...

341
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:09,195
and I didn't want you
to worry.

342
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:11,064
Wait, wait, wait.

343
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,834
You, your mama,
your sisters,

344
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:18,005
<i>a pimp, the Poker House and the
hooker live up in the garage?</i>

345
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,273
Where are y'all
fixin' to move to?

346
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,208
No! Just me.

347
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:24,077
I'm moving.

348
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:26,112
Oh.
How you gon' do that?

349
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,214
Well, I talked
to my school counselor,

350
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:30,283
and he talked to
Child Services,

351
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,319
and they say they gon' put me
in a foster house.

352
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:36,724
A foster house, huh?
Yeah, a big one over on the north side.

353
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,193
'Cause you know only them rich
folk can afford foster kids.

354
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:40,848
Mm-hmm.

355
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:43,221
My brother's kids got
took to a foster house.

356
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:45,265
Old man
fucked every one of 'em.

357
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,268
Forget you, Meatball!
That's a fib.

358
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:51,672
Well, anyways,
I'm waitin' to hear from 'em.

359
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:53,874
These things
take time.

360
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,043
Damn, big girl.

361
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,712
You think you can get me one
of them new foster houses?

362
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,615
You're too old.
You have bad habits.

363
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:08,221
Goddamn it!
Uh-huh! See?

364
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:11,257
You're apin' and clownin', and you
done dropped your damn bottle.

365
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:13,159
Fuck you, Popeye.

366
00:32:13,227 --> 00:32:15,996
What I done told you about
cussin' at me, junior?

367
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:18,131
I will cut your ass
in half...

368
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,768
and hide the knife
in your big ass.

369
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,636
You gonna cut me in half?
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:25,672
Hey, Popeye, what you got?
You got yourself a chain saw?

371
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,944
Didn't know it was gon'
be like this, did ya?

372
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,167
This is a killin' knife!

373
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,177
<i>Killin' knife?
Yeah!</i>

374
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:32,136
Who you killed lately?

375
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:34,873
Ain't killed nobody in years,
but I'm 'bout to start today.

376
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:38,452
Come on. Here's your target.
You see this move? I can do this move.

377
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,421
What you do now?
Come on and get a little piece of this.

378
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:44,925
You want some of me? Here's a target
for you, Popeye! Come on, buddy!

379
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:47,327
You don't want nothin'
about me, baby.

380
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:50,030
I'm a crazy motherfucker.

381
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,643
Fuck every-fuckin'-body.

382
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,386
Good morning.

383
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:05,804
La-La and them liked
to got my ass busted.

384
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:09,683
I told that bitch not to fuck around,
but she wanna go start some shit.

385
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:11,752
This should do you
till the first.

386
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:14,261
I told her, don't go in
there messin' with Darryl.

387
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:15,914
She tellin' me she
can handle it.

388
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,658
Talkin' 'bout,
"I can handle it."

389
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:21,161
I'm tellin' her,
"No, you can't handle it neither."

390
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,836
Look at you.
You look like Chaka Khan.

391
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:31,071
Only you little,

392
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:33,073
and you ain't got
no ass.

393
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,276
- Your mama here?
- She's asleep.

394
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:39,546
- Duval come around this morning?
- Yep.

395
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:41,281
He say he was
looking for me?

396
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:43,583
Nope.

397
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:46,086
<i>- Ooh!
- What?</i>

398
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,356
Oh, man alive!

399
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:51,291
Needs titties, baby girl.

400
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,895
Look in there
for some boots I got ya.

401
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:57,064
I'm going to bed.

402
00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:00,567
What happened to La-la?

403
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:03,037
She in department store jail.

404
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:06,907
And that's just what she get for messin'
with Darryl, gettin' in his face.

405
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:07,622
What?

406
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:10,235
La-La standin' in the middle of
the motherfuckin' parking lot.

407
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:12,245
Arms full of stolen shit.

408
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:14,918
Questionin' Darryl about who
the fuck he was with and when.

409
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:15,941
Get the fuck out!

410
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:19,519
Darryl blew his little whistle and
they came and got that bitch.

411
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:22,622
I tried to talk to her, but
she wasn't havin' none of it.

412
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,058
Thinks she knows
so goddamn much.

413
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,360
Well, she handlin' it now.
Fuck her.

414
00:34:27,428 --> 00:34:30,396
And I ain't going to
bail the bitch out neither.

415
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:33,933
Me go to jail on purpose.
That's just stupid on top of stupid.

416
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,635
If Duval comes
sniffin' around here,

417
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:39,239
you tell him I'll get with him
when I get with him.

418
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:41,241
And don't knock on my door.

419
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:43,243
I'm really, really tired.

420
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:02,595
He's late.

421
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:04,597
How you know
he's late?

422
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:06,599
You ain't got
no watch.

423
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,535
I know 'cause I know.

424
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:10,537
Yeah.

425
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:13,907
Here he comes.

426
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:16,143
You know, he own
this whole block.

427
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:19,712
Worst raggedy-ass block
I ever been on.

428
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:23,283
That's how come he's rich.
He saves up all his money.

429
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,686
Well, if that's rich livin',
I don't want no part of it.

430
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:29,756
Looks like your master
plan's workin' out there!

431
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:34,694
Now, why you want me to cut
you so goddamn bad, huh?

432
00:35:34,762 --> 00:35:37,864
With what, them little lady
tweezers you got there?

433
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:40,334
Lady tweezers?
That's what the hell I got--

434
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:43,636
Shut up, you ugly ape!
Uh, good morning, Mr. Goldstein.

435
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:45,638
Morning, Popeye.

436
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,707
What time is it?

437
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:50,643
Time to go to work.
Sure is!

438
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,849
Like a whole lot of--
Hey! No cuts!

439
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,818
Ladies first,
huh?

440
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:03,957
You know you're just a
girl underneath all that.

441
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,526
Shut your ass up.
You a little boy.

442
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,736
Okay, so that's, uh--

443
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:19,840
- One dollar and 50 cents.
- One dollar and 50 cents. Very good.

444
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:22,075
Okay.

445
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:31,218
Aw, damn, baby girl.
Come on. Hurry up, now.

446
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:33,520
She can take her time.

447
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:42,496
So, that do it then, Bee?

448
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,499
- Yeah, I think so.

449
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:48,001
All right.
Thank you very much, Bee.

450
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:50,237
I will see you
in the morning.

451
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:54,341
Good Lord willing and the creek don't
rise, I'll see you in the morning too.

452
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:57,443
Uh, okay.

453
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,547
Next.

454
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:05,852
There you go. Uh-huh.

455
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,421
Popeye.

456
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,789
Molly Pitcher's Muscatel,
baby.

457
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:17,597
Goldfish
are so delicious.

458
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:19,533
Only in here though.

459
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:22,382
Sometimes I'll take 'em home
in my pocket and eat 'em,

460
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,329
but they didn't taste
good like this.

461
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:27,440
Know why they
call 'em Goldfish?

462
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:29,442
'Cause long ago boys
in college fraternities,

463
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,512
they'd eat real, live, swimmin'
goldfish with scary eyes...

464
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,548
on a dare--
a double dog dare.

465
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,486
And they'd have to do it, or else
they'd be killed by their teachers.

466
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:44,124
We can eat Goldfish, too, except they
aren't alive and they're good for ya.

467
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:46,059
Like some?

468
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:48,487
That's sweet, little girl,
but I don't eat that shit.

469
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:49,955
It makes the scotch taste funny.

470
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:54,034
Dolly, ain't you got
no Tony Tiger or Colonel Crunch?

471
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,871
This little girl 'bout to bust a gut
fuckin' with these 'plorable things.

472
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:05,779
I eat the head first.

473
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:07,381
Why, you ask?

474
00:38:07,448 --> 00:38:09,682
So they don't bite ya.

475
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,518
It's kinda sad though,

476
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,920
leave a pile of tails
and all.

477
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:18,157
Did you know goldfish
can eat themselves to death?

478
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:20,594
It's true, it's true!
I wouldn't lie.

479
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:23,796
If you feed 'em enough,
they'll eat and eat until they explode.

480
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:25,798
For real!

481
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:30,237
I'd like to see that, even though
it would be real sad though.

482
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:34,374
Here.
Two packs of Valiants, lady.

483
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:52,425
He's a bad boy.

484
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:16,583
<i>Never called nobody father.</i>

485
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,851
<i>Why bother?</i>

486
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,920
<i>When you left...</i>

487
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:23,623
<i>you took God with you.</i>

488
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,094
<i>Never met no preacher
who wasn't tryin' to reach her,</i>

489
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:31,764
<i>sellin' heaven,
takin' your sin...</i>

490
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,633
<i>home with him.</i>

491
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,871
<i>Saw some funny hats though...</i>

492
00:39:40,408 --> 00:39:42,342
<i>when they made the new pope,</i>

493
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,511
<i>giving the sheep hope.</i>

494
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:49,282
<i>Never called nobody father.</i>

495
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,885
<i>Why bother?</i>

496
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:54,087
<i>Ain't no reverends.</i>

497
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:56,756
<i>Anyway, revered ones...</i>

498
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:00,092
<i>pimpin' the little ones...</i>

499
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,395
<i>who need God to be true.</i>

500
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:04,730
<i>Ain't no end
to what they'll do.</i>

501
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:10,970
<i>When you leave,
take God with you.</i>

502
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,802
Agnes, it's not funny!
You scared the shit out of me!

503
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:45,438
I thought you was a car
or something!

504
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:48,741
That's what you get for hanging out at
this spooky house. It's got spooks in it.

505
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,446
You liked to gave me
a heart attack.

506
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:56,116
<i>A heart attack?
You're 12, Einstein.</i>

507
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:58,117
Yeah, but...

508
00:40:58,185 --> 00:41:00,186
people have been
scared to death...

509
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:01,887
by fear!

510
00:41:01,956 --> 00:41:05,292
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Okay, I'm sorry.

511
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,797
Go on now. The coast is clear.
Ain't nobody up at home.

512
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:13,733
Cry-baby.

513
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,935
It's not funny, Agnes!
It's not funny at all!

514
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:19,473
You could've been a truck or a bus
or a tree branch or somethin'!

515
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,342
Well, what are you
waitin' for, a bus?

516
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,444
Go on now.

517
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,418
Not funny. Stop.

518
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:43,563
I'm sorry.
I love you. Bye.

519
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:47,534
I love you too.

520
00:43:30,304 --> 00:43:34,173
News flash! I just made Bee poop in her
pants in front of the spooky house.

521
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:36,909
This is front-page stuff, people.
Get it while it's hot.

522
00:43:36,977 --> 00:43:39,479
<i>- Hi, Agnes!
- Hey, Agnes!</i>

523
00:43:39,546 --> 00:43:42,782
Rowena?
Hi, foxy lady.

524
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,285
Pinkish fuchsia!
Thank you!

525
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:47,954
You got it.
Hey, Petey! Hey, Bob!

526
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:51,825
Spell it backwards. Spell it forward!
It spells the same thing--Bob!

527
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:55,862
Mr. Jefferies, a legend in his own behind.
I'm fine, just fine.

528
00:43:55,996 --> 00:43:58,465
Nice suit. You look
just like a Milk Dud.

529
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:00,400
Well,
thank you, honey!

530
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:02,201
What are you doing here,
Mr. Jefferies?

531
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:06,539
I've told you a thousand times.
You're a hundred. Go home.

532
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:08,675
What are you, nuts?

533
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:11,511
They need me here.
I'm the only one that knows stuff.

534
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:14,046
Give me that.

535
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:20,019
Why do you think they
call me Mr. Everything?

536
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:24,357
That's right. 'Cause I've
done every job in this room.

537
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:27,661
Go ahead. Ask me somethin'.
I'll ask you somethin'.

538
00:44:27,728 --> 00:44:30,496
Well, go ahead then. Shoot.
Okay.

539
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:33,132
Where's the man?

540
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,968
Bingo!

541
00:44:35,035 --> 00:44:38,338
He's at Command Central.
He's looking for Japs.

542
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:40,674
Thanks, Mr. Jefferies.

543
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:43,242
Anytime, kiddo.

544
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:47,279
All right,
let's have it.

545
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:49,649
Hold your horses.
Gee.

546
00:44:53,487 --> 00:44:56,589
"A." "A"--

547
00:44:56,657 --> 00:44:58,725
It's all A's.

548
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,760
I guess we'll
have to keep you.

549
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:03,463
Ah, you can keep it.
I'll make more.

550
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,631
My dear wife reminded me
this morning...

551
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,100
that you haven't been
by the house lately.

552
00:45:08,168 --> 00:45:12,171
Do you require a written invitation
to come back by for dinner?

553
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:14,106
I guess
I've been busy.

554
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:18,011
I could come by the house,
pick you up one Saturday night.

555
00:45:18,078 --> 00:45:21,514
Wouldn't want to interfere with your
studies during the week, you know.

556
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:24,851
Well, I got basketball
and chores and stuff.

557
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:27,720
How are you faring with the Rimbaud?
I like him.

558
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:29,856
I like that
e.e. cummings guy too.

559
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:32,592
We got the same birthday.

560
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,062
Rimbaud's dead.

561
00:45:36,129 --> 00:45:38,197
Yes.
Yes, he is.

562
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:40,066
And he was a homo.

563
00:45:41,168 --> 00:45:44,336
Is there anything else
I can assist you with?

564
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:46,740
Yeah. It's payday.
Pay me!

565
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:48,708
Right you are.
Payday it is.

566
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:51,744
Go see Rowena
in Accounting.

567
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:53,746
You mean that desk
right there?

568
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:55,848
Oh, protocol, Agnes.
Protocol!

569
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,850
Without rules of behavior,
the world's a--

570
00:45:57,918 --> 00:46:00,319
Yeah, this place
is crawling with anarchists.

571
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:03,422
<i>You have been reading.
That's very good.</i>

572
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,925
Oh, pay the girl.
Criminies!

573
00:46:08,362 --> 00:46:10,529
Excuse me.
Is this Accounting?

574
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:12,632
I guess!

575
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,100
Could I have my paycheck?
Yeah.

576
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:17,169
Got that.

577
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:20,272
Thank you.
Okay.

578
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:26,238
Right here. See, I got to have this.
Dizzy.

579
00:47:28,408 --> 00:47:30,275
Watch my bike.

580
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:40,586
Jesus Christ! I said one more time,
and that was one more time!

581
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:42,688
Hey, Pookie.

582
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:45,658
Tell Rondell I'm here
to get my check.

583
00:47:45,726 --> 00:47:49,829
Y'all better quit!
I ain't playin' with you.

584
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:52,598
Rondell,
Agnes need her check.

585
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,234
How's the baby?
Fine, I guess.

586
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:57,803
What's her name again?
I call her Tamika.

587
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:00,073
She call her Shandra.

588
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,076
Ah, Pookie. You gonna be all right?
I'll be fine, I guess.

589
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:06,879
I swear for God!

590
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:11,183
Hey!
Hey! Come on!

591
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:14,319
<i>Get away from him.
Stop jabbin' with him.</i>

592
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:34,440
Hey, Agnes.
You wanna work tonight?

593
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:36,375
Semifinals.

594
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:41,948
I got a game tonight.
The most important game of my career.

595
00:48:42,016 --> 00:48:44,851
Well, if you change
your mind, let me know.

596
00:48:44,918 --> 00:48:47,086
That's it!
I'm writin' you all up!

597
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,624
Told you that?
Yeah, right here.

598
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:54,093
Give me my bike.
Damn!

599
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:57,864
Got you, man.
She's crazy, man.

600
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:03,536
I got a 427 under there.
You ain't got no 427.

601
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:07,239
That's a 287, man.
I'll tell you right now. It's a 287.

602
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,247
<i>Then Alice became convinced...</i>

603
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:17,650
<i>that the baby
Julia's carrying... is mine.</i>

604
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:21,520
How can it be his brother's
baby when Eden loves Dax?

605
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:24,557
<i>She told Julia and me she
didn't ever want to see us again.</i>

606
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:27,359
Don't this little
girl live in the Poker House?

607
00:49:27,494 --> 00:49:29,562
Little girl, don't you
live in the Poker House?

608
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,932
Stymie, it's lunchtime. Leave her alone.
You know that's her favorite story.

609
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,667
Lunchtime? I'm gonna
tell you what time it is!

610
00:49:34,802 --> 00:49:38,137
Time for you to fix me another drink!
That's what time it is!

611
00:49:38,205 --> 00:49:40,940
Soothing even the worst parting.

612
00:49:41,008 --> 00:49:43,176
How can you have a baby
by one person...

613
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:45,311
when someone else
loves ya?

614
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:51,084
Baby, those TV people
ain't real.

615
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:54,386
Go on and eat now.
And something else.

616
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:57,489
You know, how come every time
somebody says "I love you"...

617
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:59,959
<i>to somebody that
they really don't,</i>

618
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:02,095
it's the opposite.

619
00:50:02,162 --> 00:50:04,764
They're just trying to be sneaky
about somethin' else.

620
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:08,134
<i>Seems to me people who love each
other--they don't be havin' to say it.</i>

621
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,736
Like, if someone
were to say, out loud,

622
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:13,172
"Ooh, I sure love my feet,"

623
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:16,876
well, of course you love your
feet, or you'd fall down.

624
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:19,979
<i>Cammie, honey,
don't trouble yourself.</i>

625
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:22,181
Have some more
cherry orange juice.

626
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:25,551

I'm Dr. J.

Yeah. Man, all right. Whatever.
Let's play.

Okay. You take the ball out,
then you pass the ball to me,

651
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,761
I'm gonna pass it back to you.

Then I'm gonna do my stutter
step shake-and-bake move.

Man, I was guarding George Gervin.
George Gervin ain't got no titties.

664
00:52:26,406 --> 00:52:28,740
Well, Agnes got titties,
so that's a foul!

665
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:30,776
Man, I was goin'

01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:28,119
You know
where I'm goin'.

784
01:00:28,187 --> 01:00:30,188
You ain't gotta go yet.

785
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,661
Yeah, I do.

786
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,730
I gotta
warm up the team.

787
01:00:37,797 --> 01:00:39,832
I gotta go over
the plays...

788
01:00:39,899 --> 01:00:42,033
and talk to the coach
about--

789
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:44,135
Don't go just yet.

790
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:47,973
<i> It was his lips that wrecked me.</i>

791
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,776
<i>The thick skin
over sweet custard.</i>

792
01:00:50,844 --> 01:00:53,545
<i>Like... Jell-O pudding...</i>

793
01:00:53,613 --> 01:00:55,347
<i>left out on the table
all night.</i>

794
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:58,149
<i>Sweet like that.</i>

795
01:00:58,217 --> 01:01:00,552
<i>Sweet like...</i>

796
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,054
<i>whiskey and Coke.</i>

797
01:01:03,122 --> 01:01:05,090
<i>Sweet like--</i>

798
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:07,693
Mooney, why you keep
following me around the damn place?

799
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:11,430
Everybody know you a hot mama,
but I ain't no jive-ass nigger.

800
01:01:11,497 --> 01:01:13,732
What is it you want, Mooney?

801
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,834
I want you to help me
move shit.

802
01:01:15,902 --> 01:01:18,236
You can go places I can't go.
That's all you had to say.

803
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:20,271
You got some merchandise.
Yeah. Take half.

804
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,241
Tell motherfuckers where you got it from.
I get half?

805
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:26,144
Half, goddamn it.
Did I stutter?

806
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:29,848
Well, shit, that's all you had to say.
You been mad all night.

807
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:32,718
You been playin' me like a
bald-headed stepchild. Shit.

808
01:01:32,786 --> 01:01:34,953
Can't I kid you?
Oh, we partners now, huh?

809
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,189
You don't trust me?
Hell, no.

810
01:01:39,258 --> 01:01:41,193
Well, come on.

811
01:01:59,379 --> 01:02:02,547
Hey, Duval. I'm busy, man.
Tell 'em to wait.

812
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:09,621
Too live.
That's what I told him.

813
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:27,205
Fuck that shit.

814
01:02:27,273 --> 01:02:30,542
Ain't no motherfuckin' police
taking me no-goddamn-where.

815
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:35,380
Fuckin' La-La. Ain't gonna be gettin'
no visit from my ass no time soon.

816
01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:38,951
Come on, nigger. Take me to the club.
Oh, you ready now.

817
01:02:39,018 --> 01:02:41,252
<i>Just come on.</i>

818
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:57,035
<i>Who fills the air
with notes so sour...</i>

819
01:02:57,103 --> 01:03:00,105
<i>and dares to challenge
Sinbad's power?</i>

820
01:03:02,308 --> 01:03:05,410
<i>Why, I'll fix 'em.</i>

821
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:19,057
<i>Rush that ship!</i>

822
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:26,832
<i>Go.</i>

823
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:50,388
<i>Sweet...</i>

824
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:53,058
<i>and soft.</i>

825
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:55,660
<i>Not like the man
who beats my mom.</i>

826
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:00,999
<i>The man that loves me,</i>

827
01:04:03,536 --> 01:04:06,237
<i>that kisses me like this.</i>

828
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:24,189
<i>How the fuck old was I?</i>

829
01:04:24,256 --> 01:04:26,224
<i>Thirteen?</i>

830
01:04:26,292 --> 01:04:28,326
<i>No, wait. It was winter.</i>

831
01:04:28,394 --> 01:04:31,063
<i>Fourteen, almost.</i>

832
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,031
<i>Just.</i>

833
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:43,241
<i>A virgin.</i>

834
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:46,778
<i>I don't know how old he was.</i>

835
01:04:46,846 --> 01:04:49,047
<i>Duval could've
been a thousand.</i>

836
01:04:52,986 --> 01:04:55,220
<i>Me, a sucker for his mouth.</i>

837
01:04:55,287 --> 01:04:57,155
<i>So sweet.</i>

838
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:00,759
<i>But that day--</i>

839
01:05:03,096 --> 01:05:05,363
Oh.

840
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:09,267
<i>No. No.
What--</i>

841
01:05:09,335 --> 01:05:10,336
<i>Didn't I say,</i>

842
01:05:10,362 --> 01:05:14,364
<i>"Get the fuck off me, motherfucker"?</i>

843
01:05:14,406 --> 01:05:17,009
<i>Didn't I? Did I?</i>

844
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:20,012
<i>Get the fuck--
This isn't happening.</i>

845
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:26,418
<i>This doesn't count.</i>

846
01:05:48,474 --> 01:05:50,876
<i>One thousand-one,</i>

847
01:05:52,011 --> 01:05:53,912
<i>one thousand-two,</i>
Ow!

848
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:58,716
<i>one thousand-three.</i>

849
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:03,521
<i>And now I'm sure I got one of my mom's
pimp's babies growing inside of me.</i>

850
01:06:40,826 --> 01:06:42,860
Agnes?

851
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:51,903
Yeah?

852
01:06:54,106 --> 01:06:56,207
What are you doin'?

853
01:06:57,743 --> 01:07:00,211
Nothing.

854
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:02,180
Mom.

855
01:07:25,204 --> 01:07:27,105
Hey.

856
01:07:29,975 --> 01:07:32,944
<i>Run down to the store
right quick.</i>

857
01:07:34,247 --> 01:07:36,248
So we need some Newports...

858
01:07:36,382 --> 01:07:39,050
and a big bottle
of Tanqueray...

859
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:42,353
and a Mr. T's
Bloody Mary mix.

860
01:07:43,556 --> 01:07:46,892
You know I can't drink it
with the vodka.

861
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:49,160
Don't taste like nothin'.

862
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:53,965
Why they even make somethin'
that don't taste like nothin'?

863
01:08:02,742 --> 01:08:04,642
This the end of the soap?

864
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,180
You wasteful.

865
01:08:25,865 --> 01:08:29,334
I remember
when you was a baby.

866
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:31,970
All the time all you ever
wanted me to do...

867
01:08:32,038 --> 01:08:34,872
was... read to you.

868
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:38,342
And all we had was two books.

869
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:42,948
A red one. I don't remember
what it was called.

870
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:47,785
Some other book
'bout rabbits...

871
01:08:47,853 --> 01:08:51,089
and chickens
and some shit.

872
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:54,626
You weren't
even walkin' yet.

873
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:59,598
But you just all the
time kept saying,

874
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:01,699
"Read me the red book.

875
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:05,437
Read me the red book."

876
01:09:06,672 --> 01:09:10,375
I read that book
must have been a million times.

877
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:14,446
Got sick of it,
for God's sake.

878
01:09:14,513 --> 01:09:18,649
Readin' the same
goddamn story...

879
01:09:18,717 --> 01:09:20,618
over and over.

880
01:09:22,554 --> 01:09:24,489
So--

881
01:09:24,556 --> 01:09:26,424
I'd just...

882
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:30,061
sit you on my lap,

883
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:36,668
just turn the pages,

884
01:09:38,503 --> 01:09:40,538
make up some shit.

885
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:48,079
Makin' up my own story.

886
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:52,017
Pretendin'...

887
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:57,088
like I was readin' to you.

888
01:09:58,057 --> 01:10:00,424
You weren't even
a year old yet.

889
01:10:04,263 --> 01:10:06,364
But you'd just...

890
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,734
turn,

891
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:14,638
look up at me and say,

892
01:10:16,275 --> 01:10:18,743
"Read the story."

893
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:25,150
It used to freak me out,

894
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:28,186
you speakin'
in full sentences...

895
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:30,355
since you could talk.

896
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:36,294
"Read the story."

897
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:42,533
I tried to fool you,

898
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,339
but I never could
ever since you was a baby.

899
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,209
You always knew
what I was doin'.

900
01:10:57,116 --> 01:10:59,617
What was the name
of that book?

901
01:11:04,924 --> 01:11:07,091
The red one.

902
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:09,194
You remember?

903
01:11:12,464 --> 01:11:14,532
Oh, fuck it.

904
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:18,269
It don't matter.

905
01:11:19,872 --> 01:11:22,307
Get on to the store.

906
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:24,876
If there's change,
I want it.

907
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:12,256
There's just today.

908
01:12:12,258 --> 01:12:14,492
And then there's tonight.

909
01:12:16,328 --> 01:12:18,596
Anything can happen.

910
01:12:20,499 --> 01:12:22,767
Then anything does.

911
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:28,839
That's some
valuable pussy.

912
01:12:28,907 --> 01:12:31,543
What?

913
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:35,313
Who are you talking about?

914
01:12:35,381 --> 01:12:38,916
You said it was time for
her to earn her keep.

915
01:12:40,752 --> 01:12:43,287
I'm just being agreeable,
is all.

916
01:12:43,356 --> 01:12:45,356
You're just bein' about dead.

917
01:12:45,424 --> 01:12:50,094
Oh. Look at you.

918
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:53,197
What are you gonna do
with that thing?

919
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:57,935
Mom, this motherfucker
just raped me!

920
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:05,610
<i>And now he wants
to pimp me out too?</i>

921
01:13:05,678 --> 01:13:08,279
I don't know
what you're sayin'.

922
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:10,348
He's fine to you.

923
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,617
He's good--
takes care of me.

924
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:16,588
<i>Did you fucking
just hear me?</i>

925
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:23,061
<i>Stop where you're standin',
or I'll blow the back of your head off.</i>

926
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:30,068
Baby girl, cool it now.
Come on.

927
01:13:30,135 --> 01:13:34,138
You don't want to spend the rest
of your natural life behind bars.

928
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:36,474
You don't wanna do that.

929
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,543
You think there's a cop
on this planet...

930
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:41,613
that would lock me up
for killing you?

931
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:46,284
You... stop it!

932
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:49,187
Stop it!

933
01:13:49,254 --> 01:13:51,856
I can't live
without him.

934
01:13:53,825 --> 01:13:56,260
So...

935
01:13:56,328 --> 01:13:58,429
I can't, and I won't.

936
01:13:58,531 --> 01:14:01,899
<i>So, you kill me.
You kill me.</i>

937
01:14:06,805 --> 01:14:08,906
Mom!

938
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:11,876
He raped me,

939
01:14:11,943 --> 01:14:14,912
and he beats you,

940
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,415
and he sells you!

941
01:14:17,482 --> 01:14:21,252
<i>And now he wants
to sell me too.</i>

942
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,456
<i>And you want to die
in his place?</i>

943
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:28,526
Yes.

944
01:14:31,764 --> 01:14:33,631
Y--Yes.

945
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:49,814
I'm going to
my basketball game.

946
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:55,886
No. No. You get out!

947
01:14:55,954 --> 01:15:00,325
You get--
You get out of my house!

948
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:40,130
Wait, baby.

949
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:43,801
Wait. Don't go!

950
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:10,094
<i>I left... my mother...</i>

951
01:16:11,596 --> 01:16:14,165
<i>and the man
I thought loved me...</i>

952
01:16:14,232 --> 01:16:16,133
<i>in that house.</i>

953
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:20,705
<i>I left my mother...</i>

954
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,543
<i>and my... rapist...</i>

955
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:27,779
<i>in that house.</i>

956
01:16:28,647 --> 01:16:31,115
<i>I left my mother...</i>

957
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,485
<i>and my mother's pimp...</i>

958
01:16:34,552 --> 01:16:36,921
<i>in that house.</i>

959
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:40,391
<i>Look at all the people it takes
to make up a person.</i>

960
01:16:43,928 --> 01:16:45,829
<i>Ain't that nothin'?</i>

961
01:17:57,536 --> 01:17:59,771
Where the sam hell
have you been?

962
01:17:59,838 --> 01:18:03,240
I've been to the mountaintop,
and it ain't shit.

963
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:06,811
You good to play? We ain't got time
for no warmin' up, gettin' ready.

964
01:18:06,878 --> 01:18:09,714
Give me some bull crap
excuses after you blow it,

965
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:11,749
comin' in late
with a story.

966
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:14,385
I'm not gonna blow it, Coach.
You know me.

967
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:16,453
Ref! Time!

968
01:18:16,522 --> 01:18:18,990
Visitor time out.

969
01:18:19,057 --> 01:18:21,225
Ridgeview Lady Stars are down by 13.
Come on! Let's go! Huddle up!

970
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:24,128
Just under seven minutes to go,

971
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:26,196
it's Home 47, Visitors 34.
Come on! Let's go, ladies! Get in here!

972
01:18:26,264 --> 01:18:28,999
<i>- This one is just about over.
- Come on!</i>

973
01:18:29,067 --> 01:18:31,468
"A" Game here finally
decided to show up.

974
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:33,904
Maybe she can
wake the dead.

975
01:18:33,972 --> 01:18:36,440
Y'all are playin' pitiful!
We are down 13.

976
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:38,709
Win, or go home!

977
01:18:38,777 --> 01:18:41,713
Missy, you've been gettin'
beat all night. Sit.

978
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,415
<i>Agnes, prove me right.</i>

979
01:18:44,483 --> 01:18:46,851
Nobody walks!
Team on three.

980
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:48,952
- One, two, three, team!
- Team!

981
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:56,561
<i>There's the boy who writes
me poems and leaves them in my locker.</i>

982
01:18:56,628 --> 01:18:58,730
<i>He thinks I don't know.</i>

983
01:18:58,797 --> 01:19:00,898
<i>His name is Peter.</i>

984
01:19:03,902 --> 01:19:07,238
<i>There's the varsity football players that
won't talk to me if anyone's around,</i>

985
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:10,441
<i>but Terry loves discussing
poetry at the Burger King...</i>

986
01:19:10,508 --> 01:19:13,444
<i>and I give Alfred
the math quiz answers.</i>

987
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:17,114
<i>And Mario plays one-on-one with me in
the church parking lot any time I want.</i>

988
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:28,392
Agnes! Agnes!
Agnes! Agnes!

989
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,361
Agnes! Agnes!

990
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,074
Two points, Ridgeview!

991
01:19:44,142 --> 01:19:46,010
Way to go!
Let's get it back now!

992
01:19:55,053 --> 01:19:57,922
Lady Stars grab two more.

993
01:20:04,462 --> 01:20:06,731
Ten to 14.

994
01:20:06,798 --> 01:20:08,799
And it's Agnes again!

995
01:20:12,737 --> 01:20:14,505
Number 14 takes a hard foul.

996
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,608
They need these free throws
to get back into the game...

997
01:20:17,676 --> 01:20:20,077
and have a chance
at the state championship.

998
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:25,850
Okay, Agnes! You got these.
Knock 'em down!

999
01:20:30,555 --> 01:20:32,890
There's one.

1000
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,792
Stay calm! Stay calm!

1001
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:49,139
And wow!
Ridgeview may have a prayer!

1002
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:53,310
Here come the Lady Stars.

1003
01:20:53,378 --> 01:20:55,079
Two!

1004
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:59,282
And again!
Agnes really is lighting it up.

1005
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:01,285
Number 14 is giving
this visiting team a shock.

1006
01:21:01,352 --> 01:21:06,224
Down 58-54
with 44 seconds to play.

1007
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:11,094
End-to-end layup
to tie the game.

1008
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,298
It's tied up 60-60.

1009
01:21:14,365 --> 01:21:16,934
All right! Good job!

1010
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:19,937
Ridgeview crosses half court.

1011
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:22,640
Five seconds.
Four seconds left to play.

1012
01:21:22,707 --> 01:21:24,875
Agnes puts it up.

1013
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:32,315
And it's all net!

1014
01:21:32,383 --> 01:21:36,754
Ridgeview is going
to the state championship!

1015
01:21:36,889 --> 01:21:38,789
Good job! Come on.

1016
01:21:41,425 --> 01:21:45,129
<i>I scored over
20 points in about seven minutes.</i>

1017
01:21:45,263 --> 01:21:48,866
<i>That was a tristate
record for almost seven years...</i>

1018
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:52,136
<i>until some sophomore girl from this
school on the west side broke it.</i>

1019
01:21:53,772 --> 01:21:55,873
<i>Good for her.</i>

1020
01:24:12,244 --> 01:24:14,278
Get in the car, bitches!

1021
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:26,223
Where have y'all
knuckleheads been?

1022
01:24:28,793 --> 01:24:30,561
I ate too much
Goldfishes.

1023
01:24:30,628 --> 01:24:33,296
<i>I think I'm gonna puke my guts.
Ew.</i>

1024
01:24:34,131 --> 01:24:37,092
I went to Kelly's,
then I went to the bar,

1025
01:24:37,135 --> 01:24:40,704
which I know you said
to never go to.

1026
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:43,306
But... I found Cammie.
Yeah.

1027
01:24:43,374 --> 01:24:46,043
So I would say fine to
that to me, if I was you,

1028
01:24:46,111 --> 01:24:48,545
because we was waitin'
and waitin',

1029
01:24:48,613 --> 01:24:50,580
and then we started walkin',
and it was so cold--

1030
01:24:50,682 --> 01:24:53,583
Shut up!

1031
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:56,820
Agnes, did you win your game today?
What game?

1032
01:24:56,888 --> 01:24:59,923
The basketball game!
Basketball game!

1033
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:02,793
You had a game tonight,
and you didn't take me?

1034
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:04,962
Who won?
We did, of course.

1035
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:07,164
And hear me
when I tell you,

1036
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:10,534
I scored 27 points in
the second half alone.

1037
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:12,436
Oh, my gosh!

1038
01:25:12,503 --> 01:25:15,406
Let's celebrate.
Yeah! We have to celebrate.

1039
01:25:15,473 --> 01:25:18,542
Drive the long way home,
and then we can go through the park.

1040
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:21,378
Nah. I got
a better idea.

1041
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:23,747
We're fixin' to have ourselves
some dinner, children.

1042
01:25:23,815 --> 01:25:26,817
Howard Johnson's!

1043
01:25:26,884 --> 01:25:29,486
Yes! Howard Johnson's!

1044
01:25:29,554 --> 01:25:32,289
But first we gotta go to Dolly's
and cash these paychecks.

1045
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:36,227
Dolly's?

1046
01:25:36,294 --> 01:25:39,330
Oh, no. Oh, no, Agnes.
Seriously.

1047
01:25:39,397 --> 01:25:41,899
Can I please wait
in the car or somethin'?

1048
01:25:41,966 --> 01:25:46,203
I'll die. I mean, I was already
there for, like, 800 hours today,

1049
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:49,406
and I also think I ate
all of Dolly's cherries.

1050
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:51,342
Yeah.

1051

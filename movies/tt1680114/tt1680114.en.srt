00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,633
<i>I keep having this dream...</i>

3
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:36,392
<i>where I wake up in my bed...</i>

4
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,547
<i>and all I can hear is this yapping.</i>

5
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,517
<i>I go in the hall...</i>

6
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:48,028
<i>and I see this guy
sitting in a chair.</i>

7
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,837
<i>He's got a cap on him
and his head's down...</i>

8
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,988
<i>so I can't see his face.</i>

9
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,193
<i>I yell at him...</i>

10
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,198
<i>but the guy won't look at me.</i>

11
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,078
<i>And the yapping is
getting louder and louder.</i>

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,599
<i>I walk down and say,
'Hey mate, you alright?'</i>

13
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:15,999
<i>And he just sits there,
says nothing.</i>

14
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:19,843
<i>I lift his head up
with my hands...</i>

15
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,122
<i>and he's got this cut
across his neck.</i>

16
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,396
<i>It looks like a big
fucking mouth.</i>

17
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:30,481
<i>I lean down closer...</i>

18
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>and I see this Chihuahua...</i>

19
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>sitting inside his neck...</i>

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,398
<i>looking back at me...</i>

21
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,761
<i>yapping.</i>

22
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,960
<i>Yapping at me.</i>

23
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:35,928
Oh!

24
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:39,186
I was just wondering
maybe next Saturday...

25
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,548
whether you want to go out to dinner,
to the Chinese place?

26
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:43,871
Are you asking me out on a date?

27
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,626
Yeah. You know, it's really nice.

28
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:50,026
Sounds good.

29
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:51,194
Excellent.

30
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:53,988
Take your mind
off things for a while.

31
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:54,992
Get out of the house.

32
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,752
Fuck!

33
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:04,313
- I needed to ask you, actually.
- Yep.

34
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,748
If you wouldn't mind.

35
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:08,360
Tomorrow
night I've got to go and see the ex.

36
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,633
I was hoping maybe you could watch
over them for a couple of hours for me.

37
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:16,989
Anytime you want a hand like that,
I'm happy to do it.

38
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,010
What do you reckon?

39
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:20,954
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,768
<i>Our next challenger
is a turf farmer by day...</i>

41
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,326
<i>and an entertainer by night
who dreams of winning an Oscar.</i>

42
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,722
<i>From Kandinya in Victoria,
we welcome Rowan Clancy.</i>

43
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,764
<i>Oh fucking hell,
Alex, your feet stink.</i>

44
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,246
<i>Now
you sell grass for a living then,</i>

45
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,487
<i>is that right mate?</i>

46
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:17,966
<i>Yes, instant lawn, Glenn.</i>

47
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,208
<i>Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

48
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,810
<i>My fault there. My fault.</i>

49
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:23,686
<i>But tell us more about Draculas.
That sounds like a lot of fun.</i>

50
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,012
So Jamie,
how's that girl you're seeing?

51
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:32,174
She's pretty good.

52
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:34,176
Seen her lately?

53
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:37,256
- I saw her on the weekend.
- Oh yeah.

54
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:42,730
Doing alright with her?

55
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,656
<i>- Her parents like me.
- Oh yeah, you met them?</i>

56
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:47,850
Good.

57
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:50,133
So what's the girl's name?

58
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,618
I'm not telling you.
You might steal her.

59
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,218
When are you seeing her again?

60
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:02,700
- Probably on the weekend.
- Oh yeah.

61
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:06,661
What do you reckon?
Not too bad?

62
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:07,735
Good.

63
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:12,578
Hey Jeffery, can we watch that
kangaroo movie again?

64
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:14,383
Kangaroo movie?

65
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:16,055
Which one's that?

66
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,375
The one that the kangaroo hops on.

67
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,616
Umm...

68
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:26,820
Ohh...

69
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,267
Turn to your side.

70
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,187
Look at the camera.

71
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:56,832
Put your arms up.

72
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:03,746
Put your hands
behind your head.

73
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:19,511
Turn to me.

74
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,164
<i>Hello, anyone home?</i>

75
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:13,202
- Is your Mum here, mate?
- Yes.

76
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,244
Scratching the hairs on your arse.

77
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,004
- Nice bickie?
- Yep.

78
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:29,405
You must be Elizabeth.

79
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:32,161
<i>I am, mate.</i>

80
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:35,445
- You know who I am?
- I do.

81
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:40,851
- Mind if I sit down?
- Help yourself, mate.

82
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:45,050
So, nice area.

83
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:46,764
You been here long?

84
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:48,346
Yeah, I have.

85
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:49,891
So we've heard.

86
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,212
Mmm.

87
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:59,127
I've got something to tell you,
Dizzy Lizzie.

88
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,051
Thanks, Mum.

89
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:15,574
Do you want eggs, boys?

90
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:22,974
<i>Here you go, babe.</i>

91
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:27,735
- Sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mum.

92
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:29,694
<i>Here, sweetheart.</i>

93
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:51,787
Yummy?

94
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,739
Good boys.

95
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:29,188
What have you done, Jeffery?

96
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,828
What have you fucking done?

97
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:34,545
What have you fucking done
to my fucking boys?

98
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:35,757
What?

99
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,595
I said fucking what?

100
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,314
What have you fucking done?

101
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,357
What? What?

102
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,876
Fucking what?

103
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,759
Tell me now!

104
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,230
My boys!

105
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,192
Fucking what?

106
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,435
Fucking what!

107
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:53,197
Jeffery!

108
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,721
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

109
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,554
Fuck you!

110
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,355
Fuck you!

111

<i>Northern Police.</i>

112
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,319
I need to make a
statement about my boys.

113
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,922
<i>What address, please?</i>

114
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,049
13 Farrow Road.

115

<i>As soon as possible, please.</i>

116
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,769
Yep.

117
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:49,809
What a friend we have in Jesus

118
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:54,603
All our sins and grief to bear

119
00:11:56,374 --> 00:12:01,292
What a privilege to carry

120
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,210
Everything to God in prayer

121
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:12,971
O what peace we often forfeit

122
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:17,889
O what needless pain we bear

123
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:24,178
All because we do not carry

124
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,491
Would you bow with me in prayer.

125
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,892
Lord, as we depart this place in the
name of Christ Jesus...

126
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,818
be with us in our waking...

127
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:37,899
and our sleeping
and our raising...

128
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,902
and our getting up
and our going out...

129
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:43,618
until we meet again
in the week to come.

130

00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,382
I love you so much.

133
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:04,387
Give it one more try, huh?

134
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:06,703
Don't know.

135
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,544
I miss seeing the boys.

136
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,221
I miss seeing you.

137
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:48,455
Hey!

138
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:50,351
Cut it out.

<i>Well nobody's asking you to.</i>

144
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:22,422
<i>Well what
the hell do you all want, then?</i>

145
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,158
<i>I just want you
to give yourself a break.</i>

146
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,782
<i>Stop making out
like you don't care.</i>

147
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:28,155
<i>- I don't.
- That's crap, Angel.</i>

148
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,954
<i>- You lost your father.
- Jamie.</i>

149

<i>What are you, a shrink?</i>

150
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:33,983
<i>No. No, I'm your best mate.</i>

151
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,463
<i>Get off the tracks!</i>

152
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:36,679
<i>Don't be stupid. It's safe.</i>

153
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,307
<i>Obviously it's not.</i>

154
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,412
For he's a jolly good fat cunt

155
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:54,290
For he's a jolly good fat cunt

156
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,183
With an ugly beard as well

157
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,502
What do you call 25 lesbians
stacked up on top of each other?

158
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:02,900
No idea.

159
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:04,174
A block of flaps.

160
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:08,822
You like that one, Barry?

161
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,134
You like that one?

162

<i>- Gidday, mate. I'm John.
- Morning, babe.</i>

- It's Jamie.

164
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:18,864
- You alright?
- Pretty good.

165
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:19,907
Nice to meet you.

166
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,098
Take a seat, mate.

167
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,498
<i>You hungry, yeah?</i>

168
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,460
I've got some bacon and eggs going.
Do you want that?

169
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:26,426
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Alright.

170
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,145
- You hungry again, mate?
- Yes.

171
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,946
<i>You eat like a fucking horse,
you do, don't you?</i>

172
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:32,621
You want some eggs
and bacon and everything?

173
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:33,626
- Yes, please.
- Yeah?

174
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:35,063
<i>Sausages?
You want a sausage too, Jamie?</i>

175
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,308
- Yep.
- Yep.

176
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,106
Alright. There we go.

177
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,708
I'll just get this up then I'll look
after you, alright?

178
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:44,145
Jamie mate, I'm really sorry if I woke
you up last night too, mate.

179
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:46,505
Just had to deal with that fucking
prick across the road, eh?

180
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:47,952
Don't worry about it, Jamie.

181
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,545
John'll take care of that bit of shit.

182
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:52,586
It's just not alright, mate,
you know what I mean?

183
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,473
I mean, if the kids were
from the fucking city...

184
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:56,430
<i>I bet they'd look after them real
quick, you know what I mean?</i>

185
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,151
<i>He wouldn't be out on bail in a
fucking day, would he?</i>

186
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,429
This is my eldest boy, Troy.

187
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:02,913
Gidday, mate. I'm John.
How are you?

188
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,553
Jesus, a barrel of
fucking laughs, he is.

189
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:07,790
<i>What, did he have a big night, love?</i>

190
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,232
I'd assume so, yes.

191
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,477
Live one, is he?

192
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,875
Absolutely.

193
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,316
Troy, cut it out!

194
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,636
I don't think he likes us.
Is that it?

195
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,240
<i>Troy, come on!</i>

196
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:29,597
I'm late.

197
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,114
<i>Yeah, give it a go, mate.</i>

198
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,159
Been having pains.

199
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:35,711
Yeah?

200
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,924
I'm craving gherkins and cheese.

201
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,359
Yeah?

202
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,796
I think I might be pregnant.

203
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,675
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

204
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:47,243
Alright!

205
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,040
There you go.

206
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,647
Alright, grab the straps.
That's it.

207
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:03,003
Give us a look.

208
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,123
Make sure you hold on
really tight for me, alright?

209
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:11,966
There you go.

210
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,410
<i>On you get.</i>

211
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,243
<i>Hold on tight! Hold on properly.</i>

212
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,687
Nice and tight, mate.
You ready?

213
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,525
Got his foot in foot peg?
That's it.

214
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:26,843
<i>Hold on tight, babe!</i>

215
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:45,730
There you go.

216
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,529
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

217
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:49,132
<i>- Thank you. Good one.
- That's a good boy.</i>

218
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,090
- There you go.
- Thank you.

219
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,369
- I like to hear manners.
- Yeah, good on ya. Hey?

220
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:11,818
Come here.
Come here. There you go.

221
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,061
Chuck it at the house.

222
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:14,700
<i>There you go, mate.
Chuck it out.</i>

223
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:16,419
<i>Chuck it at the house. Go on.</i>

224
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,263
<i>Come here,
come here, come here.</i>

225
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,340
Have a look.

226
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,619
Come on, come on.

227
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,938
Oi! Good work.

228
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,179
Anyone touch my kids,

229
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:37,909
I'm going to go honey over
a fucking bullants' nest.

230
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,505
<i>Yeah,
and rightly so, mate.</i>

231
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,425
<i>Rightly so.</i>

232
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,462
Or a hungry rat in a tube and let
them eat their fucking dick off.

233
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,424
<i>- Right.
- You know, full on.</i>

234
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,344
Those fucking dirty bastards deserve...

235
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,869
- In a nutshell.
- In a nutshell.

236
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,989
- The system's fucked isn't it, really?
- Full on.

237
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,312
Here's an example how
the system's fucked, right?

238
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,590
<i>And I know you can go
along with this, Nige...</i>

239
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:57,229
<i>because this has happened
to your boys, hasn't it?</i>

240
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,630
- Yes.
- Now here we go.

241
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,302
They've got a police check, don’t they?
To get into teaching at schools, right?

242
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:03,788
- Yep, and working.
- Absolutely.

243
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:05,705
- And volunteering.
- A fucking police check, right?

244
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,865
So Claire across the road, right?
We all know her.

245
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,791
She's a great girl,
she's been studying for six years,

246
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:11,392
She's been studying to be a teacher.

247
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,192
She goes to get a fucking job,
she can't get a job...

248
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,111
because she stole a fucking
watch when she was 18.

249
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:17,271
<i>But Mr. Fucking Bum Puncher,
your mates, mate.</i>

250
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:18,514
<i>No, they're not my mates.</i>

251
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,429
<i>No, they're all your fucking friends,
Barry. We know, mate.</i>

252
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:22,391
- Yeah, I know mate -
- They can just stroll into schools.

253
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,750
Just strolls into school, right?

254
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,230
Yeah,
you're a nasty character.

255
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:27,118
No, no, no fucking worries,
no fucking worries.

256
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,371
- And takes my kiddie...
- Oh, there's the keys, mate.

257
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,917
<i>- to the fucking bathroom.
- Absolutely. There's your fucking keys.</i>

258
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,879
<i>The gents are just down the hall.
Have a fiddle, on us.</i>

259
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,041
- Have a smorgasbord, mate.
- On us.

260
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,473
And what did the school
do about that?

261
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:36,978
The school?
The school actually did, uh...

262
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,197
- absolutely nothing.
- Nothing.

263
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,935
I honestly don't see an answer
to any of our questions.

264
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,560
<i>- And when you...
- I don't see a solution to any of it.</i>

265
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:46,325
I'm fuckin' sick to death of it,
I really am.

266
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:49,295
<i>I've had a gutful, and... and
sitting around here talking about it,</i>

267
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,840
<i>it's all great, we're all venting.
That's fucking fantastic.</i>

268
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,121
<i>But it's happening right fuckin' now,
right while we're sitting here.</i>

269
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,764
<i>Some little kid's being
touched up.</i>

270
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:58,193
But how difficult...

271
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,043
Can you please
go back in there with the boys?

272
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,356
<i>I really don't want you here.</i>

273
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,884
<i>No Jamie,
it's alright, mate. You can stay.</i>

274
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,005
<i>No John, I really don't want him
a part of this, John.</i>

275
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:07,478
<i>No, it's... it's alright.
It's alright love. He's a big boy.</i>

276
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:09,321
<i>He is going to learn more in
here than he is in...</i>

277
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:10,607
Tell him to go back inside.

278
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,366
Come here, mate.
Come here, mate.

279
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,362
I really don't want him in here,
John.

280
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,281
<i>Hey hey, it's alright love.
It's alright.</i>

281
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:19,689
He's a big boy. He's a big boy.
You want to sit down, mate?

282
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,447
<i>- You want to join in? Yeah.
- Yeah, I want to sit down.</i>

283
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,608
Rob, get up for him,
would ya?

284
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,801
Take a seat, mate.

285
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:24,999
- Do you want a beer?
- Yeah.

286
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,688
You want to push the legislation...

287
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,050
<i>up to the welfare and the
dogs too.</i>

288
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,041
Hey, hey, it's alright.
It's alright.

289
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,091
I'm sleeping in the bedroom.
You've got the couch.

290
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,129
How are you, mate?

291
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,969
<i>- You want to join in the conversation?
- Yeah.</i>

292
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:38,973
You can't blame
every gay for being a paedophile.

293
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,526
<i>I want to ask you a question.
Yes, you can.</i>

294
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:41,684
Our queer friend here...

295
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:44,415
<i>thinks that it's okay for poofter
teachers to teach at school.</i>

296
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:45,850
What do you think about that?

297
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:47,492
- I don't know.
- Go on, mate.

298
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:49,855
Tell us what you really think.
We're all friends here.

299
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,650
I don't think they
should be doing that.

300
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:53,254
Don't think they should be
doing that, do you?

301
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,567
Touching up your friends.

302
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:56,534
Stay behind class, please,
I need to see ya.

303
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:57,856
That's not fucking right, is it?

304
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:59,652
Well some boys know
what they want, don't they?

305
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:00,607
Shut up, Barry.

306
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,130
They're children.

307
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,296
What do you reckon?
What should happen to 'em?

308
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,012
- Fucking kill 'em.
- Kill 'em.

309
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,174
Well done!

310
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:09,540
What, are you gonna go and kill the
rest of the world?

311
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,778
I could name 250 'round here.

312
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:13,015
<i>Shut up, Barry.</i>

313
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,932
<i>You've gotta take it in your own
hands because I bet you,</i>

314
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,698
I bet you after you kick the shit...

315
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,217
<i>I bet you after you kick the shit out
of that fucking pedo...</i>

316
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:22,612
<i>he's gonna put his cock away, and
he didn't touch no other kid after.</i>

317
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:26,133
<i>And that's exactly what me and Rob
are doing, aren't we mate?</i>

318
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,302
<i>- Right on.
- You know what I mean?</i>

319
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,941
There should be
more people like me doing it.

320
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:30,778
<i>- You're right.
- There should be more people like you.</i>

321
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,776
I mean, you should see the
hours that we put in.

322
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:35,579
<i>You gotta take it into
your own hands.</i>

323
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,744
- Morning, mate.
- Morning.

324
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,182
How'd you sleep?

325
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,704
Pretty good.

326
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:16,745
Come over here mate and pick that
up and put it in the bucket for me.

327
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:20,784
<i>Just put all those in there.</i>

328
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,749
<i>Chuck them in the bucket.</i>

329
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:30,629
<i>And the tail, too.</i>

330
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:35,551
- Head as well?
- Yeah, mate. All in.

331
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,033
Woo!

332
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,988
That was a fucking bastard,
wasn't it?

333
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:48,632
Yep.

334
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,151
In she goes.

335
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:00,997
Give it a go.

336
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:08,921
Go on mate, put your back into it.

337
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:12,796
<i>That's enough.</i>

338
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:14,598
Pick up the bucket.

339
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,879
Get his fucking couch.

340
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:45,165
Pick up the bucket.

341
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,480
That's it.

342
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:34,080
<i>That's it.
You can go a bit slower if you want.</i>

343
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:36,199
<i>You're a natural, mate.</i>

344
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,640
- You want to go up a gear?
- Yeah.

345
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:40,643
Yeah, alright.

346
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:43,758
<i>Put your hand on the clutch,
clutch in, foot underneath the peg.</i>

347
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:46,518
Up. There you go.

348
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,365
Release the clutch, give it a bit.

349
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,684
There you go. Look at that.

350
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:15,928
<i>There's a man...</i>

351
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,847
<i>back to normal square leg...</i>

352
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:20,213
<i>even perhaps sometimes
behind square leg...</i>

353
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,888
<i>when the left hander
bounces you.</i>

354
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,653
<i>That's where the
top edge can go...</i>

355
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:24,814
Oi. What's on?

356
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:26,014
I don't know.

357
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,768
Is that your boyfriend?

358
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,335
What?

359
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,526
<i>What are you gonna
do about it, punk?</i>

360
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:35,571
<i>- Fuck off.
- Come on.</i>

361
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,776
<i>What are you gonna do?
Let's go. Come on, what have you got?</i>

362
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,454
<i>Ya got nothing.
Come on pussy, get up.</i>

363
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,134
Look at you,
just laying in bed.

364
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,817
<i>Let's go. Come on, get up.</i>

365
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,942
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.
What have you got?

366
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:48,700
Come on.
Come on, whaddya got?

367
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,741
What have you got, huh?
What have you got?

368
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:55,982
What have you got?
Come on.

369
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:01,258
Come on.

370
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:04,813
Fucking bitch.

371
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:08,054
Whaddya got?

372
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:09,542
<i>You can see his leg there.</i>

373
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,464
<i>Tries to to get it outside the line,
it's very close...</i>

374
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:16,345
<i>and you can see him straight
away looking back up at the umpire,</i>

375
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:20,258
<i>eyes wide open and that
is a sense of relief.</i>

376
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,864
<i>Wide World of Sports Memorabilia
is celebrating the performance by...</i>

377
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:28,660
<i>David Boon with the limited edition
500 of the bat on the left there,</i>

378
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,902
<i>seven hundred and fifty dollars
framed, including courier costs.</i>

379
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,909
<i>That's the phone number and...</i>

380
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:37,188
<i>have a look at the picture on
David on the bat there.</i>

381
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:39,189
<i>You can see this bat
beautifully framed, actually.</i>

382
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:41,549
<i>All the details of his
career down the side,</i>

383
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,912
<i>and that is painted on,
handpainted,</i>

384
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,547
<i>that picture of David Boon,
his personal signature.</i>

385
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:50,227
<i>And then that cross
shot appears,</i>

386
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:53,070
<i>that shot he played so well
down at the bottom...</i>

387
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,511
So, how was school today, boys?

388
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:08,587
Bad.

389
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:09,956
Bad?

390
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,873
<i>I thought you loved school, mate.</i>

391
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,751
Isn't there some little girl that
you've got your eye on?

392
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,394
- What?
- Yeah?

393
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,355
Didn't you tell me about this
little girl you got your eye on?

394
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,435
What?

395
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,474
- Thought her name was Aleisha.
- No.

396
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,151
Cute little girl you were
telling me about last week.

397
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,438
<i>You couldn't stop talking about her.</i>

398
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:31,838
How's the food, Troy?

399
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:40,675
It's that good you're
eating it, is it?

400
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,801
Hey, John.

401
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:06,478
What are you going to
be doing with that, mate?

402
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:07,849
<i>Oh, I don't know, mate.</i>

403
00:31:08,371 --> 00:31:09,724
<i>Think I might extend, mate.</i>

404
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,089
Hey?

405
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,249
Oh, I'm thinking of extending, mate.

406
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,644
Get a new room out here.

407
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:17,923
- Room extension?
- Yeah.

408
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:20,648
Yeah, I'm thinking an entertainment
system or something.

409
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:22,444
Go the whole nine yards.

410
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,966
<i>Yeah, mate. A big screen TV,</i>

411
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:27,967
<i>subbies, whole nine yards.</i>

412
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:30,287
That'd be alright, wouldn't it?

413
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:31,453
When's opening night?

414
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,091
Oh yeah, it's coming on.

415
00:31:35,016 --> 00:31:36,652
You'll get the opening night ticket
for sure.

416
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:40,292
- He's off his fucking tree.
- Yeah.

417
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,574
<i>Hey love,
can we get some water, please?</i>

418
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:45,332
In the army, I was a sniper rifle.

419
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:48,850
I shot hundreds of people
when I was doing...

420
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:50,288
when we were in the...

421
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,450
when you're in the barracks,
there's about sixteen...

422
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:55,570
The Trip.
That's what he's known as.

423
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:57,451
<i>He's a nasty sadist.</i>

424
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,933
<i>Anything under 16 is fine by him.</i>

425
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,259
<i>He lives at 16 Wilson Lane.</i>

426
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:09,373
<i>Then there's Jason Fry.</i>

427
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,496
<i>At 21 Chester Road.</i>

428
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:17,739
<i>Runs his fingers through his arse...</i>

429
00:32:17,824 --> 00:32:20,620
<i>And then he sits down the park all
day watching and wanking.</i>

430
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:23,979
Then there's Barry Stone.

431
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:25,456
<i>Hang on, mate.</i>

432
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:28,467
And they get down and they
run around in trees...

433
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:31,541
and whoever's left on the ground,
they shoot in the face.

434
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,217
Alright.

435
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:34,900
Barry Stone

436
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,305
<i>At 203 Bourke Road.</i>

437
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,468
Chucks kids' parties for all the
methadone mothers.

438
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:43,783
He's got one pocketful of jubes.

439
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:47,349
The other pocket's cut out
and he's playing snakes.

440
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:50,422
<i>They don't know where the kids are,
they don't know where he is.</i>

441
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,466
<i>Then there's Tony
"The Frog" Thompson...</i>

442
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,588
<i>Hang on, mate.</i>

443
00:32:58,151 --> 00:32:59,670
- Tony "The Frog"...
- Hang on.

444
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,467
Then there's Tony "The Frog"
Thompson.

445
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:12,186
He's a nasty bit of work.

446
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,945
<i>And I want in on him, John.</i>

447
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:17,873
<i>He lives at 225 Alexander Place.</i>

448
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:19,869
And he just smashes 'em.

449
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:22,599
Sodomises 'em
on the lounge room floor and...

450
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,954
And I know.

451
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:27,837
He's a fucking faggot.

452
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:32,176
- When somebody tells you that you...
- Drives an old Valiant.

453
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:36,608
you go up to the front and you try to
shoot bullets around them...

454
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,257
when the tanks come...

455
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:39,596
Is that it?

456
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:42,238
<i>Yeah, that's all I've got.</i>

457
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,153
Where'd you pick him up from?

458
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,599
<i>Someone's gotta have someone, John.</i>

459
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:56,276
<i>...Very happy because
it's what you're paid to do.</i>

460
00:33:56,288 --> 00:34:00,959
<i>You can go home and you try to have a
proper life but you can't.</i>

461
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:05,675
<i>When your Commander tells
you to move on, you move on.</i>

462
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:12,845
<i>If you got... get shot, well then that's
too bad, that's part of your life...</i>

463
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,169
Hmm...

464
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,245
<i>Do you think Liz is gonna
like this?</i>

465
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:48,050
What?

466
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:49,573
Think your Mum's
gonna like this?

467
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:52,370
<i>Oh, probably not, but who cares?</i>

468
00:34:53,857 --> 00:34:55,254
I reckon I look good, mate.

469
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:00,452
Hey, do you mind if I stay over?

470
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:04,609
Of course, mate.

471
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:06,129
You're more than welcome.

472
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,457
You alright?

473
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:20,622
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

474
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:24,617
<i>- You hungry?
- Yeah.</i>

475
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:27,294
Alright.

476
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:00,621
Do you like snow peas?

477
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,307
Don't know.
Never had them before.

478
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,021
<i>You've never had snow
peas before?</i>

479
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:05,100
No.

480
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,147
<i>Look out.</i>

481
00:36:10,513 --> 00:36:11,988
<i>Well don't wait for me
or anything.</i>

482
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:21,309
<i>Mixing it all together.</i>

483
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:31,473
- Not too hot?
- No, it's good.

484
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,589
It's good?

485
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:34,988
It's what they call a green curry.

486
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:38,672
Is that because of the peas?

487
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:40,031
It's probably because it's green.

488
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,110
Rice is a bit overcooked.
Sorry about that.

489
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,679
That's alright.
Tastes good anyway.

490
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,230
- Huh?
- Tastes good anyway.

491
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:02,597
<i>Do you like being fucked?</i>

492
00:37:04,244 --> 00:37:05,195
What?

493
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,556
Do you like being fucked?

494
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,197
No.

495
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:15,874
<i>So why not do something
about it?</i>

496
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:22,680
Because all I ever see
you do is sook, mate.

497
00:37:25,048 --> 00:37:26,880
- I do not.
- No?

498
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,639
<i>What'd you do about Jeffery?</i>

499
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:34,808
<i>Fucking nothing.</i>

500
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,689
You see me and
Robert moping around?

501
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,604
Hmm?!

502
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:43,320
No, you don't...

503
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,086
because you do that
and they fuck you forever.

504
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:49,964
Do you want that, do you?

505
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,648
<i>When are ya gonna
grow some balls, mate?</i>

506
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,775
You ever shot a gun before?

507
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,617
<i>Well go on, pick it up,
see how it feels.</i>

508
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:37,332
<i>Feel good?</i>

509
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,774
<i>Yeah?</i>

510
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:42,661
Do you wanna shoot it?

511
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:44,694
Yeah?

512
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:47,373
<i>Shoot it.</i>

513
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:49,419
At what?

514
00:38:52,946 --> 00:38:53,895
Shoot the dog.

515
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:56,420
Come on. Come here.

516
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,182
Come here. Good girl.

517
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:00,024
Come here. Good girl.

518
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:02,337
Shoot the dog.

519
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:03,856
No.

520
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,306
<i>No?
Why not?</i>

521
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:09,302
<i>She's my dog, mate.
I don't really give a shit.</i>

522
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:11,822
Oh look, mate.

523
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:15,945
<i>You don't even have to look at her.</i>

524
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,140
You just shoot it.

525
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:20,223
<i>Yeah?</i>

526
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:25,182
<i>Come here. Kelly, come here.</i>

527
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:31,021
Get up.

528
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:40,910
You want to do something
about this?

529
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:44,833
Shoot the dog.

530
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:49,468
Go on, mate. Shoot it.

531
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:00,269
<i>Shoot it.</i>

532
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:06,876
Shoot the fucking dog!

533
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:30,843
Dog's not dead.

534
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:36,602
<i>Give me the gun.</i>

535
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:39,833
<i>Give it to me.</i>

536
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:54,360
<i>Hello, Chris?</i>

537
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:58,449
<i>It's is your brother, Barry.</i>

538
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:03,361
<i>I thought you should know
I'm on my way to Queensland.</i>

539
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:10,287
<i>I don't know if I'm going to hitch
all the way, or catch the bus.</i>

540
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:15,207
<i>I should be there
in a couple of days.</i>

541
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:19,652
<i>Don't reckon I'll be
home for a while, mate.</i>

542
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:23,212
<i>Can you tell Mum?</i>

543
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:29,290
<i>See ya, mate.</i>

544
00:41:57,421 --> 00:41:59,459
Yeah, go and load it up, babe.
I'm hungry.

545
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:00,911
- Are you?
- Yeah?

546
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:02,401
You didn't eat much
lunch today, did ya?

547
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:03,751
No.

548
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,780
- You hungry, boys?
- Yeah.

549
00:42:05,885 --> 00:42:07,260
Okay, who wants a bit of mash?

550
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:08,861
Yeah.

551
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:10,780
Is that enough for you
or you want some more?

552
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:12,180
- More.
- More.

553
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:14,500
<i>- Please.
- Good manners, mate.</i>

554
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:17,096
- That'll do.
- That'll do?

555
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,305
- What about you?
- I'll have some. Just a bit.

556
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:26,582
I'm gonna need
some help tomorrow with umm...

557
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,184
<i>with some stuff out the back,
boys, alright?</i>

558
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:29,547
Ah-hmm.

559
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:31,580
We're gonna move
some rubbish in some bags.

560
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:36,859
Alright?

561
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:38,943
- Yep.
- Yeah.

562
00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:42,107
Oi.

563
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:44,871
You're going to eat your
vegetables tonight, aren't you?

564
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,065
Because if you don't,
you're not going anywhere.

565
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,746
<i>I don't wanna boast,
but we had a terrific year in chemicals.</i>

566
00:42:57,754 --> 00:43:01,272
<i>We developed the bastard white
out which takes 45 minutes to dry.</i>

567
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:05,589
<i>The bastard pencil. The lead
is broken every centimetre.</i>

568
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:11,185
<i>But the big one's finally come through
and we've developed...</i>

569
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:16,071
<i>the bastard cellophane for wrapping
sweets for picture theatres.</i>

570
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:34,914
Gidday, Ray.

571
00:43:37,043 --> 00:43:38,199
<i>How're you going, John?</i>

572
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:42,040
<i>Good, mate. And you?</i>

573
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:45,916
Oh, yeah.

574
00:43:50,966 --> 00:43:52,319
You're a bit close, aren't ya?

575
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,238
No worries, John.
I'm gonna get going.

576
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,006
How long has he been out there?

577
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:08,843
I'm not sure.

578
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:10,688
You keeping an eye on him for me?

579
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:12,479
<i>Yeah, of course I am, John.</i>

580
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:14,926
<i>Don't worry about him.
He's harmless.</i>

581
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,042
You know that's not true, love.

582
00:44:20,254 --> 00:44:22,252
Well why?
What have you heard?

583
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,963
That he's been down the school again,
flashing himself.

584
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:27,132
I haven't heard nothing like that.

585
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,009
<i>Seems okay. He's very quiet,
keeps to himself.</i>

586
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:37,256
I don't mind.

587
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:49,935
Here, have something to eat.
You look all tense.

588
00:44:50,017 --> 00:44:51,295
Oh, thanks love.

589
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:56,737
Don't worry about him.

590
00:45:36,306 --> 00:45:37,344
Turn around.

591
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,179
What's up?

592
00:45:56,272 --> 00:45:57,263
You alright?

593
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:02,152
<i>Cat lost your tongue?</i>

594
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,193
- Yours. Yours!
- No, yours.

595
00:46:12,795 --> 00:46:14,191
Hey, fucking watch the water.

596
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:18,908
Fuck this wind.

597
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:31,475
I've had some fuckin' women, but...

598
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:34,032
<i>it's been a while since
I've actually had some true love.</i>

599
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,438
<i>Mate, do you know,</i>

600
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,155
<i>I don't know if you've felt
it before but...</i>

601
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:41,957
<i>the last romantic thing I can
remember doing, bro,</i>

602
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:43,630
<i>you know, like I say,
it's been a while,</i>

603
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,997
and I wined and dined her, you know,
did the whole nine yard thing.

604
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:49,073
Hmm...

605
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:51,476
<i>I booked a hotel on
Glen Osmond Road,</i>

606
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:57,239
took her to a hotel- I think it's
called Eagle On The Hill, right?

607
00:46:57,444 --> 00:46:59,683
<i>It's a real classy
restaurant dude, right?</i>

608
00:46:59,805 --> 00:47:03,922
Cost me hundreds of dollars
obviously to pay for it.

609
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:05,519
<i>But she was worth it, mate.</i>

610
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:07,074
She was beautiful,
you know what I mean?

611
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:08,485
- I loved her.
- Yeah, I know.

612
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:11,648
Yeah, wined and dined her,
you know what I mean?

613
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:16,738
And afterwards, I think it's called
Windy Point, or whatever it is.

614
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:18,344
- It's a lookout, right?
- Up in the hills?

615
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,579
<i>Up in the hills, alright?</i>

616
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,360
Which was beautiful,
know what I mean?

617
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,403
Got into each other a little bid,
got a little bit heated,

618
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:24,361
you know what I mean?

619
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:26,568
But in that loving, caring,
sort of...

620
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:28,226
- nurturing feeling way.
- Yeah, yeah.

621
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,747
And, um...

622
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,606
<i>And took her back to the hotel room,</i>

623
00:47:31,634 --> 00:47:34,687
and you know,
it wasn't... it wasn't fucking,

624
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,766
you know, and see you later.

625
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:39,525
<i>There was something more to it,
you know?</i>

626
00:47:39,612 --> 00:47:42,090
<i>Substance, mate. Substance.</i>

627
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:47,447
I miss it.

628
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:52,170
So what's he gonna do
with this now?

629
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:55,967
He was talking about
making a bomb shelter.

630
00:47:56,815 --> 00:47:58,529
<i>Who the fuck's
gonna bomb us, brother?</i>

631
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,734
I don't know, man.

632
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:05,852
Shit.

633
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:08,968
Yeah, he's got some big ideas.

634
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:55,378
Jamie, just go.

635
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:58,020
<i>- Just fuckin' go. Just go!
- What's up, Mum?</i>

636
00:48:58,029 --> 00:48:59,699
- Just...
- She said fuck off!

637
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:13,230
What the fuck?
Everything alright?

638
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:14,466
<i>Just go, mate. Drive.</i>

639
00:49:26,155 --> 00:49:27,434
<i>Hello, Suzanne.</i>

640
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,864
<i>It's Ray.</i>

641
00:49:31,756 --> 00:49:33,153
<i>I've met some girl...</i>

642
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:36,833
<i>and I don't need to stay in
the caravan anymore.</i>

643
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,186
<i>If I've left anything behind...</i>

644
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,587
<i>you can keep it.</i>

645
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,112
<i>It's all yours.</i>

646
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,398
<i>Thanks, sweetheart.</i>

647
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,593
<i>Bye.</i>

648
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:16,075
Where's John?

649
00:50:19,564 --> 00:50:20,877
He's not here, mate.

650
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,357
<i>What happened?</i>

651
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:27,845
We had a fight.

652
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:37,045
Don't fuck this up, Mum.

653
00:51:13,815 --> 00:51:16,450
<i>- You still up, mate?

656
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,732
Lord, I just want to lift
Lynn to you today.

657
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:37,017
Thank you for bringing her back to us...

658
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:38,574

663
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:46,980
Okay, thank you.

664
00:51:46,983 --> 00:51:49,016
Is there anyone else who'd like to...

665
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,055
to share anything with the
congregation this morning?

666
00:51:52,705 --> 00:51:53,740
Elizabeth?

667
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:54,856
<i>Do you want to come

668
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,504
or do you rather me bring
the microphone to you?

669
00:51:56,587 --> 00:51:57,863
I'll stand here.
Is that okay?

670
00:51:57,945 --> 00:51:59,499
Yeah, I can bring it to you.
That's alright.

It's okay, love.
You'll be alright.

674
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,786
I just... I wanted to say...

675
00:52:32,994 --> 00:52:34,029
It's okay.

676
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:40,550
I just really love my family,
love my boys, mate.

677
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:46,830
Okay, thanks Elizabeth,

678
00:52:48,677 --> 00:52:50,511
<i>Okay, is there anyone else

679
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:51,946

680
00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:56,677

00:52:58,277 --> 00:53:00,190
Yeah, got a freezer full at home now.
You should come over.

683
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:01,390
That's alright.

684
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,759
<i>- Bring the boys.
- Yep.</i>

685
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,753
We can have a barbie, hey Dave?

686
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:08,591
<i>Be nice to get 'em away.
Something different.</i>

687
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:09,675
Yeah, that's right.

688
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:12,311
No, they should come down
one weekend. Be good.

689
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:15,278
- You alright?
- Oh, hey John.

690
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:16,913
<i>- Good to see you, mate.
- Yeah, you too mate.</i>

691
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:18,911
- Marcus gave us a lift home.
- Oh yeah.

692
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,238
<i>You remember David?</i>

693
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,400
<i>Yeah. Gidday, mate.</i>

694
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:23,675
I was just tellin' Liz...

695
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:25,793
<i>Dave got himself an
apprenticeship, John.</i>

696
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:27,761
- Did he?
- Yeah, a mechanic.

697
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:29,154
That's cool.

698
00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:31,915
Dave's been at the job
two weeks now.

699
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:33,915
Two weeks? Look out.

700
00:53:35,563 --> 00:53:36,638
<i>How's it been going?</i>

701
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:38,963
It's alright.

702
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:41,397
As long as he sticks with it.

703
00:53:41,966 --> 00:53:42,960
Away he goes.

704
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:46,998
It's a bit dirty is it, mate?

705
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:55,881
Jesus, mate. They're flash.

706
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,526
What do you call those?

707
00:53:58,769 --> 00:53:59,806
They're Nike Airs.

708
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:02,403
They must have cost a bit.

709
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,646
They did.

710
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:05,369
First week's pay and all.

711
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:06,647
Why not?

712
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,846
Splash out.

713
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:09,159
Yeah.

714
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,408
Why not?

715
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:13,885
What do you call them?

716
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:17,652
Cheap.

717
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:42,011
Have a look at your brother.

718
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:43,815
Looks like a fucking monkey up there.

719
00:54:44,783 --> 00:54:45,938
Let's go. Come on.

720
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,656
No, mate.
No monkey in me.

721
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,577
Chicken shit.
Come on, get up here.

722
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,776
Chicken shit?

723
00:54:51,941 --> 00:54:53,654
<i>- No mate, I'm alright down here.
- Come on.</i>

724
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:55,460
Let's go. Come on!

725
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:11,580
<i>Thanks, chief.</i>

726
00:55:38,912 --> 00:55:40,822
<i>Shall I, be it again?</i>

727
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:48,869
<i>That's right,
I'm being an idiot, aren't I?</i>

728
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:52,707
<i>Would the boys and girls
care to join in?</i>

729
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,947
<i>Ooh! Here's Glenn.</i>

730
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:58,754
- Hello.
- Hey.

731
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:01,272
<i>Hello.
Hello Mary.</i>

732
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:02,629
<i>What are you being?</i>

733
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,632
<i>If you'd been
here on time Glen...</i>

734
00:56:04,754 --> 00:56:05,914
How was the movie?

735
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:08,268
<i>- Pretty shit.
- Yeah?</i>

736
00:56:10,518 --> 00:56:12,354
- Where's Mum?
- She's asleep.

737
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,511
Right.

738
00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:15,309
Oi!
Where's my hug?

739
00:56:16,758 --> 00:56:17,828
<i>Come here.</i>

740
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:21,482
Big hug, big hug.
Squeeze.

741
00:56:21,603 --> 00:56:24,097
Arghh!

742
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:25,900
<i>Alright, goodnight.</i>

743
00:56:26,071 --> 00:56:27,752
<i>Sleep well.
Oh, you want a kiss, do ya?</i>

744
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:28,839
Want your kiss down there?

745
00:56:29,937 --> 00:56:31,904
Just letting you know,
I spilt some milk.

746
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,469
<i>- Oh, did ya?
- Yep.</i>

747
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:35,361
You gonna make me

748
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:36,934
<i>Yep.</i>

749
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:41,363
What happened to your hand?

750
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:52,596
Come on.

751
00:58:14,483 --> 00:58:15,763
Come and say hello to Barry.

752
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:28,797
Put your hands
on top of your head.

753
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:37,145
<i>- Take a deep breath.
- Fucking told you...</i>

754
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:38,262
<i>- he's as weak as piss...
- Shut up, mate.</i>

755
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:39,486
Get him a glass of water.

756
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:49,369
<i>He was a waste, Jamie.</i>

757
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,126
He was a fucking junkie.

758
00:58:52,255 --> 00:58:53,729
Fuck, it wasn't his fault!

759
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:55,529
Calm the fuck down.
Calm the fuck down.

760
00:58:55,538 --> 00:58:57,296
- Piss off!
- You wanna go me, huh?

761
00:58:57,298 --> 00:58:58,848
You wanna fuckin' go me? Uh?

762
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:00,655
You wanna go me, do you? Uh?

763
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:03,335
Club me in the fuckin'
head again, mate. Go on.

764
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,895
OK! Hey! Hey!

765
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,932
<i>- Piss off!
- Hey, come here.</i>

766
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:13,981
He was my fucking friend.

767
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:17,378
He was a fucking junkie.

768
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:19,339
He was my friend.

769
00:59:23,905 --> 00:59:24,778
<i>Come on, look at me.</i>

770
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:26,262
What?

771
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:29,262
He was my fucking friend,
and you killed him.

772
00:59:33,468 --> 00:59:35,827
He fucking deserved it, mate.
Come here. Come here.

773
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,348
Calm down.
Calm down.

774
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,025
<i>Calm down. Calm down.</i>

775
00:59:41,753 --> 00:59:43,509
<i>Hey? Calm down.</i>

776
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:46,503
What if that was your mother?

777
00:59:46,952 --> 00:59:49,147
What if that was one of
your brothers, hey?

778
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:51,344
He was my fucking friend.

779
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:53,386
And he was a fucking waste,
wasn't he?

780
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:56,107
Big fucking junkie, eh?

781
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:58,150
I'm only looking after you, mate.

782
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:00,547
- I'm looking after you.
- Let go!

783
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:02,108
I'm looking after you.

784
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:31,763
When you calm
the fuck down...

785
01:00:32,686 --> 01:00:34,161
you do what you need to do.

786
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:38,566
That's his card.

787
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,087
Alright?

788
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,884
Fuck you.

789
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:56,093
Go and pack his clothes up.

790
01:01:00,214 --> 01:01:01,132
Go on.

791
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:03,330
Fuck you, man.

792
01:01:04,455 --> 01:01:05,808
<i>Get outta here.</i>

793
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,891
There's this chick that I know,
known her for a lotta years,

794
01:03:25,899 --> 01:03:28,094
<i>And she had this boyfriend,
partner, thing, whatever.</i>

795
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:31,336
<i>And she actually found that guy in
bed with her daughter.</i>

796
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:33,813
How old was his daughter?

797
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,374
She was about six or
seven at the time.

798
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:40,174
She kicked him out for maybe,
I don't know, 48 hours...

799
01:03:40,464 --> 01:03:44,177
then took him back into her
home with that daughter...

800
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:45,784
and just let him live there.

801
01:03:47,226 --> 01:03:50,384
Just let that fucker live
in her house.

802
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:51,576
You wouldn't do that,
would ya?

803
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,263
- VERNA: Fuck no.
- JOHN: What would you do?

804
01:03:53,268 --> 01:03:55,629
Oh, first chance I got,
I would fucking...

805
01:03:56,509 --> 01:03:58,299
<i>probably skin his penis.</i>

806
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:00,145
What about you, Nigel?
What would you do, mate?

807
01:04:00,431 --> 01:04:02,220
Shove a 38 up his arse
and pull the trigger.

808
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,785
- That's it?
- That's too easy.

809
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,069
What do you reckon
before that?

810
01:04:05,152 --> 01:04:06,625
<i>Come on, I know.
I can see something in you.</i>

811
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,503
<i>There's something else you'd do
before that, wouldn't you?</i>

812
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,352
Yeah, I'd kick the absolute
fuck out of him. Cut his throat.

813
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:13,190
<i>Yeah. Break every
fuckin' bone in his body.</i>

814
01:04:13,192 --> 01:04:15,346
Cut his cock off, shove it
in his mouth. See ya later.

815
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,708
Say,
'how the fuck do you like it?'

816
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:18,113
<i>Put a fucking candle
in the cock eye,</i>

817
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,508
see you later, happy birthday
and then up the arse, right?

818
01:04:20,515 --> 01:04:26,513
Just shove some bloody
waterproof match heads up his dick.

819
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,149
Fucking nice.

820
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,555
What about you, mate.
What would you do?

821
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,659
<i>Don't be a fucking pussy, mate.
Have a go.</i>

822
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,594
- Stop it, John.
- Stop what?

823
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:39,439
Just your mean shit.

824
01:04:42,642 --> 01:04:44,041
Are you saying it's okay
for these people...

825
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:45,321
to just go on with what
they're doing?

826
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:49,799
You should just
get 'em all in one...

827
01:04:49,884 --> 01:04:51,765
<i>It's just not even about that
anymore, mate.</i>

828
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,165
And blow them all up.

829
01:04:53,326 --> 01:04:55,162
What're you even fucking
talking about, Liz?

830
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:56,718
It's not about that.

831
01:04:57,607 --> 01:05:00,327
<i>It's not fucking mean if you kick the
shit out of some diseased prick.</i>

832
01:05:01,688 --> 01:05:02,878
<i>He fucking deserves it.</i>

833
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:09,881
It's an Australian fucking
tradition anyway.

834
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:13,081
Hey?

835
01:05:14,694 --> 01:05:16,571
<i>Look at Anzac Day,
for Christ's sake.</i>

836
01:05:18,974 --> 01:05:20,730
The whole country applauds
a bunch of blokes...

837
01:05:20,733 --> 01:05:22,132
who killed and tortured men,
don't they?

838
01:05:22,575 --> 01:05:23,611
Why do they do that?

839
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:27,170
Because they fucking deserved it,
didn't they?

840
01:05:30,377 --> 01:05:32,255
<i>See, I don't get it.
What's the difference between me...</i>

841
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:33,536
putting the boot in a
fucking pink one...

842
01:05:33,657 --> 01:05:35,810
- and them killing a yellow cunt?
- You don't have a badge.

843
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:37,534
<i>- I don't have a badge?
- You don't have a badge.</i>

844
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:38,897
That's it.
Where's my fucking parade?

845
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:40,851
Yeah, where's your day?

846
01:05:43,701 --> 01:05:45,055
<i>You find something funny, mate?</i>

847
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,376
What do you think about this?

848
01:05:48,662 --> 01:05:50,061
If they don't touch me,
I don't care.

849
01:05:52,266 --> 01:05:53,334
That'd be right, wouldn't it?

850
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,022
Well that attitude is
why it keeps going on, isn't it?

851
01:05:58,026 --> 01:05:59,740
Not going to wait
for you to protect my kids.

852
01:05:59,745 --> 01:06:00,937
Leave it.
Leave him out of it.

853
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:01,898
Hmm.

854
01:06:02,228 --> 01:06:03,461
You wanna say something, Troy?

855
01:06:16,551 --> 01:06:18,070
People like that
just walk away.

856
01:06:18,151 --> 01:06:20,227
Exactly. People that walk away
and shut their fucking eyes...

857
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:21,226
He's the smart one.

858
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:22,783
Why is he the smart one,
walking away?

859
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:25,345
<i>He's just shutting his eyes to something
that's so real and out there.</i>

860
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:27,386
No, he just doesn't need
to be here, listening to all this...

861
01:06:27,394 --> 01:06:28,508
bravado about what you do.

862
01:06:28,515 --> 01:06:31,869
Like, honestly.
Would you do that shit?

863
01:06:34,997 --> 01:06:36,397
<i>I came here for dinner, alright?</i>

864
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:38,357
Well you had your dinner,
now fuck off.

865
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:46,195
Happy birthday to you

866
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,989
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

867
01:06:50,362 --> 01:06:53,837
<i>You look like a monkey</i>

868
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,993
<i>And you smell
like one too!</i>

869
01:06:57,003 --> 01:06:59,681
<i>- Hip hip!
- Hooray!</i>

870
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:18,049
Wow, a Sega game!

871
01:09:14,247 --> 01:09:15,480
What the fuck!

872
01:09:33,313 --> 01:09:35,525
- Get his head. Got it?
- Yep.

873
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:40,163
Yep!

874
01:09:42,854 --> 01:09:44,045
Yes!

875
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:12,136
Turn the telly on.

876
01:10:29,349 --> 01:10:30,541
No!

877
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:42,031
Get the fucking bag.

878
01:11:09,601 --> 01:11:11,032
Fuck off!

879
01:11:48,172 --> 01:11:49,450
Get back in here now.

880
01:11:51,095 --> 01:11:52,285
<i>I said fuckin' now.</i>

881
01:13:30,484 --> 01:13:31,675
You gotta see this.

882
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:36,760
Come on.

883
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:40,917
Get up.

884
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,217
I can't fucking take it anymore, Mum.

885
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,579
Can't fuckin' take it anymore, Mum.

886
01:14:27,622 --> 01:14:29,260
I don't want to fucking live here.

887
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:31,257
I don't wanna fucking live here.

888
01:14:31,262 --> 01:14:32,454
I'm going away.

889
01:14:33,023 --> 01:14:34,095
I'm going away.

890
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:35,819
Don't you fucking call me.

891
01:14:36,544 --> 01:14:38,379
Don't you fucking call me.

892
01:14:39,026 --> 01:14:40,183
I fucking hate you.

893
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:42,863
I fucking hate you.

894
01:14:47,468 --> 01:14:50,265
Troy.
Hey, hey.

895
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,379
Look who's here.

896
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:55,780
Jamie.

897
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:58,745
What did I say?

898
01:15:00,272 --> 01:15:02,030
I'm sorry, master.

899
01:15:02,313 --> 01:15:03,503
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

900
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:06,387
I'm sick.

901
01:15:06,473 --> 01:15:07,827
- Good boy.
- Cure me.

902
01:15:08,034 --> 01:15:08,985
Good boy.

903
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,079
Stop.

904
01:15:26,482 --> 01:15:27,715
Head up, head up.

905
01:15:28,243 --> 01:15:29,191
Again.

906
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,032
Stop.

907
01:15:50,281 --> 01:15:51,274
Again.

908
01:15:57,641 --> 01:15:58,634
Stop.

909
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:10,269
Again.

910
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,552
Stop.

911
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,909
Again.

912
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:29,028
<i>Stop.</i>

913
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:32,987
<i>And again.</i>

914
01:16:33,558 --> 01:16:34,911
Just fucking do it!

915
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:42,271
Stop.

916
01:17:24,715 --> 01:17:25,632
Hey.

917
01:17:26,195 --> 01:17:27,231
Hey.

918
01:17:29,914 --> 01:17:31,225
<i>Good boy.</i>

919
01:17:33,394 --> 01:17:34,508
Good boy.

920
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:12,188
<i>Come on, Jamie.</i>

921
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:13,776
How was your weekend?

922
01:19:13,866 --> 01:19:15,197
- Good. Yep.
- Was it good?

923
01:19:15,227 --> 01:19:16,780
You sure? Were you good?
Were you good?

924
01:19:16,866 --> 01:19:18,820
Yeah, I was good.

925
01:19:45,146 --> 01:19:46,663
What was the fight about?

926
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:49,859
Money.

927
01:19:53,425 --> 01:19:54,976
Do you know where he went?

928
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,823
<i>Mum, it's me, Troy.</i>

929
01:20:19,702 --> 01:20:21,460
<i>I gotta get away.</i>

930
01:20:22,503 --> 01:20:24,577
I can't fucking take it anymore, Mum.

931
01:20:26,383 --> 01:20:27,977
<i>I don't wanna fucking live here.</i>

932
01:20:29,823 --> 01:20:31,656
<i>I fucking hate you, Mum.</i>

933
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:34,692
<i>Don't you fucking call me.</i>

934
01:20:37,182 --> 01:20:38,459
<i>I'm going away.</i>

935
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:41,418
<i>Hello Mum?</i>

936
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,573
<i>I just wanted to call and tell you
that I've met someone...</i>

937
01:20:45,022 --> 01:20:46,572
<i>And his name's Andy.</i>

938
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,820
<i>Andy wants me to
live up north...</i>

939
01:20:49,941 --> 01:20:51,339
<i>so I'm going to.</i>

940
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:53,815
<i>Don't worry, you'd like him.</i>

941
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,578
<i>He's not like the others.</i>

942
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,079
<i>Love you.
Bye.</i>

943
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:00,698
<i>Hi Mum, it's me, Fred.</i>

944
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,610
<i>Hi Mum, it's me, Fred.</i>

945
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,334
<i>I'm on my way to Perth.</i>

946
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,337
<i>I'm on my way to Perth.</i>

947
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:15,212
<i>I met a really nice girl.</i>

948
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,297
<i>I met a really nice girl.</i>

949
01:21:20,738 --> 01:21:22,693
<i>I'll be back
some time after Christmas.</i>

950
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,410
<i>I'll be back
some time after Christmas.</i>

951
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:29,728
<i>Bye.</i>

952
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:32,328
<i>Bye.</i>

953
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:42,528
<i>How are you, alright?</i>

954
01:22:42,534 --> 01:22:43,570
Mm-hmm.

955
01:22:48,772 --> 01:22:51,371
So Fred, tell me, how long
have you been schizophrenic?

956
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:55,889
- Um, a couple of years now.
- Have you seen a psychiatrist?

957
01:22:56,532 --> 01:22:57,569
<i>Yeah, I have.</i>

958
01:22:57,771 --> 01:22:59,442
The psychiatrist diagnosed
you with schizophrenia?

959
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:00,610
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay.</i>

960
01:23:00,813 --> 01:23:04,602
<i>What's the symptoms of what you
usually have with the schizophrenia?</i>

961
01:23:05,453 --> 01:23:07,646
Um, a lot of stuff.

962
01:23:08,052 --> 01:23:09,689
<i>A lot of stuff. Like headaches?</i>

963
01:23:09,932 --> 01:23:12,006
<i>- Yeah.
- Do you have negative thoughts?</i>

964
01:23:12,012 --> 01:23:12,961
Yeah.

965
01:23:13,052 --> 01:23:15,727
So since you are on the medicine,
do you feel different?

966
01:23:15,731 --> 01:23:17,609
- Do you feel better?
- Nuh.

967
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:21,162
You're supposed to sleep
with such medication.

968
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:23,244
<i>What about your mind?</i>

969
01:23:23,371 --> 01:23:25,205
<i>Do you think it's not working
properly sometimes?</i>

970
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:26,885
<i>- No.
- Not at all.</i>

971
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,168
Here you are, Fred.
There's your certificate.

972
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,246
Just lodge them at a Centrelink.
I'll see you later.

973
01:23:36,569 --> 01:23:38,206
Have you got your
Medicare card?

974
01:23:45,168 --> 01:23:47,801
OK. Just sign next to the cross.

975
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:56,242
Okay, that all looks fine.

976
01:23:56,248 --> 01:23:58,638
We'll reactivate your payments
at the end of the day.

977
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:00,880
You'll receive your first
payment a week from today.

978
01:24:00,889 --> 01:24:03,367
So what I need you to do now
Fred is sign here for me.

979
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:15,920
It's the 23rd.

980
01:24:21,608 --> 01:24:22,722
'98.

981
01:24:26,966 --> 01:24:27,961
Okay.

982
01:24:31,326 --> 01:24:33,160
Okay, that's it, Fred.
Any other questions?

983
01:24:39,006 --> 01:24:40,524
So who is he?

984
01:24:42,727 --> 01:24:45,117
He's Gary.
He's just a spastic.

985
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,236
So you know him?

986
01:24:48,205 --> 01:24:49,363
<i>Yeah, sort of.</i>

987
01:24:52,244 --> 01:24:53,315
Would anyone miss him?

988
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:58,161
I don't know.

989
01:25:08,164 --> 01:25:12,313
This is my pet python snake.
It's a ju-jungle python snake.

990
01:25:12,683 --> 01:25:15,119
It comes from the ah,
top of Queensland.

991
01:25:15,683 --> 01:25:19,277
It's a bit nasty, and um,
it's about two years old...

992
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:21,995
and you can buy these um,
rats from a pet store.

993
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:24,598
It's about five dollars a-a box.

994
01:25:24,683 --> 01:25:25,873
<i>Yeah, anyway...</i>

995
01:25:25,883 --> 01:25:29,596
<i>Would you like to s-see me um,
feeding the snake, Jamie?</i>

996
01:25:30,363 --> 01:25:31,433
Yeah, sure.

997
01:26:14,599 --> 01:26:15,996
See how he's eating?

998
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,110
<i>Yeah, he's beautiful,
isn't he Jamie?</i>

999
01:26:41,217 --> 01:26:43,950
Um, this one's a um...
jungle python.

1000
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:45,355
- Is it?
- Yes.

1001
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:48,954
<i>Um, he gets about
eight feet long and um...</i>

1002
01:26:49,077 --> 01:26:51,676
he comes from Queensland,
north of Queensland.

1003
01:26:51,677 --> 01:26:52,834
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1004
01:26:53,077 --> 01:26:55,512
And his name's Bill Murray.

1005
01:26:55,516 --> 01:26:57,908
- Bill Murray?
- Yeah, and um...

1006
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,744
For fuck sake, Verna,
can you get 'em out of here?

1007
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:31,061
What do you want me to do?

1008
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,349
Clean the house,
look after the kids.

1009
01:28:32,351 --> 01:28:33,825
Just take the kids away, will ya?

1010
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,068
If you manned up once in a
while I wouldn't have to.

1011
01:28:36,069 --> 01:28:37,348
Oh for fuck's sake, just do
it, will ya?

1012
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,540
Alright kids, out!

1013
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:40,061
Out.

1014
01:28:40,511 --> 01:28:41,820
Out back.

1015
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,260
<i>We'll leave the boys alone to talk
about their private girly business.</i>

1016
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:48,027
- Thanks.
- Pussy.

1017
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:50,380
<i>- Moll.
- Out back!</i>

1018
01:28:50,748 --> 01:28:51,907
<i>Come on, all of you!</i>

1019
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,940
Jesus, mate, you're gonna
have to put a leash on that.

1020
01:28:54,589 --> 01:28:55,899
You got one big enough?

1021
01:28:57,149 --> 01:28:58,339
JOHN: I could make one.

1022
01:28:59,789 --> 01:29:01,186
<i>Might take a while, but.</i>

1023
01:29:02,188 --> 01:29:04,143
<i>I've been meaning
to talk to you about that, John.</i>

1024
01:29:05,308 --> 01:29:06,345
Why is that?

1025
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,186
Me and Verna got into a bit
of a blue the other night.

1026
01:29:11,427 --> 01:29:12,781
Drunk, carrying on.

1027
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,987
She ended up starting
to call me names.

1028
01:29:18,428 --> 01:29:22,861
You know, saying I was a pussy
and I don't fuck her properly.

1029
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,016
Do you, mate?

1030
01:29:24,306 --> 01:29:26,983
<i>Well, how do you, really?</i>

1031
01:29:27,468 --> 01:29:28,537
You tell me.

1032
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:31,698
<i>Roll her around first in flour
to find the wet spot.</i>

1033
01:29:36,265 --> 01:29:38,143
- You alright, mate?
- Yeah.

1034
01:29:38,226 --> 01:29:40,542
We got bluing and...

1035
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:45,375
when she called me a pussy,
it just sort of come out.

1036
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,225
I said, 'if I'm a pussy, why is it
that I can bury blokes?'

1037
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,655
<i>So she sort of knows
what's going on, John.</i>

1038
01:29:58,305 --> 01:29:59,299
<i>And I told her, mate.</i>

1039
01:29:59,305 --> 01:30:01,095
<i>I said, look, if you say
anything to anyone...</i>

1040
01:30:01,185 --> 01:30:03,062
<i>I'll put you and the kids
out in the streets.</i>

1041
01:30:04,464 --> 01:30:06,014
<i>She won't say nothing, mate.</i>

1042
01:30:10,824 --> 01:30:12,014
<i>So I feel really shit.</i>

1043
01:30:14,663 --> 01:30:15,820
<i>Just really sorry, John.</i>

1044
01:30:20,984 --> 01:30:22,381
She won't say anything, mate.

1045
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,220
<i>- Promise ya.
- It's alright, mate.</i>

1046
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:29,501
<i>- Sorry, John. I feel awful.
- Don't worry about it.</i>

1047
01:30:29,782 --> 01:30:30,776
It happens.

1048
01:30:36,262 --> 01:30:37,737
<i>You look like
a fucking ghost hit ya.</i>

1049
01:30:39,622 --> 01:30:40,551
Yeah.

1050
01:30:41,262 --> 01:30:42,159
Oi.

1051
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:43,980
It's alright to smile.

1052
01:30:44,061 --> 01:30:45,939
I dare you to.

1053
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,970
So how do ya fuck her, mate?

1054
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,131
Step ladder.

1055
01:30:58,101 --> 01:30:59,411
Bucket.

1056
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:03,093
Pull the bucket over her head
and hang on to the handle.

1057
01:31:05,179 --> 01:31:08,019
It's strange, but Australia Post want
to give her her own postcode.

1058
01:31:22,499 --> 01:31:24,857
- There ya go, mate.
- Want me to stop by tonight?

1059
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,813
<i>No, you spend some time
with your family, mate.</i>

1060
01:31:26,818 --> 01:31:27,932
<i>- Alright.
- I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

1061
01:31:28,058 --> 01:31:29,729
<i>- No worries. Take it easy.
- Yeah, you too.</i>

1062
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:51,612
You gotta stop fucking
around with that shit, Jamie.

1063
01:32:00,856 --> 01:32:03,893
<i>You fucking get off that shit.
Alright?</i>

1064
01:32:11,415 --> 01:32:12,890
You fuckin' get off that shit.

1065
01:32:17,696 --> 01:32:18,646
Okay?

1066
01:32:19,296 --> 01:32:20,245
<i>Yeah.</i>

1067
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:26,446
<i>Look at me.</i>

1068
01:32:34,574 --> 01:32:36,364
<i>You don't need to worry, alright?</i>

1069
01:32:40,974 --> 01:32:42,491
They're nobody, mate.

1070
01:32:43,293 --> 01:32:44,331
No one gives a shit.

1071
01:32:45,454 --> 01:32:46,808
They're nothing.

1072
01:33:00,972 --> 01:33:03,046
<i>The neighbours barely fucking
notice when they go missing.</i>

1073
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:11,041
You did though, didn't you?

1074
01:33:12,011 --> 01:33:13,124
And your brothers.

1075
01:33:17,131 --> 01:33:18,202
<i>You're lucky.</i>

1076
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:22,604
<i>Aren't ya?</i>

1077
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:27,844
Good.

1078
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:35,449
<i>It's alright, mate.</i>

1079
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:37,766
<i>Good boy.</i>

1080
01:33:38,371 --> 01:33:39,320
<i>It's alright.</i>

1081
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:40,919
<i>I need you.</i>

1082
01:33:45,691 --> 01:33:47,240
Better blow your fucking nose.

1083
01:33:50,408 --> 01:33:51,325
<i>Go on.</i>

1084
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:21,561
I need you to take Alex away.

1085
01:35:55,921 --> 01:35:57,199
You right, mate?

1086
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,596
Come here.

1087
01:36:27,799 --> 01:36:29,196
<i>Mum, it's Verna.</i>

1088
01:36:30,679 --> 01:36:32,513
<i>I need to get away for a while.</i>

1089
01:36:34,118 --> 01:36:35,789
<i>Mark and I keep fighting.</i>

1090
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:38,796
<i>I fucking hate his guts.</i>

1091
01:36:40,677 --> 01:36:42,873
<i>Can you watch the kids for me,
please?</i>

1092
01:36:43,678 --> 01:36:46,626
<i>Don't try and call me, Mum.
I'm sorry.</i>

1093
01:36:47,357 --> 01:36:48,635
Bye.

1094
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:52,194
So where's this computer at?

1095
01:36:53,037 --> 01:36:54,270
Just north of Clare.

1096
01:36:56,918 --> 01:36:58,392
And he only wants two
hundred for it?

1097
01:36:59,157 --> 01:37:00,106
Yeah.

1098
01:37:02,497 --> 01:37:03,590
Is it any good?

1099
01:37:05,316 --> 01:37:06,313
I don't know.

1100
01:37:10,676 --> 01:37:13,548
Oh well, for 200
it's probably worth a look.

1101
01:37:21,355 --> 01:37:22,304
You coming in?

1102
01:37:24,475 --> 01:37:25,785
No, I'm happy here.

1103
01:37:26,914 --> 01:37:27,952
What about you?

1104
01:37:34,194 --> 01:37:35,265
Did you call him yet?

1105
01:37:36,874 --> 01:37:38,153
Yeah, he doesn't want it.

1106
01:38:06,512 --> 01:38:08,424
Hi-ya!

1107
01:38:09,311 --> 01:38:12,152
Ya-way-ya-ya!

1108
01:38:13,312 --> 01:38:14,349
<i>Ya!</i>

1109
01:38:14,832 --> 01:38:16,503
<i>I just killed ya. Ha, ha.</i>

1110
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:20,023
<i>That was fun.
Flipping killed ya.</i>

1111
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:24,949
<i>Have a go.</i>

1112
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:39,782
<i>Do you require
police, fire or ambulance?</i>

1113
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:44,379
<i>What service do you require,
police, fire or ambulance?</i>

1114
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:49,622
<i>Do you require police,
fire or ambulance?</i>

1115
01:39:16,148 --> 01:39:17,306
Where're we going?

1116
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:19,937
Get in.

1117
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:20,249
Grab those bags.

1118
01:43:55,049 --> 01:43:56,206
You coming, mate?

1119
01:44:53,326 --> 01:44:55,804
<i>- Everything alright?
- Yeah, it's fine.</i>

1120
01:44:58,365 --> 01:44:59,643
Got time for a beer?

1121
01:45:00,885 --> 01:45:01,879
Yeah, sure.

1122
01:45:16,004 --> 01:45:18,603
- How's your Dad been?
- Yeah, he's been alright.

1123
01:45:18,763 --> 01:45:21,243
<i>- Still fishing?
- Yeah, doing a little bit.</i>

1124
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:22,721
Caught a fair bit of
whiting the other day.

1125
01:45:22,843 --> 01:45:25,354
<i>Beautiful. Still goes to that same
patch he used to always go to?</i>

1126
01:45:25,443 --> 01:45:26,600
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1127
01:45:39,762 --> 01:45:41,280
So is that your girlfriend?

1128
01:45:42,162 --> 01:45:43,396
Yeah.

1129
01:45:45,001 --> 01:45:46,475
How long
have you been with her?

1130
01:45:48,643 --> 01:45:49,636
A couple of months.

1131
01:45:51,962 --> 01:45:53,119
She's pretty nice.

1132
01:45:54,842 --> 01:45:55,878
Yeah, she's great.

1133
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,480
So does she go to school
or anything?

1134
01:46:02,201 --> 01:46:04,035
She's going to university next year.

1135
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,831
Doing, uh... psychology.

1136
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,274
Why are you asking?
Do you like her?

1137
01:49:14,988 --> 01:49:15,982
Hey, John.

1138
01:49:16,305 --> 01:49:22,856

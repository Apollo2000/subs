00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:35,276
I could give you
a crash course in this place.

161
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:38,322
Introduce you
to some of my regulars.

162
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,848
It's just mostly Wall Street guys
looking to spend money on pretty girls.

163
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,508
What do you think of that?

164
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,730
- Yeah, that would be cool.
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,777
[woman] So, it was Ramona's
idea that you two work together?

166
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,475
Yes, that's right.

167
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,695
And at this point,
everything was aboveboard.

168
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,132
I mean,
I thought she was nice.

169
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,789
And when would you say that
things got out of control?

170
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,884
Ramona was always in control.

171
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,713
[Ramona] Front hook.

172
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:23,933
Ankle hook. Yup.

173
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:25,891
Knee hook.

174
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,371
Hold on with that knee.

175
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:28,807
[Destiny] Okay.

176
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,809
From here,
you could do the carousel.

177
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,942
Put your head back.

178
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:34,987
Come down.

179
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,600
You can do Peter Pan.

180
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:41,080
Knee hook.

181
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,255
Just spin.

182
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:45,781
[Destiny]
Jesus Christ. [laughs]

183
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,609
Then you can go
into a fairy sit.

184
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:49,741
Oh.

185
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,613
Stag.

186
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,702
- [Destiny] That's pretty.
- Reverse stag.

187
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:55,181
That's pretty too.

188
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,400
Scissor sit.

189
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:00,143
Table top.

190
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,536
I can't do that.

191
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,451
You can do that.
You're gonna do that.

192
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,366
- [blows raspberry]
- A climb.

193
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:10,240
What if you don't have muscles
to do that?

194
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,198
- You have muscles to do this.
- I don't have any.

195
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,896
Every girl
has muscles to do this.

196
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,115
You could do this one,
this is a martini.

197
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,031
Fireman down.

198
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:24,472
Boom.

199
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,257
- That's... pretty good.
- Ready?

200
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,563
Push it, baby.

201
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,391
You go.

202
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:33,829
- There you go. Just point your toes.
- Okay.

203
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,134
There you go.
Hold yourself up.

204
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:36,353
I'm trying.

205
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,748
Try laying flat across.
Do a tabletop.

206
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:42,359
They all love seeing that.
Makes you look strong.

207
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,578
Okay.

208
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:48,583
- There you go. Yes. Okay.
- Yeah?

209
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:51,368
- This does hurt my vagina.
- Can you grab your foot?

210
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,631
There you go.

211
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,241
- This doesn't look sexy.
- You know what?

212
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,634
- Thumb up your butt, almost.
- Thumb up my butt?

213
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:57,940
- You know how to do that.
- How do I...

214
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:59,550
- Put your head back.
- I'm gonna fall.

215
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,247
You're not gonna fall.
Straighten your legs out.

216
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,510
- Both of them?
- Point your toes.

217
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,338
Yes! Yeah, point your toe.

218
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:07,340
[screams playfully]
Oh, my God.

219
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,087
We gotta get you outta those
training pumps into a good shoe.

220
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,959
I know.
It's hard for me to balance.

221
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:19,875
No. It's easier in these.

222
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,399
Hey, you know Diamond
from the Bronx, right?

223
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:25,228
What's up, baby-boogie-down-
fucking-Bronx-bitch?

224
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:26,359
[Ramona laughs]

225
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:28,361
Come on, she's gonna help you.

226
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:29,493
- You're gonna help me?
- You're gonna help us out right now.

227
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,451
- Get in the chair.
- Okay.

228
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,974
Get in the chair.

229
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:34,411
You're gonna help her learn
how to do a real dance.

230
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:36,544
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay. I'm good with that.

231
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,763
- Okay.
- Come on. Show me what the fuck you got.

232
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,461
[laughs]

233
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:42,811
[Ramona] There, that's good.

234
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,117
I really just go like that.

235
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,424
- [Ramona] No, wait. Wait.
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

236
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:49,557
- [Destiny] I'm trying to grind his dick.
- Arch your back more.

237
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:51,907
Oh, my. Move your hair,
look at me or something.

238
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,649
- Push your butt out.
- No. I know I'm hopeless.

239
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:56,128
No, look, that's it.

240
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,348
You don't have to be
the best dancer.

241
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:01,873
You just have to make their eyes
move just one inch. Come here.

242
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:03,179
- What do you mean?
- Let me tell you something.

243
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:04,180
- [Ramona] Show her.
- [Destiny] Okay.

244
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:05,747
Watch and learn.

245
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,488
- You fucking sit there.
- Sit, ma. Come on.

246
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:10,360
You drain the clock and not
the motherfucking cock,

247
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:11,753
you know what I'm saying?

248
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,494
And you just go slow.
Right there.

249
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:14,843
- Slow.
- And you look at them.

250
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:16,192
- Super slow.
- [Diamond] Uh-huh.

251
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,933
- Slower.
- A little slower.

252
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,674
- Slower.
- Sexier.

253
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:21,240
- Yes.
- And look back at it.

254
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,722
Oh, yeah. They love that.
The slower the better.

255
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,289
Like a motherfucking sloth.

256
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:27,812
- That's $20 right there.
- Slow.

257
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,771
Remember, drain the clock,
not the cock.

258
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,642
- Drain the clock, not the cock.
- [Ramona] That's it.

259
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:34,427
Come on, now you look
like you're taking a shit.

260
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:36,604
[all laughing]

261
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,476
You can't deny she got it.
We gonna make some money tonight.

262
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,304
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

263
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,088
I said: "Are we gonna make
some fucking money tonight?"

264
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,829
[strippers] Yeah!

265
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:47,571
Tracey, have you met Destiny?

266
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:49,051
No. Hey.
You're from Queens, right?

267
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,531
Yeah, Kew Gardens.

268
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:52,184
- Okay, I'm from Briarwood.
- Cool. Yeah.

269
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,838
Yeah.

270
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:54,883
- [Star singing operatically]
- And this is Star.

271
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:55,971
Hi.

272
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,538
And you've gotta meet Liz.

273
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,757
Liz. Liz!

274
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,629
She playin' a song
for Jackie's new titties.

275
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,066
- They're double-Ds!
- Jackie got new titties?

276
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,111
Yeah! New titties!

277
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,984
- It's this new gummy-bear technology.
- Yes! Who did these?

278
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,376
- Dr. Bobby.
- These are good.

279
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,464
Isn't he amazing?

280
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,031
Thank God for Dr. Bobby.

281
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,208
And this is Mercedes.
This my baby.

282
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,297
Hi. Nice to meet you.

283
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,690
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Destiny.

284
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:20,778
Tracey.

285
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,171
Your boyfriend's here.

286
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,955
- What? Girl, again?
- And he's crying.

287
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,478
Crying?

288
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:27,045
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah, hon.

289
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,699
What? Girl, what's going on
with Rodrigo?

290
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,701
Girl, I don't know. He's
just been so jealous lately.

291
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,311
- "Lately"?
- [Tracey] Yeah.

292
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,357
You can't let him drop
you off. You know that.

293
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,054
I know.
But, like, you know how it is.

294
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,753
- At first, he liked this shit.
- Of course he did.

295
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:40,711
'Cause you wanna know why?

296
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,018
These motherfuckers think that
it's so fun to date a stripper

297
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,935
'cause it's like, "We move, and we fuck.
And we fuck the best. It's the shit."

298
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:50,068
And then, when they realize
that we work six nights a week,

299
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,680
last shit we wanna see
is their damn dicks.

300
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,464
Okay!

301
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:57,946
I just wanna chill on my couch
in some feetie pajamas

302
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,733
with my nigga, ice cream, no makeup,
and for damn sure not with these on.

303
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,998
Wait. I just make my boyfriend
masturbate beside me.

304
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:09,174
- [Ramona] What?
- Is that weird?

305
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,612
Shit. I haven't had sex
in two years.

306
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:13,135
- Oh, baby.
- [Diamond] Two years?

307
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,354
Well, I have a boyfriend.

308
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,529
[Ramona] Since when?

309
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:17,705
Since now.

310
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,490
[all laughing]

311
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,753
He don't bother me.
He don't get jealous.

312
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:25,408
The only time he complain is when I
don't change the batteries, bitch.

313
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:27,802
[laughing]

314
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,499
Too bad he ain't got no money.

315
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,544
Well, bitch, I can't

They take your handwriting
and they make it into a font.

And then put it into your computer so
you can type with your own handwriting.

00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,354
Time flies, right?

627
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:15,531
Uh... [clears throat]
Where are you?

628
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:18,665
Well, you know,
I just got back to the city.

629
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,537
Um, I moved to Arizona
a few years ago.

630
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:24,845
- But I've missed the seasons.
- I'm just gonna take this downstairs.

631
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,282
And I really missed you.

632
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,284
[baby babbling]

633
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,720
Are you still there?

634
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:32,679
Yes, uh, I'm still here.

635
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:34,855
Um, I'm ju... [sighs]

636
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:36,726
Do you, uh...

637
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,510
Do you need to get that?

638
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:39,947
What?

639
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,949
Do you need to help the baby?

640
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,430
No, that's my friend's baby.
I'm just watching it.

641
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:47,258
Listen, I really didn't mean
to bother you.

642
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,217
I mean, if you're not happy
to hear from me,

643
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,828
- I can call somebody else.
- No, no. I'm happy.

644
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:55,092
I just wish that you
had called sooner.

645
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,355
Fatima came back.

646
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,619
Who?

647
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,403
My fiancée.

648
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,753
I mean... [stammers] my wife.

649
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:07,061
My fiancée became my wife.

650
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,889
Right. Yeah.
I know, that's how it happens.

651
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:10,499
- Okay. Bye, Stephen.
- If you...

652
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,558
So, your last job was in 2008?

653
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:29,431
Yes. But it's not like I was...

654
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,302
I mean, I had a baby.

655
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,174
So, I was busy doing that.

656
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:36,481
A year of waitressing.

657
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:39,006
Did you graduate high school?

658
00:33:39,571 --> 00:33:42,183
Oh, I see here
you got your GED.

659
00:33:44,228 --> 00:33:47,101
Five years
at Sin City Cabaret.

660
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:50,800
- What did you do there, exactly?
- Bartending, mostly.

661
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:54,412
And what about at Moves?

662
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:55,718
Bartending, mostly.

663
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:59,722
So you really don't have
any retail experience.

664
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,463
No, not yet.

665
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,683
But that's why I'd really like
to get retail experience

666
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:05,206
because then I would have it.

667
00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:09,514
We're really looking for
someone with retail experience.

668
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:12,343
[scoffs]

669
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,172
Well, how am I supposed to get retail
experience without retail experience?

670
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,566
I mean, I sold beer.
What's the difference?

671
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:20,787
[TV playing]

672

[baby crying]

673
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,967
Baby, come here.

674
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:28,969
Did Nana fall asleep?

675
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,058
There we go.

676
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:33,147
Are you okay?

677
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,507
[breathes shakily]

678
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:54,429
[chattering]

679
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:56,910
You're in my seat.

680
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,563
I'm so sorry.

681
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:04,744
[both speaking Russian]

682
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:06,876
You're so pretty.

683
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,313
[strippers speaking Russian]

684
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,371
[Mom] Another Red Bull?

685
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,677
Mom!

686
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:28,898
Hey! Welcome back, sweetie.

687
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:30,595
- They have you up front now?
- Yup.

688
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,293
What the hell happened
to this place?

689
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:33,773
2008 happened.

690
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:35,470
The guys
don't wanna spend money.

691
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:37,472
The girls
don't wanna share tips.

692
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:40,170
Management has taken the cameras
out of the Champagne Room.

693
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:42,869
And I'm up front
in customer service.

694
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:44,871
Yes, I see you. Hello.

695
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:46,046
Another Red Bull?

696
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,222
Who are these girls?

697
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:49,919
Russians, mostly.

698
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:51,965
They look like models.

699
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:54,968
They're giving blow jobs
for $300 a pop.

700
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:04,760
[club music thumping]

701
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:22,386
Yeah? What else you got?

702
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:27,783
Come on. Don't be a tease.
Are you a tease?

703
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,003
Feel how hard you make me.

704
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:33,963
We're not supposed to do that.

705
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,530
Oh, come on. Just stroke it.

706
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:38,489
I'll give you $100.

707
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,971
A hundred. One hundred.

708
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:43,973
Please.

709
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:47,063
Here.

710
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:48,978
Three hundred.

711
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:50,719
Pretty please.

712
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,590
Just for a minute. Come on.

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,593
Hey. We'll make
each other feel good.

[snorts]

716
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:10,434
All right.

717
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:20,488
When I got off the floor,
I saw that he gave me three 20s.

718
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:31,629
You don't have to believe me.

719
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:35,155
I'm used to people
not believing me.

720
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:41,639
I just wanted to tell you so that you
know where my head was at when I saw her.

721
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:45,992
[Ramona laughs]

722
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:03,618
Whoa.

[Destiny sniffs]

724
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,104
- [laughs] Oh, my God.
- There's no way.

725
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,237
Oh, my God,
she's fucking gorgeous.

726
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:16,718
Of course.

727
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:17,937
How old is she now?

728
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:19,503
Two and a half.

729
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,767
There's nothing like it,
is there?

730
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:24,247
[sighs]

731
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:26,597
Juliet still lets me sleep
in her bed.

732
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,599
But I just know she's gonna
throw me out any day now.

733
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,345
I missed you, you know that?

734
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:38,174
I missed you, too.

735
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,005
Where'd you go, baby?

736
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,227
[sighs]

737
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:50,926
What happened with Johnny?

738
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,629
Why didn't you call me?

739
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,590
You know that you and Lily can
always stay with me and Juju.

740
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,506
You know that.
No, don't do that. Come on.

741
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,290
No. Don't do that thing.

742
00:39:08,988 --> 00:39:10,032
Don't do that.

743
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,079
It's me.

744
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:16,212
Hey.

745
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:20,390
You remember
what we were like back then?

746
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,958
- Remember?
- [both chuckle]

747
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:24,829
We were like
fucking hurricanes.

748
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:26,614
- [Destiny chuckles]
- Weren't we?

749
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,010
[sniffs]

750
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:33,490
I just need to make money
right now, though, you know?

751
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:36,276
I just wanna, like, be independent.
Not need anybody.

752
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,973
Just me and Lily. That's it.

753
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,846
[Destiny] She told me
what happened after the crash.

754
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:48,549
With half of Wall Street unemployed,
the club wasn't far behind.

755
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:54,033
Mercedes got Ramona
a job in fashion.

756
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:56,165
I can't believe
he got arrested.

757
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,298
What am I supposed to do now?
I can't afford no lawyer.

758
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:00,430
I can barely afford
his half of the rent.

759
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:05,087
It's almost enough to make me
just call off the wedding.

760
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,610
Well?

761
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,179
I mean, come on, Sadie.
And you know I love Dragon.

762
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:13,139
But do you really wanna marry someone
who's probably going to prison?

763
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,880
I don't know.

764
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:18,709
Three to five
is a big commitment.

765
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,628
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, what's up?

766
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,936
I was hoping you wouldn't mind
if I ducked out early on Fridays

767
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,372
to pick up my kid from school.

768
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:31,331
She has half days
for the rest of the year.

769
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:33,507
Rest of the year? No.

770
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,814
No, no. No, the rest
of the school year.

771
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,951
[mumbling]

772
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:45,127
No.

773
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:47,216
Well, what if I got somebody
to cover my shift?

774
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,479
- Mercedes said that she could probably...
- Oh, my God. Come on.

775
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:51,873
Took me forever to figure out
everyone's stupid schedules.

776
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:53,657
- I know, Mark. But...
- I mean, really?

777
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:56,269
Please. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't for my kid. Okay?

778
00:40:56,443 --> 00:40:59,054
She's going through
this difficult time at school.

779
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:00,403
She's at that difficult age.

780
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:01,622
Am I the father?

781
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,930
- What?
- Am I the father?

782
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:10,021
No.

783
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:12,067
'Kay. Then why
should I give a shit? Right?

784
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:16,071
Don't she got a babysitter
or a nanny or something?

785
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:19,161
I can't afford that.

786
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:21,381
Well, you know, if you

So, you gotta get up
early tomorrow, or...

946
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,835
Let's get another drink. Hmm?

947
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,447
Hey, these are my sisters.

948
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,800
- [Ramona] Hi, sweetie!
- [Mercedes] Hi!

949
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,194
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

950
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:08,499
- Hi.
- Ramona.

951
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:09,805
- I'm Gary.
- Gary, nice to meet you.

952
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:11,154
- Nice to meet you.
- Annabelle.

953
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:12,852
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Isn't he so cute?

954
00:49:13,026 --> 00:49:14,114
Yes.

955
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,898
- I'm Destiny.
- Hi, Destiny.

956
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,466
Can I have three shots?

957
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,555
You know who he looks like,
don't you?

958
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:22,209
He looks like Tom Cruise.
Right?

959
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:24,167
- No, no. I'm thinking more smooth.
- Tom Cruise.

960
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,734
- [Destiny] It's the hair.
- Tom Cruise? I don't know about that.

961
00:49:25,908 --> 00:49:27,127
[Mercedes] I know!

962
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,258
- [Annabelle] No.
- [Destiny] It's your smile.

963
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,956
[Mercedes] It is.

964
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,131
- It's really good.
- [Mercedes] A mini Bob Saget.

965
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:32,306
- Getting more Sonny.
- Yeah!

966
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,873
Sonny Bono?

967
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:35,309
[Destiny] He's got
the twinkle in his eye.

968
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:36,223
- [Mercedes] I know!
- Here we go, guys.

969
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:37,877
This wine yours?

970
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:39,487
- Yes, that's it. No, this is mine.
- Okay, cool.

971
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:40,967
- [Gary] All right, thanks.
- [Ramona] Shots, ladies?

972
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,185
- [Annabelle] Okay. Yes.
- Yes.

973
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:43,534
You guys are sisters?

974
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,145
Yeah. Same dad,
different moms.

975
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,233
To sisters!

976
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,017
To sisters.

977
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,453
To sisters.

978
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,635
[exhales]

979
00:49:56,896 --> 00:49:58,071
[Gary, Ramona laugh]

980
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:07,471
[Ramona]
Just put him here right now.

981
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:09,169
[Mercedes] He dead?

982
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,737
- Oh, shit. We going to jail.
Damn. -[vomits]

983
00:50:11,911 --> 00:50:13,695
- [Destiny] Oh, my God.
- Help her.

984
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:15,523
- [Destiny] Oh, my God.
- [Mercedes] Does this always happen?

985
00:50:15,697 --> 00:50:17,394
No.

986
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:18,918
- [Destiny] Did we give him too much?
- I don't know.

987
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:21,572
- [Destiny grunts]
- [Ramona] Gary. Gary. Baby.

988
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:23,487
Gary, wake up. Wake up, Gary.

989
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:25,707
- Gary.
- [Mercedes] Oh, Gary.

990
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:27,448
- [Ramona] Open your eyes.
- We love you, Gary.

991
00:50:27,622 --> 00:50:29,102
- [Ramona] Gary! Wake up, Gary.
- Fuck.

992
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,669
Open your eyes, baby.

993
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,409
- Wake up, Gary! Wake up!
- [Ramona] Open your eyes.

994
00:50:32,801 --> 00:50:33,976
[breathes heavily]

995
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,064
There you go.

996
00:50:35,238 --> 00:50:36,500
What was that, Gary?

997
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:38,851
- Another round, Gary?
- What are we gonna do?

998
00:50:39,765 --> 00:50:41,462
[Ramona] What do you want?
Isn't this fun?

999
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,465
- [Destiny] Uh.
- [Ramona] That's it, baby.

1000
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:45,640
That's it, Gary.

1001
00:50:45,814 --> 00:50:46,989
Come on. Yeah, Gary.

1002
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:48,861
That's it, baby. Get it.

1003
00:50:49,035 --> 00:50:50,732
- There you go.
- [Annabelle] Come on.

1004
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:51,820
[Ramona] This one right here?
There you go.

1005
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:54,431
- You can do it.
- Come on. Come on.

1006
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:55,824
[Ramona]
What do you want, baby?

1007
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:57,391
Which one is it? That one?

1008
00:50:57,957 --> 00:50:59,001
You need help?

1009
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:02,701
This one? That pretty
gold one right here?

1010
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,790
- That's the one?
- [Gary groans]

1011
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,750
Wow. Oh, my...

1012
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,406
[club music intensifies]

1013
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:20,457
- [cork pops]
- [all cheering]

1014
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:21,545
[Mercedes] To Gary!

1015
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,721
[Ramona] Yes!

1016
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:29,162
The worst are the guys who go to
the bathroom and put on a condom,

1017
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:33,296
and then you know
you got to grind it out.

1018
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,689
So disgusting.

1019
00:51:34,863 --> 00:51:36,647
We don't have to go back.
Do we?

1020
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:39,433
- Do we have to go back?
- No, baby. Your dancing days are over.

1021
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:41,130
- Yeah?
- [Destiny] You guys,

1022
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:43,480
- I can pay off my grandma's house.
- Yeah!

1023
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:45,961
- I'm getting myself a new engagement ring.
- [Annabelle] That's so sweet.

1024
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,703
And Dragon's ass can stay in
jail for a few more weeks.

1025
00:51:48,877 --> 00:51:50,705
- Or a month. Or a year.
- [Ramona laughing]

1026
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,402
- To Gary.
- To Gary!

1027
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,664
- [Ramona] To Gary.
- I love Gary.

1028
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,057
- God bless Gary.
- To Gary.

1029
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:56,189
- [Ramona] I love you, Gary!
- To Gary.

1030
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,017
- I love you, Gary.
- Mom?

1031
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,193
Hi, baby.

1032
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,543
Hi, what happened?
Who woke you up?

1033
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:04,675
Who was it?
Some crazy lady woke you up?

1034
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:05,894
What happened?

1035
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:09,811
You guys are my real sisters.

1036
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:11,770
- I love you like you're my sisters.
- Yeah. Sisters.

1037
00:52:11,944 --> 00:52:13,075
- [Destiny] I love you.
- [Mercedes] I love you.

1038
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:14,294
Love you.

1039
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:16,905
- You know I love you though.
- Yes.

1040
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:17,993
We are a family now.

1041
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:18,907
Yeah.

1042
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,388
A family with money!

1043
00:52:21,562 --> 00:52:23,433
Yeah!

1044
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,698
What are we gonna do? We're gonna
go shopping tomorrow? Yes, we are!

1045
00:52:27,873 --> 00:52:30,136
[all cheering]

1046
00:52:33,052 --> 00:52:35,271
[laughs]
Hit the Electric Slide.

1047
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:38,666
[Destiny] Okay. I know it sounds bad
to say that we were drugging people.

1048
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,757
But you gotta understand,
in our world, this was normal.

1049
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:46,108
I mean, half these guys are
mainlining coke on their way to work.

1050
00:52:46,282 --> 00:52:48,763
But we still wanted to make it
as safe as possible.

1051
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:51,287
So, I suggested
that we tweak the recipe.

1052
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:54,508
So, what do you think?
Sixty MDMA, forty ketamine?

1053
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,730
That sounds good.

1054
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:03,169
Do we turn the liquid into a powder?
Or do we turn the powder into a liquid?

1055
00:53:14,745 --> 00:53:16,138
It's hot.

1056
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:23,754
- [Ramona] Eh, eh, eh.
- [laughs]

1057
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,497
[sizzles]

1058
00:53:48,736 --> 00:53:49,824
[Ramona grunts]

1059
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,352
Let's try it in the oven.

1060
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:00,748
[Ramona] Mm-hmm.

1061
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:03,838
Yes.

1062
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,755
How much?

1063
00:54:10,149 --> 00:54:11,367
Just a sprinkle.

1064
00:54:14,805 --> 00:54:17,156
You know, I'm still not sure
about strangers.

1065
00:54:17,852 --> 00:54:20,159
Well, that's the beauty of it,
baby, they're strangers.

1066
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:24,467
Yeah, but I don't wanna slip it to
anybody who's not already on something.

1067
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:27,035
We gotta know that
these guys like to party.

1068
00:54:27,209 --> 00:54:28,602
And that they've got money.

1069
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:31,213
Enough not to care
if some of it's missing.

1070
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:33,476
With strangers,
it's unpredictable.

1071
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:35,174
No guarantees.

1072
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:38,177
[Destiny] So, we called up
some old friends.

1073
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:43,051
Okay.

1074
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:45,184
David, is that you?

1075
00:54:45,967 --> 00:54:47,534
It's Ramona.

1076
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,231
- [Destiny giggles] Get some.
- [Mercedes chuckles]

1077
00:54:49,405 --> 00:54:50,580
Well, I can send you
a picture to jog your memory.

1078
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,452
Okay, I'll send it right now.

1079
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:55,324
Come on.
Come on, give it to me.

1080
00:54:55,977 --> 00:54:58,110
No. Turn around.
You know what they want.

1081
00:54:58,284 --> 00:54:59,807
- [Mercedes] You're into that good time.
- [Ramona] It's a sure thing.

1082
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,722
[Destiny] That's good.
That's a good angle.

1083
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,551
- My baby.
- Now we wait.

1084
00:55:05,204 --> 00:55:06,422
[Mercedes] You killed it.

1085
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:08,076
[sighs]

1086
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,426
- [phone vibrates]
- Uh...

1087
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,690
[chuckles]
This was too fucking easy.

1088
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:16,650
- Hi, David.
- [Mercedes giggles]

1089
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:18,521
Yeah, I can bring
some of my friends.

1090
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:19,696
[Annabelle laughs]

1091
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,178
David, these are my sisters.

1092

["It's Your Voodoo Working"
by Charles Sheffield playing]

1093
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,878
[all] Hi.

1094
00:55:28,053 --> 00:55:29,532
Annabelle.

1095
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,056
- David. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1096
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,014
- [Destiny] David.
- David. Nice to meet you.

1097
00:55:33,188 --> 00:55:34,711
Mercedes. Like the car.

1098
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:36,583
- [Ramona laughs]

since I was 15.

So, I was like, "Oh, my God."
And suddenly, he's there.

Nan, do you know who he is?

seen him in Us Weekly.

even more good-looking in person.

in this white Porsche.

- [Destiny] Yeah.

is to wear a hat.

- Fucking Kentucky Derby.
- Yes! That's what I thought!

But then, all of a sudden,
we're at the airport.

There was champagne,
lobster, a butler.

And I just didn't have the heart
to tell him, like, I hate flying.

So, there I am in this gorgeous marble

01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:58,792
Elizabeth.

1405
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,750
And did you grow up
with money, Elizabeth?

1406
01:10:01,926 --> 01:10:04,232
We were... comfortable.

1407
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:05,799
So, what did your parents do?

1408
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:06,887
My dad was a journalist.

1409
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:08,671
My mom's a psychiatrist.

1410
01:10:08,846 --> 01:10:10,760
And where'd you go to school?

1411
01:10:12,023 --> 01:10:13,676
Brown. For undergrad.

1412
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:15,940
What would you do for $1,000?

1413
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:21,771
Of course, the answer is gonna depend on
what you already have and what you need.

1414
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,905
- So, the...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1415
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:26,428
I don't think I should
even talk to you anymore.

1416
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:30,824
It's just, I don't know you.

1417
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:34,045
And I'm sorry, these girls are
just like my sisters, so...

1418
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,612
That's okay. I understand.

1419
01:10:38,179 --> 01:10:39,702
Ramona said the same thing.

1420
01:10:41,095 --> 01:10:42,618
You talked to Ramona?

1421
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:43,837
Yeah.

1422
01:10:45,012 --> 01:10:45,970
When?

1423
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:47,232
Yesterday.

1424
01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:48,320
Where?

1425
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,669
I went to her work.

1426
01:10:51,366 --> 01:10:52,454
[scoffs]

1427
01:10:54,326 --> 01:10:55,327
What?

1428
01:10:57,198 --> 01:10:59,026
Oh, nothing. It's just...

1429
01:11:00,245 --> 01:11:02,551
the idea of Ramona Vega
trying to go straight.

1430
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,857
That's like...

1431
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,821
Well, I mean, if you talked to her,
what do you need to talk to me for?

1432
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:16,565
I was just hoping that you could
fill in some of the blanks.

1433
01:11:17,349 --> 01:11:18,437
"Blanks"?

1434
01:11:21,788 --> 01:11:22,658
Okay.

1435
01:11:23,355 --> 01:11:24,356
Where was I?

1436
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:29,013
[chattering]

1437
01:11:29,187 --> 01:11:32,364
[scoffs] Fucking copycats.

1438
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,065
Look, I don't think
we need 'em anymore.

1439
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,240
Need who?

1440
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:40,894
The club.

1441
01:11:43,027 --> 01:11:45,159
Why should we split anything
when we can have it all?

1442
01:11:47,422 --> 01:11:50,904
[Destiny] After she cut out the club,
we had to meet our clients in hotel rooms.

1443
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:53,167
- Or in their homes upstate.
- [Ramona] Where the fuck are they?

1444
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:54,821
Annabelle's feeling
grossed-out lately.

1445
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:56,562
[Destiny] A lot of the girls
stopped showing up.

1446
01:11:56,736 --> 01:11:58,868
And what about Mercedes?
Is she feeling "grossed-out"?

1447
01:11:59,043 --> 01:12:02,002
We can't keep giving them their cut if
they're not showing up for weeks on end.

1448
01:12:04,396 --> 01:12:06,398
We need a bigger crew.
I'm gonna call Coco.

1449
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,443
No! She's a junkie.

1450
01:12:08,748 --> 01:12:10,750
[scoffs] Fine.
What about Georgia?

1451
01:12:10,924 --> 01:12:12,143
She just got out of jail.

1452
01:12:12,317 --> 01:12:13,100
Trixie?

1453
01:12:13,274 --> 01:12:14,493
She's still in jail.

1454
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,278
Ramona,
quit bringing home strays.

1455
01:12:17,452 --> 01:12:20,107
We're breaking the law here.
We don't wanna work with criminals.

1456
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:23,023
[Ramona] I didn't know how much I love
red hair until I saw you standing there.

1457
01:12:23,197 --> 01:12:25,721
- [girl] Oh, my God. Thank you.
- So amazing.

1458
01:12:25,895 --> 01:12:27,071
- [girl] I wish it was natural.
- I might dye my hair.

1459
01:12:27,245 --> 01:12:29,508
Hey, Dorothy. This is Dawn.

1460
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:31,075
Hi.

1461
01:12:31,249 --> 01:12:32,685
["Dawn [Go Away]"

♪ They call her Dawn ♪

1464
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,562
As soon as I saw her, I said,

1465
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:44,392
"Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.
You have to join us."

1466
01:12:44,566 --> 01:12:46,481
- And she said... Tell 'em what you said.
- [laughs]

1467
01:12:47,134 --> 01:12:49,354
I said, "What is it?
Like, a cult?"

1468
01:12:49,528 --> 01:12:51,356
[both laughing]

1469
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:57,014
[Ramona] It kinda is
a cult. A little bit.

1470
01:12:57,188 --> 01:12:59,407
[Destiny] It's like, if we're a
team, and we're making money,

1471
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:01,670
and we're winning games,

1472
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,456
do you suddenly start trading
players and bringing in new people?

01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,544
No, right?

1474
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:07,372
Think I'm gonna buy these.

1475

Where the fuck is she?

1476
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:10,636
Relax. She's a pro.

Three-seven.

1483
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:32,266
Yeah.
We can meet at five or six.

1484
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,573
No, six is good.
Six is good.

1485
01:13:34,964 --> 01:13:35,965
You want five?

1486
01:13:36,488 --> 01:13:37,663
- Make a decision.
- Two-four...

You've got three seconds.
One, two...

I'm gonna fucking get these!

Two-four-three-seven.

Um, two-four-three-seven.

- I got you.
- [Ramona laughs]

1497
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:05,647
Told you she was a pro.

1498
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,345
[Destiny] Dawn was no pro.

1499
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:09,956
She was a cokehead. A felon.

1500
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:13,612
- She was reckless and sloppy. And stupid.
- With the blue tie?

1501
01:14:13,786 --> 01:14:16,180
- She was out of control.
- I don't know. I've never seen him.

1502
01:14:16,354 --> 01:14:19,444
Ramona didn't care, as long as
she was making money.

01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:20,880
What's my credit limit, again?

Let's do it for the full 50.

We're never gonna
see him again.

Yes. Thank you.

01:14:33,414 --> 01:14:36,025
[Destiny] It wasn't long before
she burned through our regulars,

1510
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,506
which left us with
unpredictable strangers.

1511

What the fuck happened?

01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:47,733
[Mercedes] He said
he could dive off the roof.

1515
01:14:47,907 --> 01:14:49,430
And I said he couldn't.

1516
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:51,302
[Destiny] Well, you were right.
Where's Georgia?

1517

[Mercedes] She took off.

Where the fuck is Ramona?
This is her client!

I couldn't get in contact
with her.

[Destiny] My God.

1521
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:00,876
All right. Come on.
Help me get his legs.

1522
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:02,269
I... Is he dead?

1523
01:15:02,443 --> 01:15:03,575
Not yet.

1524
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,403
We're not gonna kill him,
are we?

1525
01:15:05,577 --> 01:15:06,969
No, we're gonna take him to the hospital.
Come on. Help me.

1526
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:09,929
- Okay.
- Help me get him. Lift.

1527
01:15:10,103 --> 01:15:11,365
[Mercedes] What the fuck?

1528
01:15:12,584 --> 01:15:14,542
- [Mercedes] You can do it. Come on.
- No, no, no.

1529
01:15:16,109 --> 01:15:17,110
Get the door!

1530
01:15:21,158 --> 01:15:23,116

I got him. [grunts]

Okay. You gotta help me with his torso.
Come on. Careful. Careful.

- Ready? -[Mercedes]
Don't scratch his booty.

Watch his head.

stop calling till you get her.

No.

- Help me get him out.
- Where are you taking him?

1561
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,164
We're gonna take him inside.

1562
01:16:55,339 --> 01:16:56,209
I thought we was
just gonna leave him here.

1563
01:16:56,383 --> 01:16:57,558
We can't just leave him.

1564
01:16:57,732 --> 01:16:58,690
I'm not going inside.

1565
01:16:58,864 --> 01:16:59,865
Mercedes, this is a business.

1566
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:01,083
No!

Help! Help!

- Help!
- [EMT 1] Here they are.

01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,706
Please, help my husband.

Help my husband!

1575
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:19,928
- [EMT 2] All right...
- [EMT 1] I'm gonna flip on three.

Are you still here? [pants]

01:18:29,215 --> 01:18:30,695
- [woman] There's Mommy.
- I'm so sorry.

1589
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:32,305
- Hi, baby.
- [Lily] Hi!

1590
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:33,872
[Lily chatters]
you were stealing money.

1591
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:35,656
[Destiny] That's funny.

1592
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:37,310
- Hey. The babysitter had to go home.
- Funny.

1593
01:18:37,484 --> 01:18:39,094
But we had ourselves
a fun sleepover, didn't we?

1594
01:18:39,268 --> 01:18:40,705
- [Destiny] Oh, yeah? I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1595
01:18:40,879 --> 01:18:42,271
Come on, Lily. Here we go.

1596
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,448
[Destiny grunts]

1597
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:46,319
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, I got her, Amy. Thanks.

01:18:48,277 --> 01:18:49,670
[Destiny]
Sweetie, we're almost there.

[Lily humming]

1600
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:13,651
Why are we walking
so fast, Mommy?

- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye. Be good.

1605
01:19:39,938 --> 01:19:42,549
[Destiny] So where was Ramona
when I needed her?

1606
01:19:44,464 --> 01:19:45,770
Bailing out Dawn again.

1607
01:19:46,335 --> 01:19:48,250
Are you kidding me?
Let me buy you lunch, baby.

1608
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:50,252
- [Dawn] Yeah? You're so good to me.
- [Ramona] Yes, of course.

- Don't ever fucking call me again.
- [Ramona] Baby.

1612
01:20:17,497 --> 01:20:21,153
Come Friday, we're looking at sunny
skies with a high of 78 degrees.

1613
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:24,286
On the weekend,
we got scattered showers...

[cries]

1615
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:43,218
I'm sorry
I wasn't there, baby.

1616
01:20:43,392 --> 01:20:46,570
[crying]

1617
01:20:53,446 --> 01:20:54,491
I know.

1618
01:21:05,371 --> 01:21:06,720
I don't wanna go home.

1619
01:21:09,288 --> 01:21:11,116
Do you and Lily
wanna stay with us?

1620
01:21:12,944 --> 01:21:13,945
Yeah.

1621
01:21:14,423 --> 01:21:15,468
Okay.

1622
01:21:19,994 --> 01:21:24,172
You know, I'm supposed to meet
someone tonight if you wanna join me.

1623
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:26,610
I mean,
take your mind off things.

1624
01:21:29,003 --> 01:21:30,788
Ain't no pressure,
just, you know...

1625
01:21:33,312 --> 01:21:34,487
If you need the money.

1626
01:21:37,011 --> 01:21:39,013
Could be a big one.

1627
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,061
[Destiny]
I knew it had to stop.

1628
01:21:44,453 --> 01:21:47,500
I kept thinking that there
was, like, this magic number.

1629
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:51,156
You know,
if I could save enough money,

1630
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,114
I could start clean.

1631
01:21:54,246 --> 01:21:55,247
Just me and Lily.

1632
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,469
Maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody.

1633
01:22:00,948 --> 01:22:02,994
Is that what happened
with Doug ♪♪♪♪?

1634
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:06,954
Uh...

1635
01:22:07,128 --> 01:22:08,565
I don't really remember
a Doug ♪♪♪♪.

1636

- Ramona said...
- Well, Ramona's a liar.

1637
01:22:13,482 --> 01:22:15,876
She'll say anything
to make herself look better.

1638
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:18,226
I mean,
what did she say about me?

1639
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,924
I'm sure she had a lot to say.

1640
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:21,882
What'd she say?

1641
01:22:22,753 --> 01:22:24,624
She said you had
a tough time growing up

1642
01:22:24,798 --> 01:22:26,757
and that you spent
a lot of time alone.

1643
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,195
You got into fights and...

1644
01:22:31,936 --> 01:22:34,155
had some bad boyfriends.

1645
01:22:35,722 --> 01:22:36,767
Okay. What else?

1646
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:43,600
That your parents were immigrants,
and that when your father left,

1647
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:46,820
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents' house.

1648
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:49,736
And never came back.

1649
01:22:51,912 --> 01:22:52,913
Is that true?

1650
01:22:58,571 --> 01:23:01,835
I mean, I thought that she was
just taking a break, you know?

1651
01:23:04,838 --> 01:23:08,276
I thought that, you know,
sometimes moms need a break.

1652
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:09,974
[Destiny sniffles]

1653
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,498
Why would she tell you all that?
[exhales sharply]

1654
01:23:13,673 --> 01:23:16,981
I think she just wanted me
to understand that, for you,

1655
01:23:17,155 --> 01:23:19,200
this wasn't about revenge.

1656
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:23,335
You were just trying
to make friends.

1657

Destiny.

1658
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:35,260
I know I'm supposed to think
that what you did was terrible

1659
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:37,001
and that these guys
didn't deserve it.

1660
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:41,266
But to tell you the truth,
I don't feel sorry for them.

1661
01:23:42,354 --> 01:23:44,182
[inhales sharply]
Well, I feel sorry for them.

[Destiny sniffles, grunts]

You know,
I keep having this nightmare.

1664
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:55,106
Right? Where, like, I'm in
the back seat of this car.

1665
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,324
This moving car.

1666
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:01,460
And I realize that nobody
is driving the car.

1667
01:24:02,461 --> 01:24:06,595
And I have to get to the front seat
to try to stop it, and I go there,

1668
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:10,251
and no matter what I do,
I can't get a grip on it.

1669
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:12,297
And I can't, like, stop it.

1670
01:24:12,906 --> 01:24:15,648
[sniffs] And then I wake up.

Hello?

1679
01:25:15,447 --> 01:25:17,666
[Destiny]
So Ramona met Doug years ago.

1680
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,061
Doug's friend took him to the
club to blow off some steam

1681
01:25:21,235 --> 01:25:22,933
after a few
devastating events.

1682
01:25:23,107 --> 01:25:24,499
I don't know
that it is gonna be okay.

1683
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:27,764
How could it get worse?

1684
01:25:27,938 --> 01:25:30,723
[Destiny] Which included his
house being destroyed by a fire.

- [firefighters chattering]
- [sirens blaring]

01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:36,033
And separating from
the mother of his young son.

1687
01:25:38,165 --> 01:25:40,994
She never really wanted
to have kids, you know?

1688
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:45,172
So, I think when we found out
he was autistic,

1689
01:25:45,346 --> 01:25:48,175
I think she just
couldn't handle it, you know?

1690
01:25:48,654 --> 01:25:49,698
[Destiny] He was nice.

1691
01:25:50,264 --> 01:25:53,050
We talked about our kids.
We talked about our exes.

1692
01:25:53,572 --> 01:25:55,356
- We had a heart-to-heart.
- [Ramona] Drinks!

1693
01:25:56,575 --> 01:25:58,925
Here we go.
That one's for you.

1694
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:00,361
- [Doug] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1695
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:02,015
[Elizabeth]
So, what happened to Doug?

1696
01:26:03,756 --> 01:26:06,498
[Ramona] So, what I miss?
What are we doing tonight?

1697
01:26:07,499 --> 01:26:08,848
[Destiny] Um...

1698
01:26:09,022 --> 01:26:10,110
[Doug] Uh...

1699
01:26:11,111 --> 01:26:13,200
The room was round.

1700
01:26:16,247 --> 01:26:18,640
There was a table.

1701
01:26:21,252 --> 01:26:23,254
They maxed out
my corporate card...

1702
01:26:24,255 --> 01:26:27,954
so my company launched
an internal investigation,

1703
01:26:28,563 --> 01:26:30,130
and I was fired.

1704
01:26:30,522 --> 01:26:32,829
[Doug] Can you please just
credit back my debit card?

1705
01:26:33,003 --> 01:26:34,874
My mortgage payment's
on there.

1706
01:26:35,527 --> 01:26:37,877
What are you talking about?
You were having a great time.

1707
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,098
Why are you doing this to me?

1708
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:46,277
Please, I have nothing.
I can't...

1709
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,019
I can't afford to not pay
my mortgage.

[Doug exhales sharply]

1716

- Put it away.
- Just give me a second.

Don't. What the...

1718

- Gimme the phone.
- Get off of me!

1719
01:27:09,169 --> 01:27:10,997
- [Ramona] Hey!
- Stop!

1720
01:27:11,171 --> 01:27:14,609
- If we don't do it, someone else will.
- Get off of me.

1721
01:27:14,783 --> 01:27:16,742

[Doug] Yes, hello. I...

1732
01:27:58,262 --> 01:28:00,394
I went to a strip club

[Doug] I was drugged,
and I have proof.

01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,539
It was weird.

1737

It was real weird.

If it hadn't been
for the tape,

1739

I would've been like, "Dude,
you're fucking full of shit."

1740
01:28:20,153 --> 01:28:22,634
[Doug] Please.
I just wanna know what happened to me.

You were fleeced, that's all.

[Dawn] Um... [chuckles] Well,
we're, like, a little gang.

1745
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,212
You were just a target.

1746

We just gave you
a little sprinkle.

So, was there a sting?

- [Dawn taps on microphone]
- One, two. One, two.

1753
01:28:48,312 --> 01:28:50,009
Hello, police.
Can you hear me?

1754
01:28:50,183 --> 01:28:51,750
I'm about to open the door.

1755
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:54,448
- Hey, did you bring the drugs?
- [Ramona] Shh.

1756
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:56,320
- [Destiny] Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

[Dawn breathes
into microphone]

1758
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,108
[Dawn] Look, like,
I don't think that he likes me.

1759
01:29:02,282 --> 01:29:04,806
So, I don't know,
I think one of you is gonna have to do it.

1760
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:06,156
Are you high?

1761
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,070
- [Dawn] What?
- Give her a break.

1762
01:29:07,244 --> 01:29:09,333
No. Me? [chuckles]

1763
01:29:09,507 --> 01:29:11,988
No, no. No. No. I don't do
that kind of stuff anymore.

1764
01:29:12,162 --> 01:29:13,728
That's just... it's not me.

1765

Hey, these are my friends
that I told you about.

1768
01:29:20,909 --> 01:29:22,694
- Hi, friends.
- This is Ramona.

1769
01:29:22,868 --> 01:29:24,565
- Ramona. Hi.
- Ramona. Hi.

1770
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:26,437
- This is...
- And I'm Rhonda.

- Rhonda. You are both very attractive.
- Rhonda. Yeah.

Thank you.

01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:33,444
Okay. Why don't you
take a seat right here.

1774
01:29:34,184 --> 01:29:36,142
We're gonna fix you a drink.

1775
01:29:36,316 --> 01:29:38,710
- So, you stay there, okay?
- You get one too. Shots? I don't know.

1776
01:29:38,884 --> 01:29:39,885
[Dawn] We'll see about that.

[Dawn chuckles]
Just a second. Hmm.

1779
01:29:52,419 --> 01:29:54,117
Hope you're thirsty.
[chuckles]

1780
01:29:59,774 --> 01:30:01,689
- Do it.
- No, just go ahead.

1781
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:03,778
Go on.

1782
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:06,520
[Destiny]
You found him. Go ahead.

1783
01:30:12,526 --> 01:30:13,875
Hi. [chuckles]

1784
01:30:14,746 --> 01:30:15,747
Here you go.

1785
01:30:15,921 --> 01:30:18,228
Yum, yum, yummers. Slàinte.

1786

[Dawn chuckles]

1787
01:30:20,186 --> 01:30:21,231
So, who's excited?

1788
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,972
I'm telling you,
it's the same fucking car.

1789
01:30:24,147 --> 01:30:26,062
You're being paranoid.

1790
01:30:26,236 --> 01:30:28,368
No, I saw the same fucking Buick
parked outside the Gansevoort.

1791
01:30:28,542 --> 01:30:30,675
It's not a Buick.

1792
01:30:30,849 --> 01:30:33,417
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's been following us for 20 minutes.

1793
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,246
- Dawn was setting us up back there.
- Dawn?

1794
01:30:37,377 --> 01:30:39,292
Now I know you're paranoid.

1795
01:30:39,466 --> 01:30:41,860
You really think that she wouldn't
sell you out to save herself?

1796
01:30:43,209 --> 01:30:44,732
[Elizabeth]
So, there was a sting?

1797
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:49,563
We cannot comment on that
at this time.

1798
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:52,175
But what we can tell you

1799
01:30:52,349 --> 01:30:54,916
is the amount of people that were willing
to talk to us was so small it was absurd.

1800
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,528
Why?

1801
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:00,226
I guess men don't wanna admit
what happened to them, you know?

1802
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,272
Being victimized by a woman.

1803

[detective 1]
So, we did some investigating,

1804
01:31:05,231 --> 01:31:06,450
and we found
the Connecticut architect

1805
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,670
who Moves said
failed to pay a $135,000 bill

1806
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:12,195
he racked up during
four visits to the club.

1807
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:14,980
"For a night of pleasure
he can't even remember."

1808
01:31:15,894 --> 01:31:17,069
What a boob.

1809
01:31:17,243 --> 01:31:18,984
"And went back
three more times"?

1810
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:20,855
[laughs]

1811
01:31:21,029 --> 01:31:22,248

[all laughing]

1813
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:25,643
[detective 1] You know,
when you look at it out of context,

1814
01:31:25,817 --> 01:31:26,905
it seems like
he's making it up.

1815
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:28,733
You're a family girl?

1816
01:31:28,907 --> 01:31:30,604
You look like my brother.

1817
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:31,692
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1818
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:33,303
- You like that?
- No.

1819
01:31:33,477 --> 01:31:35,479
Why I'm here. I mean,
it's not about the money.

1820
01:31:35,653 --> 01:31:38,221
It's about the next guy
this happens to,

1821
01:31:38,395 --> 01:31:40,614
and, like, I gotta
do something to stop that.

1822
01:31:40,788 --> 01:31:44,052
[detective 1] But when you put it
together with Doug, it all added up.

1827
01:31:54,454 --> 01:31:56,891
I mean, we got so spooked,
none of us went back to the club anymore.

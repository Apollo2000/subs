<i>Outbound traffic is piling up,
with many Los Angeles...</i>

10
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:08,451
Watch the road, please?

11
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,452
Just give me that.

00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:12,621
- <i>...in quarantine.</i>
- Fuck! Come on, man!

13
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,656
What is this guy doing?

14
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,759
- Come on.
- <i>Police have already shut down the 405 freeway...</i>

15
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,026
What time do we
have to be there?

16
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:20,395
In a little less
than an hour.

Give me a spot.
Give me a spot.

24
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:39,047
- Give me a spot...
- <i>Authorities are asking people to remain calm.</i>

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,049
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,351
You can't just
leave your car here.

27
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,520
- It's gonna get towed.
- I don't fucking care. They can tow it.

28
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:45,521
<i>Avoid crowded areas.</i>

29
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:46,988
We'll get it
when we get back.

30
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,424
Get the bags.
I'm gonna get the tickets.

31
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:50,392
- Okay! Okay.
- Go, go, go, go.

What do we do?

47
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:41,610
We're gonna get out of here.

48
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:21,849
<i>All special experts
on the team</i>

49
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:25,087
<i>are stuck in Philadelphia,
trying to get military flights,</i>

50
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,522
<i>because there are no longer
commercial flights running</i>

51
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:28,624
<i>from the city.</i>

52
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:47,742
<i>I heard rumors.</i>

53
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,744
<i>Actually, she let
her body go all limp.</i>

54
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:51,813
<i>It... It like,
makes it hard to drive.</i>

55
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:52,615
<i>Yeah.</i>

56
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:54,549
<i>And then Slate Atkins
saw him</i>

57
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:55,951
<i>and chased him off
with his shotgun.</i>

58
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,886
- <i>But it's dangerous.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

59
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,155
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

60
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:00,823
<i>What's wrong, Katie?</i>

61
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,793
<i>You seem a little off tonight.</i>

62
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:05,628
<i>What do you mean?</i>

63
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:07,897
<i>It is kind of weird that</i>

64
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,598
<i>we don't know anything
about you.</i>

65
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,436
<i>We've been working together
for like seven months now?</i>

66
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:26,549
Hey, you.

67
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:27,916
Hey.

68
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:30,753
Can't sleep?

69
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:34,689
It's gonna be okay.

70
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,127
What's the plan?

71
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,897
You always have a plan.

72
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,932
Guessing it's not holing up

73
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:46,067
in this shitty motel room
for a month.

74
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,573
I love it, but...

75
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,675
I'm waiting for a call
from my friend.

76
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:54,642
He owes me a favor.

77
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,111
What kind of favor?

78
00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:58,547
A flight.

79
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:01,616
Okay.
Where are we going?

80
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,558
- No. No.
- Baby?

81
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,226
- No, no, no. No.
- Ava?

82
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,760
Listen to me.

83
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:14,563
The virus has not
spread there yet.

84
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,131
We'll go there.
We'll wait it out.

85
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:19,068
And then as soon as it's over
we will come right back home.

86
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,070
I can't believe you
right now.

87
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:22,237
It's in the middle
of nowhere.

88
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,571
It's perfect.
It's a farm.

89
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:26,174
- Your family hates me.
- No. They don't.

90
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:27,943
Your brother,
he hates me.

91
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:28,976
No. I...

92
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,578
Look, why don't you
go stay with your family?

93
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,214
I'm sure it'll be much better.

94
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:44,493
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,633
I didn't mean that.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,505
You're welcome there.
They love you.

97
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,075
Listen,
I know what I'm asking.

98
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,082
But, it's...
It's our only option.

99
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:10,285
We can go, literally,
like anywhere else.

100
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:11,486
What do you mean?

101
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,621
You just wanna drive around
and look for somewhere safe,

102
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,157
when we know we
have a safe place?

103
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,959
- It's not safe.
- It is.

104
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,126
Then we're gonna lay low.

105
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,861
It's gonna be fine.

106
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,267
God, you always do this.

107
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:43,818
I promise you I will never
let anything bad happen to you.

108
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,116
Hello?

109
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:18,254
Yeah.
Hold on.

110
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:22,892
<i>Yeah.</i>

111
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:26,127
<i>Yeah, we, um...
We made it out.</i>

112
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:27,762
<i>Great.
That's great.</i>

113
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:30,866
Yeah,
we're a couple hours away.

114
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,635
We'll see you shortly.

115
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,770
Bye.

116
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:42,243
You ready to go?

117
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,926
Hey.
Come on.

118
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,761
<i>Hey.</i>

119
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,229
<i>Thank you so much again.</i>

120
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,666
<i>Don't worry about it.
I owe you big.</i>

121
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,402
<i>Actually, before I forget.</i>

122
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>Ava, come here.</i>

123
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,344
He's gonna take
your temperature.

124
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay, hold still.

125
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:23,951
We gotta get going.

126
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:25,887
Hey, I'm sorry
about the delay.

127
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,289
It's not about the wait.

128
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,358
I gotta get flying
before they won't let us

129
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,193
up in the air anymore.

130
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,116
Hey!
Hey now.

131
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:54,883
Now.

132
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,218
What are you doing?
Come here.

133
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,885
Stop freaking out.

134
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,020
Ava! Ava!

135
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,088
Look at me.
Stop freaking out.

136
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,356
Look at me.
Come here.

137
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:02,791
Come here.
Come here.

138
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,226
Come, come...
Eye contact.

139
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,427
Look at me.

140
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,997
You don't have to see anybody
that you don't want to see.

141
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:10,433
Okay?

142
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,769
You're gonna be fine.

143
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:16,972
Do you believe me?

144
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:19,842
You're gonna be fine.

145
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,202
Kel?

146
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,937
Kel, what are you doing?

147
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,105
<i>Kelly!</i>

148
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,040
<i>Stop the plane!
Stop the plane!</i>

149
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,141
<i>Kelly!</i>

150
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,242
<i>Kelly!</i>

151
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:56,412
<i>Kelly!</i>

152
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,366
- What?
- <i>Baby? Hey.</i>

153
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,467
Did you make it okay?

154
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,904
You can't force me to
come here and then ditch me.

155
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,939
<i>I'm sorry I tricked you.</i>

156
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:05,940
<i>I knew you wouldn't go</i>

157
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:08,009
<i>if you didn't think I was
gonna go, too.</i>

158
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,412
<i>They asked me to cover
the CDC in Atlanta.</i>

159
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:11,679
<i>I had to go.</i>

160
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:13,948
Then you should have
left me in LA!

161
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:14,949
<i>Okay.
I'm sorry.</i>

162
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:16,617
Just sit tight.
My brother's gonna pick you up.

163
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,253
I'll call you later tonight.

164
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,154
<i>Look at that.
Look at that.</i>

165
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,490
<i>Can you start getting
pictures of this stuff?</i>

166
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:22,424
<i>Look at this guy,
right here.</i>

167
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,428
Hey.

168
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,429
Ava.

169
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:48,443
Hey, Max.

170
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:49,678
Hey.

171
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:52,279
Things calming down
for you guys at all?

172
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:54,015
About the same
as it's been.

173
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:56,117
Hey, you're Ava Boone,
right?

174
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:59,020
- Hi.
- Makes sense you know Max.

175
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:01,623
Well, I won't hold you up.

176
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,525
Let me know if
you hear anything.

177
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:04,793
You got it.

178
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,528
- And be safe.
- You, too.

179
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,728
Take care.

180
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,297
Thanks.

181
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,307

Oh, sweetheart.

Oh!
Oh, oh.

200
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:11,092
I am so glad to see you!
Let me look at you.

201
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,428
Oh!
How beautiful you are.

202
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,164
Look at your hair!
It's so long, Amanda.

203
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,164
I mean Ava.

204
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:18,866
I always slip back,
don't I?

205
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,102
- It's fine.
- Come on in.

206
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,670
Make yourself at home.

207
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,541
<i>She's gonna be
another mouth to feed.</i>

how to do anything.</i>

209
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,310
- <i>I'm just gonna have to...</i>
- <i>Give her a chance.</i>

210
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:39,446

211
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,650
<i>I don't want her family
coming around the house.</i>

212
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:43,617
<i>I don't want anything
to do with what he's up to.</i>

213
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,786
<i>She shouldn't get
mixed up in it either.</i>

214

218
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,336
Sorry.

219
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:03,205
Oh!
It's all right.

220
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:04,939
Come on in.
Have a cup of coffee.

221
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:15,416
I get it that it wasn't
your choice to be here.

222
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,318
But I'm really happy
you're here.

223
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:19,187
Don't mind Max.

224
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:20,487
You know how he is,
set in his ways.

225
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:21,523
Maybe a girl
would be interested

226
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:22,957
if he loosened up
a little bit.

227
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,759
Oh, trust me.
There's plenty of girls.

228
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:27,795
Just no settling down.

229
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,765
Oh, I think I'm gonna
take a little rest.

230
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,235
Would you mind taking
that out to the boys?

231
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:35,903
They'll be starving by now.

232
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,475
Max?

233
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,443
What?

234
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:44,446
Brought lunch.

235
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,813
Put it on the fridge.

236
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:52,686
<i>Hi.</i>

237
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,355
I fed your cows.

238
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,258
I bailed your hay.

239
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,693
What else you need?

240
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:02,563
Hi.

241
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:05,234
Hi.

242
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:07,302
I'm Ava.

243
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:08,603
Yeah.

244
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:10,706
I know.

245
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:11,939
That's Jake.

246
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:16,245
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

247
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:17,411
How's the fence?

248
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:18,513
Fence?

249
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:19,780
I started it.

250
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:21,682
Yeah, I need you to
finish that today.

251
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:24,285
It's raining.

252
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,654
You're gonna get wet?

253
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:29,957
- All right.
- Take Ava with you.

254
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,992
- Hm?
- What?

255
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,661
Yeah.

256
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:35,596
You gotta earn your beer.

257
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:39,301
You got any pants?

258
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,541
Ow!

259
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:47,808
Fuck.

260
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:51,713
- You all right?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,689
Used to be
three of us out here.

262
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,792
You know,
everybody got scared.

263
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,526
Going home to their families.

264
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,561
Now it's just me.

265
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:08,863
- And this is a huge property.
- Yeah, I know.

266
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,534
Here. Why don't you
grab one of these?

267
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,101
Get a good one.

268
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,736
How do you know
it's a good one?

269
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:17,606
You'll know.

270
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,409
Stick it right there.

271
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:21,809
This way?

272
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:23,745
Yeah, like that.
Hold it tight.

273
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:26,448
- Are you seriously gonna hit that?
- Just hold it.

274
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,551
You slide this on top.

275
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:32,486
Scoot.

276
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:34,755
And then...

277
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,495
I'm taking out
all my anger issues

278
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,463
on this fucking fence.

279
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:46,501
- It's leaning a little bit.
- Well...

280
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,037
It's the thought that counts.

281
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,805
All right.
First day.

282
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:55,169
<i>You have nineteen
new voice messages.</i>

283
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,838
<i>Hey, Ava?</i>

284
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:00,909
<i>Look, I'm sorry.</i>

285
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:04,446
<i>You know I'd be going crazy
if I was back there right now.</i>

286
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:06,448
<i>I...
I couldn't sit this one out.</i>

287
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:09,217
<i>I just wanted you
to be safe.</i>

288
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,718
<i>Will you just call me back
so that we can talk about this?</i>

289
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,789
<i>Okay?
I miss you.</i>

290
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:36,477
You're good at this.

291
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,447
Yeah, I used to do it
when I was a kid.

292
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,216
Why don't you
take care of her?

293
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,485
I'll go look after
the big ones.

294
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:44,685
Okay.

295
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,455
<i>Have fun!</i>

296
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,311
It's for your hands.

297
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:23,685
What's all that?

298
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,119
Oh, I have the...

299
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:28,021
I have the main house
and barn on back-up.

300
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:31,759
The solar panels
and pump generators.

301
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:36,197
I didn't know you were
such a doomsday buff.

302
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:40,068
I like to be prepared.

303
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,371
<i>Officials say that this
a temporary precaution.</i>

304
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:46,707
<i>Many residents are wary
of being stranded long-term...</i>

305
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:51,145
What do you need?
Okay.

306
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:53,715
Oh.
Oh, sweetie?

307
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:56,183
Will you make sure
we get this, please?

308
00:23:58,852 --> 00:23:59,955
Yeah.
Thanks.

309
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:05,293
You need to
vacuum-seal those.

310
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,833
Hey.
Go with him.

311
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,969
I've gotta...
redo all these.

312
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:17,138
I'll take care of it.

313
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:19,808
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

314
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,943
Hey!
I'm coming with you.

315
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:25,013
No, you're not.

316
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:26,715
Go finish with the meat.

317
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:37,291
<i>Gas prices have been
sky rocketing,</i>

318
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:39,794
<i>starting at just a few dollars
a gallon last week.</i>

319
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:42,195
<i>We're now seeing a range
anywhere from ten</i>

320
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,698
<i>to thirty dollars a gallon.</i>

321

<i>We've got Walker
on the line right now.</i>

322
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,404
<i>Walker,
what are you hearing?</i>

323
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,140
<i>Nationally, we're facing
a huge crisis of fuel</i>

324
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:53,807
<i>and panic issues.</i>

325
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:55,909
<i>Gas stations can't
keep up with the demand,</i>

326
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,377
<i>while deliveries are stalled,</i>

327
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,813
<i>causing many residents
to stockpile fuel.</i>

328
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,215
Whoa.
This is everything?

329
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:04,184
<i>That's all we got.</i>

330
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:05,687
- Come on. No...
- <i>Sorry.</i>

331
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,822
<i>...the fuel shortage
is taking a toll on</i>

332
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:09,957
<i>public transportation
as well.</i>

333
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,825
<i>Many bus lines
have stopped running,</i>

334
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:14,028
<i>causing businesses
to close temporarily</i>

335
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,797
<i>due to absent employees.</i>

336
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:42,457
- What?
- Stay in the car.

337
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:44,692
- Are you kidding?
- Just stay in the car.

338
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:56,904
Hey.

339
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:58,406
You're good.

340
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,782
All right.
You know what to do.

341
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:08,982
What do you think?

342
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:10,851
We're gonna... We're gonna
need some defense or something.

343
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:12,853
Shh. Shh.

344
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,000
<i>Yeah, I mean,
the interstate travel ban</i>

345
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,468
<i>is affecting the delivery of
infrastructure, particularly...</i>

346
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,570
Hey.

347
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:32,039
- <i>...of the remote and more rural...</i>
- Hey.

348
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,842
How're you feeling?

349
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:36,644
Great.

350
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,845
<i>...there's a lot of chaos
going on as they work</i>

351
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,646
<i>to figure out exactly how
this virus is spreading...</i>

352
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,981
Yeah, you should
be Sheriff, Buck.

353
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:49,289
You sure you can spare it?

354
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:51,258
I'd rather you
have it than them.

355
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:55,963
Speaking of,
Bob wants a word.

356
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,532
<i>Reporting earlier,
officials in LA</i>

357
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:00,101
<i>have set up a triage center
at Dodger Stadium</i>

358
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:03,003
<i>to attempt to handle the
heavy influx of patients.</i>

359
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:05,305
<i>Doctors have cordoned
off specific sections...</i>

360
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,407
Oh, hey.

361
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,109
- Great, Bob.
- What do you want?

362
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:12,280
What can I get for you,
Amanda?

363
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:14,181
Um, shot and a beer?

364
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:19,886
My granddaughter sure
loved that TV show of yours.

365
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,856
They're all into that,
uh, vampire stuff.

366
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:25,226
Now what is it?
Zombies?

367
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:26,226
Werewolves.

368
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:27,861
Yeah.
That's it.

369
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:30,897
How about you, Jake?
You want another pop?

370
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,600
- <i>Quarantines are expanding from twenty-three</i>
- <i>No, ma'am.</i>

371
00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:34,901
- <i>US cities to nearly sixty.</i>
- All rightie.

372
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:37,171
<i>The number of reported
cases domestically</i>

373
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:39,607
<i>has reached
ninety-thousand.</i>

374
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,908
<i>Compared to
seven hundred-thousand...</i>

375
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,910
Oh my God,
I'm stuck here forever.

376
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:44,846
<i>This is happening.</i>

377
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,448
- <i>I didn't know we've gotten to that point.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

378
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,182
Well take a look
at the news, man.

379
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,318
And they're only
getting worse.

380
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,852
What are they talking about?

381
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:57,390
Oh, they're talking
about forming a militia.

382
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:59,960
And Max doesn't think
it's a good idea.

383
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:04,364
<i>You can be with us,
or you cannot be with us.</i>

384
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,301
So I'm acting like
I'm going to war?

385
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:08,535
Call it what you want.

386
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:10,371
But this is how it is.

387
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,344
I'll be back.

388
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,512
<i>All of this is adding
to the sense of fear</i>

389
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:21,248
<i>and chaos as people fight
to get home to their families...</i>

390
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,989
It's all right.
It's all right.

391
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:39,165
Amanda, we've been
worried about you.

392
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:40,333
When'd you get back?

393
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:41,502
Why didn't you call?!

394
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:43,371
She doesn't wanna
talk with you.

395
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,138
None of your business,
Rhodes.

396
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:46,407
Come on.

397
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:49,409
Step away from the truck.
Let's go home.

398
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:53,648
Step out of the way, son.

399
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,985
Can't do that.

400
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:03,291
This is family business.

401
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:05,125
I said step aside.

402
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:09,997
<i>Hey!</i>

403
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:11,466
<i>Hey!</i>

404
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,702
<i>Not in my place!</i>

405
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:18,573
Now, you know I have zero
tolerance for this crap.

406
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:21,542
Get back inside.

407
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:08,623
Hey.

408
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,727
Dinner will be ready
in an hour.

409
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,330
You take a day off?

410
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:20,601
<i>I had a meeting.</i>

411
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:23,603
Where?

412
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:30,311
Hm?

413
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:39,087
They're doing something,
Max.

414
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,221
What do you think
we're doing?

415
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,326
All right.

416
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,328
If you keep hanging out
with those guys,

417
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:49,097
don't bother coming back.

418
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:26,132
Where's the rest
of your insulin?

419
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,601
I only have the one bottle.

420
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:33,174
I'll be fine, sweetheart.

421
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:46,553
Okay.

422
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,855
Ava, hey, uh...

423
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:51,192
Give me a call
whenever you can.

424
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,493
Please?

425
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,564
<i>You should call him back.</i>

426
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,233
Why?

427
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:00,601
He's just worried.

428
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,303
He's trying to do
the best that he can.

429
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:04,504
In his way.

430
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:06,306
Then maybe he
should be here.

431
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,674
<i>I just checked again.</i>

432
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,576
<i>We have no insulin in stock.
Sorry...</i>

433
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:16,583
This isn't working.

434
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:21,621
How long is the bottle
gonna last?

435
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:23,524
Not long enough.

436
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,394
Where are you going?

437
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:27,829
<i>I'm going out.</i>

438
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:30,663
- Right now?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

439
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:32,199
<i>Lock up.</i>

440
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,537
Where are you going first?
You don't have a plan.

441
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,880
<i>And we have Kelly Rhodes
on the line outside Atlanta.</i>

442
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:48,481
<i>Kelly, any updates
from the CDC?</i>

443
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:49,416
<i>Uh, thanks.</i>

444
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:51,451
<i>Well, the CDC has declined
to comment</i>

445
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,786
<i>and they haven't updated
their statement from last week.</i>

446
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,790
<i>But, I've gotta say tensions
are high inside Atlanta.</i>

447
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:58,859
<i>As you know, strict travel bans
have been in place</i>

448
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:01,327
<i>for several weeks now.</i>

449
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:03,597
<i>Frankly, people are scared.</i>

450
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,866
<i>They wanna get
their families out.</i>

451
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:07,834
<i>They want information.</i>

452
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:10,271
<i>I think until we get
some sort of positive news,</i>

453
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:13,373
<i>we're gonna continue
to see civil unrest escalate.</i>

454
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:52,980
<i>Hey, this is Kelly Rhodes.</i>

455
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,348
<i>You know what to do.</i>

456
00:33:57,918 --> 00:33:59,719
<i>Hey. Um...</i>

457
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:04,225
<i>I know I've been avoiding
all your calls, but...</i>

458
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:06,994
<i>...you should know your mom,
she's really getting sick.</i>

459
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,628
<i>I don't know how
much she's told you,</i>

460
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:11,532
<i>but the insulin
will be out really soon.</i>

461
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,302
<i>If you could do anything.
Make some calls.</i>

462
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,470
<i>We could really use
your help.</i>

463
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:20,974
<i>Look, I know you think
what you're doing is important.</i>

464
00:34:22,675 --> 00:34:24,477
<i>We really need you here,
too.</i>

465
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:27,747
<i>So just, come home.</i>

466
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:33,286
Okay.

467
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:50,438
- Any day now.
- Shut up.

468
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,514
<i>Focus on those bottles!</i>

469
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:09,990
This is a shotgun.

470
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:14,561
All right.

471
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:16,264
Yeah, you don't
hold it like that.

472
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:19,033
You wanna hold it...

473
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:22,869
...in the pock
in your shoulder.

474
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,472
Okay, keep your elbow out.

475
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,573
- See how it creates that pocket in there?
- Mm-hm.

476
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,610
Okay.
You're gonna take your cheek

477
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,644
and put it against the stock.

478
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:33,713
Aim right down the center
of this barrel.

479
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:34,915
Okay.

480
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:36,849
All right.
Now, you barely have to aim.

481
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:38,718
You just have to point in the
direction that you want to fire

482
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:40,320
and you're gonna
hit something.

483
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:41,888
Pump it.

484
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:43,823
Now it's loaded
into the chamber.

485
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:50,030
- It's gonna be loud.
- Okay.

486
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:01,808
Yeah.

487
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:03,843
Eject it.
Now there's a new one in there.

488
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:05,478
Do the rest of them.

489
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:06,680
Okay.

490
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:13,420
This is awesome.

491
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,722
- <i>That lipstick.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

492
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,796
<i>Why do you even have
that many lipsticks?</i>

493
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:24,698
All right, so now you need
to replace my bullets.

494
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:26,066
And you need to replace
my beer.

495
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:29,001
- You need to replace...
- Shut up.

496
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:30,637
- ...your pride.
- It wasn't that bad.

497
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:32,072
You need to replace...

498
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,842
Hi, Amanda.

499
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:43,616
<i>Max?</i>

500
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,017
<i>Will you come inside,
please?</i>

501
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,453
Here, I'll...

502
00:36:57,997 --> 00:37:01,568
I always loved you in,
um, short hair.

503
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,503
But this is nice, too.

504
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:05,172
What do you want, Maddy?

505
00:37:05,204 --> 00:37:06,739
I heard you were
back in town.

506
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:07,941
I wanted to say hello.

507
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:09,142
Okay.
Thanks.

508
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:11,578
Can we talk a bit?
I...

509
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:14,715
I wanna hear
all about your life.

510
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:16,983
Really? That's it?
That's all you want?

511
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:22,789
I'm tired.

512
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:25,124
- I just need a little money.
- I knew it!

513
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:27,493
Just a little bit
to get on my feet.

514
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:29,061
You know how your father is.

515
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:30,597
I never asked you
for anything.

516
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,765
I don't owe you anything.

517
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:33,167
That's no way
to talk to your mother.

518
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,936
- You're not my mother.
- I am your damn mother.

519
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it!

520
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:44,445
Well I guess you never gave
a shit what happened to me,

521
00:37:44,477 --> 00:37:46,746
so I guess nothing's changed.

522
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,117
Hey. Hey!

523
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:55,054
It's what you want?

524
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:56,857
Here.

525
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,827
Hey.

526
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,595
Don't come back here.

527
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,553
Are you asleep out here?

528
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:02,856
No.

529
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:05,092
Just thinking.

530
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,996
She's not gonna come
back to the house.

531
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:17,070
Why did you wanna be
a farmer?

532
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:19,672
I didn't.

533
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,010
I wanted to race cars.

534
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:24,778
Um, what?

535
00:39:24,811 --> 00:39:25,845
Yeah.

536
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:27,180
When?

537
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:30,684
Oh, before Dad got sick.

538
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:33,553
But things got bad
senior year

539
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:38,092
and someone had to
take care of the farm.

540
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:40,827
College wasn't
my thing anyway.

541
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:46,200
Yeah, well at least you
graduated high school.

542
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,135
I pretend to be a werewolf.

543
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,573
Every day.

544
00:39:57,343 --> 00:40:00,146
It's a really bad show.

545
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,715
Nah.

546
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,017
Don't be so hard on yourself.

547
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:06,987
Yeah.

548
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,258
You just kind of left.

549
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,160
Real young.

550
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,731
It didn't feel like
a choice.

551
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:19,800
Yeah.

552
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,570
<i>I just had to go.</i>

553
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:25,104
<i>Change everything.</i>

554
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:26,806
<i>My name, even.</i>

555
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,778
<i>Kelly doesn't even
know all of it.</i>

556
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,914
<i>Not everything.</i>

557
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:57,271
Did you come here often?

558
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:02,275
Yeah.

559
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:04,244
I came here all the
time when I was a kid.

560
00:41:04,276 --> 00:41:05,713
By yourself?

561
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:08,148
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

562
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,916
I wouldn't take
anybody here.

563
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,224
So who's house is this?

564
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,060
Um, it was the, uh...

565
00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:22,428
hired hand
of my great-grandpa's.

566
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:23,862
No way.
What?

567
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:31,671
Um, his wife left him
and he went bankrupt.

568
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:34,107
They took what they wanted
and didn't come back.

569
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:58,765
In here.

570
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:05,005
It's a trap door.

571
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:06,473
To what?

572
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:07,507
It's just a hole
in the ground.

573
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,443
I used to hide stuff in here
when I was a kid.

574
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:11,945
Mostly booze
and cigarettes.

575
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:13,246
You got any left?

576
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:16,383
- No.
- Ugh.

577
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:17,718
Drank it all.

578
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:18,418
- I know.
- Sorry.

579
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,952
Three.

580
00:42:21,354 --> 00:42:22,989
Ugh! Okay.

581
00:42:23,021 --> 00:42:23,855
All right.
Two out of three.

582
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,191
Two out of three.
Two out of three.

583
00:42:25,224 --> 00:42:27,126
- Okay? One. Two. Three.
- One. Two. Three.

584
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:29,196
Oh my God!

585
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,898
Stupid game.
[phone ringing]

586
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:35,202
Cause you're losing.
That's why it's stupid.

587
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:39,239
<i>Hello?</i>

588
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:42,208
<i>Yes.
Yes, this is she.</i>

589
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,412
<i>He's my son!</i>

590
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:49,149
<i>No! No!</i>

591
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:53,053
<i>What do you mean
you can't locate him?</i>

592
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:55,956
- They can't find Kelly.
- Let me talk to them.

593
00:42:55,988 --> 00:42:57,157
- Stop.
- Mom!

594
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:59,425
- Stop. No.
- Let me talk to them, okay?

595
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,764
Yeah.
This is Max Rhodes.

596
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:05,164
Kelly's brother.

597
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:07,868
<i>When... When was the last time
that you saw him?</i>

598
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,737
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah.</i>

599
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:12,740
<i>What?</i>

600
00:43:59,852 --> 00:44:01,053
Hey.

601
00:44:34,486 --> 00:44:36,055
<i>...in Manhattan,
the phone lines are down</i>

602
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:37,824
<i>and we can't reach
any additional...</i>

603
00:44:56,008 --> 00:44:57,276
<i>...declare the
United States,</i>

604
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:58,611
<i>under martial law.</i>

605
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:00,980
<i>The disaster relief aid
is on its way</i>

606
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:03,249
<i>to unaffected areas
of our nation.</i>

607
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:06,185
<i>And the WHO remains
relentless in the...</i>

608
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:07,454
<i>Ava!</i>

609
00:45:09,988 --> 00:45:11,191
Mom?

610
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:12,626
Mom, listen.
Mom?

611
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:14,160
- Hm?
- Stay up.

612
00:45:14,193 --> 00:45:15,629
Grab some corn syrup.

613
00:45:16,662 --> 00:45:18,064
It's all right.

614
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:19,532
Wait.

615
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:23,469
Her blood sugar is crashing.
She's just not eating enough.

616
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:24,470
- Come on.
- That's right.

617
00:45:24,503 --> 00:45:26,572
- A little corn syrup.
- Take a little more.

618
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:28,175
There you go.
There you go.

619
00:45:28,707 --> 00:45:30,209
It's gonna be all right.

620
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:31,911
Hey.

621
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:32,646
Are you okay?

622
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:33,646
Hey, how you doing?

623
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,482
Don't. Shh.
Come on, Mom.

624
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:39,119
<i>No. No!
I said no!</i>

625
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:41,320
<i>We can't just do nothing!
It's too...</i>

626
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:48,562
<i>I can't just sit around here.</i>

627
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,231
<i>You know?
I have to at least try.</i>

628
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:25,164
- Do not get into that truck!
- Mom.

629
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:26,699
No.
Do not get in that truck.

630
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,301
- No! No!
- We have to.

631
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:30,203
You are not going!
You are not going!

632
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:31,704
- Mom!
- You are not gonna die for me.

633
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:33,340
Shh, shh!

634
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:35,275
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Please?

635
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:38,010
Please don't let him go.
Cause I can't be alone.

636
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:53,994
It looks pretty quiet.

637
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:18,618
What is that?

638
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:20,619
I don't know.

639
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:47,646
See what happened, Bob?

640
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:51,284
Just got here.

641
00:47:54,586 --> 00:47:55,220
Max!

642
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:56,756
Amanda!
Get in the truck!

643
00:47:56,789 --> 00:47:58,557
You see this, Rhodes?

644
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,325
This is what I'm talking about!

645
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:02,496
It's what I've been
talking about the whole time!

646
00:48:03,396 --> 00:48:05,131
I hear your mom's
not doing too good.

647
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:06,198
Max!

648
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:08,201
Are you heading into town?

649
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:11,304
Amanda, be smart.

650
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,376
- Max!
- Keep your head down!

651
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:17,110
Stop! Stop!

652
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:17,976
Max! Max!
Hey!

653
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,611
Let's go. We're going.
Get in the car.

654
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,180
Amanda, please?

655
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:23,249
Don't make that trip tonight.

656
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:33,426
Come on, son.

657
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:05,351
Max. Don't, don't.
Don't go out there. Don't.

658
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:06,818
Okay. Okay.
I won't.

659
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:07,821
<i>Max!</i>

660
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,592
<i>Max!</i>

661
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:16,629
Get the hell
off my property.

662
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:18,430
<i>Is Amanda in there?</i>

663
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:23,336
What do you want?

664
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:25,804
<i>I found some insulin.</i>

665
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:29,409
<i>If you get in
the truck with me,</i>

666
00:50:29,441 --> 00:50:31,477
<i>I'll leave it out here
for them.</i>

667
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,679
<i>Look, we don't have
power like you do,</i>

668
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:36,783
<i>so the sooner you get it
into your fridge the better.</i>

669
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:41,954
- No.
- Max.

670
00:50:42,854 --> 00:50:44,356
<i>Amanda?</i>

671
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:45,791
<i>You belong with your family.</i>

672
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,561
No you don't.

673
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:51,597
Max, we have to.
Your mom.

674
00:50:51,863 --> 00:50:54,568
It'll be at the house
when you change your mind.

675
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:05,678
We're gonna be okay.

676
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:11,650
Hey. Hey.

677
00:51:11,983 --> 00:51:13,852
We'll find another way.

678
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:16,990
She's gonna be okay.

679
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:24,796
<i>Max?</i>

680
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:26,331
<i>Who's here?</i>

681
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:28,001
I promise.

682
00:51:32,371 --> 00:51:33,740
Mom?

683
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,570
Ava? Ava!

684
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:09,541
No! No!

685
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,379
Max! Max!
Hey!

686
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:14,314
Look at me.
Look at me.

687
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:14,981
Stay with me.

688
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:17,517
Look at me.
Look at me.

689
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:19,285
Hey!
Oh my God.

690
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:22,722
Shh.
Stay with me.

691
00:52:22,755 --> 00:52:25,892
Hey.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

692
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,360
- You're okay.
- The work is done.

693
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:28,894
Don't!
Don't kill him!

694
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:29,895
Stop!

695
00:52:29,928 --> 00:52:31,764
- Don't!
- Stop! It's okay.

696
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:32,798
You're killing him.

697
00:52:32,831 --> 00:52:34,633
Shh!
Stop it.

698
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:37,369
- It's too-It's too late!
- No!

699
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,646
I didn't know.

700
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:48,481
I swear to God,
I didn't know.

701
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:49,983
Are you okay?

702
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,452
Let's get her in.

703
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:53,787
Let's get her in the house.

704
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:55,921
Fuck you!

705
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:58,457
You! You!
No! No!

706
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:59,659
<i>Max!</i>

707
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,026
<i>Max!</i>

708
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:03,662
- Get off!
- <i>Where's my son?</i>

709
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:04,831
Get off!

710
00:53:04,863 --> 00:53:05,631
<i>Where's my son?!</i>

711
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:07,534
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Where's my son!</i>

712
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:09,601
<i>No!</i>

713
00:53:10,168 --> 00:53:11,704
<i>No!</i>

714
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:37,090
<i>She ain't here!</i>

715
00:56:10,582 --> 00:56:11,684
Stop!

716
00:56:11,983 --> 00:56:13,119
Stop!

717
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,320
Stop! Stop!

718
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:16,689
Please stop!

719
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:18,157
No! No!

720
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:27,900
Go!
Go, go, go!

721
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:29,135
Go, go!

722
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:39,912
You have to help me.

723
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,149
I need to see a doctor.

724
00:56:45,316 --> 00:56:46,251
Let me out.
Stop the car.

725
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:47,754
Stop. Stop!

726
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:52,791
Please!

727
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:54,093
Don't leave me!

728
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:56,896
Just drive me there!

729
00:56:56,928 --> 00:56:58,631
- Sorry, I can't. I can't help you!
- Please!

730
00:56:58,664 --> 00:57:00,566
- I can't help you!
- Please!

731
00:57:00,898 --> 00:57:02,167
I'm sorry.

732
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:11,610
Don't move!

733
00:57:12,043 --> 00:57:14,079
Don't touch anything!

734
00:57:17,048 --> 00:57:18,784
You're okay!

735
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:21,588
Hang on!

736
00:57:22,253 --> 00:57:23,922
Be right there.

737
00:57:24,222 --> 00:57:26,291
It's gonna be okay.
Calm down.

738
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:29,762
You're fine.
We're gonna take this off.

739
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,398
Take this off.
Slow down.

740
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:34,968
Slow down.

741
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:38,004
Okay?
Grab this.

742
00:57:40,372 --> 00:57:42,041
Okay.

743
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:43,943
It's okay.
I got you.

744
00:57:45,943 --> 00:57:47,313
All right.

745
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:49,414
I need you to hold out
your collar, all right?

746
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:50,849
Just the collar.

747
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:52,752
Stretch it out.
Out, out, out.

748
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:55,121
Good.

749
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:56,889
Good, all right.

750
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:00,359
It's okay.

751
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,200
All right.

752
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:11,371
Come on!

753
00:58:17,242 --> 00:58:20,246
<i>You're not gonna get
very far dressed like that.</i>

754
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:00,253
<i>Amanda, open the door!</i>

755
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,267
<i>You want out?</i>

756
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:17,403
<i>Come here!
Come here!</i>

757
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:42,995
You see what
you're making me do?

758
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:44,863
You think I wanna
be this way?

759
00:59:49,334 --> 00:59:51,169
I'm not the bad guy.

760
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:56,275
<i>Stop putting us all at risk!</i>

761
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,246
Dig in there, everybody.

762
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:40,819
There was something
in my throat.

763
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:44,356
Adam, would you go
get some firewood?

764
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:46,025
The stove is low.

765
01:00:47,025 --> 01:00:48,260
Yep.

766
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:49,561
Thanks.

767
01:02:17,983 --> 01:02:19,318
<i>We've gotta go.</i>

768
01:02:24,189 --> 01:02:26,325
<i>C'mon.
It's gonna be dark soon.</i>

769
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,362
Jake?

770
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:15,006
Hey.

771
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:27,320
You ready?

772
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:29,220
Yeah.

773
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,162
It looks like it hurts.

774
01:03:37,528 --> 01:03:39,130
It's fine.

775
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:42,034
- It's fine?
- Yeah.

776
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,269
- Yeah?
- It's totally fine.

777
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:48,541
You don't have to
pretend with me.

778
01:03:49,673 --> 01:03:51,276
I know you're tough.

779
01:03:54,412 --> 01:03:56,581
Hey, did you think
about what I asked?

780
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,321
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

781
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:08,327
And?

782
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:11,430
I don't think
we'd get very far.

783
01:04:13,131 --> 01:04:14,767
Why not?

784
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,568
I think we'd make
a great team.

785
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:20,238
Back.

786
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:36,789
Don't you think so?

787
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:41,760
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

788
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:46,599
We could take care
of each other, you know?

789
01:04:49,834 --> 01:04:51,704
Don't you want that?

790
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,542
Yeah.

791
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,717
What are you doing?

792
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:07,485
I think we should go.

793
01:05:12,456 --> 01:05:14,459
We should go
before they get back.

794
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,296
We should go tomorrow.

795
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:24,537
- Ava?
- Come on. Let's go.

796
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,139
Come on.

797
01:05:29,807 --> 01:05:31,709
Hurry.
Let's go right now.

798
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,246
We could just go tomorrow.

799
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,814
What's wrong with
right now?

800
01:06:18,356 --> 01:06:19,792
Take your boots off.

801
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:22,627
- What?
- Take your boots off.

802
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,896
- My boots?
- Take your...

803
01:06:23,928 --> 01:06:25,363
Why?

804
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:35,434
<i>Hey, Jake!
Grab me a beer.</i>

805
01:07:42,773 --> 01:07:44,242
<i>Jake!</i>

806
01:07:48,613 --> 01:07:50,216
Fucking worthless.

807
01:07:56,488 --> 01:07:57,756
Jake!

808
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:28,286
Ah!

809
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:32,390
Shh.

810
01:08:35,026 --> 01:08:36,762
I'm not gonna hurt you.

811
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:37,796
All right.

812
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:39,598
Things are gonna change.

813
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,532
Everybody's gonna
do their part.

814
01:08:41,566 --> 01:08:42,701
Shh.

815
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:44,335
Calm down.
Shh.

816
01:08:52,076 --> 01:08:54,545
Calm down!

817
01:08:59,817 --> 01:09:01,320
Oh!

818
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,689
Oh!

819
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,025
Agh! Ow!

820
01:09:58,509 --> 01:09:59,744
Ava!

821
01:10:01,545 --> 01:10:03,381
What the hell are you doing?

822
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:06,485
I can't stay here.

823
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,426
Fine!
You wanna go so bad?

824
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:16,027
Get the fuck out of here!

825
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:17,562
Jake, come on.

826
01:10:17,594 --> 01:10:18,496
Leave!

827
01:10:37,482 --> 01:10:38,684
<i>Ava!</i>

828
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:41,854
Ah!

829
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,157
<i>Jake, stop!</i>

830
01:10:51,094 --> 01:10:52,563
<i>Jake, stop it!</i>

831
01:10:56,733 --> 01:10:57,769
Jake, stop!

832
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,518
Ava?

833
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,089
Max?

834
01:16:05,343 --> 01:16:06,912
Ava! Run!

835
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:08,213
Go!
Just go!

836
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:09,880
Look what I got!

837
01:16:09,914 --> 01:16:11,816
- Came an awful long way!
- Ava, listen to me.

838
01:16:11,848 --> 01:16:13,050
- See this?
- No. Don't.

839
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:14,786
You're gonna show me
where my guns are.

840
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:16,521
I'll... I'll give you
the guns back, okay?

841
01:16:16,554 --> 01:16:17,589
Uh, just don't hurt him.

842
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:20,157
- Ava, I am fine. I'm fine.
- Shut up! Shut up!

843
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:21,860
Okay! Okay!

844
01:16:21,893 --> 01:16:23,328
We're gonna take
a little walk!

845
01:16:24,262 --> 01:16:26,164
Ava, listen to me.
You don't show him anything.

846
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:29,299
Get up!
Let's go.

847
01:16:29,332 --> 01:16:30,768
No, no, no...

848
01:16:30,802 --> 01:16:32,437
Please, just help him out.

849
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:34,104
I'll get the guns.
I'll bring them back.

850
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:36,041
Just don't hurt him,
please.

851
01:16:41,978 --> 01:16:44,048
You bring them
back here by morning,

852
01:16:45,249 --> 01:16:47,219
or I will shoot him
in the head!

853
01:16:48,486 --> 01:16:49,821
Okay.

854
01:16:51,222 --> 01:16:52,456
Get up!

855
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:56,861
Ava!

856
01:16:56,893 --> 01:16:58,896
- Ava, don't!
- Get off your ass and help me!

857
01:17:03,835 --> 01:17:05,103
Pick him up!

858
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:28,106
Where's Kelly?

859
01:20:29,506 --> 01:20:31,375
You need to hold up
your end of the bargain.

860
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:33,111
Tell me where he is!

861
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:36,013
Come on.
Shoot me.

862
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:42,687
Then how will you
find him then?

863
01:20:45,589 --> 01:20:47,425
You want your guns?

864
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,727
Yes.

865
01:20:49,759 --> 01:20:51,195
Yes, I do.

866
01:20:52,062 --> 01:20:54,231
You want this gun?
You can have it.

867
01:20:54,497 --> 01:20:55,666
Amanda?

868
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,370
Hold on.
Shh, shh, shh.

869
01:21:01,205 --> 01:21:03,107
You killed him,
didn't you?

870
01:21:03,139 --> 01:21:04,709
No, I didn't.

871
01:21:05,308 --> 01:21:06,710
I don't believe you.

872
01:21:06,744 --> 01:21:09,546
Just show me
where they are.

873
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,683
I'll... I'll take
you to Kelly myself.

874
01:21:14,151 --> 01:21:15,653
It's nice and simple.

875
01:21:16,687 --> 01:21:19,357
It's okay. Shh.

876
01:21:19,389 --> 01:21:20,392
It's okay.

877
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,227
Shh.

878
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,595
It's okay.

879
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:28,066
It's gonna be just fine.
Shh.

880
01:21:28,098 --> 01:21:29,199
I got you.

881
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,535
I got you.

882
01:21:32,469 --> 01:21:34,438
Come on.
Come on.

883
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:36,740
I got you.

884
01:21:37,241 --> 01:21:38,343
It's okay.

885
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:40,678
It's all right.

886
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:44,515
It's okay.

887
01:21:52,723 --> 01:21:54,225
Come on.

888
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:12,242
Turn around.

889
01:22:13,811 --> 01:22:15,280
No.

890
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,215
You turn the fuck around.

891
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,153
What are you gonna do?

892
01:22:22,385 --> 01:22:23,620
Shoot me?

893
01:22:39,536 --> 01:22:41,606
Did you look my brother in
the eye before you killed him?

894
01:22:41,638 --> 01:22:43,240
I didn't kill him.

895
01:22:43,273 --> 01:22:45,343
I bet you looked away.

896
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:46,910
Didn't you?

897
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:48,312
You did.

898
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,150
You did.
You looked away.

899
01:22:55,952 --> 01:22:57,856
You're gonna look me
in the eye.

900
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:02,159
Do it!

901
01:23:07,665 --> 01:23:09,501
Agh!

902
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:20,879
They're under there.

903
01:23:28,318 --> 01:23:29,720
That's my girl.

904
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:33,323
Where's Kelly?

905
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:36,260
He's right next
to his family.

906
01:23:37,561 --> 01:23:39,764
But you already
guessed that.

907
01:23:39,796 --> 01:23:41,432
Didn't you?

908
01:23:43,701 --> 01:23:45,436
Agh!

909
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:47,472
Fuck! Fuck!

910
01:23:48,339 --> 01:23:50,274
Goddammit, Amanda!

911
01:23:50,307 --> 01:23:51,742
Come on, just let...
Damn it!

912
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:55,880
Amanda, you stupid bitch!
Get me out of this trap!

913
01:23:58,014 --> 01:24:00,517
Amanda, sweetie?
I know you're mad.

914
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:01,919
I know you're confused.

915
01:24:01,951 --> 01:24:03,853
But come here
and help me.

916
01:24:03,887 --> 01:24:05,389
Now.

917
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:11,228
Amanda, quit fucking around!

918
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:15,665
This isn't you.

919
01:24:15,698 --> 01:24:17,902
You're sick
and you need help.

920
01:24:17,934 --> 01:24:19,536
I can help you.

921
01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:21,872
What are you doing?

922
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:26,744
All right. All right.
All right.

923
01:24:26,777 --> 01:24:28,412
You've proved your point.

924
01:24:28,445 --> 01:24:29,914
No.

925
01:24:29,946 --> 01:24:32,616
No, no, no.
Are you fucking nuts?

926
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,951
Amanda!

927
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:36,354
Amanda, let me out!

928
01:24:36,987 --> 01:24:38,456
Let me out!

929
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:39,756
Come on!

930
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,960
I can't get out, Amanda!

931
01:24:45,763 --> 01:24:48,666
Hey. Hey. It's okay.
Come on.

932
01:24:48,698 --> 01:24:49,968
Come here.

933
01:24:50,601 --> 01:24:51,902
Come here.

934
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:55,439
Stop.
Stop!

935
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:58,576
Amanda!

936
01:24:58,608 --> 01:24:59,977
You can't leave me here!

937
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:01,344
Don't you go!

938
01:25:01,378 --> 01:25:02,780
Amanda!

939
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,840
Ava?

940
01:27:41,981 --> 01:27:46,981

00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,176
Hi, I'm Jake Winton.

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,644
If you're receiving
this video,

3
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,047
it means that you have invested
in MINDS i.

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:19,818
It also means that we have
raised $2.5 million

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,721
to start production
on the sickest piece

6
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,557
of wearable technology
on the market today.

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,994
It's also much more affordable
than any of our competitors.

8
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,229
I'm not gonna name
any names,

9
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,897
but I think you
know who you are.

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,466
I'm telling you,
there is no other product

11
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:38,303
on the market today that is
as comprehensive, easy to use,

12
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,140
and fucking cool as MINDS i.

13
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,409
<i>Wired</i> Magazine,
TechCrunch,

14
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,844
and a whole mess
of other media agree.

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,880
Look, I'm not an inventor.
I'm an investor.

16
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,349
All of my money is
in this product.

17
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,017
I know a good thing
when I see it,

18
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,487
and I want you guys
to see it all, so thank you.

19
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,456
And you're welcome.

20
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,949
Gersh, congrats,
her dad's out of jail.

21
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,350
Love the Windsor.

22
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,186
Chatakov, thank you
for the pork bun rack.

23
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,555
Sam, you're not on the list,
you can't be here.

24
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,356
Hey, dude, take off
the braided belt.

25
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,292
No bullshit in my house,
okay?

26
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,028
- It's Hudson's apartment.
- Do what he says, dick.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,963
- Dick.
- You're gonna kill it, Dick.

28
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,200
We're in for another 75K.
This launch is gonna be huge.

29
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,102
When I look around this room,
I see so many people

30
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,304
that I love...
for their money.

31
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,275
But this is where I say
something that I really mean.

32
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,911
I really want to thank you guys
all for being here

33
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,881
and investing your money
and your time

34
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,217
and your trust
into MINDS i.

35
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,986
You are all gonna be so much
more interesting to talk to

36
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,588
at a dinner party
a week from now,

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,224
and you are gonna have
so much more money on paper.

38
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,126
Whoo!
- To MINDS i.

39
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,961
- Not bad.

40
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,396
Now, please, everybody
enjoy their champagne.

41
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,931
It's filled with rufies,
so we're gonna have

42
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,166
a good fucking time tonight.

43
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,738
Oh, my God, you guys,
that is so hot.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,573
Mmm, yeah, it is.

45
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,674
Who wants a cup of coffee?

46
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,977
Mmm... I do.
Yes.

47
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,783
Hey, lawyer man, tell me
you're bringing by more demos.

48
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,920
People want their eyes to get
fucked by technology.

49
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,756
Hudson, please.

50
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,291
They're the manufacturer.

51
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,533
What do you mean,
they can't manufacture the part?

52
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,662
No, no, fuck.

53
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,531
Look, it's China,
it's a big-ass country.

54
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,834
We'll just find someone else
to make the part, okay?

55
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:54,139
We just need to keep this quiet
and keep the launch smooth.

56
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:58,310
You're reading this
off of TechCrunch, aren't you?

57
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:03,615
Jesus Christ.
It's already out.

58
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,690
You guys are gonna
leave me in here?

59
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,200
B dog.

60
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,401
What, did you have
your fucking mom

61
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,535
do the production
research?

62
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,703
My mom's dead.

63
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,205
- Right.
- But we're gonna find

64
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,739
a new manufacturer
and make this right.

65
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,874
Fuck you, fuck head.

66
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,576
Already on the phone,
I love it.

67
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,643
Yeah, no, I'm on my way home.
He... he lost all the money.

68
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,378
See you, man.

69
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,753
What time is it?

70
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:46,158
We are gonna watch the sun rise
every day together, dude,

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,161
until your soul is healed.

72
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,603
Oh, I can't stay here.

73
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,904
Tickets.

74
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,740
Get your tickets out,
please.

75
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,543
I'm sorry,
I forget where...

76
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,346
I put it.
There it is.

77
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,119
Going backwards makes
a lot of people nauseous.

78
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,022
Yeah, I don't get
nauseous, man.

79
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,925
New Rochelle.
Be there in no time.

80
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,364
Hey, man, where's my money?
I trusted you, give me a call...

81
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,399
Hey, great party.
Way to fuck up my life.

82
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,968
Stop texting Kat, okay?
She broke up with you, dude.

83
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,937
The end, she's done.

84
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,105
Hey, Jake, my kids aren't
going to camp

85
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,606
this summer.
Thanks, buddy.

86
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,441
I just wanted to let you know

87
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,277
that you probably shouldn't come
to the reunion this weekend.

88
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,612
You better find
another fucking manufacturer...

89
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,281
Hey, Jake, I want you to tell
my wife that she's probably

90
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,982
gonna have to get a second job.
I changed your name

91
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,251
in my phone
to "life ruiner."

92
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,986
Jake, don't come
to my birthday party next week.

93
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,288
I wanted to leave you
a voice mail

94
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,756
so you could hear
in my voice

95
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,878
how disappointed and angry
and pissed I am!

96
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,423
Hey.

97
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:28,760
It's Jake, your brother.
I left you messages.

98
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,495
Well, I had no idea...

99
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,498
What are you doing here?
Hi.

100
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,434
Uh...

101
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,169
Do you not answer
your phone anymore?

102
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,937
I know, yeah,
it's basically impossible

103
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,206
for me to talk
on the phone.

104
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,941
Hi... come in, hi.

105
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,609
- Hi.
- Ugh.

106
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,445
Whoa.
You all right?

107
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,781
No, it's good.
I'm good, I'm fine.

108
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm pregnant.

109
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,519
Really? Wasn't Teddy born,
like, yesterday?

110
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,021
He's three.

111
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,489
He is?

112
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,224
And there's another one
in there?

113
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,327
There's like nothing going on
with this belly.

114
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,397
Sorry, I just... I don't like
people touching it.

115
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,965
But you can touch it.

116
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,834
No, it's fine, I don't need
to touch anything.

117
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,002
So how pregnant are you?

118
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,573
13 weeks.

119
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,575
Wow.

120
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,744
Why aren't you wearing
your glasses?

121
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,312
I got Lasik.

122
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,680
You had surgery?

123
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,482
You don't have surgery
without telling people.

124
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,684
I could have come in for that.
When did you do it?

125
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,386
I don't know.
Last year.

126
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,988
Wow.

127
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,923
Your eyes look
kind of buggy.

128
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,226
Yeah, that's what I was
going for.

129
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,228
Maybe you should check
your thyroid.

130
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,829
You should check
your thyroid.

131
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,766
Sorry, this is Teddy's
wake of destruction.

132
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,935
Just step over that turtle,
and have a seat.

133
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,670
Where is Teddy?
Teddy!

134
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,707
He's actually at daycare,
and I have a early meeting,

135
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,544
so can you stay
for dinner?

136
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,781
Yeah.
Is it cool if I crash here?

137
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:59,117
Tonight?
Sure.

138
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,019
Oh, don't sit there.
Sorry, that's where

139
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,388
Teddy puts his leaf babies
to sleep.

140
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,557
Oh, that's where his leaf babies
sleep, of course.

141
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,092
That makes perfect sense.

142
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,895
So, how long do you
need to stay?

143
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,863
For a couple nights.

144
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,598
That's a big bag.

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,100
Yeah, well, I couldn't cram
everything into a little bag

146
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,936
when my entire world
imploded upon itself.

147
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,038
You don't seem
very focused.

148
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,540
Huh?
I'm focused.

149
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,076
I'm focused on you
and on folding this laundry

150
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,780
and on not being late.
What is going on?

151
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,316
Well, you can basically take
the last three years of my life

152
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,085
and light them on fire.
Company's fucked.

153
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,988
My girlfriend dumped me.
People hate me.

154
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,959
Oh. Did you, uh,
lose a lot of money?

155
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,263
Oh, yeah, no, I lost, uh,
all of my money and then some,

156
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,732
and then I lost a lot
of other people's money,

157
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,768
which feels
surprisingly terrible.

158
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,903
Dude, can you just
take the day off?

159
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,606
I can't.
I-I've been out a lot lately

160
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:59,110
and my principal is tracking
my level of commitment, so...

161
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,445
Whatever.

162
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,847
You're gonna be fine,
Jake.

163
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,750
Fuck those people.
I'm done with the city.

164
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,519
Your shirt's buttoned wrong.

165
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,121
Oh.
Shit. Thanks.

166
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:14,659
So, if it's a couple of months,
Is that okay? Three months?

167
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,261
Jesus, three months?

168
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,029
I'm sorry I didn't schedule
my life falling apart

169
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,464
better for you.

170
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,832
That's not what I'm saying.
You just...

171
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,667
You show up here
with your big bag,

172
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,870
and you haven't been out here
for at least a year.

173
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,372
I was here
for Teddy's birthday.

174
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,341
We invited you
and you didn't come.

175
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,276
Well, I wanted to be there,
okay?

176
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,811
That counts for something.

177
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,679
- I have to talk to Danny.
- Like ask him permission?

178
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,781
Like have a conversation
where I ask him

179
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,950
how he feels about you living
with us for three months

180
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,185
because he's my husband.

181
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,686
Can you answer me
as to why there are

182
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,724
so many new sconces
around the house?

183
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,395
We're trying to sell
the house.

184
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,698
Could you maybe not sell
our childhood home right now?

185
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,668
Please?

186
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,372
I'm really sorry, Jake.
Look, just...

187
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,574
Just hang out,
and eat whatever you want,

188
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:06,077
and I'll be home tonight
and we can all have dinner.

189
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,947
Okay.

190
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,553
It's freezing in this house.

191
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,557
Can you get me a sweatshirt,
please?

192
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,610
Ah! Fuck you,
you pressed wood piece of shit.

193
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,612
Oh, look who it is.

194
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,681
Good nap?

195
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,915
Yeah, I forgot where I was.

196
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,017
You were in my bed
with your shoes on.

197
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,919
- Uh...
- It's okay.

198
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,389
Hey, sorry to hear about,
you know, everything.

199
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,124
Oh, no worries.

200
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,894
So you gonna replace that door
with more sconces?

201
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,797
We're doing reclaimed walnut.

202
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,131
Justine and Teddy
are upstairs.

203
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,433
Oh, I'll go say hi to them.

204
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,934
You know what, no, no,
don't do that.

205
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,302
She's pretty upset
about that nap.

206
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,370
Why don't you be
my little helper?

207
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,938
Help me take the door off.

208
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,707
You know I pay a guy to hang
pictures in my apartment.

209
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,941
Dude, it's very easy.

210
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,610
You just take this,
put it in there...

211
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,372
- Uh-huh.
- And then look.

212
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,214
Exciting.

213
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,984
- Do I need goggles?
- No, dude.

214
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,051
Like that?

215
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,219
Yeah.
Oh!

216
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,287
- Oh, ho.
- Lookit, lookit.

217
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,456
- Hey!
- Hey! Holy shit!

218
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,558
Hey.
- Teddy!

219
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,126
Unky!

220
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,629
Look how big you are!
You're like an adult man.

221
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,163
I'm holding an adult man!

222
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,065
I have a train table.

223
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,501
Yeah, I just used
an electric screwdriver.

224
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,836
Let's go crazy!

225
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,471
Let's go crazy
in the morning.

226
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,805
We just came in
to say goodnight.

227
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,741
Good night?
What time is it?

228
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,676
7:45.
Time for books and bed.

229
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,511
Oh!
- What?

230
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,014
Shit, that means I've been
sleeping for, like, nine hours.

231
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,148
9 1/2.

232
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,816
Shucks,
that's a long nap.

233
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,818
Shucks!

234
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,620
You can't be mad at people
for napping.

235
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,155
Dude, we get mad at anybody
who gets any sleep.

236
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,790
Okay, Mr. Monster Man,
let's bring it in.

237
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,958
- Family hug.
- Bring it in.

238
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,092
- Family hug. Come on.
- No!

239
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,794
Oh!

240
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,763
I'm hungry, I'm gonna have to
eat some of... grr.

241
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,131
- No, you can't eat him!

242
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,198
All right.

243
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,466
- Mwah.
- I'll start dinner.

244
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,668
- Hi.
- Good night.

245
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,036
- Okay.
- Good night!

246
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,303
Night, Teddy.

247
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,105
What is that?

248
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,707
- This guy.
- Is that that...

249
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,275
Is that that song
from<i> The Shining?</i>

250
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,544
Yeah, this guy
wants to kill me.

251
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,614
I love that song.

252
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,688
Jeez, You guys are eating
like rescue dogs.

253
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,191
I know, we got to slow down.

254
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,160
You talk to him yet?

255
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,295
No.

256
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,563
What?

257
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,799
I need to stay here
for a few months.

258
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,200
Yeah, sure.

259
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,568
Mm!

260
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,869
What?

261
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,137
My sister moved back in
with my parents

262
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,372
after she had
that nervous breakdown,

263
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,074
dropped out of school.
Same thing.

264
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,209
Yeah, it's the same thing
as that.

265
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,044
I haven't had a chance
to talk to him yet.

266
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,015
I can help out around the house,
buy groceries, build stuff,

267
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,050
rip shit out of walls
as needed.

268
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,885
You want to watch Teddy?

269
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,420
Yeah, sure.
I'll watch cartoons with him

270
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,888
while you guys have
a night on the town.

271
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,826
I could do that, like,
every other week.

272
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,495
He can watch Teddy.

273
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,064
You mean like "watch him"
watch him?

274
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,499
- No.
- Come on, dude.

275
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,001
That day care sucks.
It's not clean.

276
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,104
The kids are always
licking the toys, and...

277
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,672
One got whooping cough
last week.

278
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,340
Yeah, It's fucking dark ages
there.

279
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,344
Plus, he'll help us out
money-wise.

280
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,679
We're not broke.

281
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,014
Well...

282
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,216
What?

283
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,918
Hi.
What the fuck's going on?

284
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,520
I...

285
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,188
Nothing, it's...
Well,

286
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,558
I guess...
The idea on the table

287
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,462
is that you...
stay for a few months,

288
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,298
and you look after Teddy.

289
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,301
Guys, I'm talking about,
like, buying groceries,

290
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,237
maybe build a few things.

291
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,772
I need you to make me
feel better.

292
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,207
Come on, you fuck.
He's cute.

293
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,076
You need to get
a flu shot.

294
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,411
We'll take care of it, dock it
out of your pay, or whatever.

295
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,813
Oh, we're paying him now?

296
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,214
We can't not.

297
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:07,619
Can't not.
How much we talking about?

298
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,621
300.

299
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,654
A day?

300
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,590
A week, maybe.

301
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,526
You should take it, bro.

302
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,731
Fine.

303
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:24,235
Awesome!
I'm gonna get the Breyers.

304
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,770
You seriously gonna do this?

305
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,839
You know I have a DUI, right?

306
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,241
You don't trust me
with your kid?

307
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,976
Absolutely.

308
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,584
Dude!
The old room.

309
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,253
I'm gonna need, like, four guys
to get rid of that thing.

310
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,455
- It's all right.
- Look,

311
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,425
left your dope-ass
Bar Mitzvah thing up.

312
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,267
Guess I had
a lot of interests.

313
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,665
Still badass.

314
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,940
Are you okay?
Do you want to talk?

315
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,541
No, I'm good.

316
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,443
Open or closed?

317
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,911
Closed.

318
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,347
Good night.

319
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,950
Good night.

320
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,820
Hey, so you're cool, right,
with the whole thing?

321
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:49,988
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

322
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,990
Fine.

323
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,924
Okay.

324
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,497
He decides when he comes
and when he goes, you know.

325
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,567
Whatever works for him.

326
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,602
Okay, so we are gonna
talk about it?

327
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:08,406
No, no, I'm sorry.
I'm done.

328
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

329
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,943
Okay.

330
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,717
You know, he doesn't even
know how old Teddy is.

331
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,454
I just don't... I mean, it's not
like he has to get him anything.

332
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:28,092
He's just like my dad.
Everything's a fly-by, I...

333
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,861
He just shows up here
like...

334
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,863
Okay, I'm gonna go
and drink a coke

335
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,798
so we can keep talking about it.
- No, it's fine.

336
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,401
No, it's fine, it's fine.
I...

337
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,903
He's my brother.

338
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,939
Okay.

339
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,181
Fuck, I forgot
to brush my teeth.

340
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,400
Spit in this.

341
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,307
I love you.

342
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,642
Hmm?

343
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,810
I love you.

344
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,812
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Okay.

345
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,460
I'm jumping.

346
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:39,197
Stop.
Stop, Teddy.

347
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
Too early, buddy.
Stop jumping on the bed, okay?

348
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,003
It's 7:00.
We've been up for two hours.

349
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,537
- What?
- Yeah.

350
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,773
He has?
How's that possible?

351
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,375
That's crazy.

352
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,646
It's going down!

353
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,815
Can you... I really feel it.
Can you?

354
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,118
Yeah, I can feel it.

355
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,553
Unky Jake needs
a little coffee,

356
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,355
and then I'll be ready
to play, okay?

357
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,894
Coffee bean!

358
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,864
Coffee beans!

359
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,300
"I used to just splash.
Now I make waves.

360
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,337
"I used to be shy.
Now I am brave.

361
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,707
"I used to just watch.
Now I can dig.

362
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,646
I used to be little.
Now I am big."

363
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,549
How is this not
putting you to sleep?

364
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,718
Okay, Teddy's gonna be
a good boy

365
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,354
while Unky Jake
does his business.

366
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,855
No, Teddy, you can't
play with that.

367
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,757
That is a heavy
glass paperweight.

368
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

369
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,227
You can't play with glass
like that, buddy.

370
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,897
Okay.

371
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,059
Hold on a second,
we're gonna deal with this.

372
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,836
This better be an emergency.

373
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,005
Yeah, no,
this is an emergency.

374
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,674
I can't even go to the bathroom
without him breaking something.

375
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,943
I'm here with a student
who is literally

376
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,246
a million times smarter
than you.

377
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,015
She's gonna
get into Harvard.

378
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,450
Well, what am I supposed to do?

379
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,118
Jake, just leave
the door open.

380
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,619
I tried
leaving the door open,

381
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,123
but your devil child
wouldn't listen to me.

382
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,727
I'm sorry,
it's my little brother.

383
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,029
He's kind of an idiot.

384
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,697
Oh my God, mine's
an effing moron.

385
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,634
You really think
I can get into Harvard?

386
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,503
Yeah, I really do.

387
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,977
Don't climb up there.
Teddy, please,

388
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,545
just give me one minute.

389
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,114
Teddy, that's...
It's fragile.

390
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,882
I know you think
this is hilarious,

391
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,284
but this is one of the more
embarrassing events of my life.

392
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,331
Look, Jean, if Shirley's gonna
organize meeting with parents

393
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,166
about college prep strategy
during lunch,

394
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,767
I'm gonna need
a little more notice.

395
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,836
What's happening?
Are we rescheduling?

396
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,771
You left me a note
about a parent meeting?

397
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,507
Yes, I did, right there
in your mailbox.

398
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,674
I have a cell phone.

399
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,576
Yes, I know you have
a cell phone.

400
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,978
- They're everywhere.
- Look, Shirley,

401
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,679
my brother just showed up
out of nowhere

402
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,416
and he's staying with us.
I'm pregnant.

403
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,785
I have
a doctor's appointment.

404
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,488
Listen, I'm sure
the baby will be great,

405
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,824
but I would like
for you and I to be great,

406
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,293
and that means we gotta put
a little more effort

407
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,629
into our communication.
Mm-hmm.

408
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,031
Okay.
So let me be clear.

409
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,001
You want me to miss
my ultrasound appointment

410
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,802
to check that my baby
is healthy

411
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,364
because I didn't check
my mailbox?

412
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,944
Jean, we'll reschedule.
Can you make that happen?

413
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,979
And please look around
and find my password.

414
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,248
I can never remember it.

415
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,403
Yeah?

416
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,405
Hi, uh, how do you
open the stroller,

417
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,240
and what time
are you coming home?

418
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,342
You step down on it, and then
you push the handles up and out.

419
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,911
I can't talk, I'm at work.
I gotta go.

420
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,914
Who I am,

421
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,517
not for what
you wanted me to be.

422
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:28,626
I just wanted you to be happy.
That's all.

423
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:36,901
Oh, my God.

424
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,538
Sweet rides, right?
Good afternoon, ladies.

425
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,674
What, you've never
seen a kid in a suitcase before?

426
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,076
Who's a stud, Teddy?

427
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,177
Me!

428
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,180
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:52,683
Suitcase stud!

430
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,324
Kind of a beat scene,
huh, Teddy?

431
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,204
Teddy, why don't you go hit
the monkey bars for a second?

432
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:17,008
Yeah, why don't you go hit
the jungle gym, bud.

433
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,649
Oof.

434
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:27,251
They grow up so fast now,
they can just play on their own.

435
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,654
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

436
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,956
How old's your little boy?

437
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,424
She's a girl.

438
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,627
No doubt, no doubt.

439
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,297
You're a girl too,
aren't you?

440
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm Jake.

441
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,401
Blanca.

442
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,803
Blanca?
But you're not white?

443
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,837
Funny.

444
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,172
- I know, right?
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,840
It's crazy.
Yeah, it's funny,

446
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,409
'cause it's like...
- Whoo! Pa-pow, pow, pow!

447
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,844
Pa-pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!
Pa-pow, pow!

448
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,246
Hey, Armin.

449
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,781
Hey, Blanca.

450
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,316
Mwah.

451
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,850
- How are you, gorgeous?
- No, you're gorgeous.

452
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,154
No, Georgia is gorgeous.
Hello, Georgia.

453
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,089
Hey, if you want,
Bash and I are gonna go

454
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,691
have snacks
on the giant turtle today,

455
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,459
so you are invited.
- Ooh.

456
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,660
Oh, shit, I forgot
to feed Teddy.

457
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,861
Do you have any snacks?

458
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,129
Hey, language, man.

459
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,597
Just a little something.
I'm sorry, he...

460
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,867
- Wow.
- So this is Teddy's nanny.

461
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,436
Oh.

462
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,138
I'm actually his uncle,
and what does "oh" mean?

463
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,274
Ah, nothing, man.
I'm just effing with you.

464
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,142
Oh, hey, are you guys going
to the wool festival today?

465
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,944
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, great.

466
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,313
You're gonna love this.
It's... they've got live sheep.

467
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,949
The kids can pet the sheep.
There's a knitting workshop.

468
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,452
The kids go crazy for it.
There's a yarn toss.

469
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,886
- Remember, we went last year.
- Uh-huh.

470
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,722
Oh, is that where you made
the pizza hat?

471
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,725
Nope, Blanca got me
this hat.

472
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,193
'Cause I was gonna say,
it's awesome.

473
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,328
- Yeah.
- I mean, everybody loves pizza.

474
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,730
You know, I'm not touching carbs
right now, but...

475
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,612
- We're going.
- Okay, good.

476
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,301
- Oh, shit.

477
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,136
No, don't sip it
from the straw.

478
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,505
Hold it up to your face,
please, okay?

479
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,073
There you go, like that.

480
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,242
- Good.
- Hey!

481
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,345
Oh.
Hi, little monster.

482
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,881
How's my little baby?
You okay, hey, honey?

483
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,349
I'm letting him do
whatever he wants.

484
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,151
Hey, you did exactly
what I would've done.

485
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:11,389
Tongues and lips bleed
like a m-o-t-h-e-r-f-u-c-k-e-r.

486
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,824
- Hey, hey. Let me see.
- I don't know
what you're spelling.

487
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,594
I called you, like,
a gazillion times,
with information.

488
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,696
Hey, I'm sorry. I know,
I had my phone on silent.

489
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,098
I had five students today
who didn't

490
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,198
get into their first choice
of schools.

491
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,733
It was an s-h-i-t-show.

492
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,902
- Just stop spelling.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

493
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,170
I had to pry his mouth open

494
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,339
to see if his teeth
were still there.

495
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,107
It was fucking rough.

496
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,876
My God, you still have
baby blood on your shirt.

497
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,944
What?
Oh, my God.

498
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,446
Oh, my God!

499
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,047
Oh.

500
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,850
Okay, hey, let me wash it.
I'll wash it off for you.

501
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:43,587
Jake.
Whoa, what's up, Channing Tatum?

502
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,189
Huh?
What is up with that?

503
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,958
That is my letter of resignation
written in baby blood.

504
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,261
Come on, it's been one day.
Where are you going?

505
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,530
I don't know, I just... I gotta
go out for a little while.

506
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,565
I'll bring the car back,
and then I'm gonna figure out

507
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,133
where I'm gonna go next.

508
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,336
Jake, come on.

509
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,074
Hey.
Hey.

510
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:07,311
Are you my little monster?
Huh?

511
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,613
Yeah?

512
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,784
Let me see your mouth, baby.
Oh.

513
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,768
Hey, are you smoking
my cigarettes?

514
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,936
What?
You're smoking?

515
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,604
- No.
- You're an idiot.

516
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,840
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling at you.

517
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:41,312
Please.
You're about to have two kids.

518
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,248
No cigarettes, please.

519
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,810
And they're not yours.
You have to ask.

520
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,156
Smooshed.

521
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,991
You know I can just
buy more.

522
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,327
Not on your salary.

523
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,995
Good night, assholes.

524
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,701
Ow.
Don't kiss me so it hurts.

525
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,808
So what's up?

526
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,810
Uh, nothing.

527
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,813
Well, what are you
gonna do now?

528
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,018
Well, I was gonna sit here
and obsess over all the shit

529
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,553
I've done wrong
the last few years,

530
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:26,357
and then probably fall asleep
watching Bravo.

531
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,793
Want to smoke pot?

532
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,862
I don't have pot.

533
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,904
So cigarettes are a no-fly zone
but she's okay with this,

534
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,839
or she doesn't know
about this?

535
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,807
Dude, I stopped this.

536
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,644
When he turned two,
I stopped.

537
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:47,978
And she didn't even ask me
to stop.

538
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,547
She was like,
"You don't have to stop

539
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,515
'cause he's getting older,"
and I was like,

540
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,350
"I don't... I want to stop,"
and she's like, "Well, you don't

541
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,185
have to want to stop just
because he's getting older."

542
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,988
I-I'm like...

543
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,191
I don't know... Dude, I don't
know, stop asking questions.

544
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,662
Hey, you like
the renovations?

545
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:08,332
- No.

546
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,768
Nah.

547
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,771
I like that you like
staying up late.

548
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,407
I love staying up late.

549
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,710
And this... this gets
the smell out?

550
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,378
Fuck yeah.

551
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,347
It's unreal, man.

552
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:27,751
I did, like, a whole system.
I put fucking Joy's blanket

553
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,287
that she gave us... right?
That's perfect...

554
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,623
Fan, fucking box...

555
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:37,094
Oh, sure, but you know what?
I always forget to do this.

556
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:42,700
You know, Teddy has got
the tiniest fucking hands.

557
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:46,770
He puts 'em all over everything
so I have to do this.

558
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,613
His hands are tiny.

559
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:58,115
Dude, it's no joke.
They're teeny.

560
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,750
- His hand is tiny.
- He says...

561
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:00,985
His mom... I mean,
your sister's are tiny.

562
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,486
His little ears... his ears.

563
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,055
The ears, you can't even see
your sister's ears.

564
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,156
Justine's...

565
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,459
Hold on, what is that?

566
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,727
That something?

567
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,604
So what's your plan?

568
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:24,408
Well, I'm gonna eat
all the Cheddar Bunnies

569
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,679
in the goddamn universe.

570
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:31,081
After that, I don't know.

571
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,918
Are you scared?

572
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,490
I don't want
to start over again.

573
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,026
At least I'm not getting
death threats anymore.

574
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:45,262
Fuck it, dude, you should just
open a cheese shop.

575
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,265
Or a bakery.
Like, little, tiny pies.

576
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,827
That's all anybody wants,
is comfort, right?

577
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,273
All right, 17 weeks.

578
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,542
Great.
If you want me to film this, I...

579
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,110
No.

580
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,980
Are you wanting to know
the sex of the child?

581
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:07,051
Don't.
Don't say anything.

582
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,152
Danny likes surprises.

583
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:11,522
I can't even look at this.

584
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,623
Oh, my God, what is that?

585
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,725
What?

586
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,494
- Babe, you're an asshole.
- Just relax.

587
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,862
Fluid looks great.

588
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,699
Yes, my fluid.

589
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,568
It looks good.

590
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,597
You can't be that happy,
you're getting a massage

591
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,167
in a strip mall.

592
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:05,943
No.
No, no, no, no.

593
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,036
Wow.
Been drinking?

594
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,073
No. I had, like,
3 1/2 glasses of Riesling.

595
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,609
Dude, You can't drink
and drive my car.

596
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,277
Okay, Dad.

597
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,113
You already know I have a kid,
that's not really an insult.

598
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,883
I'm not drunk.

599
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,718
Good day?

600
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,221
Yeah, yeah, I went...
Got some frozen yogurt

601
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:54,725
waiting for that bar to open.
Cross Creek Square.

602
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:56,126
Awesome.

603
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,761
Yeah, you know that one,
it's across the street

604
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:02,966
from the frame store and that
sad-ass spa. You been there?

605
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,569
Got a lot of choices over there.
You can get whatever you want.

606
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:10,374
A lot of toppings.
So how was that spa?

607
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,010
Okay, I don't wanna...

608
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,645
What?

609
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,580
I don't know.
Look at me, I'm drunk,

610
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,282
and I'm not even gonna
remember this tomorrow.

611
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,083
You're not drunk, dude.

612
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,685
Okay, listen to me.

613
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,655
I went and I had a massage
with my business associate.

614
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,123
I know that sounds bad,

615
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,926
but we weren't even
in the same room.

616
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,861
It's not a good spa.

617
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,030
I came in here for juice.

618
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,666
Hey, look, I fuck around on all
my girlfriends a little bit,

619
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,502
so don't listen to me. I don't
even know what I'm saying.

620
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,670
You know
what you're saying.

621
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:40,804
I'm not saying anything.

622
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,506
Nothing happened, okay?

623
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:48,212
Except the occasional couples
massage in separate rooms.

624
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,714
Anything else?

625
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,682
I don't know.

626
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,585
Do we need to talk?

627
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,191
Okay, I'm gonna go
to my air mattress now.

628
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,734
Add the power of oxygen
to every load...

629
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,703
When you open a restaurant,

630
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,339
it's scary, 'cause you're
putting yourself out there.

631
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:20,077
Hey. You want to watch
something stupid?

632
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,347
Hmm?
Like<i> Chopped?</i>

633
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,049
I'd be asleep before they even
fuck up the appetizers.

634
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,520
Justine, come on.
You know what's on next.

635
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,757
<i>House Hunters International.</i>

636
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,802
Move over.
Your touching my elbow.

637
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,861
Oh, shit.
What... why are you up so early?

638
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:13,563
I thought we should spend
some time together today.

639
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,965
Okay.

640
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,201
Since it's...
You know, the anniversary.

641
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,942
Mom died on the 15th.
It's tomorrow.

642
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,977
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

643
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,212
I'm going back to bed.

644
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:33,350
No, no, come on, come on.
You're already up.

645
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,289
Hi, Duncan.

646
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,625
So where are you
gonna move?

647
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,061
I don't know, we can't afford
anything around here.

648
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,562
So don't sell our house.

649
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,664
I want to.
I need a change.

650
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,166
We can't live there
forever.

651
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,134
If we don't sell it now,
we'll never leave.

652
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,337
Oh, is that
Dana Sormin's dad?

653
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,805
Yeah.
They still live here.

654
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,107
You've got to switch
with me.

655
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,576
He caught me feeling up
his daughter in eighth grade.

656
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,911
I can't let him see me.

657
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,512
Don't worry about it.

658
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,782
You've gained a lot of weight
since high school, Jake.

659
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,018
What? No, my body's
just changed shapes.

660
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,820
Is that why you're
wearing Mom's coat?

661
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,621
- This is Mom's coat?
- Yeah.

662
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,024
He's gonna think I'm walking
with my Aunt Lynne.

663
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,292
"Hello, Madam."

664
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,927
"Oh, hi, sweetie.

665
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,628
You married that Cuban boy,
huh?"

666
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,697
"You know, the Cubans
and the Jews, they really...

667
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,765
They really get along."

668
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,433
"They understand oppression."

669
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,669
That's right.

670
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,604
Be nice.
He never gets to talk to us

671
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,774
in the same place
at the same time today.

672
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:31,708
Be nice.

673
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,243
You said that already.

674
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,484
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

675
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,852
Oh, there you are.

676
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,520
We just thought we would
call you together

677
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,055
and see how are you doing
today.

678
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,623
It's terrible here.

679
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,025
- Yeah.
- - Oh, my gosh.

680
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,393
It's just like a blow furnace
out here.

681
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:52,295
It's supposed to go
up to 103 today.

682
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,197
- Forget having a hairdo.
- Really?

683
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,866
Soon we're just... we're gonna
stop wearing clothes altogether.

684
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,300
Oh, wow.

685
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,668
We're just gonna wear
rash cream.

686
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,570
- Wow.
- Dad, we...

687
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,040
We took some tulips
over to Mom's...

688
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,641
I appreciate that.

689
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,244
Now, where is Teddy, huh?

690
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,545
Yeah, where's that...

691
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,680
Because I have something
I want to show him.

692
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,150
What is this?
Oh, my gosh.

693
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,518
Dad, what are you doing?
I...

694
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,219
Just... I want to show you
the new pool.

695
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,521
Oh...

696
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,089
A little spray tan,
you think maybe?

697
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,357
Show of hands.

698
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,691
- Oh.
- Just a little.

699
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,859
- Hey.
- Oh.

700
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,261
We just ate lunch, so...

701
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,163
Come on, I want Teddy to see
the diving board.

702
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:28,665
Oh, no, he's... actually, he's not
here, Dad, so you don't...

703
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,701
Whoa, is that Bruce Willis
and his new hot young wife?

704
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,371
Looking good, Bill!

705
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,939
Who is that, that handsome,
drop-dead gorgeous Danny?

706
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,441
I'm just walking through.
I'm working.

707
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,409
- Don't go. Don't go.
- Where's Teddy?

708
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,578
Teddy's napping, Dad,
so it's just us, yeah.

709
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,913
Oh.

710
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,681
- Yeah.
- Miss that munchkin.

711
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,250
Well, can he swim?

712
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,552
No, he's three.

713
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,353
Well, now's the time.
See, we waited

714
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,521
too long with you two.

715
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,622
- Well, he's only three.
- So...

716
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,624
No, don't wait too long.

717
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,426
You didn't wait too long,
did you, Dad?

718
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,095
- What?
- We can't hear you now.

719
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,230
- Jake.
- What? It's on mute.

720
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,565
- I didn't touch a thing.
- It's not working.

721
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,467
He's not good on the phone,
okay?

722
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,069
It's like he has no idea what's
going on with this family.

723
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,572
He hasn't even asked
why I'm here.

724
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,073
- You done?
- You call them every week?

725
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,075
Yeah, every week.

726
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,478
You have a death wish.

727
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,812
Hey.
- Probably... Oh, there we are.

728
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,447
- Hey. Hey.
- They're back.

729
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,949
What happened?
We didn't do anything.

730
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,450
I-I think it just
dropped out for a second.

731
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,418
- What made that happen?
- Technology.

732
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,086
Yeah.

733
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,921
One of those things,
but we'll let you go.

734
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,389
It was great to see you,
and...

735
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,624
- Wait, whoa, whoa.
- Don't go yet.

736
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,259
When are we gonna
get to see Teddy?

737
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,494
- Yeah, that little Teddy Bear.
- No, he's napping now,

738
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,095
so we'll try you
later in the week.

739
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,398
Did he get those little
turquoise cufflinks I sent?

740
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,501
I did, I did, yeah.

741
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,769
You know, maybe for his
confirmation I could...

742
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,338
Or his Bar Mitzvah.

743
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,942
Okay, well, we'll just do
a little David thing,

744
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,811
and then we'll do
a little Christ thing...

745
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,079
Yeah.

746
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,347
And you know,
just have a wardrobe.

747
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,848
- Uh-huh.

748
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,650
Okay, well that's it,
so we're gonna go,

749
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,086
but it was lovely to talk
to you, Dad, we miss you.

750
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:58,255
Yup, and you get that boy
swimming.

751
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,823
I'm doing fine,
by the way.

752
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,991
- Okay, good one.
- Give my love to Teddy.

753
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,526
Okay, that's it, bye.
Bye.

754
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:05,762
Okay.
- Bye.

755
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,765
I mean, that made me
physically nauseous.

756
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,867
- Do you like talking to her?
- I have a severe headache.

757
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:14,938
I can smell the hairspray
through the screen.

758
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,010
Teddy, you got
any straight pieces?

759
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,511
Want to trade?

760
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,148
Hi!

761
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,782
- Hi!
- Mom, I love you!

762
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:29,553
Yeah! I love you!
Come here, monster man.

763
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,788
Can I have a kiss?
Please?

764
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,989
Mwah.

765
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,825
Look at
these beautiful trains, huh?

766
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,827
- Yeah.
- Look at that.

767
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,730
You guys are busy.

768
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,966
So?

769
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,001
It's gorgeous.

770
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:50,006
I signed you up
for a "Mommy and Me" swim class

771
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,741
at the high school.

772
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,910
I'm gonna swim!
- Yeah.

773
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,845
It starts tomorrow.

774
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,647
No.

775
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,882
I did.

776
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,584
I don't have
a bathing suit.

777
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,519
That's okay.
You can borrow one of Danny's.

778
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,421
Ew, I'm not gonna wear
another man's bathing suit.

779
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:05,922
That's like rubbing Ds.

780
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,157
What are you, ten?

781
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,859
I don't know, am I?

782
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,095
You need some structure.
Danny will give you the car,

783
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:15,232
he said he would, and Teddy's
old enough. He should learn.

784
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:19,903
I agree that he should learn
to swim, with his mother.

785
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,907
There's no classes available
on the weekend.

786
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,910
I already checked.

787
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,747
Okay.
"Swim class, 3-5 years old.

788
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,083
"Friday, 4:00-4:45.

789
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,018
"Still available.

790
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,355
Saturday, 2:00-2:45.
Still available.

791
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:39,389
You want me to check
Sunday?

792
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,591
- Are you done?
- Mm-hmm.

793
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,662
2:00 P.M. will fuck up his nap,
so we'll go Friday, together.

794
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,799
Fine, but I get
my own bathing suit.

795
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,269
I don't give a shit
what you wear.

796
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,970
Fine, I'm gonna do it nude.

797
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,772
Yeah, good luck with that.

798
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,114
Excuse me,
you have anything else

799
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,416
that's a little less
Margaritaville?

800
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:09,019
No, what you see is
what we have, man.

801
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,322
Holy shit.

802
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:16,893
Hello? Dude.

803
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,729
Nothing?
Paul Reggio.

804
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,499
Reggio Jackson? Come on, man,
everyone called me that.

805
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,933
I went to New Rochelle High
with you.

806
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,168
Oh, right.

807
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,903
Think we did<i> Guys and Dolls</i>
together.

808
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,271
I think you were
Sky Masterson,

809
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,140
and I think I was
Nicely-Nicely Johnson.

810
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,841
No, that was Goldberg.

811
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,411
That's right.
I did tech.

812
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,913
But if I auditioned, I would
have been Nicely-Nicely Johnson.

813
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,649
No doubt.
All right, man, good to see you.

814
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,084
Thanks, man, doing good.

815
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,687
Doing good, you know,
assistant manager, so...

816
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,021
- Really?
- Some day.

817
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,856
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

818
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,591
- Sweet.
- Crazy, man.

819
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,262
Oh, dude, do you remember
Ben Bresler's cast party...

820
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,496
you went to?
I think it was the night

821
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,098
you found out you got
into Colgate.

822
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,466
- Cornell.
- Cornell, that's right.

823
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:57,867
- Yeah.
- Colgate's a toothpaste.

824
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,469
Stupid.
Oh, dude, you took

825
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,038
the hugest rip
off of Bresler's bong.

826
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,874
You tore your pants off,
you did LaserDisc karaoke

827
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,609
to the<i> Moonlighting</i> theme?

828
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,331
- Yeah.
- We were like...

829
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,615
- Yeah.
- Mind blown, man.

830
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,150
That was a fun night.

831
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,219
Yeah, we all knew you were
going on to amazing things

832
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,054
at that point.

833
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,889
So what are you up to now, man?
Come on, gimme the rundown.

834
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,558
Make me jealous.

835
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,394
Um...
I'm actually doing,

836
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,629
like, early childhood education
stuff now.

837
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,965
Whoa.
That sounds big.

838
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,468
I was doing, like, a bunch
of tech stuff, and I was like,

839
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,137
"Know what?
Eh.

840
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,638
How 'bout I give back,
you know?"

841
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,540
- Awesome.
- Yeah, it's going well.

842
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,542
- Kids.
- Yeah, they're the future.

843
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,710
We'll see, but...

844
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,412
Mm-hmm.
No, they are.

845
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,913
- They will be.
- We'll see.

846
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,682
No, it's undoubted
that children are the future.

847
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,751
- Crazy, man.
- Yeah, so...

848
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:51,087
My sister's pregnant, so I'm,
like, staying at her place,

849
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,223
and just kind of helping her out
a little bit,

850
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,691
getting my ducks in a row.

851
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,426
Yeah.

852
00:39:56,428 --> 00:40:00,163
She came in here
a couple weeks ago to buy a bra.

853
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,264
It was the best.

854
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,732
All right, cool, man,
this is weird.

855
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,933
I'm still thinking
about it.

856
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,502
I bet.
Okay.

857
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,103
Yeah, hey, well,
now that you're back, man,

858
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,371
you should give me a call.
We do, like,

859
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,240
a rotating brunch thing
every Sunday

860
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,276
with, like, the whole crew.
Like, Buskirk, Golub, Mclntire...

861
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,911
Yeah, those guys weren't
in my crew, so...

862
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,914
Me neither, but, like,
now we roll pretty deep.

863
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,582
Yeah, here,
let me take your phone.

864
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,785
- Oh.
- I'm gonna call yo' phone

865
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:26,356
from my phone, and then
our phones will do it up.

866
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,792
Is it ringing?

867
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,760
Why isn't it ringing?
Hello?

868
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,128
You're 'em both up to...

869
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,296
Yeah, well, I'm trying
to see which one...

870
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,464
Yeah.

871
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,698
There we go.

872
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,635
Nice, the<i> Star Wars</i> theme.

873
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,303
It's<i> The Shining.</i>

874
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,404
With Jack Nicklaus?

875
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:42,806
- Yeah, the golfer.
- Yeah.

876
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:44,274
All right, man, well,
it was good to see you.

877
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,836
Dude, contact made.
Jake Winton's back.

878
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,145
Come on, man, bring it in.

879
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,947
- Mm.
- Good seeing you, man.

880
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,549
- You too, man.
- That's a nice coat.

881
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,784
- Thanks.
- Looks like my mom's coat.

882
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,985
It's a...
It's a guy's coat.

883
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,547
Did you steal
my mom's coat?

884
00:40:58,557 --> 00:40:59,789
Did you steal
my mom's coat?

885
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,724
No, man.

886
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:06,429
Move our aquababies
through the water.

887
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,765
We want them to love
their water experience

888
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:11,234
so please keep talking
to them or...

889
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,809
One parent, one aquababy.

890
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,444
She's the...
She's the parent.

891
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,946
You go in.
Hey.

892
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,315
- He's going in.
- I'm not going underwater.

893
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,584
I'm not going underwater.

894
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,126
I don't know how to swim.

895
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,963
No one is swimming today.
We're just standing

896
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,332
and walking,
and singing songs.

897
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,614
You said that already.

898
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,505
That might help you, okay?

899
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,342
Come on, everybody.

900
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,386
Okay, just...
Please stop wiggling.

901
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:08,658
Stop wiggling and just
hold still for me, please.

902
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,860
Teddy, just stay still.
Ugh.

903
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,061
Justine!
- Okay, okay.

904
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,396
- Please.
- Okay.

905
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,398
Okay.

906
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,267
- Stop wiggling.
- Hold on.

907
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,702
- Hold on.
- Yeah.

908
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,204
Here comes your mama.

909
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,749
One parent, one aquababy.

910
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,484
Yeah, we got it, okay?

911
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:37,921
Our parents didn't teach us
how to swim, so... hi.

912
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:41,724
Aw.
Everyone, let's say hello!

913
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,897
Okay, this is a new aquababy.

914
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,869
Miss Jenn's
Adult Beginners?

915
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,170
Get your feet wet.

916
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,506
Then you can swim with Teddy
next semester.

917
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:59,776
No, we are very excited
about this class.

918
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,378
It's actually very therapeutic
for my brother's depression.

919
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,247
- What?
- Oh.

920
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,849
If you want Teddy to have
confidence in the water,

921
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:07,951
you need to have it too.

922
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:08,918
I'm not depressed.

923
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,219
We're very confident.

924
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,590
Thank you.
We'll see you next week.

925
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,929
Fuck her!

926
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,967
I'm not an adult beginner.

927
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,505
Okay, you got five more minutes
on this section.

928
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,978
Another glass?

929
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,715
Can I just have,
like, that much?

930
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,818
Fine, I'll just have
another glass, thanks.

931
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,152
And you?

932
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,288
Uh, yeah, I'll have
a glass of that too.

933
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,365
Thanks.

934
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,604
I was kidding.

935
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:03,640
This is the first time
anyone's ever served me alcohol

936
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:04,941
in a restaurant ever.

937
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:05,943
Wow.

938
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:08,945
Are you gonna
send it back?

939
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:12,015
When I was your age,
I basically took my SATs drunk.

940
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:14,517
- What did you get?
- I got a 1600.

941
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,185
And then I went to Columbia

942
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,620
and was drunk there.

943
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,322
So is this
what you studied?

944
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,125
College prep?
No, that wasn't my major.

945
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:25,261
Poly-sci, and then I went
to NYU for law school.

946
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:28,197
- You're a lawyer?
- No, no, I...

947
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,933
My mom got sick
in the last semester, so I came

948
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:34,904
up here for a few weeks
and then I just never left.

949
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,940
Yeah, shit.

950
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,977
I'm sorry.

951
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:45,048
You can have one sip,
and then finish that section.

952
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,152
Hello?

953
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,654
Hello? Hello?

954
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,122
Hi.

955
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:54,490
Hey, Teddy.

956
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:57,052
Welcome to the playdate.
Teddy, blow that horn.

957
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,963
Oh, oh, wait.
Are you a shoes-off house?

958
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,365
I don't know.

959
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,000
Hmm.
Okay, where are the toys?

960
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,836
They're in the living room.
Teddy, you can grab my neck,

961
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,538
but you can't grab
my neck skin.

962
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,473
I can grab your neck skin!

963
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:13,342
Okay, lesson learned.
Hi, Georgia.

964
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,844
Say hi, Georgia.

965
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,145
Aw, she's shy today.

966
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,513
That's okay.
Hey, Georgia,

967
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,550
did you bring...
"Hey, I'm so hungry!"

968
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,587
Today on ze menu at Chez Teddy,

969
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:28,424
we have a delicious assortment
of Cheddar Bunnies,

970
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,160
Bunny Fruits, Buddy Fruits,
carrots,

971
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,396
apples shaped like dogs...

972
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,199
And milk in mommy and daddy
glasses

973
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:39,502
because this is
a special playdate.

974
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,742
Mmm.

975
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,277
I feel like
they take stuff out

976
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:49,879
just so that we
have to put it away.

977
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:52,415
They do have so many things.

978
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,717
I know, like this fire truck,
I keep trying to hide

979
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,120
from Teddy.
He keeps finding it.

980
00:45:57,122 --> 00:46:00,022
And this?
I tried to throw out,

981
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:01,724
but Georgia caught me.

982
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:05,361
Oh, this thing is just gonna
keep playing.

983
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,963
We just have to wait it out.

984
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,569
No, Georgia!

985
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:15,104
Don't touch that.
That's not yours.

986
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,306
Wait, I actually read
this thing that

987
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,875
if the kids take things
and put them

988
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,476
between their thumb
and two fingers,

989
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,447
it's actually practice
for eventual writing skills.

990
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,919
We should get a snack.

991
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,287
Okay.

992
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,759
Wait.

993
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:37,794
What?

994
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,262
What about the Supermanny?

995
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,496
- Armin?
- Yeah.

996
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,265
That's just for when I'm bored.

997
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,504
Wait, what about the kids?
Will they be okay?

998
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,406
They're fine.
That's the "Elbow Song."

999
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,974
We have about ten more minutes.

1000
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,743
Okay.

1001
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,078
Justine?

1002
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,346
Could I just...

1003
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:58,614
I'm going for my five-month
check-up.

1004
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:01,184
I cleared it with Jane.

1005
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:03,452
No, no.

1006
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,987
You have to clear everything
with me now.

1007
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,490
Jean's son just got checked
into rehab

1008
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,827
for Internet gambling
last week.

1009
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,595
Yeah, she's totally
out to lunch.

1010
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:15,298
I left you a memo about this
three days ago.

1011
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,367
But, it's not what I want
to talk to you about.

1012
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,774
Listen, I had a conference
with Marley Benson's mom,

1013
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:28,678
and she said that she saw you
and Sarah Lipson

1014
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,450
at Theresa's Bakery,
and that you were both drinking.

1015
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:35,785
"Drinking" drinking?

1016
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:36,819
Drinking alcohol.

1017
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,187
- Is she crazy?
- Well...

1018
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,389
She's a minor
and I'm pregnant.

1019
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,658
I... I realize some of the moms

1020
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,828
like to manufacture the drama.

1021
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,897
Some of the moms are insane.

1022
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:51,334
Justine, her voice was very
level with concern.

1023
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:59,976
Penis.

1024
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,978
You have no idea
what you're looking at.

1025
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,681
Penis, that's a boy.

1026
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:07,683
Can you just tell me what it is?
Really?

1027
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,652
I mean, just tell me.

1028
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:10,920
It's a girl.

1029
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,058
I'm gonna be a girl's uncle.

1030
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,760
That's insane.

1031
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,929
Don't tell Danny.
He really didn't want
to find out.

1032
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:21,264
I'm such an asshole.

1033
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:22,832
You're not an asshole.

1034
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,801
I mean, you're an asshole,
but not because of that.

1035
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,704
Can you put on a little show
for him?

1036
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:29,906
Mm-hmm.

1037
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:38,347
I mean, is it possible that
the girl could have a penis?

1038
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,916
It's happened before.

1039
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,884
I would love her just the same.

1040
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,519
What?

1041
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,473
Where, where?

1042
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:05,641
What?

1043
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,882
Bubble-butt.
Muffin top.

1044
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,552
Do it up.
Muffin back.

1045
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:17,653
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Muffin front.

1046
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:21,624
Dru-Dru-Drury Lane.
Drury Lane.

1047
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,827
So you can't see it,
but the studs are spaced

1048
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:27,396
24 inches rather than 16.

1049
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:29,665
Saved 25% on the studs.

1050
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:33,169
Turned that into six lineal feet
of floor-to-ceiling insulation.

1051
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:35,972
- Six lineal feet, huh?
- Yup.

1052
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,440
You love insulation.

1053
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:40,409
Oh, also, I designed these
floor-to-floor straps.

1054
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,411
You know? That we use
for certain heavily-loaded

1055
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,113
second story shear panels.

1056
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:47,683
But I only use those if the
calculations prove necessary.

1057
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,018
And did they?

1058
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,353
Did they what?

1059
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,621
Did the calculations
prove necessary?

1060
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:54,323
Oh, you guys are fucking
with me.

1061
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,092
You guys, I just want to know
what you think of the place.

1062
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,994
Baby, I love it.
I love it.

1063
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,662
- It's awesome.
- I love it. I love it.

1064
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:00,930
Show... what's this?
Show me over here.

1065
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:02,031
Oh, those are my storm windows?

1066
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:06,035
You want to see
my storm windows?

1067
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,503
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah?

1068
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,106
- Yeah, I love it.
- Do you?

1069
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,674
Why are you so smart?

1070
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,286
Hi, are you here
for the open house?

1071
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:27,656
Come right this way.

1072
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,225
Oh, fuck.

1073
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,394
He's really the best contractor
I ever worked with.

1074
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:33,362
Oh, me too.

1075
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,898
Okay, come on, we should pick
Teddy up from his play date.

1076
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,400
Come on, babe.

1077
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,351
What the fuck?

1078
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:56,685
Mold?!

1079
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:57,753
What the fuck?

1080
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:59,555
You guys, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

1081
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,689
I got an inspection on Monday.

1082
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,757
It's okay.
He's asleep.

1083
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,858
Okay.
I'm so sorry, baby.

1084
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,760
I'm so fucking hungry.

1085
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,435
Dehumidifier.
<i>Dijo,</i> dehumidifier.

1086
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,105
Hey, want to order a movie
On Demand?

1087
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:17,406
I won't make it.

1088
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,874
Come on, we'll get
something stupid.

1089
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:20,943
We can get<i> The Princess Bride.</i>

1090
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:22,778
I gotta clean up.

1091
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,915
Fuck, I feel like this kid
is trying to tunnel out
my lower back.

1092
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,477
Sit down.
I got it.

1093
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,689
<i>Bring It On?</i>

1094
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,694
- What's going on here?
- He's sick.

1095
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:39,728
Can you get the Vicks?

1096
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,464
Yeah.

1097
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,201
- Hey.
- Oh, thanks.

1098
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:47,269
A little Vicks for Mom.

1099
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,105
A little beer for Unky Jake.

1100
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,540
A little rubdown for the man.

1101
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:54,410
Here you go, honey.

1102
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:57,046
Is my hair crazy?

1103
00:51:57,048 --> 00:52:00,116
No, it looks nice.

1104
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,650
What about mine?

1105
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:04,086
No, 'cause you had it chemically
straightened.

1106
00:52:04,088 --> 00:52:06,055
I had it chemically
straightened, like, once.

1107
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:08,791
For prom, okay?

1108
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,127
Want to trade?

1109
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,429
Yeah.

1110
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,498
- Jakey.
- There we go.

1111
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,633
Let's get Uncle Jakey
just a little sick.

1112
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,767
Okay.

1113
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:19,768
You want to hook a brother up?

1114
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,070
Mm-hmm.

1115
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,171
Thanks.

1116
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,572
There we go, buddy.

1117
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,774
Let's get that rub on.

1118
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:28,410
Yeah.

1119
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,312
You know, Unky Jakeys
have to pay a lot more

1120
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,881
for these rubdowns.

1121
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,920
Dude.

1122
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,588
What?

1123
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,992
What is that face?
I know that face.

1124
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,326
What face?
What are you talking about?

1125
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,761
You were having a sex flashback.

1126
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:46,962
I wasn't having a sex flashback.

1127
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,331
Yes, you were.
I saw it.

1128
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,366
Tell me.
Who did you sleep with?

1129
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:51,500
Stop it. No.

1130
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,968
You've only been here
two months

1131
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,637
and you're already
f-u-c-k-i-n-g-ing somebody?

1132
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,272
I'm holding your son.

1133
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:57,940
You're a pervert.

1134
00:52:57,942 --> 00:52:59,942
I saw that face.

1135
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,212
Busy.

1136
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,446
You're busy.

1137
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,182
He, like, sneezed on me.

1138
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,704
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1139
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,994
"One morning, Little Rabbit
sat on the bank.

1140
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:22,164
"He pricked his ears
and listened to the trit-trot,

1141
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:25,301
trit-trot of a pony..."

1142
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:26,969
Can we put something better on?

1143
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,170
No, I'm the guest.

1144
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,210
Hey!

1145
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:35,811
That' not how "I'm The Guest"
is played.

1146
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:39,181
The guest gets to decide
what TV shows to watch,

1147
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:42,751
what games are played, and what
to listen to on the tape player.

1148
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,386
You always cheat.

1149
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,223
You've always been a cheater.

1150
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,525
I'm the guest.

1151
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:54,096
"Everywhere that Big Chick went,
Little Chick went, too."

1152
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,331
You're right.
This is better.

1153
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,932
"Big Chick went looking
for berries

1154
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:59,068
"and Little Chick followed.

1155
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,936
"Big Chick took a walk
in the woods

1156
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,772
and Little Chick followed."

1157
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,174
He's asleep.

1158
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:10,279
"'But I'll be lonely, '
said Little Chick.

1159
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:13,115
"The next morning,
Big Chick woke up early,

1160
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:17,186
and she left without waiting
for Little Chick..."

1161
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:19,555
Fresh lemonade from powder.

1162
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:21,624
Fresh powder.
Just 50¢.

1163
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,959
I love that you kept the VCR.

1164
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,762
Okay.

1165
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:30,766
Okay, well,
it's pretty cold out,

1166
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,535
but I think we're gonna get
some people walking by.

1167
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:34,870
Why were we always trying
to sell things

1168
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,905
that people didn't want to buy?

1169
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:40,709
Fuck.
I'm still doing that.

1170
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:41,944
You had such a cute voice.

1171
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,646
That was the only reason
we sold anything.

1172
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:46,915
It was like the center
of our business model.

1173
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,285
God, you made me hawk
all those sea shells.

1174
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,621
They were all fucking broken.

1175
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,257
"Sea shells.
Get your seashells."

1176
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,725
- "Seashells"

1177
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:57,993
That's not...
I didn't sound like a...

1178
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,462
You were so cute.

1179
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,364
No, I wasn't.

1180
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,170
I drank with a student.

1181
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,907
"Drank" drank?

1182
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,976
Yeah.
It's bad.

1183
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:17,146
I could get fired.

1184
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,681
Maybe I want to get fired.

1185
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:20,582
Just fuck everything up.

1186
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:24,520
You're pregnant.
They can't fire you.

1187
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,456
This girl, Sarah,
she's great.

1188
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:30,859
She's gonna get
in everywhere she applies.

1189
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,928
She sounds like you.

1190
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,001
I wish you came to visit
because you were happy.

1191
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,036
I was happy.
Look at me.

1192
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,373
We're gonna just keep our eye
out for a while.

1193
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,542
Are you happy?

1194
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,980
Okay, turn it off.

1195
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,349
Bye.

1196
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,150
Get out of here.

1197
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,169
Thank you for not throwing
everything away.

1198
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

1199
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:33,615
How's Teddy?

1200
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,918
He's wheezy, but sleeping.

1201
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,553
How's the mold?

1202
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,087
Bro, it's bad.

1203
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,224
Still moldy?

1204
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:43,459
You like your room?

1205
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:44,827
Took me, like,
two hours

1206
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:46,061
to drag that fucking
Nordic Track out of here.

1207
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,998
That's great.

1208
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,267
You want to smoke out?

1209
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,436
No.

1210
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,205
You want to keep me company?

1211
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,176
<i>Cats.</i>
Now and forever.

1212
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,813
This is the same wood
from the cabinets.

1213
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,183
And, you know, he's gonna be
able to eat on it.

1214
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,185
Fucking Play-Doh.

1215
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,186
All that shit.

1216
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,589
It's gonna be nice
to have his own space.

1217
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:14,957
Yeah, it's great.

1218
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:15,858
I gotta go to bed, man.

1219
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,959
What?
No, dude.

1220
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:18,694
Come on, I got snacks.

1221
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,362
I can't.

1222
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:24,967
I can't look at tiny tables
and pretend like we're cool.

1223
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:26,335
Your kid was sick
and you were off

1224
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:30,772
fucking Plainy
the Real Estate Agent.

1225
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:32,007
Look.
Hmm?

1226
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,709
What is that?

1227
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,511
That's mold.
Okay?

1228
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:36,645
She wasn't there?
Really?

1229
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,647
Dude. Mold.
Mold, mold, mold.

1230
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,849
- Mold, fucking everywhere.
- Yeah.

1231
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,784
I don't understand how you can
make it okay

1232
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:45,020
in your head, because it's not.
Okay?

1233
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,523
And you walk around, like, just
because you're building things,

1234
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,291
everything's even?

1235
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,493
Do you think I'm an asshole?

1236
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:52,961
I don't know.

1237
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,963
No, you don't.
Because you know I'm not.

1238
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,131
Yeah, you're fantastic.

1239
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,534
Look, I needed attention, Jake.

1240
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,903
I needed somebody to look at me

1241
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,037
instead of being fucking
distracted

1242
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,039
by something more important.

1243
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,241
- And that was all?
- That's all. Okay?

1244
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:11,880
I would talk about whatever
and she would think I'm awesome.

1245
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,082
Okay? And it only got weird
when we started to...

1246
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,751
Oh, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

1247
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,520
The sex was terrible.
It sucked, okay?

1248
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,155
And the second time
was even worse...

1249
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:21,990
Just stop talking 'cause I don't
want to hear.

1250
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,559
Twice.
That's how many times we did it.

1251
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,827
That's it.

1252
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,401
Don't fucking throw
little cookies at me.

1253
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:33,669
Hey!

1254
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:36,138
Just stop fucking around
on my family.

1255
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:41,410
Right.
Your family.

1256
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,078
So you think you've got it all
worked out now, huh?

1257
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,446
After three months.

1258
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:47,115
You know what it means
to have a family.

1259
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,383
To have a wife, to have a kid.

1260
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:50,752
To have a kid, Jake.

1261
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,089
You've got it
all worked out now.

1262
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,591
I was here.
Where were you?

1263
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,960
I was working.

1264
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,227
You know what?
You don't know what the fuck

1265
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,696
you're talking about.
Okay?

1266
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:03,365
I mean, you don't really
live here.

1267
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,927
Nobody expects anything
from you.

1268
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:30,092
Okay, okay, point taken.

1269
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:32,060
A little cabbage
goes a long way.

1270
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,763
But look,
you two do this at every meal.

1271
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:37,232
You know, I used to have
a waterbed in here.

1272
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:38,734
Oh.

1273
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:41,403
That sounds really
uncomfortable.

1274
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:44,172
Yeah, it was, but I loved it.

1275
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:47,743
I had to read 100 books
with my mom to earn it.

1276
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:49,144
And then we sold it
'cause she thought

1277
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,780
it was gonna give me scoliosis.

1278
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:53,749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1279
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,017
Let me see.

1280
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,185
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1281
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,587
Are you a doctor now?

1282
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,130
How does it feel?

1283
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,197
It feels straight enough
for me.

1284
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,966
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1285
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,128
Well, that's what you get
for working out once a month.

1286
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,972
You know Franny's mom?

1287
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:19,141
She asked me about you
for nanny share.

1288
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:20,442
Oh, yeah?

1289
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:21,610
Sounds hot.

1290
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:23,345
Shut up.

1291
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,813
That just means she wants
you to take care

1292
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,448
of Franny and Teddy together.

1293
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,051
One more kid.
More money.

1294
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,886
Shit.

1295
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,454
What?

1296
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:35,357
I mean, she thinks you're really
good with Teddy.

1297
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,858
Whatever, you don't have
to do it.

1298
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,293
- Don't freak out.
- I'm not freaking out.

1299
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:43,165
It's just, like,
this gig is temporary.

1300
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,734
Okay, that's cool.

1301
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:50,672
You know, Armin's band
is playing at Brennan's
on Saturday.

1302
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:51,907
The manny has a band.

1303
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:54,376
- Perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,045
So, would you like
to go together?

1305
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,214
Me and you?

1306
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,917
Two nannies on a date together?

1307
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:04,252
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1308
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,988
Yeah, that's cool.
Let's do it.

1309
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,670
And I might get up there
and sing with him.

1310
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,045
- What up?
- Hey.

1311
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,780
Uh, have you seen Teddy's
Giraffe-y?

1312
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,582
I can't find it anywhere
and he's freaking out.

1313
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:34,716
I can't put him down.

1314
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,084
Oh, shit.

1315
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,285
Yeah. I think we left it
at Georgia's house.

1316
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,687
I'll go get it.

1317
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,589
Oh, no, no, no.
It's too late.

1318
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,924
No. It's fine.
I'm happy to do it.

1319
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,593
I literally have nothing
better to do.

1320
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,094
Thank you.

1321
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,866
It is gonna happen.

1322
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,434
They are gonna raise
the billion six.

1323
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,269
They're having an IPO
before the end of the year.

1324
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,104
Right, we have a shit-ton
of homework to do for our guys.

1325
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,441
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm Jake, Teddy's uncle.

1326
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,409
- Georgia's friend.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

1327
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,078
Teddy left his toy giraffe
here earlier today

1328
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,080
and now he's having
a Chernobyl-level meltdown...

1329
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:06,448
All right, come in.

1330
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,550
So, look, do we have
the personnel, or not?

1331
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:11,620
I mean... you know... let me, um,
let me call you back.

1332
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,889
I got a guy here looking
for a giraffe.

1333
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,310
Hey, can I use the car tonight?

1334
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,845
Where are you going?
Are you going out?

1335
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:37,946
I'm going to Brennan's.

1336
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:40,248
For some fucking shitty-ass
band.

1337
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,818
Wait, okay.
Wait, well, I'll come with you.

1338
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,686
You can drink.
I can drive.

1339
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:46,588
Baby, can you stay here
with our sleeping child,

1340
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,590
and then I get to go out?

1341
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,124
Yeah.
Of course.

1342
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:50,425
Great.

1343
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,459
Awesome.

1344
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:54,996
Give me two seconds.

1345
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,431
Fuck you.

1346
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,627
Is this too much?

1347
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:27,028
- Yeah.
- No.

1348
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,363
- It's too short.
- No, that looks hot.

1349
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,397
- Yeah?
- Put some pants on. Please.

1350
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:30,999
Oh, shut up.

1351
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,067
- You look perfect.
- Go on, please.

1352
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:33,735
Oh, come on.

1353
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:34,903
Relax, let's go.

1354
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,172
Oh, hot!

1355
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:38,406
You look good.

1356
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:40,575
Bring that back home.

1357
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:50,719
Jesus, enough.

1358
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:54,522
You look like a Tim Burton
creature.

1359
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:57,158
Hey. What was going on
with you and Danny?

1360
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,493
What do you mean?

1361
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:01,696
Did he make fun of your shirt
or something?

1362
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:05,734
What's wrong with my shirt?
It's casual chic.

1363
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,702
I can't believe how long
you've been here.

1364
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:10,405
Yeah, it's crazy.

1365
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:14,843
No, no, it's, like,
it's flown by.

1366
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:16,845
Do you like your room?

1367
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,046
Yeah.

1368
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:19,681
Yeah, it's nice.

1369
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:21,784
Whoo!

1370
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,389
Why are we stopping?

1371
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,157
'Cause I'm picking up a friend.

1372
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,361
Oh, my God,
am I on your date?

1373
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:36,631
Shit, is that why
you're wearing CK One?

1374
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:37,899
- No.
- I can smell you from here.

1375
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:39,801
It's fine.

1376
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,903
Blanca, you remember my sister,
Justine.

1377
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:43,972
- Hi.
- Hey.

1378
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,808
Do you always bring
your pregnant sister on dates?

1379
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,476
Just when I'm trying
to guarantee I won't get laid.

1380
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,644
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

1381
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:52,147
You should just take me home.

1382
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:53,882
No.
No, no, no, no.

1383
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:55,917
You know what?
I love your eye shadow.

1384
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:57,485
- Thanks!
- It's gorgeous.

1385
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,154
Oh, thank you.
I love your hair.

1386
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:00,388
Oh, my God, thank you.

1387
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,423
It's incredible.

1388
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:02,757
I love your highlights.

1389
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:04,793
- I did these myself.
- Really?

1390
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,461
- Yeah. L'Oreal.
- This coat's from Old Navy.

1391
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,997
I always wanted to do highlights
but I'm always afraid...

1392
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:10,765
Don't want to miss the band.

1393
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,801
You didn't tell me
this was a date, by the way.

1394
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,102
This is gonna be a fun time.

1395
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,805
You know, I never go out.

1396
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,212
Thanks, guys.

1397
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:58,446
We'll be back in ten.

1398
01:06:58,448 --> 01:06:59,848
Stay sexy.

1399
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,683
That's not
Toad the Wet Sprocket.

1400
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:02,717
I know you think it is.

1401
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:04,285
But it's not.

1402
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,824
You want me to get you another
cran and soda?

1403
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:13,828
No, it's cool.
I got it.

1404
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,798
Sorry, she just
doesn't get out much.

1405
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,700
She's awesome.

1406
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:21,503
So, um, Georgia's dad,

1407
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,005
he said that he talked
to you the other day.

1408
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:27,308
Yeah, Teddy left his giraffe,
so I went and grabbed it.

1409
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,410
Mm.

1410
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:30,578
So you got a giraffe
and a job offer.

1411
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:31,813
That's cool.

1412
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:33,348
He said you were there
for like an hour,

1413
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,383
and that you were
really impressive.

1414
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:38,253
Yeah, it's a finance job,
which is fucking boring.

1415
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:41,256
It's practically entry-level.

1416
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:43,525
You gonna take it?

1417
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:46,494
Uh, I am.

1418
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,396
You know, my cousin needs a job.

1419
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:52,400
Your sister should totally
hire her to take care of Teddy.

1420
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,840
What?

1421
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:02,877
I like having sex with you, but
I wasn't planning our wedding.

1422
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:07,515
Okay.

1423
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,551
You're not taking us seriously,
are you?

1424
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:12,921
I know.
I just...

1425
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,456
I thought that you were
taking me seriously

1426
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:19,294
and it made me feel better
about my life.

1427
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:22,597
Oh.
That's fucked up.

1428
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,966
Hmm.

1429
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:28,036
I'm gonna go play<i> Asteroids.</i>

1430
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:32,440
I'm gonna stay here
and get drunk.

1431
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,442
That's cool.

1432
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:38,313
You do that.

1433
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,615
See, if you stay here,
you already have a girlfriend.

1434
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,450
She's not my girlfriend.

1435
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,586
Okay,<i> sensitivo.</i>

1436
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:45,820
I used to sneak in here.

1437
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:47,388
I used to want to be in here
so badly.

1438
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,923
How depressing is that?

1439
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:51,326
You know what?
I can't hear you mope anymore.

1440
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,895
Okay?

1441
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:56,164
Look.

1442
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:59,000
Pregnant Running Man.

1443
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:02,737
Stretching.

1444
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:04,706
Stretching.

1445
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,010
Come on.

1446
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:10,512
You just came to drink?

1447
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:13,581
It's a bar.

1448
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:14,816
Well, we don't have to hang out.

1449
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:15,950
Go and talk to your
not girlfriend.

1450
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:17,318
She'll make you feel better.

1451
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,256
I'll feel better when I get back
to my life.

1452
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:23,525
There's a job in the city.
I'm gonna take it.

1453
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,693
You're gonna have to find
someone else
to take care of Teddy.

1454
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:28,263
Blanca said she know someone,
so...

1455
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:31,966
Just so you're prepared.

1456
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:33,668
Wow.

1457
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,504
That's great.

1458
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,839
You must be relieved.

1459
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,040
Don't make me feel bad.

1460
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,975
It's a real job.
I have to take it.

1461
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:42,610
No, no.
It's great.

1462
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,779
Could you just get me my juice?

1463
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,214
Okay, don't.
Okay?

1464
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,116
If you say that you're gonna
get your own juice,

1465
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:50,051
then I believe that
that is what you're gonna do.

1466
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:51,819
Why are you getting like this?

1467
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:54,022
It's just, like, if you want me
to get you juice, just ask.

1468
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:56,191
But don't test me.
I'm not Danny.

1469
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:58,693
Oh, thanks.

1470
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,395
Just, like, sleep
with your husband, okay?

1471
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:03,831
I'm not your problem.

1472
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,801
What?
I never go out.

1473
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:08,203
Fuck you.

1474
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,808
- So what, we're leaving?
- Yeah.

1475
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,511
Fine. Take the car.
I'll stay somewhere else.

1476
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:18,479
- Right, where are you gonna go?
- I have friends.

1477
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,081
Really? Why didn't you stay with
them for the last three months?

1478
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,749
I've been here for almost three
months helping you.

1479
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,585
But I don't want that
to be my whole life.

1480
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:26,754
Don't worry.
It's not.

1481
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:28,489
People die.
People are born.

1482
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,858
But the only reason you stick
around for more than two minutes

1483
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,026
is when you need something.

1484
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:33,695
I needed you
to make me feel better.

1485
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,330
I had something real,
and now it's gone.

1486
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:36,864
Don't talk to me
about how you had something real

1487
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,166
and now it's gone.

1488
01:10:38,168 --> 01:10:40,335
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1489
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:42,203
No one told you you had to
drop out of law school.

1490
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:43,438
She didn't ask you to come home
and take care of her.

1491
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,939
Because she didn't have to.

1492
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:46,040
She said she didn't want me
to interrupt my life

1493
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,609
just because she was sick.

1494
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:49,277
We didn't even come close
to interrupting your life.

1495
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,445
If you had a dog, it would
have interrupted your life

1496
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:51,946
more than Mom dying.

1497
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,715
You don't think I wanted
to be there when she died?

1498
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,116
I called you. I called you
when we knew it was close.

1499
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:56,784
I told the nurse, I said,

1500
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:58,019
"Tell me when it's close,
I need to call my brother.

1501
01:10:58,021 --> 01:10:59,087
We need to be here together."

1502
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,688
I left you messages.

1503
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:01,789
I couldn't breathe.

1504
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,858
Dad was here.
Danny was here.

1505
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,892
That's right, I'm an asshole
and Danny's a saint.

1506
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:06,527
I wanted you here.

1507
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,463
Me. I called you
because I needed you.

1508
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,365
But you know what?
It's fine.

1509
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:11,933
Because Danny held Mom's hand
with me until I was ready

1510
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,568
to let it go.

1511
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,536
Well, Danny's fucking around
with that real estate agent,

1512
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:17,305
but I'm glad he was there.

1513
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,977
I'm sorry.

1514
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:24,979
I had to tell you.

1515
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,957
What... wait a second.

1516
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,600
Hey, baby.
How's the concert?

1517
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:46,768
Hey.

1518
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,169
It's a girl.

1519
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,873
Wh...

1520
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,213
I'm sorry.

1521
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,554
Justine, I'm sorry.

1522
01:12:58,408 --> 01:12:59,807
This one.
Not this one!

1523
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:00,975
Yeah, but you said
you wanted to wear the...

1524
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,377
- No!
- Come on, Teddy, you said

1525
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:03,644
you wanted to wear
the robot shirt.

1526
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:05,012
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

1527
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:06,814
You said you wanted to wear
the robot shirt.

1528
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,484
I don't... I really don't want to
have this discussion right now.

1529
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,553
No!

1530
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,555
Hey, where's Danny?

1531
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,491
I don't know.
He's not here.

1532
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,092
But I made him leave the car.

1533
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:19,494
Come on, I got this.

1534
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:20,895
- Yeah, over here.
- Yeah, come here, honey.

1535
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,497
- He's right there.
- I know, I know.

1536
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:23,898
- Let's put on your shirt, okay?
- No.

1537
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,500
- Yeah.
- Come on, honey.

1538
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:26,601
You love this shirt.

1539
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:28,436
Okay.
Use soft hands, please.

1540
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:29,704
No, Mommy, no!

1541
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:30,772
- Please? Please?
- Yeah, no hitting.

1542
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:33,074
Hey! No.
Come on. Soft hands.

1543
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,209
You know what?

1544
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:38,079
I think you guys
just need to go.

1545
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:43,284
I just need some time to myself.

1546
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:47,188
Hey, Teddy, you wanna
take a chill pill, bro?

1547
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,590
Chill pill, bro.

1548
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,092
Yeah.

1549
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:53,761
Trains

1550
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:54,763
Trains? You like trains?

1551
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,197
Mm.

1552
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,533
I'm a big fan of trains myself.

1553
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:00,201
Don't ride backwards
on a train though, okay?

1554
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,369
Why?

1555
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:03,738
It'll make you sick.

1556
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,072
Do you ever get nauseous?

1557
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,040
I don't know.

1558
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,809
No?

1559
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:39,140
Dude, he's a genius.

1560
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,942
You've never met
a three-year-old.

1561
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:41,909
This is normal.

1562
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:43,144
This is not normal.

1563
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,979
How are all the museums closed
today?

1564
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,514
It's Monday.
Everything's closed on Monday.

1565
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,983
Museums, theaters, that amazing
meatball place.

1566
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,284
I gotta tape everything up.

1567
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:51,652
Make sure he doesn't
hurt himself.

1568
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,688
Oh, that's great.
I mean, for me.

1569
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,456
You wouldn't believe what
happened here last Friday.

1570
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,657
This hooker hit a vein.

1571
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:57,992
Teddy, do you want to go
to the park?

1572
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,460
No park!

1573
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:01,662
- I mean, it bled everywhere.
- Come on, buddy.

1574
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,698
You want to stay in Hudson's
apartment all day?

1575
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,999
I have to go to the park.

1576
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,701
Yeah, well, he's going
to the park

1577
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:08,703
for a different reason
than you're going to the park.

1578
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:09,704
Yeah, but two birds, right?

1579
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:10,986
One stone.

1580
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:14,542
Hello?
Yeah?

1581
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:15,776
Where are you guys?

1582
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,345
Dinner's almost ready.

1583
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:19,013
We're in the city.
At Hudson's place.

1584
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,047
Hudson?

1585
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,049
Hey, Jake's hot sister.

1586
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,550
That dirtbag?

1587
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:24,218
- I can't believe you.
- Hudson says hello.

1588
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,220
Hello?

1589
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,723
Hello?

1590
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:29,724
What does she look like now?

1591
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:30,992
My sister?

1592
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:32,994
- My pregnant sister?
- She still hot?

1593
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:35,863
Oh, you're a little crazy
person, huh?

1594
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
Mommy!

1595
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:41,168
Baby!

1596
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,336
Hi.

1597
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:43,638
Hey.

1598
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,540
- Hey.
- Hi, Mama!

1599
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,308
Hey, baby.

1600
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,844
You told me to take him
on a trip.

1601
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,646
We're going home now.

1602
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,814
Oh, man.

1603
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:55,349
Yeah.

1604
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,718
This is not an appropriate place
for a child.

1605
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,280
You're not an appropriate place
for a child.

1606
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:05,393
So should I follow you?

1607
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,428
No, do not follow me.

1608
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:15,870
Hey, uh,
I'm out of clean sheets,

1609
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:18,906
but we're gonna make
this work.

1610
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,213
Most of our traders
are in their 20s.

1611
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,249
This work is gonna kick
your ass.

1612
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,951
I am used to
having my ass kicked.

1613
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:31,218
And the salary's...

1614
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,286
It's awful.

1615
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,756
I'm aware.
It's okay.

1616
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,091
Well, Rich Kaplan
says you're good.

1617
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,093
You probably are.

1618
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,261
You play golf?

1619
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,729
Yeah, a little bit.
You play?

1620
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:43,731
Yeah, all the time.
I used to play in college.

1621
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:45,199
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't recommend it

1622
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,201
unless I believed
in the product myself.

1623
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,869
I'm telling you,
Emmy and Morgan

1624
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,305
are gonna thank you,
once they're old enough to talk.

1625
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:52,807
All right.

1626
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:55,076
Okay, I gotta go.
Thanks, Howard, bye.

1627
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:56,611
There was no receptionist
so I just walked back here.

1628
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,145
I noticed that.

1629
01:16:58,147 --> 01:16:59,714
You know this is my place
of work, right?

1630
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:00,982
You won't call me back.
So what am I supposed to do?

1631
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:02,416
I don't know.
Use your inside voice.

1632
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,884
She won't see me.

1633
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,953
I haven't hung out
with Teddy in two days.

1634
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,722
He had a doctor's visit
the other day.

1635
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:09,090
I didn't even know about it
until the next day.

1636
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:10,091
Whoa, what's wrong with him?

1637
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,892
That croup-flu thing again.

1638
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:13,327
Okay, well,
what's his temperature?

1639
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:16,063
I don't know.
That's my point, man.

1640
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:19,333
I mean, Teddy could be, like,
counting to, like, 100 by now.

1641
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:20,668
I seriously doubt that.

1642
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,003
I'm writing him these little
tiny postcards.

1643
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:23,571
I don't know what else to do.

1644
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:27,475
Sorry, all we have
is the small ones.

1645
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,479
He has his little swim class
graduation next week.

1646
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:34,582
What if they wear caps
and I'm not there?

1647
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:37,918
Fuck, man,
it's not like I'm unhappy.

1648
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,189
Okay, where are you living?

1649
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:43,758
In that house I just finished.

1650
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,926
On an air mattress.
No sheets.

1651
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:47,962
I don't know how the fuck you
slept on that raft

1652
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:49,363
for three months.

1653
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,698
You know what, man?
Whatever. I deserve it.

1654
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,433
Well, you can begin
by going to Target.

1655
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:53,768
Get the Martha Stewart sheets.

1656
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,636
They're soft as fuck.
I'm telling you.

1657
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:56,804
Are you gonna help me?

1658
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:58,606
Are you gonna use
your inside voice?

1659
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:01,042
Are you gonna help me?

1660
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:26,701
Well, you are a totally
uneventful pregnancy.

1661
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:27,802
Very healthy.

1662
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:29,036
Very boring.

1663
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,638
See you next month.

1664
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:46,253
We are getting a nice bump in
our advanced risk investments.

1665
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:49,390
I gotta say, Jake, I wasn't
sure you were up for this.

1666
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:51,892
But these are some
animal numbers.

1667
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,261
Yeah, bro, what's
with the 5:00 A.M. clock-ins?

1668
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:56,823
What are you?
Part rooster?

1669
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,367
I hear...
Just heard,

1670
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:01,502
that he does like cock.

1671
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,537
Oh, shit!

1672
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:04,939
I'm just... don't,
don't shoot the messenger.

1673
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,540
Early bird gives the beej.

1674
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:13,447
Ha. Cock. Awesome. Yes.

1675
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:17,051
Uh, but like Phil was saying,
we are seeing a ton of reward

1676
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:18,185
in our high-yield portfolio.

1677
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:21,122
And... excuse me.

1678
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:22,289
Sorry.

1679
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,058
If we look towards
the second quarter,

1680
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,026
we're gonna see some real big
numbers

1681
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:27,461
if we just stay the course on,
um...

1682
01:19:29,232 --> 01:19:30,865
I'm sorry.
I just gotta quickly take this.

1683
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:34,268
Excuse me.

1684
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,036
Hey, is everything okay?

1685
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,104
No! Hey!

1686
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,472
No, Mommy, no!

1687
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:40,407
Justine, it's your brother,
Jake, hello?

1688
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,877
Teddy. Teddy, we need you
to put your trunks on.

1689
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:45,780
You cannot be a naked boy
in swim class.

1690
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:47,782
I can be a naked boy.

1691
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,583
Just one second.

1692
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,986
Teddy. Teddy, we need
to put your trunks on, okay?

1693
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,554
Hey, where's my giraffe?

1694
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:55,122
Honey.

1695
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,724
Unky Jake, Unky Jake, Unky Jake!

1696
01:19:56,726 --> 01:20:00,394
Teddy, hey, can you please
have soft...

1697
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:02,296
Sorry, man.
I've got a family emergency.

1698
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,398
So I'll be back
in a couple of hours tomorrow

1699
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,301
if it runs any longer, okay?

1700
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:11,138
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1701
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,808
I just called you an animal.
I never say that.

1702
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,843
Right, and I'm gonna be back
in that chair tomorrow,

1703
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:17,778
animal-ing it up.

1704
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:22,116
Okay, so, you have a choice
you have to make.

1705
01:20:22,118 --> 01:20:23,918
Either you're the guy
who sits right back in the chair

1706
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,153
right now.

1707
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:31,358
Or you're the guy who leaves
work for his family.

1708
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,593
Right.

1709
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:35,362
Don't... don't give me
that look.

1710
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:36,630
This isn't<i> Jerry Maguire,</i> dude.

1711
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,865
I won't fire you.

1712
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:40,367
You can put up numbers.

1713
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:43,871
But you know this is one
of those decisions

1714
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:47,608
that will keep you
right here.

1715
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:49,977
In the middle.

1716
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:51,846
Forever.

1717
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,119
Fucking intense.

1718
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:08,229
I'll be back bright and early,
okay?

1719
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:10,831
Like a rooster.

1720
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:15,469
Cock, cock, man.

1721
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:19,974
All right, Neal,
what else do you got for us?

1722
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:21,642
"There's a lot of reward
in risk."

1723
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,210
Yeah, I just heard Jake
say that.

1724
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,879
What else do you got, Neal?
Jesus fucking Christ.

1725
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:28,148
Right, well, I'm picking up
where he left off.

1726
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,494
Hurry up.
The meter's running.

1727
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,062
Let's go.

1728
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,120
- Schnell, schnell, come on.
- I'm coming.

1729
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,248
Oh, my God.

1730
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,784
Don't... Look, just let me talk.

1731
01:22:03,786 --> 01:22:05,219
You don't even have
a bathing suit.

1732
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:06,954
I have on boxer briefs.
It's fine.

1733
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:08,455
Not really.

1734
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,424
- I'll get out.
- No, we're coming in.

1735
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,526
Daddy, I'm swimming!

1736
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:13,528
Buddy, you are swimming.

1737
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:14,862
- And Mama, too.
- Honestly.

1738
01:22:14,864 --> 01:22:16,297
Oh, come on.
We're getting out.

1739
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:17,531
Oh, that is cold.

1740
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:18,699
Danny, this is ridiculous.

1741
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:20,034
Hey, ladies.
Hi, hi.

1742
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,102
I'm Teddy's daddy.

1743
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,737
- Hey, buddy.
- Come on.

1744
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:25,739
What? Dude, why are you
holding onto me?

1745
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:27,408
I'm not entirely comfortable
here.

1746
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:28,642
Yeah, me neither.

1747
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:31,478
Okay, I'll hold him.
You guys talk.

1748
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,080
Go to Uncle Jakey, come on.

1749
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:34,448
- What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you.

1750
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,952
Hey, buddy.

1751
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,720
Look.

1752
01:22:39,722 --> 01:22:41,388
It was a one time thing.

1753
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:45,793
Okay? That happened
one-and-a-half times, okay?

1754
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,828
Justine, I'm sorry.

1755
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:49,563
I'm sorry, you know I am.

1756
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:52,566
I don't know what I needed,
but it wasn't that.

1757
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,268
And I'll do anything.

1758
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:57,071
I'll wake up every morning
with Teddy until you forgive me.

1759
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:58,405
I'll get up in the middle
of the night

1760
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:01,008
with the baby
until you forgive me.

1761
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,743
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

1762
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:06,914
But you've gotta let me
come home.

1763
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:09,249
So many visitors.

1764
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:12,152
Teddy, do you think you're ready
to try and jump in?

1765
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,021
- Oh, today?
- What? Wait.

1766
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:15,255
No, he doesn't have to,
if he's not ready.

1767
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:16,824
Hey, buddy.

1768
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:18,292
Buddy, you gotta jump in okay?

1769
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:19,360
We gotta go under, okay?
Watch Daddy.

1770
01:23:19,362 --> 01:23:20,627
Like this.
Ready?

1771
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,267
You do it.

1772
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:28,602
Okay, we gotta go under.

1773
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:29,803
- We gotta show him.
- You gonna go under?

1774
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:31,271
Yeah.
Today's our last class.

1775
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:32,806
- I don't want to.
- She's right.

1776
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:34,108
She's right.
You gotta do it.

1777
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,376
You know what?
I'll stay up here, okay?

1778
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:37,378
I'll stay up here
in case he jumps in.

1779
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:38,879
You hold onto Jake,
and I'll hold onto you.

1780
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:40,781
- Nobody's gonna drown.
- Jesus. Drown?

1781
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:42,282
What? Isn't that
what you're worried about?

1782
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:44,118
You know what?
You're new to this class.

1783
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,285
Why don't you just back off?

1784
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:46,620
Hey, I'm not new to this class.

1785
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:47,821
I been in this class
a long time.

1786
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,023
I'm gonna be in this class
forever.

1787
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:50,491
Okay.
Hold onto me.

1788
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:51,959
We're going under.

1789
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:54,028
Okay?
Teddy, look at Jakey and Mommy.

1790
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,997
We're gonna go under.
Okay?

1791
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:58,866
You know I'm doing this just
so you'll stop talking to me.

1792
01:23:58,868 --> 01:24:00,901
Great.
I'll be right here.

1793
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,369
One...

1794
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,571
Two...

1795
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:07,474
Three!

1796
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:08,409
Come on, buddy.

1797
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:10,010
Jump.

1798
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:36,870
- Hey.
- Hey.

1799
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:37,905
I thought we were all getting
pizza.

1800
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:39,273
She's back at the house.

1801
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:41,175
- She's in labor.
- What?

1802
01:24:41,177 --> 01:24:42,576
What the fuck are you doing
picking me up here?

1803
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,878
Chill out, dude.
She's in the first inning.

1804
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,947
Got, like, hours to go.

1805
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:49,583
Wanna blaze?

1806
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,884
I'm just kidding.

1807
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:52,519
We do have to pick up
a pizza though.

1808
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,055
She'll fucking kill me
if I don't.

1809
01:24:55,057 --> 01:24:58,725
"And the owl baby took
his new owl baby sister,

1810
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:02,629
"and together they flew down
from the tree

1811
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:04,565
"to their little red car.

1812
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:07,534
"'Let's go fast, '
said the owl baby sister.

1813
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:10,904
'Put on your seatbelt, '
said her owl baby brother."

1814
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:12,539
Hi, guys.

1815
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,941
I'm gonna go put your bag
in the car.

1816
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:15,242
Teddy, you wanna help Daddy?

1817
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:16,877
- No.
- It's okay.

1818
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:19,379
We're here and we're reading
about baby owls.

1819
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:20,881
Okay.

1820
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:23,984
Well, tell your brother
to relax.

1821
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:25,919
Kiss.

1822
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:27,588
Okay.

1823
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,330
Hey.
How are you doing?

1824
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:37,397
When was your last contraction?

1825
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:38,932
20 minutes ago.
Relax.

1826
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:40,801
People should be moving
at a different clip here.

1827
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:43,604
Hey, Teddy, Mommy and Daddy
are gonna go to the hospital

1828
01:25:43,606 --> 01:25:45,072
for a little while,

1829
01:25:45,074 --> 01:25:46,106
and you're gonna stay here
with Unky Jake, okay?

1830
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:48,008
What does that mean?

1831
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,243
Donuts!

1832
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:50,344
Cookies!

1833
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:51,612
More than two shows!

1834
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:53,580
Three shows!

1835
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:56,350
Yeah.

1836
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,253
Who stayed with you
when I was born?

1837
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:01,455
I have no idea.

1838
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:04,625
Justine, your fort-building
skills

1839
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:05,827
are very structurally unsound.

1840
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,127
I'm in labor.

1841
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:11,832
Honestly, I'd put more
sconces in here.

1842
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,367
Noted.

1843
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:21,975
"I am a frog.
My name is Anton..."

1844
01:26:21,977 --> 01:26:23,510
Oh, God, I hate this story.

1845
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,711
Can we change it?

1846
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,813
I'm the guest.

1847
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:29,483
No, you're not.

1848
01:26:40,496 --> 01:26:42,963
"...lived a family
of three bears.

1849
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:46,900
"The first was a great big bear.

1850
01:26:46,902 --> 01:26:50,837
"The second was a middling-sized
bear.

1851
01:26:50,839 --> 01:26:56,643
"And the third was a little
teeny-tiny bear.

1852
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:59,646
"And they all lived together,
in a fine little house.

1853
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:01,081
And very happy they were."

2
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,645
THREE COLORS
RED

3
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,297
Come here.

4
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:39,262
3200486.

5
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:43,726
Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.

6
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:46,562
Valentine?

7
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:48,272
Valentine?

8
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:51,818
Are you home?
Are you there?

9
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,321
I'll call back later.

10
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:58,493
Michel...
I was having breakfast.

11
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:02,080
First it was busy, now the machine.
Are you alone?

12
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:03,039
Alone.

13
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:04,248
All alone?

14
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:09,004
ALL alone. They just called me
for a photo session.

15
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,964
They want to see me.

16
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,008
When did you get back?

17
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:16,346
Yesterday. I called,
but you weren't home.

18
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,641
Our car was stolen in Poland.
They got everything:

19
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,602
passports, money, clothes...

20
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,605
So what happened?

21
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,857
We found a nice guy
who put us up.

22
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,944
The Embassy gave us money
and passports. We made it home.

23
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,613
Michel?

24
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,909
I felt lonely last night.

25
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:38,828
What did you do?

26
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:44,377
All night long
I slept with your jacket.

27
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,549
I wanted to be with you.

28
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,885
I can't now, Valentine.

29
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:55,347
I know.
What's the weather like there?

30
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:57,809
Typical English weather:
it's pouring.

31
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,852
It rained here yesterday.

32
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:04,023
Now it's sunny. It's springtime.

33
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:05,818
What did you do last night?

34
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:09,947
I took your advice
and saw The Dead Poet's Society.

35
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:10,989
What a good movie

36
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,282
I liked it a lot.

37
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,909
I'll call you tonight.

38
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,621
I'll be back at 7.
I'll stay in.

39
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,914
I'll talk to you later.

40
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:22,377
I miss you.

41
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,587
Me too.

42
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:38,145
Personal weather reports.

43
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,649
Hello.

44
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,034
Lose?

45
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,085
Take that out.

46
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,424
Take your sweater.

47
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,887
Tie it around your neck.

48
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,640
The sleeve too.

49
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,850
Like this?

50
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,144
Give me a profile.

51
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,564
No, don't smile.

52
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:57,817
Be sad.

53
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:01,654
Sadder.
Think of something awful.

54
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:02,697
There.

55
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:04,617
Sad.

56
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,661
Now it's coming.
That's it.

57
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,873
Turn. And 6 and 7
on the bar.

58
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:14,753
And1and2
And 3 and 4 and stretch,

59
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:18,548
and 6 and 7 and 8 and bend,

60
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:21,135
and 3 and 4 and arch,

61
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:25,973
and 6 and 7 and stretch,
and stretch and stretch.

62
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:29,978
Stretch out your chin,
your arm, your fingertips.

63
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:33,482
Stretch out your hand, your neck.

64
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:38,071
Relax your toes.
Stretch.

65
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,501
I almost fell.

66
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:49,550
Excuse me...
the door was open.

67
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,638
I'm sorry. I ran over

68
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:53,847
your dog.

69
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:58,978
Rita. A German shepherd.

70
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:01,272
That's possible.

71
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:03,775
She disappeared yesterday.

72
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,235
She's in my car. Alive.

73
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,739
I don't know what to do.

74
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:16,998
Should I take her to a veterinarian?

75
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,959
As you wish.

76
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,340
If I ran over your daughter,

77
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:28,094
would you be so indifferent?

78
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,138
I have no daughter, Miss.

79
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:36,478
Go away.

80
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:43,945
Don't close the door.

81
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,009
She's fine.
We stitched her up.

82
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,052
Otherwise, she has a few bruises.

83
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,764
She'll need some rest.

84
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:48,684
She's pregnant.

85
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,604
Will you take her
or leave her here?

86
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:54,773
I'll take her.

87
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,026
We'll help you carry her.

88
00:15:57,986 --> 00:15:58,903
Marc...

89
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,751
Are you alone?

90
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:14,254
No.

91
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,258
Tell him something.

92
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,182
Did you hear?
I have a dog.

93
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:28,603
A dog. I ran her over.

94
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:33,108
Michel, I'm sorry.

95
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,776
That wasn't funny.

96
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,194
No, it wasn't.

97
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:39,699
I knew it was a joke.
I could see you laughing.

98
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,118
Do you remember how we met?

99
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,411
I remember...

100
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:49,001
We're lucky
I stepped out during the break.

101
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,252
That's true.

102
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,172
Valentine, return the dog.

103
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,052
I tried.
The owner doesn't want it.

104
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:58,845
Who is he?

105
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,890
I hear an alarm.

106
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:06,645
it's my car.

107
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,649
Wait for me
to turn it off.

108
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:11,984
I'm in a rush.

109
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:13,069
I understand.

110
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:40,767
Move.

111
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:42,393
Move.

112
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,621
They prefer these.

113
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,544
They'll use the slogan:
"A Breath of Life".

114
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,547
Which do you prefer?

115
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:17,599
I like this one.

116
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,101
Me too.

117
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:26,734
25 by 65 feet.

118
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,489
Will people recognize you?

119
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:34,785
Who?

120
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,047
Who are you thinking of?

121
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,063
Not you.

122
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:54,916
That's a bad sign.

123
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,253
I think I know why I won.
Goodbye.

124
00:19:58,462 --> 00:19:59,212
So long.

125
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:43,720
You're back already.
The mailman left money for you.

126
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:48,225
Who sent it?

127
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:49,226
I have no idea.

128
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:53,189
Isn't that your brother?

129
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,819
Or someone who looks like him.

130
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:01,448
What a shame.
Does your family read this paper?

131
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,161
I don't know. Thank you.

132
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,204
Goodbye.

133
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,991
Can I speak to Marie, please?

134
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:46,666
It's Valentine.
Will you see Marc soon?

135
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,417
Tonight, probably.

136
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:52,171
Tell him to call me
at any hour.

137
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:03,518
I'll let you run around.

138
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:06,646
But don't run away.

139
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:08,731
You promise?

140
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,152
Go on.

141
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,985
Excuse me.
My dog ran away.

142
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,634
Call her. She's yours.

143
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,087
- Was it you?
- For the vet.

144
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:23,798
- You found my address?
- That was easy.

145
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,845
You don't know the prices.

146
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,724
it cost 130 francs.

147
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,978
You sent me 600.

148
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,324
Wait. I'll get the change.

149
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:51,789
What about Rita?

150
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:55,000
She's a very intelligent dog.

151
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:56,794
Take her.

152
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,881
- You don't want her?
- I want nothing.

153
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,928
Then stop breathing.

154
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:06,846
Good idea.

155
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,579
You don't breathe anymore?

156
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:26,185
If you don't come,
you'll never see me again.

157
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,813
But today is Sunday.

158
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,609
Yesterday was Saturday
and we were together.

159
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:36,864
I'm sorry, Sir.
We're about to have lunch.

160
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,701
I ask one thing of you:
don't call me "Sir".

161
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:44,330
Talk to me like yesterday.
Call me Pierrot.

162
00:26:44,914 --> 00:26:48,084
Call me "my love".
Say "my love"...

163
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,879
Sir, let me change rooms.

164
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:06,272
Pierre, I'm alone now.

165
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,023
So am I.

166
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:12,069
Far from you. I want you to come.
I can't be alone...

167
00:27:14,113 --> 00:27:16,742
I saw you yesterday.
I miss you too.

168
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:17,909
Understand that.

169
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,829
I don't want to.
I'm thinking of you.

170
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:26,085
You're naked in front of the mirror.
But for someone else, not for me.

171
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:29,464
I want to kiss you.
I lean forward,

172
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,134
I touch your lips...

173
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,469
What are you doing?

174
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:41,561
I'm spying.

175
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:42,604
What?

176
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:51,572
I'm listening
to my neighbors' phone calls.

177
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,284
You cut it off
just as it was getting interesting.

178
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,541
You don't find it entertaining?

179
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,084
It's disgusting.

180
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:04,044
Yes.

181
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,839
What's more, it's illegal.

182
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:11,302
Your 30 francs.

183
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:18,810
One minute, Miss.

184
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:27,028
You're persuaded you are right.

185
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:28,446
Yes.

186
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:30,573
Then why

187
00:28:30,823 --> 00:28:31,992
don't you do anything?

188
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:33,619
What?

189
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:37,790
Can't I touch your scar,

190
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:39,166
like yesterday?

191
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:46,091
Go see this man.

192
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:50,471
Tell him someone listens
to his conversations.

193
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:53,474
While you're at it,
tell him

194
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:54,683
it's me.

195
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,020
I will.

196
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,234
It's that house.

197
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,202
May I see your husband?

198
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,749
He's upstairs on the phone.
Let me shut off the gas.

199
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:21,714
Come in, please.

200
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,579
Have a seat.

201
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,164
He'll be right down.

202
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,958
Caroline, don't play

203
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,169
with the phone.
Daddy's talking.

204
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,088
Excuse me.

205
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,048
I'm at the wrong address.

206
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,842
This is number 22.

207
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,718
I'm very sorry.

208
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,138
No problem.

209
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,181
Have a nice day.

210
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:47,602
Goodbye.

211
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,520
I'll call you later.

212
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:03,870
You lost this.

213
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:21,222
So? Did you tell him?

214
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:30,357
Would you like
something to drink?

215
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:31,984
No, I wouldn't.

216
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:36,906
I came back...

217
00:31:38,283 --> 00:31:40,660
I came back to ask you something.

218
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:43,580
Don't do this any more.

219
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,752
I've done it all my life.

220
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:06,898
What were you?

221
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:08,441
A cop?

222
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,111
Worse. A judge.

223
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:20,664
A judge?

224
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,791
You've never seen one
for real?

225
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:35,221
Would you like to try?
It makes...

226
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:36,681
a lovely sound.

227
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:46,109
I don't know whether I was
on the good or the bad side.

228
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:52,073
Here, at least, I know
where the truth is.

229
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:56,078
My point of view is better
than in a courtroom.

230
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:57,162
No.

231
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:01,166
Everyone deserves a private life.

232
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,127
Of course.

233
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:09,676
Why did you stop short?
Why didn't you tell him?

234
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,516
Because he has a sweet wife,

235
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:17,351
devoted to him?

236
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,941
And a little daughter who loves him?
So you couldn't.

237
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:26,778
Did you feel remorse...

238
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:29,448
or were you afraid to do harm?

239
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:31,659
Maybe both.

240
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:36,540
Let me tell you.

241
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:41,086
It matters little
whether I spy or you tell them.

242
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,047
Sooner or later,

243
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:46,551
he'll jump out a window,

244
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,555
or she'll find out everything.

245
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:56,478
Someone will tell their daughter
and it will be living hell.

246
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,401
What can we do about it?

247
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,490
Why are you so quiet?

248
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,245
Does this remind you of something?

249
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,122
- Yes.
- What?

250
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,623
Say it.

251
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:19,379
A boy I know.

252
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:21,506
A boy you know who...

253
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,136
found out his mother was a whore?

254
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,142
Who learned...

255
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,895
he's not his father's son.

256
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:37,649
He was fifteen.

257
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:43,573
That man's daughter...

258
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,202
she knows too.

259
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,747
Stay a minute.

260
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:56,962
Why?

261
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,426
The light is beautiful.

262
00:35:09,518 --> 00:35:11,604
Personal weather reports.

263
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:14,190
I'm driving to Turin tomorrow.

264
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:17,401
I checked. The weather
will be fine to Chamonix.

265
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:20,947
From Chamonix to the tunnel,
it may snow.

266
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,992
And after the tunnel...
one minute...

267
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,954
I know the weather all over Europe.

268
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:29,290
Up to Turin,
the weather will be fine.

269
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:31,709
Leave early to avoid the snow.

270
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:33,753
This service is a great idea.

271
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:35,464
Thank you. Goodbye.

272
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,732
Personal weather reports.

273
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,944
it's me.

274
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,446
Did you get any sleep?

275
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,656
A little.

276
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:03,328
I didn't tell you.
By telephone it may be easier.

277
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,372
it was really great.

278
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,418
We'd never made love so well,
so long.

279
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:14,423
We learned something.
Me from you. You from me.

280
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,804
When I woke up, you were
still sleeping. Like a child.

281
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:20,180
I'm older than you.

282
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,391
- One year!
- No, two.

283
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,939
Okay. Two. When I saw you, I got
scared. What is this leading to?

284
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,608
You sound a little down.

285
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:32,902
Are you nervous
about your exams?

286
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:36,698
About what I'm going to do.
Will it be enough for you?

287
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:37,825
Why not go bowling?

288
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,661
I opened all my books.

289
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,831
Maybe.
Do you have a coin?

290
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,873
Yes.

291
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:48,086
Flip It. Tails is bowling.
Heads is Penal Code.

292
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,094
Tails. Bowling.

293
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:57,763
I'll work for an hour,
then I'll call you.

294
00:36:57,972 --> 00:36:58,931
Or I will.

295
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,059
I'll wait. If I go out,

296
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:03,478
It's just to buy cigarettes.

297
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:11,654
You didn't listen?

298
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:18,370
What a shame. It was romantic.

299
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:21,206
I heard the beginning.

300
00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:23,291
They're in love.

301
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,045
Yes.

302
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:30,758
He hasn't met the right woman yet.

303
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:33,345
How do you know?

304
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,974
I watch them from my window.

305
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:42,981
You think I'm a bastard?

306
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,065
Yes.

307
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:45,734
Come look.

308
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,868
He bought a telephone in Japan
that uses another wavelength.

309
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:59,291
My radio can't pick it up.
Too bad.

310
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:05,422
I think he's responsible for most
of the heroin trade in Geneva.

311
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:08,134
We have nothing on him.

312
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:10,928
He never takes risks.

313
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:18,353
Do you like him?

314
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:19,354
Very much.

315
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:23,860
I'll call him.

316
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,363
You have his phone number?

317
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:54,894
You deserve to die.

318
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,457
What did I do?

319
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:18,003
Here's his phone number.

320
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:22,341
If you feel like saying
mean things to him, don't hesitate.

321
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,107
At 10 o'clock, I turned off
the lights. I couldn't seep.

322
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:39,693
Next program.
Not very interesting.

323
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:43,490
I kept tossing and turning.
It kept hurting.

324
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:45,992
it still does.

325
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,621
I haven't done the errands.

326
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,998
I'm sorry, mother.

327
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:52,959
I have no milk or bread.

328
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:56,462
I bought you some.
I put it in the freezer.

329
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:58,590
I ate it all.

330
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,884
You didn't eat 7 loaves

331
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:03,303
in #4##days.
I'm sick##of##this#.

332
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:07,809
Go do her errands.

333
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:10,853
Maybe you'd feel better.

334
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:18,779
Maybe she's the one

335
00:40:18,987 --> 00:40:20,280
who'd feel better.

336
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:23,243
Why did you pick up Rita?

337
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,579
Because I'd run over her.

338
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:28,790
She was bleeding.

339
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:31,627
Otherwise,
you'd have felt guilty.

340
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:36,382
You'd have dreamt of a dog
with a crushed skull.

341
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:38,759
Yes.

342
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,429
So who did you do it for?

343
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:50,106
Don't bother
doing that Lady's errands.

344
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,899
She has everything she needs.

345
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,777
She wants to see her daughter.

346
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,781
She already came 5 times,

347
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,617
when her mother
faked a heart attack.

348
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:06,708
After she dies,
I'll have to call the daughter.

349
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,336
She doesn't believe her any more.

350
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:16,135
You're mistaken.

351
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,554
About what?

352
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,764
About everything.

353
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:24,310
Everything.

354
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,277
People aren't bad.

355
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,778
It's not true.

356
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:35,364
Yes.

357
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,283
They may be weak sometimes...

358
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:42,497
The boy who learned
his father wasn't his father...

359
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:44,666
your boyfriend or your brother?

360
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:48,463
My brother.

361
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,047
How old is he?

362
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:53,342
16.

363
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:56,138
How long
has he been shooting up?

364
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,225
How do you know?

365
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:02,394
it wasn't hard to guess.

366
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,946
I can only feel pity for you.

367
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,458
Maybe you don't know.

368
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,376
Your dog is pregnant.

369
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:45,577
It's Valentine.

370
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:46,995
Hello, darling.

371
00:44:47,203 --> 00:44:48,871
Mom, did Marc come?

372
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,166
Two days ago. With his girlfriend.
Do you know her?

373
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:53,460
Yes. Marie.

374
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:56,505
We're all together.
They're watching TV.

375
00:44:57,381 --> 00:44:58,590
I'm sorry
I can't be there.

376
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,926
Too bad.
It's like old times.

377
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:02,804
Your brother's a good boy.

378
00:45:03,013 --> 00:45:04,180
Can I talk to him?

379
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:05,932
Marci
He's coming.

380
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:07,809
Call me, Mom.
I love you.

381
00:45:08,351 --> 00:45:09,019
Hi, Valentine.

382
00:45:09,227 --> 00:45:11,439
Thanks for going there.

383
00:45:11,647 --> 00:45:14,358
We're leaving tomorrow.
I can't stand it.

384
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:17,611
Mom didn't see the paper?

385
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,532
I don't think so.
She'd never believe it...

386
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,660
You're right.
You should go home.

387
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:24,870
Bye.

388
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:32,295
Call me, Michel.

389
00:45:32,795 --> 00:45:34,464
Please, call me.

390
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:38,844
Did you see the picture?

391
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,053
The picture?

392
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:42,431
Is that you, Jacques?

393
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,018
Isn't it amazing?
You didn't see it?

394
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:48,229
I forgot.
I've had a hard day.

395
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:50,523
Come meet us.
it'll relax you.

396
00:45:50,732 --> 00:45:51,399
Where?

397
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,115
Not bad!

398
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,848
I'm sorry to bother you...

399
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:29,517
Someone played a stupid prank.
I can't get in.

400
00:49:32,938 --> 00:49:33,689
Those kids...

401
00:49:33,898 --> 00:49:35,983
Turks. Always trouble.

402
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,112
I don't know.
They stuck chewing gum in my lock.

403
00:49:40,654 --> 00:49:41,948
Tweezers.

404
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:53,586
It's me.

405
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:54,837
Michel...

406
00:49:55,046 --> 00:49:57,006
I just called.
There was no answer.

407
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,136
Someone stuck chewing gum
in my lock.

408
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:02,721
I heard the phone.

409
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,764
Chewing gum?

410
00:50:06,058 --> 00:50:09,187
I did an ad for chewing gum.
That must be why.

411
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:12,690
I told you not to.
They take advantage of you.

412
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:16,195
Forget It.

413
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:18,530
There was no answering machine.

414
00:50:22,868 --> 00:50:24,371
All I want is peace.

415
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:27,540
A life of peace and quiet.

416
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:30,210
Life won't be peaceful with me.

417
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,632
Did you meet someone?

418
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:37,510
No. I'm waiting for you.

419
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,596
Why didn't you answer before?

420
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:43,558
I told you.
I couldn't get inside.

421
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:44,893
I understand.

422
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:49,190
How are you?

423
00:50:49,398 --> 00:50:51,484
I'm going to Hungary next week.

424
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,237
What are you doing?

425
00:50:54,654 --> 00:50:55,488
I'm going to bed.

426
00:50:55,696 --> 00:50:56,614
Go ahead

427
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:58,826
Go on..

428
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:02,913
Are you there?

429
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,999
Michel, are you there?

430
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:13,007
It's starting again...

431
00:51:37,118 --> 00:51:38,160
Are you asleep?

432
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:39,954
No, I'm not.

433
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:41,498
Get into bed.

434
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,751
Are you in bed?

435
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:47,295
I'm taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.

436
00:51:47,546 --> 00:51:49,048
No one is helping you?

437
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:55,263
Valentine, are you there?

438
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,266
No. Goodnight.

439
00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:14,076
I knew you'd make it.

440
00:52:15,578 --> 00:52:17,121
Did they ask the question?

441
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:20,624
From the book
you dropped in the street.

442
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:54,370
You don't Like it?

443
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,498
Yes. Very much.

444
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,170
What will be
the first judgment I sign?

445
00:53:29,326 --> 00:53:30,828
Civil hearing.

446
00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:34,207
The inhabitants of Pinchat

447
00:53:34,415 --> 00:53:37,084
against Joseph Kern.
Please enter.

448
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:44,743
I'd like number 432.
Van den Budenmayer.

449
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:47,121
- Did I pronounce it right?
- Yes.

450
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,166
This one?

451
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:54,671
just sold the last one.

452
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,302
I'll have others this afternoon.
I can set one aside.

453
00:55:11,314 --> 00:55:12,900
Whose paper is this?

454
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,318
Yours.

455
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:49,315
I came...

456
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,735
I saw the newspaper...

457
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:55,030
I want you to know
I didn't tell a soul.

458
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:56,615
I know.

459
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,411
No one. Not the police. No one.

460
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:01,871
I know.

461
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,710
I know who it was.

462
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:09,421
Who?

463
00:56:10,672 --> 00:56:12,008
It was me.

464
00:56:13,843 --> 00:56:15,720
You asked me to.

465
00:56:16,721 --> 00:56:18,180
Won't you come in?

466
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,685
Let me show you something.

467
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:45,128
One, two, three, four, five, six.

468
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:46,838
Seven?

469
00:56:47,964 --> 00:56:49,007
Seven.

470
00:56:50,759 --> 00:56:53,429
Won't you have some pear brandy?

471
00:57:01,312 --> 00:57:04,483
I've had it for ages,
but I've never had an occasion.

472
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:22,085
To my health.

473
00:57:28,426 --> 00:57:30,220
Why did you do it?

474
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:32,847
Why did I turn myself in?

475
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:34,182
Yes.

476
00:57:36,644 --> 00:57:39,939
To see what you'd do
once you saw it in your paper.

477
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,441
You thought

478
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:43,567
I would come?

479
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:46,613
After our last conversation,
I thought so.

480
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:49,532
Why?

481
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,794
Do you expect something
from me?

482
00:58:00,002 --> 00:58:01,045
Yes.

483
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:06,385
Before you left,
you mentioned

484
00:58:06,593 --> 00:58:07,636
pity.

485
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:11,349
Afterwards, I realized
it was disgust.

486
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:26,031
Will you sit down for a moment?

487
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,001
Will you smile for me?

488
00:58:43,593 --> 00:58:45,637
The day you left,

489
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:47,013
you cried.

490
00:58:47,472 --> 00:58:48,515
I cried.

491
00:58:52,186 --> 00:58:54,146
And I shut off my radio.

492
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,192
I sat down at my desk.

493
00:58:59,193 --> 00:59:03,240
The fountain pen I'd used
all my life was out of ink,

494
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:05,033
so I took a pencil

495
00:59:05,659 --> 00:59:08,704
and wrote letters to my neighbors
and to the police.

496
00:59:10,206 --> 00:59:11,874
I mailed them that evening.

497
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,544
While you were sleeping soundly.

498
00:59:15,128 --> 00:59:16,796
I wasn't sleeping.

499
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:19,258
I had gone bowling.

500
00:59:22,344 --> 00:59:25,180
Do you remember
that couple's conversation?

501
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:27,016
The boy and the girl?

502
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:30,437
I remember.

503
00:59:31,146 --> 00:59:32,564
They wanted to go too.

504
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:34,274
That same evening.

505
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:37,611
Maybe you were
right next to them.

506
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:41,657
Maybe.

507
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:46,413
You didn't like her.

508
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,209
It's almost over.
I was right.

509
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:57,508
You seem happy about it.

510
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:06,143
Did you provoke it?

511
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,987
Yes or no?

512
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,119
Because of my eavesdropping
and my trial,

513
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:23,829
the girl met

514
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,457
another man.

515
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:58,576
Good day.

516
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:04,166
Since then, she's been alone.

517
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,377
I asked my brother
to go see her.

518
01:01:08,004 --> 01:01:10,006
He stayed three days.

519
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,139
in one week
I'm going to England.

520
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:19,433
I'm abandoning my mother
and my brother.

521
01:01:19,683 --> 01:01:21,936
Every day he gets a little worse.

522
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:24,355
I shouldn't leave.

523
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:27,317
Leave. It's your destiny.

524
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,694
You can't live your brother's life

525
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:31,071
for him.

526
01:01:37,286 --> 01:01:38,537
I love him.

527
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:42,834
If only I could help.

528
01:01:43,543 --> 01:01:44,670
You can.

529
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,213
Be.

530
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:48,882
What do you mean?

531
01:01:49,842 --> 01:01:52,345
That's all: be.

532
01:01:57,016 --> 01:01:59,311
Do you like flying?

533
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,146
Then take the ferry.

534
01:02:02,815 --> 01:02:04,608
I've never taken one.

535
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:07,404
It's less expensive and healthier.

536
01:02:07,654 --> 01:02:09,072
That's a good idea.

537
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:20,042
Do you like it?

538
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:23,420
Today is my birthday.

539
01:02:23,755 --> 01:02:25,132
I didn't know.

540
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:32,640
35 years ago today,
at about the same time, 5 o'clock,

541
01:02:33,641 --> 01:02:35,810
I acquitted a man. A sailor.

542
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:41,858
One of my first big cases.
it was a tough time in my life.

543
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:47,614
I have since realized
I made a mistake.

544
01:02:49,158 --> 01:02:50,910
He was guilty.

545
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:57,835
I'm all out of bulbs.

546
01:03:26,992 --> 01:03:28,535
What happened to him?

547
01:03:29,661 --> 01:03:31,581
I did my own investigation.

548
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:35,501
He's married with three children.

549
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:38,045
A grandson.

550
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,716
He is living in peace.

551
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:45,679
So you did what was necessary.

552
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,144
And you did it well.

553
01:03:57,318 --> 01:03:59,028
Don't you understand?

554
01:04:01,155 --> 01:04:02,531
You saved him.

555
01:04:03,991 --> 01:04:05,452
Perhaps.

556
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:10,081
But how many others
could I have acquitted? Even guilty?

557
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:16,589
Deciding what is true and what isn't
now seems to me

558
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:19,842
a lack of modesty.

559
01:04:22,011 --> 01:04:23,055
Vanity?

560
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,099
Vanity.

561
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:37,862
Can I have a drop?

562
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,626
To you!

563
01:04:54,172 --> 01:04:56,049
If I had to go to court...

564
01:04:57,551 --> 01:05:00,304
are there still judges like you?

565
01:05:01,514 --> 01:05:03,307
You won't go to court.

566
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,937
Justice doesn't deal
with the innocent.

567
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,358
See that?

568
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:14,153
It's the sixth window
they've broken.

569
01:05:14,362 --> 01:05:18,532
The wavelength has been changed.
I can no longer eavesdrop.

570
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:22,412
Where is the broom?

571
01:05:22,621 --> 01:05:24,581
In the kitchen closet.

572
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:48,650
Put the stone
on the piano.

573
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,922
You're not afraid?

574
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:14,428
I wonder what I'd do
in their place.

575
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,765
The same thing.

576
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,145
You'd throw stones?

577
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,356
in their place? Of course.

578
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,860
And that goes
for everyone judged.

579
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:31,030
Given their lives,
I would steal,

580
01:06:31,281 --> 01:06:34,117
I'd kill, I'd lie.
Of course I would.

581
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,623
ALL that because I wasn't

582
01:06:39,832 --> 01:06:41,458
in their shoes, but mine.

583
01:06:47,173 --> 01:06:49,050
is there someone you love?

584
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,560
Have you ever loved?

585
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:06,611
Yesterday I dreamt...

586
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,199
I dreamt of you.

587
01:07:14,912 --> 01:07:17,331
You were 40 or 50 years old,

588
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:21,086
and you were happy.

589
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,424
Do your dreams come true?

590
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,556
It's been years
since I dreamt something nice.

591
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,612
Stay there!

592
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:12,635
I bought a ticket
for the ferry.

593
01:11:12,886 --> 01:11:16,306
I arrive in England
next Wednesday.

594
01:11:20,186 --> 01:11:21,979
At 7:30 a. m.

595
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:23,606
Why the ferry?

596
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:27,652
So I can visit my mother
near Calais.

597
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:31,573
I'll meet you at 8:00.

598
01:11:32,657 --> 01:11:34,201
I'm happy you're coming.

599
01:11:35,953 --> 01:11:37,288
Michel, tell me...

600
01:11:38,706 --> 01:11:39,624
do you love me?

601
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:41,042
I think so.

602
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:44,379
You love me
or you think so?

603
01:11:44,588 --> 01:11:46,048
It's the same thing.

604
01:13:13,103 --> 01:13:14,521
The battery.

605
01:14:17,174 --> 01:14:18,676
Auguste!

606
01:14:53,673 --> 01:14:55,800
Personal weather reports.

607
01:14:56,009 --> 01:14:58,554
I've tried calling
for a few days.

608
01:14:58,763 --> 01:15:00,347
I was sick. I'm sorry.

609
01:15:00,556 --> 01:15:03,934
What will the weather be
on the English Channel next week?

610
01:15:04,143 --> 01:15:07,647
Wonderful. Sunny, a slight breeze,
chilly in the morning.

611
01:15:07,856 --> 01:15:09,232
Why are you laughing?

612
01:15:09,441 --> 01:15:12,402
I intend to go there.
Even farther.

613
01:15:12,611 --> 01:15:13,779
For your work?

614
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:16,574
No, for pleasure. On a yacht.

615
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:18,117
It's a nice sail.

616
01:15:18,326 --> 01:15:19,577
Yes, very.

617
01:15:19,785 --> 01:15:20,953
You'll be closing?

618
01:15:21,162 --> 01:15:22,580
I'll have to.

619
01:15:22,788 --> 01:15:25,250
That's too bad.
It was a good idea. Goodbye.

620
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:05,879
We told you
not to smile!

621
01:16:07,005 --> 01:16:08,256
Be serious!

622
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:13,011
Can you send an invitation
to this address?

623
01:16:13,261 --> 01:16:14,514
Just one person?

624
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:06,997
Are you okay?

625
01:19:08,457 --> 01:19:09,583
- So long.
- Have a good time.

626
01:19:18,134 --> 01:19:19,552
There's no make-up remover?

627
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:20,721
Here.

628
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,611
Everyone noticed

629
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:35,862
that guy.

630
01:19:36,613 --> 01:19:40,159
During the entire show
I kept staring at him.

631
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:06,814
You came.

632
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:10,150
You knew the invitation
came from me?

633
01:20:10,359 --> 01:20:11,611
I'd hoped so.

634
01:20:12,612 --> 01:20:14,197
Did you look for me?

635
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:16,783
During the entire show.

636
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:22,581
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say goodbye.

637
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,000
Goodbye.

638
01:20:27,921 --> 01:20:30,590
I'd like you
to tell me in detail

639
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:32,592
the dream you had.

640
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:37,139
You were 50 years old

641
01:20:37,974 --> 01:20:39,517
and you were happy.

642
01:20:41,018 --> 01:20:42,311
in this dream...

643
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:46,233
was there someone else?

644
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:48,485
There was.

645
01:20:50,404 --> 01:20:51,405
Who?

646
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:57,537
You woke up

647
01:20:58,329 --> 01:21:00,748
and you smiled at someone
next to you.

648
01:21:01,749 --> 01:21:03,210
I don't know who.

649
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,714
That's what will happen?

650
01:21:08,424 --> 01:21:09,967
in 20 or 25 years?

651
01:21:10,552 --> 01:21:11,469
Yes.

652
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:19,145
What else do you know?

653
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:22,022
Who are you?

654
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:25,401
A retired judge.

655
01:21:27,612 --> 01:21:30,615
I feel something important
is happening around me.

656
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:33,743
And it scares me.

657
01:21:45,299 --> 01:21:46,466
is that better?

658
01:21:50,345 --> 01:21:51,722
I used to come here often.

659
01:21:53,683 --> 01:21:55,351
Where did you usually sit?

660
01:21:56,728 --> 01:21:58,146
Where I sat today.

661
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:01,901
That's why you couldn't see me.

662
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:09,993
One day,
during the intermission,

663
01:22:10,785 --> 01:22:13,288
the elastic holding my books broke.

664
01:22:14,956 --> 01:22:15,540
One of them,

665
01:22:15,749 --> 01:22:18,794
a big one,
fell down...

666
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:21,297
somewhere around here.

667
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:27,054
it was just before my exams.
I ran down immediately.

668
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:30,974
The book had opened to a certain
page. I read a few sentences.

669
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:34,478
it was the question they asked
during my exam.

670
01:22:35,646 --> 01:22:38,107
Getting out of the house
did you good.

671
01:22:40,026 --> 01:22:41,652
I had to recharge the battery.

672
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,739
it was dead.

673
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:47,618
The storm.

674
01:23:17,568 --> 01:23:19,195
Lousy coffee.

675
01:23:21,572 --> 01:23:22,949
I was wondering

676
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:25,743
why you mentioned that sailor.

677
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,330
Do you know why?

678
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:32,793
Yes.

679
01:23:41,094 --> 01:23:42,595
Because

680
01:23:44,807 --> 01:23:47,893
you didn't want to tell me
something more important.

681
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:55,026
About the woman
that you loved.

682
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:00,741
She betrayed you.

683
01:24:04,787 --> 01:24:06,580
She betrayed you,

684
01:24:07,915 --> 01:24:10,210
and you never understood why.

685
01:24:14,214 --> 01:24:16,007
And you kept on loving her.

686
01:24:18,761 --> 01:24:20,596
How do you know all this?

687
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,397
it wasn't hard to guess.

688
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,526
What was she Like?

689
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:37,156
She graduated
two years before me.

690
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:43,622
She was blond,

691
01:24:44,331 --> 01:24:45,916
delicate,

692
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:50,296
radiant, with a long neck.

693
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,845
Her clothing and her furniture
were all light-colored.

694
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:01,934
In the foyer there was a mirror
in a white frame.

695
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:06,063
it was in that mirror,

696
01:25:06,522 --> 01:25:08,108
one night,

697
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,069
that I saw her white Legs spread,

698
01:25:13,864 --> 01:25:15,908
with a man between them.

699
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:21,622
Why?

700
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,376
did that happen?

701
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:26,503
Do you know?

702
01:25:27,129 --> 01:25:31,258
This man,
whose name was Hugo Holbling,

703
01:25:35,346 --> 01:25:37,390
could offer her what she wanted.

704
01:25:39,893 --> 01:25:41,437
They left.

705
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,649
I followed them.

706
01:25:47,318 --> 01:25:49,863
I crossed France, the Channel...

707
01:25:52,157 --> 01:25:53,533
I was...

708
01:25:54,326 --> 01:25:55,744
humiliated.

709
01:25:58,331 --> 01:26:01,125
Until the day she died
in an accident.

710
01:26:04,045 --> 01:26:06,923
Since then,
I've never loved another woman.

711
01:26:08,592 --> 01:26:09,259
Yes.

712
01:26:09,926 --> 01:26:11,720
I stopped believing.

713
01:26:13,972 --> 01:26:16,267
Maybe I never met the woman...

714
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:23,399
Maybe you're the woman
I never met.

715
01:26:25,486 --> 01:26:27,321
The story doesn't end there.

716
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,031
No.

717
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:32,619
A while ago,

718
01:26:32,827 --> 01:26:35,080
I was given a difficult case.

719
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,958
On it was written the name
of the defendant:

720
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:40,711
Hugo Holbling.

721
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,338
The same man.

722
01:26:43,297 --> 01:26:44,799
He'd come back here.

723
01:26:51,097 --> 01:26:52,474
I'm closing up.

724
01:26:54,935 --> 01:26:56,728
Did you see a woman
with a bucket?

725
01:27:01,192 --> 01:27:03,110
The storm flooded the wardrobe.

726
01:27:03,528 --> 01:27:04,278
If you see her,

727
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,281
tell her I'm upstairs.

728
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:14,832
You shouldn't have taken the case.

729
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,668
I didn't want to.

730
01:27:22,006 --> 01:27:23,342
At first,
I wanted to kill him.

731
01:27:25,678 --> 01:27:28,764
I would have,
if it would have changed something.

732
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:32,644
Now,

733
01:27:33,687 --> 01:27:35,563
he was waiting for my verdict.

734
01:27:38,274 --> 01:27:41,445
He was building
a covered market which caved in.

735
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:43,614
Several people died.

736
01:27:46,242 --> 01:27:48,077
I said he was guilty.

737
01:27:49,621 --> 01:27:51,581
It was a legal sentence.

738
01:27:56,044 --> 01:27:59,006
Afterwards,
I asked for early retirement.

739
01:28:03,052 --> 01:28:04,470
Did you see her?

740
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:09,434
I'm always running after her!

741
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:13,647
Milana!

742
01:28:22,867 --> 01:28:26,495
There you are! Give me the buckets.
They're heavy.

743
01:28:34,838 --> 01:28:36,798
You seemed to Like
my pear brandy.

744
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,677
I have another favor to ask you.

745
01:28:40,636 --> 01:28:42,596
I'll be gone two or three weeks.

746
01:28:43,347 --> 01:28:45,016
I'll come see you afterwards.

747
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:49,396
Please give me
one of the puppies.

748
01:28:52,357 --> 01:28:54,526
Will the fashion show be on TV?

749
01:28:55,444 --> 01:28:56,738
Probably.

750
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,490
I better buy a TV.

751
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:01,826
I have one I never use.

752
01:29:02,326 --> 01:29:03,745
My brother
can bring it to you.

753
01:29:03,953 --> 01:29:04,997
His name is Marc.

754
01:29:05,205 --> 01:29:08,250
I'd Like to meet him.
I'll see you soon.

755
01:29:09,418 --> 01:29:10,753
Goodbye.

756
01:29:15,175 --> 01:29:17,135
Do you have your ticket?

757
01:30:44,857 --> 01:30:46,401
Where do I go?

758
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:48,487
This deck. That corridor.

759
01:30:56,037 --> 01:30:58,081
Excuse me, I'm lost. F38?

760
01:30:58,331 --> 01:30:59,082
The deck above.

761
01:33:52,734 --> 01:33:56,112
TRAGEDY ON THE CHANNEL
Seven passengers escape.

762
01:34:00,075 --> 01:34:02,995
Very bad weather
on the English Channel

763
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:06,248
is making the rescuers' task
all the more difficult.

764
01:34:06,457 --> 01:34:08,876
Several fishermen
are reported missing

765
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:12,297
as are two people
aboard a yacht.

766
01:34:12,631 --> 01:34:15,133
The cause of the accident
is unknown.

767
01:34:15,342 --> 01:34:16,718
According to sources,

768
01:34:16,927 --> 01:34:19,972
the ferry was carrying
1435 passengers.

769
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:22,767
Rescue operations
are still under way.

770
01:34:22,975 --> 01:34:25,478
Hundreds of bodies
have been recovered.

771
01:34:25,686 --> 01:34:28,649
Many passengers are still missing.

772
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:35,573
A police boat,
responding to the SOS,

773
01:34:36,074 --> 01:34:39,410
retrieved 7 passengers.
ALL are reported unharmed.

774
01:34:52,467 --> 01:34:56,846
The widow of a French composer
who died last year, Julie Vignon.

775
01:34:58,682 --> 01:35:01,936
Steven Killian, English citizen,
barman on the ferry.

776
01:35:02,478 --> 01:35:03,187

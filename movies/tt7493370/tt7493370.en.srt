3
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:59,208
For 7 years, the Greeks living under the burden of overwhelming debt.

4
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,625
The election of a new government

5
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,041
represents the hope out of the prison of debt.

6
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,583
If we win the elections,

7
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,208
after years of deprivation and oppression,

8
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,125
everything will change.

9
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,000
They played drums and we danced.

10
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,708
If we win, we play and they dance.

11
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,041
If we win,

12
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:05,166
we will not pay the debt and ask for compensation.

13
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:10,625
European banks have played huge sums of money and lost.

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,750
Their debt has reached one billion.

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,458
French and German Governments

16
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,666
transferred 600 billion losses

17
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,125
the European peoples.

18
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:28,208
To rescue the French banks, German and Greek,

19
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:32,041
they transferred 320 billion

20
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,916
their losses

21
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,750
the Greek people.

22
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,250
Payable by the Greeks:

23
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,125
320 billion.

24
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,750
It will destroy the oligarchy,

25
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,250
who mounted a power system

26
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,416
that plunders the economic strength of our company.

27
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,500
If they win,

28
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,416
where the fate of the Euro.

29
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,791
A speech !

30
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,916
The speech, according to official results!

31
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:48,791
Europe will see who we are!

32
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,166
A declaration !

33
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,375
Later !

34
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,625
The statement...

35
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,166
The statement

36
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,666
after the official result!

37
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,500
Later !

38
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,291
And now ?

39
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,708
What do we do ?

40
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,000
A government

41
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,416
with allies to change the country.

42
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,125
What allies?

43
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,791
After the blessing, the prime minister is sworn.

44
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,833
Contrary to the tradition of swearing on the Gospel,

45
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,041
he simply stated that he would respect the constitution.

46
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,583
Communists!

47
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,083
That's where we were wrong?

48
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,250
No. You won the election.

49
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,333
You are Minister of Finance

50
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,333
and you got a majority with the nationalists.

51
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,041
When you were in Washington,

52
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,708
we called you "the Prince of Darkness," with my students.

53
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,333
Prince !

54
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I've had worse names.

55
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,458
I need your advice.

56
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,416
You are leftist radicals.

57
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:35,791
They will do everything to destroy you and hope that you embody.

58
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:40,041
The Germans and their allies will suffocate you.

59
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
A tragedy for your people.

60
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,041
It already is.

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,250
Your plan?

62
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,583
Compromise,

63
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,041
without compromising himself.

64
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,000
You promised to erase the debt.

65
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,500
There are promises and reality.

66
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,083
That is to say ?

67
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,000
Negotiate, restructure debt, erase part,

68
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,541
and finish with austerity for the reparte economy.

69
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,708
They will not let do.

70
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,583
Prime Minister supports me.

71
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,041
Your extremists?

72
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,291
They follow the Prime Minister.

73
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,791
You're an outsider

74
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,250
politics and power,

75
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,041
a true underdog freedom.

76
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,208
I become an insider,

77
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,333
but I keep my freedom.

78
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,083
My resignation is ready.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,916
You win and you sign your defeat?

80
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,333
The letter will help me to get the country out of the prison of debt.

81
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,791
You remain an outsider.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,041
Insiders will not forgive you.

83
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,958
I resigned.

84
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,166
It's 4 hours I discussed with the Prime Minister.

85
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,458
It's been 6 months since you speak without understanding.

86
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,250
He does not understand that ...

87
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,166
Berlin wants to punish us

88
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,041
and force him to submit.

89
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,291
He can do anything.

90
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,083
Berlin, or Europe?

91
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,208
All.

92
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:52,208
He thinks that Angela is her friend, she will support,

93
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,083
but it will sell nothing.

94
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,125
She will stop at nothing.

95
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,541
You have done everything to help him.

96
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,375
He did nothing when his attacking you.

97
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,916
You were right.

98
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,458
You should have quit.

99
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,250
M'a supported ...

100
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,583
for a long time.

101
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,208
We agreed. He accepted my proposals.

102
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,833
For the Germans,

103
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,041
the French, the Italians ...

104
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,708
They do not know we want to renegotiate.

105
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,500
In an open, constructive.

106
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,333
But firmly.

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,291
The Germans want to transfer us to the Euro.

108
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,791
In their dreams.

109
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,666
There is, it stays there.

110
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,291
Not even a Party member!

111
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,750
And do not adhere, you will be crushed by the quarrels.

112
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,250
Those who do not agree with my choices

113
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,041
keep quiet or go away!

114
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,750
They should understand our goals.

115
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,166
The party program is not the government's.

116
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,333
- There he is, the "sado-monetarism"? - Not yet.

117
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,875
Why the head of the Troika comes 2 days after the election?

118
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,333
3 days, and it is not the leader.

119
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,583
To announce the Grexit?

120
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,291
Or the stroke of Cyprus?

121
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,166
If that's so,

122
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,375
there will be blood at the counters.

123
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,875
For 5 years, they do not care!

124
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,750
They are there.

125
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,416
They? They are more?

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,750
It is not Cyprus.

127
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,916
We will not always refuse their demands.

128
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,250
We can.

129
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,708
And their bullshit too.

130
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,750
My colleagues.

131
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,625
The President of the Eurogroup.

132
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,583
- Greek Representative of the IMF. - Nice to meet you.

133
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,166
Nice to meet you.

134
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,541
We will be back.

135
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,625
I wish

136
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,125
we have good working relationships.

137
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,583
But I have to tell you

138
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,666
the methods of the Troika are counterproductive.

139
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,208
The Troika is not appreciated here.

140
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,041
Not really.

141
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,166
Tell me,

142
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,083
your intentions vis-Ã -vis the MoU?

143
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,583
The Memorandum of Understanding , to repay debt.

144
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,625
Sit.

145
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,708
We must find a compromise

146
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,666
between our program, approved by the people,

147
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:06,666
and your MoU, which destroyed our economy.

148
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,125
It will not work.

149
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,291
Finding a compromise is not an option?

150
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,583
You have 15 days to accept the MoU before the Eurogroup,

151
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,583
or program collapses.

152
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,416
An ultimatum ! 3 days after our election.

153
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,125
The country is ruined and will take us to the Euro!

154
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,000
- I did not say that. - You are implying!

155
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,166
You do not accept the compromise!

156
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,416
Your MoU is indecent and impossible to keep!

157
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,125
I announce to the media that you reject the MoU,

158
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,708
you leave the Euro, the economy collapses, chaos ...

159
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,416
Let them know!

160
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,291
Wait! Tell them what?

161
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,708
What you want.

162
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,875
I will welcome you.

163
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,083
Hello.

164
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,625
Thank you for being there for this first meeting

165
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,166
with the president of the Eurogroup,

166
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,541
to which I welcome.

167
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,750
I gave him the floor.

168
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,791
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,500
I had constructive meetings with the government.

170
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,750
Thank you for your welcome.

171
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,541
Even speech for 5 years.

172
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,708
A first step towards future collaboration.

173
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,583
Excuse me.

174
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,541
Will you cooperate slavishly with the Troika,

175
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,083
as your predecessors?

176
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,833
Cooperate with the European Commission ...

177
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,750
with the European Central Bank and the IMF, yes!

178
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,083
More...

179
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,500
not with bureaucrats and humiliating methods

180
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,416
they inflict upon us for 5 years.

181
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,125
It is they, the Troika.

182
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,916
Even the European Parliament considers their inappropriate decisions.

183
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,416
We will not cooperate with them.

184
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,208
You just killed the Troika.

185
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,166
They are our strength.

186
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,000
They can turn against us tomorrow.

187
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,791
If we disappoint them if we betray them.

188
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,500
One day we will disappoint.

189
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,541
Not necessarily.

190
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,333
They always ask for more,

191
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,750
we will eventually disappoint them.

192
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,708
Hello.

193
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,208
Looked.

194
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,750
Everything is closed.

195
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,208
Do something for them to reopen.

196
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,958
Your ministry.

197
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,458
You paid me

198
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,458
the kick in the balls of the Troika!

199
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,250
Do not promise them anything. This is a time bomb.

200
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,166
My suitcase !

201
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,291
I know your problem. Preparing a decree for rehire.

202
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,625
I will sign my return.

203
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,916
In 4 days.

204
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,208
We will wait here.

205
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:37,291
Rehire 300 housekeepers, negative signal to the Troika.

206
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,750
They will do it.

207
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,000
The taxi's gone!

208
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,958
Minister with my costume!

209
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:45,833
Super !

210
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,208
Find him!

211
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:56,250
That sums up our tragedy. It borrows

212
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,708
to buy German cars.

213
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,583
Prepare a note to replace them with others

214
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,750
adapted to the left that is supposed to be ministers.

215
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:12,291
This is more than show that economy.

216
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,791
The show for our society of the spectacle.

217
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,583
The Troika will enjoy.

218
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,958
It's hot enough?

219
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,583
Yes, that is a bit wide.

220
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,750
The French do not pay attention to style.

221
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,250
The English, by cons ...

222
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,875
The elevator goes directly to the minister's office.

223
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,583
Nice to meet you.

224
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,833
Call me Michael.

225
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,458
Your welcome,

226
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,541
our long-standing friendship, your solidarity,

227
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,458
are indispensable

228
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,833
out of the MoU and negotiate a new contract with Europe.

229
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:40,333
I presented our project to a debt restructuring,

230
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,750
a realistic policy against austerity

231
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,291
reforms against corruption and the privileges of the oligarchy.

232
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,916
I developed all our proposals to end the crisis.

233
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,583
Michael thought it was perfect.

234
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,041
You have invited me and I came.

235
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:42,000
Osborne invited me, I go to London.

236
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,291
It's an invitation or summons?

237
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,083
I insisted, without polemics,

238
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,916
on cultural ties between our countries.

239
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,958
France, girlfriend for two centuries.

240
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:49,583
I had to present to the Minister the proposed reforms.

241
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,291
I continued, in a friendly tone,

242
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,583
Despite the humiliation inflicted Michel us

243
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,125
to please Berlin.

244
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,541
What are you doing ?

245
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,333
You say one thing in private and not the public?

246
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,791
Yanis,

247
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,833
You must understand.

248
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,500
France is no longer what it was.

249
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,041
- Yanis! - Emmanuel!

250
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,125
- How are you ? - Good and you ?

251
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,000
Well.

252
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,291
Michel told you about France?

253
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,708
Apparently, it is not what it was.

254
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,625
They are obsessed with difficulties.

255
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,791
You have to imagine another France,

256
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,750
a France that succeeds.

257
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:03,875
Yes.

258
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,291
Come. Come into my office.

259
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,083
You go to Berlin?

260
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
In London. Osborne invited me,

261
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,625
I'll take the opportunity to meet with businessmen.

262
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,750
Everything happens in Berlin.

263
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,875
Berlin did not invite me.

264
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,791
They expect me to invite me.

265
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,500
You depend on Berlin.

266
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,583
You have to go to Berlin.

267
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,041
The average English as its officers,

268
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:43,416
think Europe impedes progress.

269
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,333
As for France,

270
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,166
she clings to Europe to avoid forfeiture.

271
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,416
What do they think of us?

272
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:52,750
Du mal,

273
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,625
and also contempt.

274
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,916
Minister Osborne esteem for you.

275
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,041
The French had to declare their love you, without promising anything.

276
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,958
We,

277
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,166
we do not like you,

278
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,416
especially your party variable current

279
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,375
and your economic program, which is ...

280
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:25,083
a great danger to international markets.

281
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,166
We will not intervene

282
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,125
in the affairs of the Eurozone.

283
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,208
I did not think that George, a Eurosceptic,

284
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,916
was going to be so open.

285
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,125
He explained to the press that I received

286
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,958
because he thought our crisis threatened the global economy.

287
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,541
What can I do for you ?

288
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:51,958
He promised to help us,

289
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,791
but did nothing,

290
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,041
except prepare for my meeting with the financial

291
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,958
and their wild attacks.

292
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:04,458
Know that they are killers.

293
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,583
Thank you all.

294
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,416
Thank you.

295
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,833
Thank you for coming.

296
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,625
If you just defend your economic project,

297
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,250
far from.

298
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,333
There will be a massive sale of stocks and bonds!

299
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,958
Are you for privatization?

300
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,625
It depends on the conditions and price.

301
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,333
Would you sell the Parthenon?

302
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,333
At a good price ?

303
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,958
The Parthenon belongs to all humanity.

304
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,291
We were elected

305
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,541
to manage bankruptcy

306
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:02,541
nobody wanted to admit.

307
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:06,000
But Europe has a plan to save Greece.

308
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,791
To save the German and French banks.

309
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:18,041
Their colossal debt was transferred to the Greek people.

310
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:24,833
What do you do if your populist campaign promises?

311
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,125
We are aware of realities

312
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,833
and willing to compromise,

313
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,666
provided that...

314
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,250
that debt slavery ended.

315
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:44,208
I propose that our debt is adjusted to national income.

316
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,875
This is the same method

317
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:50,000
that you use in the City or on Wall Street.

318
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,083
Why not use it to save Greece?

319
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,375
Here is our total debt:

320
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,541
473 billion.

321
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,541
In this mountain of debt,

322
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,541
your share is 15%.

323
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,708
My proposal is to restructure

324
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,000
85% of the Troika

325
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,916
and do not touch your 15%.

326
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,458
You have suffered enough cuts.

327
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,833
I prefer not to make you my enemy.

328
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,625
And what will you do

329
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,458
with 85%?

330
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,958
I will propose to the Troika, the European institutions,

331
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:35,041
to be partners in our growth for the next 15 years.

332
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,000
It will be enough to convince them?

333
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,333
Certainly not.

334
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,750
I intend to stop austerity.

335
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:50,291
Even your Minister Osborne believes that the requirements are excessive.

336
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,458
We recommend instead

337
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:58,250
a major overhaul of the state and taxes

338
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,333
to encourage investment

339
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,375
and I hope yours.

340
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:10,625
What a success !

341
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,250
You will see results.

342
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,375
Hello.

343
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,541
The Adam Smith Institute love your statements.

344
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,416
Super !

345
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:32,916
Leftist acclaimed by the preferred institute Thatcher!

346
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,500
Our comrades will be proud!

347
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:39,708
Allo?

348
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,541
What is this ridiculous coat?

349
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,208
My daughter already scolded! Leave me.

350
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:49,875
Thank you.

351
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:54,916
I recorded this.

352
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,500
Greek equities panicked.

353
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,791
They took 11.2%

354
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,416
hoping to end the standoff

355
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,708
between the radicals and their creditors.

356
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,458
The Germans will receive you with respect.

357
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,833
Your debt amounts to 186 billion

358
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,791
for the European Union,

359
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,833
29 billion for the ECB,

360
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,541
and 25 billion for the IMF,

361
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:46,208
not to mention the money we need your banks.

362
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,916
Altogether more than 410 bln.

363
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:54,250
Your GDP fell from 250 to 175 bln.

364
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:58,625
Over 100,000 plus 250,000

365
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,875
plus 480 000,

366
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,833
plus 600 000.

367
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:20,875
The ECB can not ensure confidence in your banks.

368
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,000
Welcome, I am responsible for your safety.

369
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,666
Follow me, I beg you.

370
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,333
- Good morning, Mr. Minister. - Mr. Ambassador.

371
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,125
We do not need bodyguards.

372
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:44,833
Orders from the German government, Mr. Minister.

373
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,083
The announcement of Mario no longer guarantee our banks

374
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,583
has reduced our stock market by 10%.

375
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,000
You lose acquired London.

376
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,291
Good morning, Mr. Minister.

377
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,750
When I visit my money?

378
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:45,708
Here you are. Speaking ...

379
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:47,750
Your excellence...

380
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,291
Call me Wolfgang, I call you Yanis.

381
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,083
Wolfgang...

382
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,583
I am here to work with you

383
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,125
to end this endless drama that undermines our two countries.

384
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,208
My Prime Minister ensures

385
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,750
our commitment to the Euro.

386
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,500
We offer to negotiate

387
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,833
to reach compromises

388
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,541
acceptable for your creditors and our people.

389
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,375
We ask not to reduce debt,

390
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,750
but a reasonable ratio between debt

391
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,166
and our national income.

392
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,625
We work against tax evasion.

393
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,541
London responded ...

394
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:34,500
Flash in the pan.

395
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,541
I do not want to discuss your proposals.

396
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:44,375
For tax evasion, I can send 500 specialists

397
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,375
to put in the order.

398
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,000
You have already sent the Troika.

399
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:51,041
It controls the economy, directs ministers

400
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,291
and because of the crisis a tragedy.

401
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,833
Europe sent them.

402
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:01,291
We will not fund your generous social system.

403
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,750
A communist dream.

404
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,125
Our priority is the survival of our social security.

405
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,458
The savings can be made elsewhere.

406
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,666
Here is our modest proposals.

407
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,791
For institutions.

408
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,958
Your excellence,

409
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:29,000
it is sad to send our proposals

410
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,708
to institutions, technocrats of the Troika,

411
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,791
and not to politicians.

412
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,916
Journalists waiting.

413
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,125
You have 12 days before the Eurogroup

414
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,125
to review your strategy.

415
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:13,208
I talked with my Greek colleague.

416
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:19,250
After this cordial meeting,

417
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,416
we agree on the fact

418
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,458
we do agree on anything.

419
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,833
Even on this, we disagree.

420
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,958
Either his country back into line,

421
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,500
it is out of line.

422
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:41,833
Now I leave you, Mr. Minister.

423
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,666
If you have understood,

424
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,083
This is the impasse?

425
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,791
The Minister has a radical position.

426
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,708
Ours is also,

427
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,000
we must all make efforts

428
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,166
to understand us.

429
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,125
Mr. Minister, do you think

430
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,375
do dance to the drum?

431
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,583
There is electoral speeches and there are social realities.

432
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,458
My country is experiencing a humanitarian crisis

433
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,625
and Europe is in existential crisis.

434
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,666
We must work together

435
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,250
without being dogmatic.

436
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,166
What do you think of Greek fanaticism anti-German?

437
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:24,208
You also negotiate? Or you Eradicate?

438
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,458
And the anti-Greek German fanaticism?

439
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,125
We must stop these silly games

440
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:10,416
which generate hatred

441
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,750
and racism.

442
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,041
Our government wants to dialogue,

443
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,250
to negotiate.

444
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:21,666
But they do not want to discuss or negotiate.

445
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,416
We are a people with a millenary patience.

446
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,291
With stoicism in the blood.

447
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:31,625
This crisis is dangerous for us all.

448
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,750
The Germans know well that can lead

449
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:40,166
dubbed a crisis of national humiliation

450
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,125
and infinite despair.

451
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:46,166
This hatched the egg of the snake.

452
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:54,500
Back in Athens, I will go to Parliament, where the third party

453
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,833
is not neo-Nazi,

454
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,375
but just Nazi.

455
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,916
The crisis feeds.

456
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,625
We need your help, sir.

457
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,791
The assistance of the German people,

458
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:13,708
to combat hate each other

459
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:18,250
and return to normal life in the European Union.

460
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,625
That depends on you, Mr. Minister.

461
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,333
Hold on tight.

462
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,583
The Germans and Wolfgang?

463
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,750
All.

464
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:43,375
Wolfgang organizes our exit from the Euro.

465
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,583
They are waiting for us.

466
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,083
First, the ECB

467
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,041
will suffocate our banks

468
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,083
by depriving them of cash until closing.

469
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,541
What do you propose ?

470
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:58,291
We must prepare for the Eurogroup meeting, where everything will be decided.

471
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:04,000
And plan to replace the Euro if they throw us out.

472
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,916
Where are we ?

473
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,750
At your request, I assembled a team

474
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,125
to study a plan B.

475
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:14,166
- If it comes out, it's a bomb. - It does not come out.

476
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:17,125
Speaks only of Berlin.

477
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,166
Of course.

478
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,666
There you are ! Welcome !

479
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,500
We fuck Brussels.

480
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,083
The Russians give us billions.

481
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,125
They do not have a radish, it is not a solution.

482
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,875
Summarize your European tour.

483
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,916
The stock market went along.

484
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,916
On the way, it is mounted, mounted,

485
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,000
in return, she fell, fell ...

486
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,416
Who cares, the stock exchange.

487
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:43,750
Let's summarize.

488
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,041
All require that applies the MoU.

489
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,458
The what ?

490
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,208
The Memorandum of Understanding signed by the right.

491
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:55,041
I did not know it was called MoU!

492
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:58,000
- We will not accept! - We elected to fight.

493
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,083
Wolfgang swears by the MoU.

494
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,541
Your Wolfgang knows we elected

495
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,791
and that the country no longer accept the dictates of Berlin?

496
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,125
Many are with him.

497
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,458
The French ? The English ?

498
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,875
The French ... are low.

499
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,083
Holland helps a little ...

500
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,375
and nothing to expect from the English.

501
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,125
The European Bank?

502
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:25,791
They cut us cash

503
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,708
other refuse on the MOU.

504
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,083
Your tour was a disaster.

505
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:36,458
The press says Wolfgang snuffed thee and thou hast Nazi treaty.

506
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,208
Lies, sit down.

507
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,250
These are attacks against us.

508
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:43,625
In short...

509
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,375
What do you propose ?

510
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,583
shit we say in Brussels and does not pay.

511
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,125
And after ?

512
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,333
Then they will negotiate.

513
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,083
In 12 days, we have a meeting with the Eurogroup.

514
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,000
Two options.

515
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:03,541
Either you sign the MoU and we Gentiles,

516
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,208
either one remains intractable

517
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,583
and throw us to the Euro.

518
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,333
Conclusion.

519
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:17,583
For a satisfactory agreement with the Eurogroup,

520
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,708
it is imperative that they understand

521
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,416
we are united

522
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,000
and we are not afraid.

523
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,875
We want to negotiate.

524
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,458
We go to the end.

525
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,958
It will fall on the Prime Minister.

526
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,750
Worse if it weakens.

527
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,291
We can be flexible without ...

528
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,625
If we're ready for bed,

529
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,666
it will be a disaster.

530
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,291
Thank you, Fenya.

531
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,750
These meetings must remain secret.

532
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:02,500
We need an evaluation before the Eurogroup meeting,

533
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,583
where we risk being expelled from the Euro.

534
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,708
In 10 days !

535
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:08,875
I know. No time.

536
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:12,333
Study each case

537
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:17,958
to avoid shortages and if necessary create ...

538
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,541
digital and paper currency.

539
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,541
We must act in the greatest secrecy.

540
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,166
If it comes out, it's panic.

541
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:32,000
We wanted to lay off 2,000 teachers,

542
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,666
then 2000 and again 2000.

543
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,125
Then they had the idea to strike.

544
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:41,833
We sent them all at once!

545
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,375
8000 doctors sacked.

546
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,666
How many hospitals have merged?

547
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:47,791
We do not know.

548
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,708
We did not count.

549
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,125
We must re-employ.

550
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,375
Many have gone abroad.

551
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,291
How ?

552
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,958
More than 3 000.

553
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,000
The Prime Minister wants us recommit doctors

554
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,375
and that reopens hospitals.

555
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:08,958
Lister reforms to end the austerity cuts.

556
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,125
aggressive austerity cuts.

557
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:15,333
It sells off and the oligarchy benefits.

558
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
The Troika called it "The Program"

559
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,333
it allows him to sell everything

560
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,666
without state control.

561
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,875
Here the Greek official.

562
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,500
What do you sell ?

563
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:29,583
All.

564
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,250
Everything that belongs to the State:

565
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,625
roads, fields, beaches,

566
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,583
buildings, ports, railways,

567
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,375
airports

568
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:43,041
and many other treasures of the country.

569
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,041
This is a sale, not a liquidation.

570
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,750
This is a liquidation and without any effect.

571
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:50,583
That's why.

572
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,166
This money pays the debt.

573
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:00,375
The Troika forces us to borrow

574
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:03,291
to pay the debt, creating more debt.

575
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,708
This deficit leads to new taxes

576
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:11,166
when we reduced wages, pensions and aid.

577
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,500
Lower income

578
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:16,833
slows the economy even more.

579
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So less than national income.

580
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,291
Causing new debt

581
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,833
to repay debts.

582
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,708
Which creates

583
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:32,916
an unpayable debt.

584
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:38,541
It's a vicious circle, as you can see.

585
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,166
Whatever we sell,

586
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:45,250
it will not change the debt.

587
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:49,208
I need to study

588
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,625
for each point. Start by privatization.

589
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,166
Kim will follow your work.

590
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,500
Thank you, and later.

591
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:07,666
Let's start with the European Bank.

592
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,541
You do not work with foreigners.

593
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,833
You listen to the doors?

594
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,833
Not at all.

595
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,333
The Elena has worked with the right.

596
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,291
The Prime Minister is aware.

597
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,541
Mr. Minister!

598
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,916
Sven, the expert in European taxes.

599
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,250
- Nice to meet you. - Me too.

600
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:26,458
Do all jump Eurogroup!

601
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,041
Not pass. Ever onward to victory!

602
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,208
They wait for you.

603
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:36,000
- But they are passed. - What?

604
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:38,166
Nothing.

605
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,750
It's here !

606
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,541
The tie !

607
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:39,541
Come.

608
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,166
This way.

609
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,916
Welcome.

610
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,416
We are eager to hear.

611
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,041
I'm sure we will do a good job.

612
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,000
Thank you.

613
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,041
We will start.

614
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,375
Thank you for coming

615
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:39,833
in this important meeting.

616
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:43,375
The Greek representatives,

617
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,791
gentlemen creditors

618
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,416
the IMF,

619
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,541
the ECB.

620
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,625
The European Commission and your colleagues

621
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,333
Finance Ministers,

622
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,166
are eager to hear.

623
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,541
Mr. Minister, you have the floor.

624
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,250
Be brief.

625
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,125
Thank you, Mr. President.

626
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,208
Colleagues ...

627
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,875
After 5 years,

628
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:20,250
I understand that the Greek drama you fatigue.

629
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,375
The Greek people are tired too.

630
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:28,458
We are here to negotiate and earn your trust

631
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:32,250
without losing one of our people.

632
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,708
We want

633
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,125
put our finances in order

634
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,333
and make reforms

635
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,166
our predecessors did not.

636
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:51,458
Some regret the victory of the left.

637
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,125
I say that we are convinced Europeanist.

638
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,375
I want ground.

639
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:01,750
I do not ask

640
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:04,250
erase our huge debt

641
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,708
but to restructure.

642
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:10,583
We want to renegotiate the MoU

643
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,916
to end austerity

644
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:16,791
which prevents any reform in the country.

645
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,500
The elections can not change economic policy.

646
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:42,666
Your country must implement the MoU full.

647
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,708
The people change their minds.

648
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,750
The Eurogroup can not start over.

649
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,416
That would be the end of the Eurozone.

650
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,791
Why the elections, then?

651
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:57,041
If the popular vote is unimportant,

652
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,708
if you can discuss the MoU ...

653
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,125
What are we doing here?

654
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:05,791
Prohibit the elections, for that matter.

655
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,416
What are you doing ?

656
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,916
Here are our proposals

657
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:15,708
for everyone to see that they are substantiated.

658
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,833
10 minute break.

659
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,958
Stop distribution.

660
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:24,125
I can not share my analysis on the MoU with you?

661
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:27,958
The MoU is the reason for this meeting.

662
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:28,958
Non !

663
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:32,125
We must inform parliaments,

664
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:35,083
if the meeting ends.

665
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:47,833
We must listen to them. They are competent.

666
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You can not listen.

667
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,916
I told the press we hear what they have to say.

668
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,291
empty talk ...

669
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,916
You wait.

670
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,666
Mediterranean narcissism.

671
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,375
"Ignorance and arrogance", to quote Mark Twain.

672
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:20,458
President.

673
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,666
The talks are just beginning, and already a statement?

674
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,166
To talk about it !

675
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,208
Maximum flexibility in the MoU. It's perfect.

676
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,333
It's a trap.

677
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,083
It says "good relations"

678
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,958
and forbidden to touch the budget submitted to the Troika.

679
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:43,625
It speaks neither restructuring nor austerity.

680
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,875
This press release does not

681
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:52,125
MoU to link to our mandate.

682
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:56,208
No question of renegotiating the MoU.

683
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:04,166
In good faith, I propose to speak of an MoU "amended".

684
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,000
You accept an MoU "amended"?

685
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:11,666
We are ready to accept an MoU "amended"

686
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,666
financially sound and socially correct.

687
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,458
The word "amended" after "MoU"

688
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,500
must be accepted by the German parliament.

689
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,708
I do not defend.

690
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:31,083
No way our Parliament

691
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:35,458
discussing on short-term amendments.

692
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,750
You understood ?

693
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:41,500
Should be 2 to 3 weeks for parliaments to decide.

694
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,666
You do not leave this room without a statement.

695
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,500
The ECB will take your cash.

696
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,166
Without cash, your bank will close.

697
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:56,041
Mr President, an ultimatum to my first meeting?

698
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,291
Because of parliamentary procedures and deadlines,

699
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:02,958
my proposals to save my country are worthless

700
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,958
because the MoU is the MoU!

701
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,708
The MoU is what it is

702
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:10,625
and nothing can change the MoU!

703
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,708
As a democrat, I refuse the ultimatum.

704
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,375
You are the cicadas.

705
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,791
After all wasted,

706
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:23,625
you demand that ants are paying for you.

707
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:27,541
Your country has lied, cheated, wasted.

708
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:32,125
We are not responsible for previous governments.

709
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,416
Your salaries and pensions are disproportionate.

710
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:38,250
The Troika has reduced them by 40%.

711
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:41,125
This is for my people to pay your follies?

712
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,958
The purpose of this meeting is to insult people and their elected?

713
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,875
Take it or leave it !

714
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:03,083
You sign it "adjusted" instead of "amended"?

715
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:06,791
You said

716
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,458
to straighten my country,

717
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:12,333
Debt was reduced and taxes lower.

718
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,958
It's more than MoU "adjusted".

719
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,333
Exact.

720
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,250
But the priority is to approve this release

721
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:22,500
and continue negotiations.

722
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:38,166
I advise my Prime Minister to accept an MoU "adjusted"

723
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,041
to resolve the humanitarian crisis.

724
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,458
Unacceptable!

725
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:45,000
"Humanitarian crisis" is too political!

726
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,375
Nothing is more political

727
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:51,583
to ignore a human tragedy because it is too political!

728
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,000
10 minute break!

729
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,666
What do you think ?

730
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,666
Accepts "adjusted".

731
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,791
- Yes. - They're closing our banks!

732
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,416
We need time.

733
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:21,750
Remove "humanitarian crisis", it will not pass.

734
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:25,083
"Adjusted" is important to prevent implosion.

735
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:29,083
Our parliament will be furious if I give from the start.

736
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,458
Talk to Wolfgang, he will understand.

737
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:41,083
I must speak to my Prime Minister. We must extend the break.

738
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,958
There is a quiet place.

739
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,708
Accept the adjusted MoU is a surrender.

740
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:59,000
Our alternatives?

741
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,291
We must give in, they will close our banks!

742
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:05,250
They will not break us in the first meeting.

743
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,166
It is too long.

744
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,333
Communicating well is not normal.

745
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:11,166
What is normal?

746
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,625
Choose between our banks close

747
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:17,458
or more austerity, which will destroy our country?

748
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,208
Excuse me !

749
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:22,666
I have better things to do than being paused endless.

750
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,625
It saves time. See you later.

751
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,583
We won some time.

752
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,750
This is a huge mess.

753
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,250
You have one last chance to sign.

754
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:01,083
I will sign, but with too political statement.

755
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,958
This is the impasse. You win some time.

756
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:08,458
Very little.

757
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:18,000
I'm too old for these games.

758
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:22,083
Your plan is to be expelled from the Euro?

759
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,125
Non !

760
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,500
But we will not yield under threat.

761
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:29,625
Your banks closed. More money.

762
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,541
As the Beatles sang:

763
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,625
Money can't buy me love.

764
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,625
Eurogroup The measures have led to demonstrations in several countries

765
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:44,291
who accuse his neocolonialist policy.

766
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:47,708
This, however, is an organization

767
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:52,750
consisting of 19 Finance Ministers of the Euro zone.

768
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:55,458
Your analysis of the Eurogroup?

769
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,541
Under the control of Wolfgang.

770
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:06,708
They try to overthrow you

771
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:10,125
or create chaos and make us responsible.

772
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,375
They make fun of us.

773
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,916
"Meaningless Speech,

774
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,625
"Arrogance, narcissism Mediterranean ..."

775
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,500
It's me they intended.

776
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,916
Hollande senses danger,

777
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,000
I offered him an official visit.

778
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:36,875
Speak to Merkel.

779
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,666
It alone can curb Wolfgang.

780
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,625
The President of the Eurogroup.

781
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,125
I'm waiting for you.

782
00:56:57,333 --> 00:57:01,625
Jeroen is a minister, he should not receive it.

783
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:03,708
He is president of the Eurogroup.

784
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:06,708
It is a puppet or a puppeteer?

785
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:16,958
Thank you for hosting me.

786
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,000
Come.

787
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,041
That's the statement.

788
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:23,583
I have come to propose, instead of "amended" or "adjusted"

789
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,708
MoU the word "updated" or MoU "modified".

790
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:29,750
What you want.

791
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,958
Followed by :

792
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,000
"To help out in the humanitarian crisis."

793
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,166
Then I'll come back with another proposal.

794
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,000
Make.

795
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,208
So be.

796
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,333
Thank you.

797
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,375
It will make concessions to reach an agreement.

798
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:57,583
If you allow them to decide to talk to, they will drop anything.

799
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,875
This way.

800
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,208
They are furious, it will be hard.

801
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:11,041
The Troika, they are ideologues of the economy,

802
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:14,875
the more fanatical they are poor economists.

803
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:19,250
They are the leaders of the ECB,

804
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,458
the IMF

805
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,875
and the European Commission.

806
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,375
They mock the suffering they cause.

807
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:27,875
VAT increase,

808
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:31,125
taxes on tobacco, alcohol, fuel,

809
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,041
cars and rents.

810
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,625
Secondly,

811
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:37,250
decline in the retirement age to 67 years.

812
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:41,500
You forget about evictions for non-payment of bills.

813
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:43,791
Effectively.

814
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,000
Here are the numbers.

815
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,541
The projects to validate:

816
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,125
falling wages 30%

817
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,458
according to the categories.

818
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:58,291
You've already down 40%.

819
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:03,166
To enable the repayment of debt,

820
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,625
must still down 40%.

821
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:12,875
So you want to lower the wages of 65 to 70%.

822
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,625
That was the original debt.

823
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,791
There are 5 years old, this was our national income.

824
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:27,291
Thanks to the brilliant policy you have imposed,

825
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:31,666
our income has dropped by 26%.

826
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,541
And the debt has increased by 6%.

827
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,791
We are not here to listen to your critics, sir.

828
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:42,333
If you persist, we stop the session.

829
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:56,541
The previous government committed to sell 14 state airports.

830
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,125
Our government will review it.

831
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,541
We will inform you, that's all.

832
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,625
A German consortium

833
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:09,666
offers 1.2 billion.

834
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,750
This is a good price.

835
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:13,791
A handout.

836
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,583
No other buyers?

837
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,958
This is a serious German company

838
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:24,250
will apply for a loan at your bank.

839
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:25,833
A loan that you, Mr. Minister,

840
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,625
who represent the state, will ensure.

841
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:36,000
You want to buy our airports with our money?

842
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:39,041
You really think I'm going to accept?

843
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:43,458
Otherwise, someone higher up will.

844
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:50,625
Excuse me.

845
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:57,791
Go see Peter.

846
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,583
My article in Le Monde has had its effect.

847
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,291
This is a project that can Juncker breakthrough.

848
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:05,750
Ok, I'll let you know.

849
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,291
Hello.

850
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,666
Read it.

851
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,916
- Coffee ? - Yes thanks.

852
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,666
The big boss.

853
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,666
I sign that?

854
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,500
Seriously?

855
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,666
Absolutely.

856
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,500
The meeting is going very well happen.

857
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,916
The President is right?

858
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,625
It was read and reread.

859
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,875
Mario and Christine?

860
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:13,291
I just talk

861
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:16,291
with Juncker, Mario, Christine

862
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:17,541
Jeroen it.

863
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,708
It Wolfgang?

864
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:22,875
Wolfgang No, but when he sees

865
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,250
we all agree, it will sell.

866
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:29,875
The President agrees that no Wolfgang?

867
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:31,208
Trust me.

868
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,125
Intervene as little as possible.

869
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:38,125
Delighted to say nothing.

870
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:41,750
You must say you are for this release.

871
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,750
Come see the President.

872
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,458
Come.

873
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:04,666
Read and tell me what you think.

874
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:31,083
Even the word "adjusted" disappeared.

875
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,208
You offered me a statement

876
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,833
I was ready to accept.

877
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,125
You commissioner of the European Union,

878
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:43,875
can you tell me what is the correct version?

879
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:49,750
Is it possible to combine some formulas

880
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:51,625
- with this ? - No !

881
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:55,041
Everything that could be retained was.

882
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,000
You will accept this text,

883
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:02,333
which is the contradiction of yours?

884
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:07,041
I agree with the opinion of the President.

885
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,583
Cross out what is wrong.

886
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:56,916
You spoil our time!

887
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,166
You torpedoes meetings

888
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:02,416
with disproportionate requirements. What wind!

889
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,541
We are in Europe here!

890
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:08,000
Your position does not allow you to lift the tone!

891
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,583
Nor to ignore my suggestions!

892
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:16,000
As president, you have to listen to the members of the Eurogroup.

893
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,333
If you persist, I will make it public.

894
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,875
Please excuse me.

895
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,625
The tension is too strong.

896
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:30,375
It happens to everyone.

897
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:36,666
The meeting was due to start there 15 minutes.

898
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:40,458
Delays promote negative rumors.

899
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:48,958
Take place.

900
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:58,041
The Eurogroup meeting did not produce any concrete agreement.

901
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,791
Others followed, long and repetitive ...

902
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,833
with Byzantine discussions

903
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,625
Jeroen favored

904
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,000
and statements

905
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:18,208
to convince the world that the Eurogroup was doing

906
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:19,541
to "save" Greece.

907
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:22,666
They make fantastic proposals.

908
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:26,708
Driven by an arrogant leftist, poor negotiator.

909
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:31,666
My efforts to deny or correct the image

910
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:35,791
were diverted against us and against our proposals.

911
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,333
Another grotesque article ...

912
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,500
no relation to our proposals.

913
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,833
EnchaÃ®nons.

914
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:01,791
If you provoke us, it will end badly.

915
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:03,041
End of meeting.

916
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,541
Tomorrow same time, same place.

917
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,916
Wolfgang wants to send the Troika in Paris!

918
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,583
The Troika has never been to Paris.

919
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,500
The attacks continued in the press.

920
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:37,250
Our label leftist crÃ©dibilisait their lies.

921
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,875
Mr. Minister,

922
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:43,333
you refuse the MoU because you are unable to apply.

923
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,375
Non !

924
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:49,125
The MoU, which even Spiegel calls ...

925
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,958
"Catalog of cruelties"

926
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:54,000
contains impossible promises.

927
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:58,375
It caused a human tragedy and economic disaster.

928
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:04,541
I had Angela on the phone. She talked to the president.

929
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:08,250
Go to the meeting. Stay calm and firm.

930
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:09,625
Saves time.

931
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,208
Now or never.

932
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:14,083
Many do not want to agree.

933
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:17,666
They want to fool our people and make us bend.

934
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:21,125
Remains true to our plan of 3 pages.

935
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,583
5 pages.

936
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:31,958
Mr. Minister, I requested a list of reforms in 3 pages.

937
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,541
There are 5.

938
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,708
Mr. President ...

939
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:39,875
Besides my technical proposals

940
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:43,541
I would remind this assembly

941
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:47,708
600 000 people have not been paid for six months

942
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,500
and that thousands of young people leave the country.

943
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,666
We want your proposals, not your lamentations.

944
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:59,125
These 5 pages recall that we remain insolvent.

945
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,916
It is impossible to make reforms

946
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:03,875
As the ongoing austerity

947
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:06,791
and that the debt is not restructured.

948
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:10,541
It is our people poor to pay your astronomical pensions?

949
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:18,416
The Minister's list is complete enough to be the basis for an agreement.

950
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:21,583
Let's debt proposals

951
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,000
for another time.

952
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:25,875
The minister smokes us with its proposals.

953
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,875
The debt must be paid!

954
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:31,125
A debt is a debt is a debt!

955
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,750
10 minutes !

956
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:46,166
Wolfgang and Angela are at war. The victim will be Jeroen ...

957
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,166
or US.

958
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,708
It leaves too?

959
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,458
Thank you.

960
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:58,666
I know ... I understand your opposition

961
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:00,083
but I think

962
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,666
an interim agreement

963
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:06,250
would end this stalemate.

964
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:10,250
I appreciate your gesture.

965
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,833
I'm not your enemy.

966
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,250
But I will not accept any changes to the MoU.

967
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:27,583
You do not change the MoU. This is the only legitimate basis

968
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,750
which will allow us to collaborate.

969
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,791
We take back ?

970
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,791
I think we should approve this list.

971
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,833
I agree with Christine.

972
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,333
Disagree.

973
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:43,458
- You have your majority. - I believe.

974
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,541
I expect this agreement signed

975
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,833
with reforms in 3 days. Not in 5.

976
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,583
As for the number of pages, no limit.

977
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:59,750
A new program and our banks are open.

978
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:03,041
In the spirit of "constructive ambiguity".

979
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,125
The Troika, institutions ...

980
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:28,166
We are very dissatisfied with our system!

981
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:31,791
You have an entire floor

982
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,041
au Hilton !

983
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,458
This will be settled by our superiors.

984
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:41,125
We want the files of ports and shipyards

985
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,958
to put on sale.

986
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:45,208
You are servants.

987
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:48,166
You demand Minister of documents?

988
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:49,750
As usual.

989
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:54,166
Now, make your requests to our officials.

990
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:59,541
It is an ideological decision, my superiors will not understand.

991
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,791
I'll explain to your superiors.

992
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:04,041
Come out.

993
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,625
If I have any questions?

994
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:14,958
You will ask in my teams and I will answer your superiors.

995
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,541
I understand.

996
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:34,458
The institutions can not bear to be treated well.

997
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,416
The Troika, you mean.

998
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:38,416
They have a floor at the Hilton.

999
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:42,416
It's been 5 years they invade our ministries. That's enough !

1000
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,666
It is in the interim agreement.

1001
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,208
Christine thinks about their safety.

1002
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:51,708
100 officers ensure their safety day and night.

1003
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:54,958
Your relative ambiguity agreement ...

1004
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:57,041
"On constructive ambiguity".

1005
01:14:57,208 --> 01:15:00,875
More than half of the deputies did not vote.

1006
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:04,750
With the other half over the opposition, it will pass.

1007
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,333
Not without restoring wages and pensions

1008
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,625
and stop privatization.

1009
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:14,416
This is an interim agreement, the first step

1010
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,458
towards what we all want.

1011
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,041
Let's start by denying the debt.

1012
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:22,958
The refuse is not a political position.

1013
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,708
Message from the President of the Eurogroup.

1014
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:35,250
"Your list of requests for the interim agreement

1015
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:39,916
"Must be consistent with the MoU for renegotiation."

1016
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:43,125
Wolfgang took control.

1017
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,708
Parliament will not vote a text involving the MoU.

1018
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,833
Parliament will explain.

1019
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,916
I can sign it

1020
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:03,750
bypassing the Parliament.

1021
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,208
10 years in prison.

1022
01:16:09,916 --> 01:16:11,791
I can sign me?

1023
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,375
Non.

1024
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:20,083
Only the Minister to sign the Eurogroup.

1025
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,083
I'm taking care of it.

1026
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,250
The President of the Council of State.

1027
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:16,416
Mr. President, your verdict?

1028
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,208
Mr. Prime Minister,

1029
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,333
a letter from the Minister to creditors

1030
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,583
to an agreement

1031
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,791
must have the approval of Parliament.

1032
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:34,541
Your advisor said to me

1033
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:37,791
it is the extension of an existing agreement.

1034
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:43,166
A letter like this

1035
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,458
will set a precedent.

1036
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,500
It would require a decree ...

1037
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,500
which entitles the Minister ...

1038
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:55,791
designate.

1039
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,000
Prepare the decree.

1040
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:12,000
Wolfgang took control. You should call Angela.

1041
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:17,916
They are like children waiting for Santa.

1042
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:22,250
It comes from the airport by taxi, incognito.

1043
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,166
Why the mystery?

1044
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,416
Surely someone important Angela protects.

1045
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:30,583
I do not know.

1046
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,416
The Prime Minister does not know who it is.

1047
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:36,500
He said: "Listen to him before speaking."

1048
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:38,208
A trusted man ?

1049
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,583
Hold.

1050
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:42,125
- There taramasalata? - I'll back in.

1051
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,333
Someone with solutions.

1052
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,416
Relax.

1053
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:56,666
Good evening, welcome. I DÃ©a and ...

1054
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:57,958
Good evening.

1055
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:05,958
I am happy to be here, although I do not know why.

1056
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,875
Whoever sent you had to say.

1057
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,375
I have no idea who sent me.

1058
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,208
Sit.

1059
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:28,833
I found a note on my desk. "Take the first plane to Athens."

1060
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,291
You drink?

1061
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,875
Not at the moment.

1062
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,041
Wims...

1063
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:46,291
your decision to return to the MoU

1064
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,291
cancels all our progress.

1065
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:54,375
Only the Chancellor who sends you can unblock the situation.

1066
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,250
I did not know that Angela was aware of my coming.

1067
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,750
The return to the MoU means

1068
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:04,791
new taxes, cuts in wages, pensions,

1069
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:08,208
still limited purchasing power.

1070
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:12,125
What lead to the closure of more shops,

1071
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:15,083
increase unemployment,

1072
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:19,750
and reduce our purchasing power and tax revenues.

1073
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,333
It's a vicious circle.

1074
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,791
If it does not change,

1075
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:26,750
we go to a regression for the next 10 years.

1076
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:30,791
It's a disaster policy. What about the people?

1077
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:34,625
He chose us to change that, to fight.

1078
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:38,083
It was 4/5 of the way to you.

1079
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,625
Take a step. Yield on something.

1080
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:44,916
It does not advance if nothing changes!

1081
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:50,416
It depends on the Troika, as you call it.

1082
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:52,708
Discuss with them.

1083
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,541
He played with us.

1084
01:20:56,708 --> 01:21:01,041
Angela sent him to close any possibility of dialogue.

1085
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:03,625
Dinner is served.

1086
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:10,541
It looks delicious.

1087
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:22,291
your tzatziki

1088
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,666
is delicious !

1089
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:28,000
WIMS savored dishes with obvious pleasure,

1090
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:32,416
while we exposed him our fears about our banks.

1091
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,666
Formidable !

1092
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,625
With the fingers.

1093
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:52,208
You have to pay the IMF.

1094
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:54,333
Draw everywhere.

1095
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,708
Take the money of pension funds!

1096
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,500
It's already done.

1097
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,208
Pension funds, university funds,

1098
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,166
all possible funds

1099
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,750
were emptied by previous governments,

1100
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:09,500
to obey the Troika.

1101
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,125
It lasted nearly five hours,

1102
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,791
it gets without the slightest concession,

1103
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:20,666
or for more democracy in the Eurogroup

1104
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,916
or for greater control of the Troika.

1105
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:26,833
Our insistence came to nothing.

1106
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,208
Try to understand

1107
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:32,250
that it is to inherit

1108
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,833
a gigantic crisis

1109
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:37,166
without European experience.

1110
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:41,250
You have now.

1111
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,500
Your tenacity was noticed in Brussels.

1112
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,875
And your colleagues face antagonism

1113
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:52,250
who have neither your international experience,

1114
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:54,500
nor your talent to debate.

1115
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,708
Is it a reproach?

1116
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:02,041
The Eurogroup should be a place of free debate.

1117
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:06,333
Freedom is an essential concept for our democracies.

1118
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:11,583
But freedom must be framed by a system that maintains order.

1119
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:16,416
It's very official and it's too early.

1120
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,416
It begins.

1121
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,875
We expect the bank closure

1122
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:28,291
and she invites him in style.

1123
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,875
What is happening?

1124
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:40,916
Hopefully he will not be fooled.

1125
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:48,125
The Prime Minister is not an easy prey.

1126
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:53,583
Angela Merkel, the soft power.

1127
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:58,750
charm offensive to study the guest character.

1128
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,833
Beautiful coat.

1129
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,791
She wants to change the image of his country.

1130
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,291
I do not think so.

1131
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,875
She has only one strategy: divide and rule.

1132
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,375
The meeting between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister

1133
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,791
lasted 6 hours.

1134
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:20,500
6 hours !

1135
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:23,583
Awaiting the outcome.

1136
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,083
The agreement was perfect.

1137
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,541
The differences are important,

1138
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:33,541
but the desire for change is clear.

1139
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:37,833
Especially after reading your 27 pages, where she congratulated me.

1140
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,625
You sincerely believe?

1141
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:43,625
She drops a little to take the maximum.

1142
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:46,375
Sincere, not sure, pragmatic, surely.

1143
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,666
She tacking. And do you know what she said?

1144
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,375
"Replace Yanis

1145
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:54,833
"And negotiations for the MoU will be much better."

1146
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,708
I said, "Okay,

1147
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,166
"If you replace Wolfgang."

1148
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:02,666
She talked more about it.

1149
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:06,291
What else, apart from the non-replacement?

1150
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:10,125
Create a group of freer discussions Eurogroup

1151
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:11,708
which seems paralyzed.

1152
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:13,500
Nice way to divide us.

1153
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:16,416
You and I will introduce our ideas.

1154
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:19,500
There is soon a Eurogroup meeting in Riga.

1155
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:20,500
Your instructions?

1156
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,916
Farm on our decisions

1157
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,958
and on your 27 pages.

1158
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,000
In Riga, the meeting without issue.

1159
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:41,416
Our correspondent in Riga.

1160
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:45,333
At the reception in honor of the 19 ministers of the Eurogroup,

1161
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,458
one of them was missing:

1162
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:49,708
the Greek Finance Minister,

1163
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:53,416
often criticized for his tenacity in negotiations

1164
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:56,166
and his love of the media.

1165
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:59,208
But we were there! Both !

1166
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:03,208
Your room is smaller than mine.

1167
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,125
They had put me there for the view.

1168
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:08,541
They put me far away.

1169
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:10,125
What is going on ?

1170
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:13,958
We're together, we listen to you.

1171
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:15,708
I talked to Angela.

1172
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:19,166
Hold on, do not let go.

1173
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,875
Move forward in our planning.

1174
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,500
Greece.

1175
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:28,208
What a shame to have replaced your collaborator, Yanis.

1176
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:30,666
We have to continue with what we have.

1177
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:38,541
On commence ?

1178
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:16,708
As in the past, your government

1179
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,208
must work with the Troika

1180
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:21,375
in technical and policy areas.

1181
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,333
political issues to Ministers

1182
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,041
technical issues to civil servants.

1183
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:31,083
The Troika must regain its full freedom of action.

1184
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,791
Before your election, Greece on track,

1185
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,750
your debt was manageable.

1186
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:39,875
It is no longer and the deficit increases.

1187
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:43,291
Your debt is unmanageable, erase billions!

1188
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,958
Your country can not recover without debt relief.

1189
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,625
Without the Troika,

1190
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,583
So no more liquidity reforms.

1191
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,250
Your banks will close

1192
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:56,791
and you come out of the Euro.

1193
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:00,333
Without affecting the economies of the Euro.

1194
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:04,125
The output of a single country of the Euro

1195
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:06,875
will be an earthquake for all others.

1196
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:09,000
There is a contradiction, Mario ...

1197
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:11,166
Minister, wait your turn.

1198
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,833
We want to help Greece

1199
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:16,625
but Greece does not help.

1200
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:19,625
It's time to talk about the consequences.

1201
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:23,125
We went in the wrong direction.

1202
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:26,083
I see no other solution than the MoU.

1203
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:33,333
Our Government will do

1204
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,250
to stay in the EU and in the euro zone

1205
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,250
sustainably.

1206
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,125
Mr. Minister,

1207
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:46,875
you have to give carte blanche to the Troika,

1208
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:50,416
not legislate without the agreement of the Troika

1209
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:53,000
and forget your intermediary agreement.

1210
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,958
I expect the agreement signed with the list of reforms

1211
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:59,583
in 3 days, not five.

1212
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,541
As for the number of pages, no limit.

1213
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:06,750
That's all for today. The meeting was closed.

1214
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:20,541
It seems that the Greek Minister is an amateur.

1215
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,791
Is it correct ?

1216
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:25,541
Our discussion highlighted the urgency of the situation.

1217
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:27,458
Their ideological rigidity

1218
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:30,791
ruin the negotiations, it will cost them dearly.

1219
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:34,541
Do not post this. I keep it in my book.

1220
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:36,666
Their minister is heterodox.

1221
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:40,250
To monopolize the media, he wants to dominate discussions.

1222
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,291
It must be excluded.

1223
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:44,166
It takes a Yanixit.

1224
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,708
Mr. Minister!

1225
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:53,833
You avoid them? you are treated saboteur and amateur.

1226
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,541
I never fled.

1227
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:59,500
When it comes to the fate of a suffering people,

1228
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:01,291
it can take time.

1229
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,458
It says you isolated.

1230
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:06,958
I trust the Prime Minister and the Greek people.

1231
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:08,416
It is enough for me.

1232
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:12,291
You fled dinner official because of their hostility?

1233
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:14,541
I was the official dinner yesterday.

1234
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,541
Tonight I dine with my team.

1235
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,333
Will you be replaced?

1236
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,333
I trust my Prime Minister.

1237
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,875
Thank you very much !

1238
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:26,750
He would not answer and said to have been the official dinner.

1239
01:30:26,916 --> 01:30:29,291
He was surprised fleeing Ministers

1240
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:32,541
and questions, answering side.

1241
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:35,375
It is isolated and unable to enforce.

1242
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:37,208
Thank you, Victor.

1243
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:42,083
My public lynching began.

1244
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:44,875
If my replacement is necessary ...

1245
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:47,875
We are like a knitted sweater.

1246
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:50,083
They took a thread and pull on it.

1247
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:53,083
They want you to shoot me down.

1248
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,875
We are two in this war.

1249
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,416
Thou hast weathered Riga. The proof.

1250
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:00,625
The President of the Eurogroup

1251
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,000
wants your replacement.

1252
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,416
It bored.

1253
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:07,416
It's your fault. Should not talk to him live.

1254
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,708
I'll tell him to speak only to you.

1255
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,416
- You told her ? - No, I have news.

1256
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:16,416
He called me 2 times.

1257
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:17,541
Assisi.

1258
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:27,583
The Eurogroup President called me. He will talk with Yorgos.

1259
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:33,708
We will not accept everything, but we can not always say no.

1260
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,750
It seems that Angela

1261
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:39,625
think Yanis and Wolfgang are incompatible.

1262
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,416
And that

1263
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,833
paralyzes the negotiations.

1264
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,541
I will sacrifice Nicholas

1265
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,791
and replaced by Yorgos.

1266
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,500
Yorgos is excellent.

1267
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:56,416
Please Brussels. It will arrive at agreements.

1268
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:59,375
Capitulation.

1269
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:04,250
Nicholas is a researcher,

1270
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:06,875
an intellectual, a collaborator,

1271
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:09,958
but not the man for complex talks.

1272
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,666
Efklis validated the choice of Yorgos

1273
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:14,625
not even pronounce his name,

1274
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:17,375
alors qu'il the mÃ©prisait politiquement

1275
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,208
and humanely.

1276
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:23,375
You yield all to the Troika!

1277
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:26,333
No. I save time

1278
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,791
to get to our goal.

1279
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,000
Some want to get the MoU.

1280
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:33,375
- It will not happen. - It will pass !

1281
01:32:33,541 --> 01:32:34,375
Catastrophe.

1282
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:37,666
The Eurogroup, the public, the European media,

1283
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,541
all are against us!

1284
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:41,833
We need a break

1285
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,375
and you will follow it all closely.

1286
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,208
In witness?

1287
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:49,875
In man on whom I can rely.

1288
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:52,250
Sit down.

1289
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,916
140,000 people voted for you.

1290
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,791
142 000 !

1291
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:11,916
142 000 !

1292
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:13,291
Why are you laughing ?

1293
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:17,333
Quitting is to betray their hopes ...

1294
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,333
The betrayal would stay and not ...

1295
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,333
I do not hear anything !

1296
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,041
The betrayal would be to stay

1297
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:26,791
not keep my promises.

1298
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:31,916
Always the last word!

1299
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:37,416
What are we doing here? That's your surprise?

1300
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:40,916
We dined with friends. It does not make you happy?

1301
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:42,416
And.

1302
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,500
This wine, great!

1303
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:49,583
Thank you.

1304
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,791
Who wants the red?

1305
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,833
- Me. - Me too.

1306
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,791
- So who starts? - Serve yourself.

1307
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,708
I mean, who wants to explain

1308
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:01,458
the goal of this friendly

1309
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,833
small meeting looks like a conspiracy?

1310
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:07,000
150,000 people voted for you ...

1311
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:08,958
- 142 000 ! - Bravo !

1312
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:11,458
You got the most votes,

1313
01:34:11,625 --> 01:34:14,375
and you want to give up with a nice letter.

1314
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:16,833
And crap on TV.

1315
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,291
This is a conspiracy.

1316
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:23,541
After all your promises radical change.

1317
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:26,833
A well-organized conspiracy.

1318
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:30,416
They accuse you of failures of Europe and Greece.

1319
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:31,708
It's already the case.

1320
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,208
Guys...

1321
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,166
More than half

1322
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:38,500
members of the government want to sign the MoU.

1323
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,291
After being elected

1324
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:43,916
to reduce debt, end the rigor

1325
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:46,916
and unemployment, restore wages

1326
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:48,625
nationalizing banks,

1327
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:52,500
taxing church property ...

1328
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:26,958
You want something ?

1329
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,791
What do you want ?

1330
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:37,333
Speak !

1331
01:36:14,583 --> 01:36:16,375
What have you decided?

1332
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:19,708
It must first that I speak with her.

1333
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:22,375
She does not speak politics.

1334
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,375
- Sorry. - No, come in.

1335
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,833
Sit down.

1336
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:41,625
One.

1337
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,541
You're going to sign a new austerity program?

1338
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,125
Sakis and Giorgos believe we have a good agreement.

1339
01:36:58,291 --> 01:36:59,791
It is a capitulation.

1340
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:03,166
They think we will get a debt relief.

1341
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:06,208
More you make concessions,

1342
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:08,500
the more they ask thee.

1343
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:13,333
We were elected to lead the country out of the worst ever imposed austerity.

1344
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,375
Do you know what it means

1345
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:18,958
"Repay 3.5% budget surplus for 10 years"?

1346
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,000
A permanent crisis!

1347
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:23,041
Except oil countries,

1348
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:28,833
no country displays such a budget surplus for 10 years.

1349
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:35,375
Angela wants to see me.

1350
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:40,416
I need you. I have important decisions to make.

1351
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:45,000
I am leaving Brussels, join me as soon as you can.

1352
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:51,958
Secret services believe that thou hast allied with Wolfgang

1353
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:54,250
to lead us out of the euro.

1354
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,916
Manos too.

1355
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,958
And you believe him?

1356
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:02,833
Me no.

1357
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:07,875
I await you in Brussels.

1358
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:38,958
Kim! What are you doing here ?

1359
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:42,166
So this is the Greek world?

1360
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,583
The only thing that the Germans can not take us.

1361
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:49,458
So ? What are you doing in Brussels?

1362
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,083
Dine together, I have to talk to you.

1363
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,583
Yanis ... I must join Yorgos,

1364
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,583
it is with WIMS and Costelo.

1365
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:01,500
You see the Troika without telling me?

1366
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:07,916
Yorgos and Sakis called me to join the emergency.

1367
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:10,416
I was trapped by the Greeks!

1368
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:12,208
The Prime Minister knows?

1369
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:24,125
- The Prime Minister. - He does not want to be disturbed.

1370
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,708
I have to see. It's urgent.

1371
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,833
Yorgos ignore your instructions and meeting the Troika.

1372
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,791
He speaks with WIMS!

1373
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:48,958
Stop with Yorgos!

1374
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:50,666
You've bothered me for that?

1375
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,583
Excuse me.

1376
01:40:09,416 --> 01:40:12,708
Yorgos n'a plus d'importance.

1377
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:23,916
A Grexit is out of question.

1378
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:28,833
Does not change your program, I call you to read.

1379
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:46,291
I arranged to see Wolfgang privately

1380
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:55,500
On the part of German schoolchildren.

1381
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:58,125
I promised to offer them.

1382
01:40:58,291 --> 01:41:00,750
Chocolate against depression!

1383
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:05,208
You should also take because ...

1384
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:07,125
I have to tell you ...

1385
01:41:10,166 --> 01:41:12,541
Our economy collapses

1386
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:16,000
because of your persistent blockages.

1387
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:20,000
You pay us the money to repay the debt,

1388
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:22,541
and we pay you interest.

1389
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:26,958
Mario and his ECB earn a billion a year,

1390
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:28,375
grÃ¢ce Ã  la grecque said.

1391
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,375
What is the solution ?

1392
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:35,000
It is up to you.

1393
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:36,750
But I you the summary:

1394
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:40,166
institutional reforms in a revitalized economy

1395
01:41:40,708 --> 01:41:42,916
by debt restructuring.

1396
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:46,583
The solution: sign the MoU or exit the Euro.

1397
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:49,333
I sign your MoU

1398
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,208
and 6 to 12 months later,

1399
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,500
the country will be in the same economic impasse.

1400
01:41:54,666 --> 01:41:57,791
Your Prime Minister must agree to leave the Euro.

1401
01:41:57,958 --> 01:41:59,208
Temporarily.

1402
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:02,000
Your chancellor has ruled that.

1403
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:05,125
This requires you to sign the MoU.

1404
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:09,333
Your Prime Minister is considering a referendum.

1405
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,458
It is not expected.

1406
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:15,958
There will be one in 2 weeks or 3 months.

1407
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:18,291
To stay or not in the euro.

1408
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:20,958
We want to stay in the Euro.

1409
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:23,041
So vote Yes and sign the MoU.

1410
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:24,666
If you vote No ,

1411
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:26,333
it will be the Grexit.

1412
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,958
Wolfgang, do me a favor.

1413
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:33,208
You are an insider in politics for 40 years.

1414
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:35,416
I am for only 4 months.

1415
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:39,416
Stop telling me what I should do

1416
01:42:39,583 --> 01:42:42,083
and give me your opinion instead.

1417
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:48,041
If you were me ...

1418
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,958
you sign the MoU?

1419
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:05,125
As a patriot ...

1420
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:08,666
non.

1421
01:43:09,708 --> 01:43:11,333
It's bad for your people.

1422
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:13,583
You are not going to recover.

1423
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:18,541
Think the euro area

1424
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:20,750
is unsustainable in the state,

1425
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:23,458
need a political union.

1426
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:25,833
It's just.

1427
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:28,583
But meanwhile,

1428
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,583
must impose rules

1429
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,250
to save the euro.

1430
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:36,041
You will serve as an example for other discipline.

1431
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:39,875
Your prime minister often speaks to my Chancellor.

1432
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:41,708
It has nothing to offer him.

1433
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:46,750
It's a simple choice: MoU or Grexit.

1434
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:56,375
I like swordfish taken the bait.

1435
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,791
They shoot me, they let me go,

1436
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:00,291
they shoot me ...

1437
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,541
they let me go.

1438
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:21,708
This referendum will free us.

1439
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:24,875
The referendum is not enough.

1440
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:27,250
We must be prepared for the future.

1441
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:29,416
They want you to go.

1442
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:33,250
The right wants you assign the current economic disaster.

1443
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:36,625
I did everything with your agreement.

1444
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:38,541
We will be two at the helm.

1445
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:41,833
It's me and the entire left they want to annihilate.

1446
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:45,333
WIMS think you're fleeting.

1447
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:48,125
He is wrong.

1448
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,833
That's why I want you by my side.

1449
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,416
I decided to make a referendum.

1450
01:45:09,666 --> 01:45:13,208
I returned to inform the Cabinet and Parliament.

1451
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:16,791
You two stay here for the Eurogroup.

1452
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:20,583
total secrecy until my official announcement.

1453
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,291
I need you all.

1454
01:45:22,666 --> 01:45:26,708
A referendum ... To win or to lose it?

1455
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:31,041
If we win it, we leave the Euro?

1456
01:45:31,208 --> 01:45:34,666
The referendum is to say O ui or Not the MoU.

1457
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:36,375
They'll close our banks.

1458
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:38,916
Merkel m'a for the promise of which it is not.

1459
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:59,875
A referendum is crazy!

1460
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:02,791
What to do after the referendum?

1461
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:06,083
Why a referendum? To win or lose?

1462
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:19,333
The announcement of the referendum makes our deciduous discussions.

1463
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,583
We continue without you.

1464
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:24,208
The referendum is an internal matter

1465
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:27,125
that does not affect our discussions.

1466
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:29,458
We want the opinion of our people

1467
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:31,166
our debates.

1468
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:34,333
How ordinary people can decide

1469
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,458
a complex issue?

1470
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:39,833
The people he really knows his interests?

1471
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,291
We believe that our people

1472
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:45,250
can think and decide.

1473
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:47,875
We ask the ECB, Mario,

1474
01:46:48,041 --> 01:46:51,916
to extend our credit until referendum day.

1475
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:53,541
It is the role of the ECB.

1476
01:46:53,708 --> 01:46:54,500
No way !

1477
01:46:55,083 --> 01:46:58,125
The ECB has nothing to do with politics.

1478
01:46:58,291 --> 01:46:59,666
Mario answer.

1479
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:04,333
We can stop sending cash at any time.

1480
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,208
So cause the closure of our banks

1481
01:47:08,375 --> 01:47:10,958
and you interfere with our referendum.

1482
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:14,125
The next meetings will be without you.

1483
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:22,958
What do the statutes? Can we exclude?

1484
01:47:23,416 --> 01:47:24,458
With this referendum,

1485
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:28,583
the people tell the Prime Minister to follow the line.

1486
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:31,625
Breaking these negotiations come to nothing,

1487
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:33,666
or sign the MoU.

1488
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:36,791
Mr. Minister, the Eurogroup has no statutes,

1489
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:38,666
no legal existence.

1490
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:41,541
Decisions are made by the President.

1491
01:47:44,666 --> 01:47:46,583
Your decisions,

1492
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:49,125
our decisions

1493
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:51,958
are not legal,

1494
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:54,250
they are arbitrary!

1495
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:57,708
Our decisions are accepted by all governments!

1496
01:48:08,625 --> 01:48:11,125
We need adults in this room.

1497
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:21,541
Allo?

1498
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:25,125
I arrive.

1499
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:28,375
I arrive.

1500
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:29,750
I arrive !

1501
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,208
If banks are closing, this is a great advertisement for the Yes .

1502
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:40,958
We will sign the MoU.

1503
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:43,583
For pity's sake, reopen our banks!

1504
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,416
Why not sign it?

1505
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:50,291
It would finally be alone!

1506
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:54,458
If they open Monday and closed for lack of cash,

1507
01:48:55,416 --> 01:48:56,791
it will riot.

1508
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,791
There will be a great event, and we will be there.

1509
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:01,291
We in the street?

1510
01:49:01,666 --> 01:49:03,875
The government did not take to the streets.

1511
01:49:06,166 --> 01:49:10,291
Your idea to limit withdrawals to 60 per day still stand?

1512
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:11,458
Yes.

1513
01:49:12,708 --> 01:49:15,916
- We will hold until when? - Until the referendum.

1514
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:20,916
Very well.

1515
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:23,875
60 per day is put in place.

1516
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:37,375
Tell me.

1517
01:49:39,375 --> 01:49:41,625
It is where Plan B?

1518
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:42,958
We're ready.

1519
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:44,125
But still ?

1520
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:48,791
The transition to a new currency is painful, difficult.

1521
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:52,333
We will be in a weak position, but it will not come out of the Euro.

1522
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:56,041
Look what we found.

1523
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:03,333
Found 16 billion!

1524
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:09,166
There are 3 years, the ECB has transferred 16 billion for distributors.

1525
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:13,333
The funds are in different banks and the ECB forgotten.

1526
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,625
Great discovery, but useless.

1527
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:16,791
Why unnecessary?

1528
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:18,875
It will keep the banks open.

1529
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:21,583
This is theft. It belongs to the ECB.

1530
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:22,791
Theft?

1531
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:26,458
If my child dies of hunger, I can steal milk.

1532
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:28,458
The left does not fly.

1533
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:31,291
Not after the abuses of the previous governments.

1534
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:35,416
these funds to benefit can nationalize our suffering people.

1535
01:50:35,583 --> 01:50:39,708
If we want to get out of the euro, yes, we can.

1536
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:47,125
We will neither come out of the Euro, or become thieves.

1537
01:50:48,416 --> 01:50:51,083
It starts the 60 day plan.

1538
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:57,708
After the announcement of the referendum,

1539
01:50:57,875 --> 01:51:01,041
the ECB cut the liquidity to Greek banks,

1540
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:04,416
that closed, creating a financial asphyxiation.

1541
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:24,500
These idiots are going to the vote Yes !

1542
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:29,333
They are right because Yes save the country

1543
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,916
the misery in which the left has plunged.

1544
01:51:33,083 --> 01:51:37,583
- If the Yes wins, I quit. - The Yes, it is "acceptance of the MoU."

1545
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:41,416
We must continue the fight and not give up.

1546
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:43,833
The Yes offers a solution.

1547
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:46,666
Some will accept it.

1548
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:50,291
We will not hand the country to the Troika.

1549
01:51:50,458 --> 01:51:52,958
It is the promise of the Prime Minister.

1550
01:51:53,125 --> 01:51:54,583
If the No wins?

1551
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:57,750
It takes us out of the euro, and nobody wants that.

1552
01:51:57,916 --> 01:52:00,583
If the people are with us, they will not dare.

1553
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,041
If that is the case,

1554
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:05,125
creating a new currency and continue to fight.

1555
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:09,291
It was a way to remember our promises to the Prime Minister.

1556
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:12,750
I understood his difficulties and fears.

1557
01:52:12,916 --> 01:52:15,708
"Taken as swordfish." This image haunted me.

1558
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:19,458
The referendum night arrived,

1559
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,041
all indicators gave the Yes winner.

1560
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,708
Some of us wanted.

1561
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:28,583
It would be an excuse to stay in power.

1562
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,625
In less than an hour,

1563
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:34,375
an earthquake of unpredictable magnitude will hit Europe.

1564
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,833
And they shall go

1565
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:41,125
in the prison of eternal debt.

1566
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:43,750
Subjected to the brutality of the Troika.

1567
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:50,958
Unless one has a No .

1568
01:52:52,458 --> 01:52:53,833
A No massive.

1569
01:52:54,458 --> 01:52:56,875
Whatever the result, I need you.

1570
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,541
Manos think

1571
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:06,541
I am the brake that prevents agreement.

1572
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:10,541
With No , we will impose our agreement.

1573
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:19,083
They'll try to make you fold by any means.

1574
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:20,625
All.

1575
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:24,500
A political vision needs time.

1576
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:28,583
Leaving is the death of the visionary

1577
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:30,416
and vision.

1578
01:53:30,583 --> 01:53:31,791
It is true

1579
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:35,708
that the victory of Yes is an end and a solution.

1580
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:38,458
If one resigns, the left disappears.

1581
01:53:38,791 --> 01:53:43,583
If it remains, it will make a right policy.

1582
01:53:44,583 --> 01:53:46,416
Better it disappears

1583
01:53:47,583 --> 01:53:48,833
to be reborn one day.

1584
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,291
Now, the results ...

1585
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:52,416
10,

1586
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,791
9,

1587
01:53:54,708 --> 01:53:55,708
8,

1588
01:53:56,291 --> 01:53:57,333
7,

1589
01:53:58,041 --> 01:53:59,041
6,

1590
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:00,958
5,

1591
01:54:01,541 --> 01:54:02,583
4,

1592
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:04,125
3,

1593
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:05,791
2,

1594
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,208
1...

1595
01:54:23,708 --> 01:54:27,500
The people are always right, even when he is wrong.

1596
01:54:30,833 --> 01:54:32,833
We passed them!

1597
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:28,958
I like swordfish took the bait.

1598
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:32,000
The Germans will destroy us.

1599
01:55:32,666 --> 01:55:36,291
It is megalomaniac, he is only interested that his career!

1600
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:44,250
Austerity will be defeated

1601
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:47,750
by the growth it will generate.

1602
01:55:50,541 --> 01:55:52,875
Do not resign, whatever it costs.

1603
01:55:53,166 --> 01:55:56,666
If one resigns, is jail for two.

1604
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:01,250
Our Chancellor has nothing to offer to your Prime Minister.

1605
01:56:01,416 --> 01:56:02,958
If we win? We leave the Euro?

1606
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:05,166
Change currency hurts.

1607
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:08,666
It takes us out of the euro, and nobody wants that.

1608
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:11,000
MoU ou Grexit.

1609
01:56:12,125 --> 01:56:12,875
Allo?

1610
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:16,791
Chancellor.

1611
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:23,666
Allo?

1612
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:26,583
It's a trap.

1613
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:29,791
The Chancellor and the heads of state are waiting,

1614
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:33,333
they are furious about your victory in the referendum.

1615
02:01:18,875 --> 02:01:20,166
Smile!

1616
02:01:30,416 --> 02:01:34,083
The Prime Minister signed the MoU.

1617
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:37,666
The finance minister has resigned.

1618
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:45,416
The Greek Parliament voted 73% for the MoU.

1619
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:50,500
The people have been spilled.

1620
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:57,166
The crisis continues ...

1621
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,208
The people...

1622
02:01:59,375 --> 02:02:06,875
The people heroically survives.

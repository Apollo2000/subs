1
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:20,897
He's gonna sell,
move back to Illinois.

2
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,903
She had my gun.

3
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,229
I'll get supplies
while I'm in town.

4
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,164
It would be good to get stocked
up before winter sets in.

5
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:50,168
How did she get my gun?

6
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,795
You got to keep your wits
about you.

7
00:06:57,865 --> 00:06:59,453
Will you do that?

8
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,571
Won't be long.

9
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,025
Couple of days, maybe.

10
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,024
Lizzy!

11
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,648
Lizzy, wake up!

12
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,926
- Isaac?
- Lizzy!

13
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,238
Lizzy!

14
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,172
We got to get the baby out!

15
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,158
Aah!

16
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,524
We got new neighbors.

17
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,735
They bought
the old Bergson Cabin.

18
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,635
A man and his wife.

19
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:33,225
Did you invite them over
for dinner?

20
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,160
Of course. Said you wouldn't
take no for an answer.

21
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,197
What are they like?

22
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,514
A little funny.

23
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:48,793
- Funny?
- Nervous?

24
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:51,243
Huh.

25
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,730
Better get dinner started.

26
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:23,414
This is the best food
we've had in weeks.

27
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,383
Lizzy, you'll have to
give my Emma a few lessons

28
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,317
on making a decent meal.

29
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,945
I'd be happy to.

30
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:47,713
Mm.

31
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:49,232
You two have a hell
of a lot to do

32
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,166
before the winter sets in.

33
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,824
Everyone said that
this was the best time

34
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,482
of year to get started.

35
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:02,417
Well, sure, but between getting
that old cabin livable again

36
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,351
and planting your garden..

37
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,390
We'll do what we can to help,
of course.

38
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:20,297
Maybe I can bring my plow
around tomorrow.

39
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,231
We could at least get your crops
in the ground.

40
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,823
That would be a,
a mighty big help.

41
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:36,244
- You're German?
- Yes.

42
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,178
I was brought over as a child.

43
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:40,387
Thank you.

44
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:48,705
- How were your travels?
- Long.

45
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,915
- Meet anyone?
- Uh, a few people.

46
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,882
A family going to Oklahoma

47
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:56,817
some men, a reverend.

48
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,993
Is there a church nearby?

49
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,927
Not enough people
around here yet.

50
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,551
- Now many?
- Now..

51
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:09,553
Four.

52
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:39,911
Oh, my.

53
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,294
Is the rain always like this?
This intense?

54
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,572
It can be.

55
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,956
Oh, my.

56
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:53,510
Lizzy, these are beautiful
pieces.

57
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:56,064
Did you bring them with you
from Saint Louis?

58
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,999
No. Isaac made most
of our furniture.

59
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,209
That's incredible.

60
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,074
Isaac, you are truly talented.

61
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,838
My father made most
of our pieces as well.

62
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,772
He was quite the man.

63
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,334
How long have you been married?

64
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:26,371
Eight years.

65
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:27,373
Oh, my.

66
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,171
And no little ones?

67
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,419
- We had a son.
- Wasn't the Lord's will.

68
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,907
It's none of my business,
of course.

69
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:52,604
Ah, sometimes I don't know
when to stop talking.

70
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,158
And the rain..

71
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,198
Well, I tend to get
a bit restless.

72
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,693
Is that what we look like
to them,

73
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,421
just a little flickering light
in the middle of nowhere?

74
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,457
Perhaps.

75
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,398
What do you think of them?

76
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:40,332
It's nice to have people close.

77
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,266
Something I've always
longed for.

78
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
But?

79
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,416
But it feels odd.

80
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:59,421
In cities,
strangers stay strangers.

81
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:05,254
Here we don't have that luxury,
do we?

82
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,062
Come to bed. It's too cold
to have the door open.

83
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,384
Are you sure
they're expecting us?

84
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,255
Come on.

85
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:37,164
We were very comfortable
in Illinois, you see?

86
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:39,511
Be sure to hold firmly

87
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,340
and get the root.

88
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:43,239
Gideon couldn't stand working
for my father

89
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,276
as if it were something
to be ashamed of.

90
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,521
He's not strong like Isaac.

91
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:50,799
Like you.

92
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:53,387
Hm.

93
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,914
I'm going to get some water
for the men.

94
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:03,915
Hm.

95
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,818
Be sure to bring some
for us as well.

96
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,044
Isaac?

97
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:21,821
I fear I'll never really
get clean again.

98
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,274
Something wrong?

99
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:32,211
Just getting used
to everything, I think.

100
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:35,248
That takes time.

101
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:49,124
This land is funny, you know?

102
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,990
It plays tricks on your mind.

103
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,967
It's Emma, she..

104
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:02,973
She's not well.

105
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,813
Better to wait outside.

106
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,505
No point in us all getting sick.

107
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:21,889
It is not that kind of sickness.

108
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,685
We'll wait outside.

109
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:42,701
Emma?

110
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,022
Emma?

111
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,302
Give us this day
our daily bread.

112
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:59,891
Forgive us our trespasses.

113
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,721
It's coming for me.

114
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,725
It's coming for me.

115
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:09,419
It's coming for me.

116
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,871
It's coming for me.

117
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:19,393
Emma.

118
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,366
It's coming for me.

119
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:30,060
No one's here but us.

120
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,650
Gideon and Isaac are outside

121
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:38,688
but in here
it's just you and me.

122
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,414
No.

123
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,865
No. This place is wrong.

124
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:45,420
We're not supposed to be here.

125
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:51,254
And now it wants my baby.

126
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,776
You're with a child.

127
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:04,819
Come on.

128
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:12,860
Don't touch me! Don't..

129
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:25,944
Is she pregnant?

130
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:33,813
Uh, did she say she was?

131
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,611
She needs rest.

132
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,486
Lizzy, what are you doing?

133
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,661
Shh. It's okay.

134
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,250
- You're exhausted.
- I'm not.

135
00:32:57,251 --> 00:33:01,150
I can't rest because
it's coming for me.

136
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:02,565
No, Lizzy.

137
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,120
Please don't do that.

138
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,914
No.

139
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,332
Lizzy, don't..
Lizzy. Lizzy! Lizzy!

140
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,333
Ah!

141
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,169
Don't do that. Don't do that!

142
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,414
Shh!

143
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,836
Pull your wife out
from under the bed

144
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:33,459
and tie her to it.

145
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:53,859
You alright?

146
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,034
Fine.

147
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,770
It was hard enough
when it was just the two of us.

148
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:13,051
And now we're expected
to look after them as well?

149
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:17,745
Gideon should take her home.

150
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:22,612
She's gonna hurt herself
or one of us with her nonsense.

151
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,548
Is she really pregnant?

152
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:34,693
She thinks she is.

153
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,805
"At length, the worn out anxiety

154
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,394
"she determined to call loudly
for assistance

155
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:32,844
"from her casement,
and was advancing to it

156
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:35,778
"when whether the terror of
her mind gave her ideal sounds

157
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,091
"or that the real ones did come

158
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:40,439
she thought footsteps
were ascending.."

159
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,203
Perhaps we should finish
another time.

160
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,447
When you're feeling better.

161
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:53,555
It's just a person in the book.

162
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:55,316
It's not a spirit.

163
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,667
I see.

164
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,223
You can keep it.

165
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:12,195
Have you thought of names
for the baby?

166
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,024
Not yet.

167
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,245
They're coming in for lunch.

168
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,665
I've seen something.

169
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:39,221
- Just now?
- At night.

170
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:43,052
I hear it too, whispering.

171
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,779
I've told Gideon
but he doesn't believe me

172
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,506
tells me it's the wind.

173
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:52,960
- There are many natural...
- It's not.

174
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:59,828
You remember how many graves
you passed on the way here.

175
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,871
I told Gideon
we should turn back.

176
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:19,054
I said everyone would be dead
when we get there and there's...

177
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,297
Hush now.

178
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,653
Please don't be unpleasant
in front of the men.

179
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:10,501
Lizzy?

180
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:13,435
Isaac.

181
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:02,553
My help cometh from the Lord,
which made heaven and Earth.

182
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:04,798
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

183
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:07,351
The Lord is my keeper

184
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,215
the Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

185
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:10,837
The sun shall not strike me
by day, nor the moon by night.

186
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:12,529
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

187
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,910
Behold, He who keeps Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

188
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,980
The Lord is my keeper.

189
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:18,327
...which made heaven and Earth.

190
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,950
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

191
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:21,676
He that keepeth thee will not
slumber..

192
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:34,896
Lizzy?

193
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,158
Lizzy?

194
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:17,628
Lizzy?

195
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,462
Hey, hey, Lizzy.

196
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:25,774
English! English!

197
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:26,775
Lizzy!

198
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:30,711
You're alright.

199
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,369
You're alright.

200
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,044
I shouldn't have left
you alone like this.

201
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,129
What's this?

202
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,407
It's nothing.

203
00:44:12,822 --> 00:44:14,858
Have you been reading it?

204
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:16,550
I glanced at it.

205
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:20,139
You don't need to be filling
your head with stuff like this.

206
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,693
You need to rest.

207
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:26,008
What I saw was real.

208
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:44,991
This is yours now.

209
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:46,268
- I don't...
- No.

210
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:50,065
Promise me you will keep it
by you at all times.

211
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:53,000
It will protect you.
It will protect our baby.

212
00:44:56,245 --> 00:45:00,180
And the next time you think
you see a demon..

213
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,217
...shoot it.

214
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:05,615
What?

215
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:09,619
What do you want now?

216
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,384
Where are you?

217
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:25,566
Aah!

218
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:30,157
What must I do to be rid of you?

219
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:51,938
No! Stop!

220
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:56,795
Lizzy, where's your gun?

221
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:04,768
Mara, damner of souls.

222
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:08,599
Abbadon, the destroyer.

223
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,188
That's enough, Emma.

224
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:13,157
Succorbenoth..

225
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,297
...bringer of jealous thoughts.

226
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:17,298
Enough.

227
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,889
Do you want to play a game?

228
00:49:22,856 --> 00:49:23,856
No.

229
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:26,170
Why not?

230
00:49:29,587 --> 00:49:31,692
You are not well, Emma.

231
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:35,143
You should rest.

232
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:36,317
Think of your baby.

233
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:38,423
I am, Lizzy.

234
00:49:39,252 --> 00:49:41,322
Elizabeth.

235
00:49:41,323 --> 00:49:42,910
Little lady Macklin.

236
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:47,398
I want you to know
what I'm going to name the baby.

237
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:50,263
And what's that?

238
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:53,955
I want you to guess.

239
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:55,889
I do not want to play
a game, Emma.

240
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,548
Three guesses
for if it's a girl.

241
00:50:01,895 --> 00:50:02,895
Mary?

242
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:05,484
- No.
- Sarah?

243
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:07,141
Mnm-mnm.

244
00:50:07,142 --> 00:50:08,729
Do you want a hint?

245
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,391
It's one of two names
in this room.

246
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:17,773
Emma.

247
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,844
Elizabeth.

248
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:22,639
Why?

249
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,093
Because you have been such
a strong person.

250
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:31,062
I would not have survived
without you.

251
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:40,658
Three guesses for if it's a boy.

252
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:45,075
Gideon.

253
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,077
No.

254
00:50:51,324 --> 00:50:52,325
Samuel?

255
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:56,225
Lizzy, I'm not a monster.

256
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,195
One more guess.

257
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:02,920
No hints this time?

258
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:04,854
I don't think you need one.

259
00:51:11,723 --> 00:51:13,829
- Isaac.
- Yes.

260
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:18,315
Why?

261
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:20,594
You know why.

262
00:51:22,976 --> 00:51:27,152
Mesimer,
prince of pestilence.

263
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:31,502
Succorbenoth,
bringer of jealous thoughts.

264
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,508
Mara, damner of souls.

265
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:41,063
Babael..

266
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:44,860
...keeper of graves.

267
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:54,239
For I have never,
not in my entire life

268
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,724
seen anything like this land.

269
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:59,244
The wind never stops.

270
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:01,522
Gideon has barely been able
to do his part

271
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:03,558
in making this place livable.

272
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:07,252
My only comfort is the time
I get to spend with Isaac.

273
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:10,393
He puts in extra hours
in the long days here

274
00:53:10,394 --> 00:53:12,360
away from Lizzy.

275
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:15,191
I am pregnant. I know it.

276
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,710
I can feel it inside of me.

277
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:19,023
Our baby.

278
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:41,941
Succorbenoth,
bringer of jealous thoughts.

279
00:53:41,942 --> 00:53:44,220
Babael, keeper of graves.

280
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,808
Abbadon, the destroyer.

281
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,432
Mesimer, prince of pestilence.

282
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:52,367
Mara, damner of souls..

283
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:20,187
Isaac..

284
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:23,500
...I'm scared.

285
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:25,191
You're doing fine.

286
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:26,400
I wanna die.

287
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:52,944
It's a boy.

288
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:55,119
It's a boy.

289
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:09,685
Why isn't the baby crying?

290
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:17,831
Why isn't the baby crying?

291
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,835
Isaac?

292
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:28,808
- Isaac, why isn't..
- You stay right there, Lizzy.

293
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:32,501
He should be crying.

294
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:15,233
Samuel.

295
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:20,860
It's a good name, Lizzy.

296
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,430
He'll use it
more than I will.

297
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:43,095
I.. I am so sorry.

298
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:44,477
Reverend.

299
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,592
I do beg pardon.

300
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:01,080
I haven't had much in the way
of real food for weeks.

301
01:00:08,535 --> 01:00:10,952
You out here alone?

302
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:17,027
I came across an empty cabin
about a mile east of here.

303
01:00:18,304 --> 01:00:19,339
Kin?

304
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:22,341
No.

305
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:28,901
Well, I've been traveling
a while..

306
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:32,732
...spreadin' the word of God.

307
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:37,150
I don't suspect
God has much business out here.

308
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:44,399
No longer a God-fearing woman,
hmm?

309
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:10,769
Mrs. Macklin,
thank you so much.

310
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,980
You have been
more than hospitable.

311
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:17,155
You shouldn't be out at night.

312
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:20,228
The Harper cabin is empty
and you'll be comfortable there.

313
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:22,851
You can head out in the morning.

314
01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:27,338
You and your family..

315
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:30,238
...will be in my prayers.

316
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:35,449
Reverend, don't answer the door
for anyone..

317
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,796
...not after dark.

318
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,419
Not even for me.

319
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:45,252
Goodnight.

320
01:01:45,253 --> 01:01:46,599
Goodnight.

321
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:31,230
Mrs. Macklin?
There's something out here. Please!

322
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:34,784
Quick! Mrs. Macklin!

323
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:37,304
Mrs. Macklin, quick!

324
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:40,479
There's somethin' out here,
please!

325
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,447
Move to the window
so I can see you.

326
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:43,760
Alright.

327
01:02:49,524 --> 01:02:51,732
Inside, quickly!

328
01:02:57,843 --> 01:03:00,949
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

329
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:08,508
What is that thing?

330
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:12,857
I don't know.

331
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:15,067
It's been here
for as long as we have.

332
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:18,587
Why did you stay?

333
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:22,314
My husband doesn't believe me.

334
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:24,386
He... he hasn't seen it?

335
01:03:26,285 --> 01:03:28,873
But sure he..
When Emma saw it..

336
01:03:35,052 --> 01:03:36,329
Oh, no.

337
01:03:41,024 --> 01:03:42,715
I've said too much.

338
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:47,927
Pity.

339
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:53,588
I was havin' such a good time!

340
01:07:59,282 --> 01:08:01,284
Oh, hey, Lizzy!

341
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,601
Lizzy?

342
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,264
Lizzy?

343
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:23,375
It's me.

344
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:26,031
It's me.

345
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,590
Hey.

346
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:36,767
Look at me. It's alright.

347
01:08:39,563 --> 01:08:41,116
It's alright.

348
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,980
Okay. It's alright.

349
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:45,810
Hey.

350
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:48,676
What happened? You hurt?

351
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:55,338
I saw the reverend
on the way home.

352
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,170
He said you were
very hospitable.

353
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:04,484
No.

354
01:09:17,705 --> 01:09:18,913
Hey.

355
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:23,434
Lizzy?

356
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:38,648
You should have woke me.

357
01:10:43,135 --> 01:10:46,000
That is probably the longest
sleep you've had in a while.

358
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,696
All the men are gone, but, uh..

359
01:10:54,353 --> 01:10:55,906
...I brought you something.

360
01:11:20,586 --> 01:11:23,140
Good Lord, Lizzy,
you've gone pale.

361
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,872
I just wasn't expecting
to see anything of theirs again.

362
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:34,013
They're just books.

363
01:11:38,742 --> 01:11:39,881
Besides..

364
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:43,437
...they'll help us pass
the winter.

365
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,750
Occupy our minds.

366
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,236
Occupy my mind?

367
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,345
Let's get it inside.

368
01:12:06,252 --> 01:12:09,807
"I demand a creature
of another sex

369
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:12,775
"but as hideous as myself.

370
01:12:12,776 --> 01:12:16,123
"It is true
we shall be monsters

371
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:19,126
"cut off from all the world.

372
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,956
"But on that account

373
01:12:20,957 --> 01:12:23,615
"we shall be more attached
to one another.

374
01:12:26,065 --> 01:12:29,689
"Our lives will not be happy..

375
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,553
"...but they will be harmless

376
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:35,074
"and free from the misery
I now feel.

377
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:38,353
"Oh, my creator, make me happy.

378
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:43,323
"Let me feel gratitude
towards you for one benefit.

379
01:12:43,324 --> 01:12:45,808
"Let me see that I excite
the sympathy

380
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:48,225
of some existing thing.."

381
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:09,823
Oh, it's getting cold.

382
01:14:09,824 --> 01:14:12,137
Maybe you should pull out
the extra blankets.

383
01:14:16,624 --> 01:14:19,039
I burned this.

384
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,112
- It was Emma's.
- She was reading this?

385
01:14:23,113 --> 01:14:25,322
She was seeing something.

386
01:14:31,156 --> 01:14:32,502
Lizzy..

387
01:14:35,332 --> 01:14:37,541
- There is something out there.
- Enough.

388
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:39,163
Just enough. Enough.

389
01:14:39,164 --> 01:14:40,578
I really thought
we were past this.

390
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:43,270
Nothing, nothing good can come

391
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:44,894
from reading this nonsense.

392
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,034
Look what happened
to Emma, she took

393
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:50,657
her own life,
for Christ's sake!

394
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:52,660
I'm not so sure she did.

395
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:59,805
No, Lizzy.

396
01:15:05,086 --> 01:15:07,122
You really shouldn't be out
after dark.

397
01:15:07,123 --> 01:15:09,607
Y... you don't know
what's out there.

398
01:15:09,608 --> 01:15:12,577
There is nothing out there!

399
01:15:14,026 --> 01:15:16,269
Oh, God. Isaac, please!

400
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,512
Where's your gun, Lizzy?

401
01:17:39,344 --> 01:17:40,863
Isaac.

402
01:17:45,281 --> 01:17:47,076
How long have you had this?

403
01:17:55,153 --> 01:17:57,086
It's not safe here.

404
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,921
Isaac.

405
01:18:08,925 --> 01:18:11,271
Isaac, we have to leave.

406
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:13,033
We have to get out.

407
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:17,693
How did she get your gun, Lizzy?

408
01:18:19,315 --> 01:18:21,419
It doesn't matter.

409
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:24,388
- Emma?
- Lizzy!

410
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,600
Isaac, I don't care
what happened.

411
01:18:31,603 --> 01:18:33,604
- We need to go home.
- I told Gideon.

412
01:18:33,605 --> 01:18:35,468
I told Gideon
that he should leave

413
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:37,402
and that he
shouldn't come back.

414
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,369
What did you do?

415
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:44,339
Isaac... please untie me.

416
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:47,618
You don't understand
what's happening..

417
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:49,827
...but I do, I've seen it.

418
01:18:51,796 --> 01:18:54,521
Isaac! Please untie me!

419
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:58,249
- She was pregnant.
- Oh, God, no.

420
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,530
It's just gonna be me,
you, Isaac..

421
01:19:04,498 --> 01:19:07,327
- You killed her.
- No. It wasn't me.

422
01:19:07,328 --> 01:19:08,744
It was.

423
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:38,704
Isaac.

424
01:19:42,122 --> 01:19:43,537
There's something here.

425
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:50,578
Lizzy!

426
01:19:56,343 --> 01:19:58,171
It's right there.

427
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:00,035
There is nothing!

428
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:01,209
Lizzy.

429
01:20:03,764 --> 01:20:04,903
No.

430
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:36,614
Good morning.

431
01:21:36,615 --> 01:21:38,478
Morning, reverend.

432
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:39,895
How was your journey?

433
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,070
Fine. Thank you.

434
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:46,279
I have something for you.

435
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,903
I came prepared.

436
01:21:49,283 --> 01:21:51,596
You can never be too prepared.

437
01:21:52,873 --> 01:21:55,806
The Lord's blessing
be with you.

438
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:57,326
And with you.

439
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,723
There's something out there.

440
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,488
There is nothing out there.

441
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,733
This land, there's something
wrong with it.

442
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,222
Your mind is looking for
things to worry about.

443
01:22:33,155 --> 01:22:34,742
First baby and all.

444
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:46,927
It's just you and me.

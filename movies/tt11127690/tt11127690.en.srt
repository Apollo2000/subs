3
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,040
We didn't see it coming.

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,800
It's okay. What's your name?

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,440
- Andrea.
- Andrea. Does your arm hurt?

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,680
Hello.

7
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,720
Hi. Try to stay calm. We're here to help.
We're gonna get you out.

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Slowly.

9
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
One, two, three.

10
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
And up.

11
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,000
That's it. There.

12
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,800
Help!

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Help me, please! Help me!

14
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to work.

15
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,880
- Honey, can you stop for a second? Listen.
- Vane.

16
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
What is it?

17
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,240
- Can you hang up the washing?
- Sure.

18
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,600
But give me a kiss. You look good.

19
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Come here.

20
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
Yes, I'm leaving now.

21
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
Okay, perfect.

22
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,800
Bye, thanks.

23
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,080
Kiko, hey. How are you today?

24
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,960
Kiko, come on. Here, come on.

25
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,120
That's why in Mexico they say,
"First name Tequila, last name Mescal."

26
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,120
Because tequila is a type of mescal.

27
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,880
Tequila is made from agave...

28
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,200
That's the plant
you make mescal and tequila from.

29
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,000
But for tequila you use blue agave.

30
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,320
The agave heart goes into an oven,
packed with other agave hearts.

31
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,320
That dries it out.

32
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,560
You use the oven to dry it,
then you crush it and distill it.

33
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,000
Distilling is when you separate
the pulp and the juice.

34
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,680
You heat the liquid to get sugar,
and what do you get from sugar?

35
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Alcohol.

36
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,640
The alcohol in spirits
always comes from sugar.

37
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,400
For example, whiskey comes from barley.
It's the same...

38
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,800
<i>- Yankee 715, do you copy?</i>
- Go ahead.

39
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,000
<i>Unconscious female, possible code 3-0,

40
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,200
Okay, copy that.

41
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi.

42
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
She's dead.

43
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Yes, David?

44
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,080
This is 715. We have a body.

45
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,680
Five hundred.

46
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,320
I won't pay more than 200 for this shit.

47
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,920
Where did you get these?

48
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,560
My grandma gave me them.

49
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,600
Two hundred fifty, but I keep the ring.

50
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Damn dog.

51
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
What's wrong?

52
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,400
I stepped in shit from Vicente's dog.

53
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,920
Vicente is disgusting.
Hi, my love.

54
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,040
- Aren't you gonna reply?
- It's not important. I can reply later.

55
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,240
I don't get why you're not replying.

56
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,960
You want me to reply now?

57
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,840
Fine, I'll reply.

58
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Reply if you want to. I don't care.

59
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,840
My period came.

60
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,120
Maybe you should see a gynecologist.

61
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
Maybe the problem isn't with me.

62
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,360
It could be psychosomatic.

63
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,480
Maybe you're not getting pregnant
because you don't want to.

64
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
I have to go.

65
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,400
Vane, wait.

66
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,159
Wait, I'm sorry.

67
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Listen.

68
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,240
I've had a shitty day.

69
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,640
Look, I'll do the fertility test.

70
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,040
You'll see, my sperm are...

71
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
world class.

72
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
You want some now?

73
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,360
- A little bit.
- No, they're waiting for me.

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,720
A quickie. Look, I'm hard already.
Just quickly.

75
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
- I'm on my period.
- You know I don't care.

76
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Ángel, stop!

77
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,040
Don't get mad. It's no big deal.

78
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
I wanted some affection, that's all.

79
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Okay.

80
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm sorry.

81
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
It's fine.

82
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,720
- See you later.
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

83
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Shut up!

84
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Shut up!

85
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Ángel Hernández?

86
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Please come in.

87
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,800
The results show
that your sperm count is low.

88
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Most of them show poor motility,

89
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,560
which means they can't reach the egg
to fertilize it.

90
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,520
Most of them?

91
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
We're talking about 97%, Ángel.

92
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
It's known as asthenospermia.

93
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
There must be some mistake.

94
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,320
In cases like yours, assisted reproduction
has a fairly high success rate.

95
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
You know...

96
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,280
we should try more often.

97
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,040
How about a weekend away?

98
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,640
I'd love to,

99
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,520
but I have to study.

100
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,520
The exam's coming up.

101
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,600
What exam is it?

102
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
Canine psychology.

103
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,680
Canine psychology?

104
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,400
That's pointless.
Animals don't have feelings.

105
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,400
You're the one with no feelings.

106
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,280
I'm gonna take a shower.

107
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,200
ROBERTO FROM CLASS

108
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

109
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
Wait for it to go green.

110
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,960
- Which one is this?
- A hybrid.

111
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Now.

112
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,400
It's good because there's no smell.

113
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,320
<i>715, do you copy?</i>

114
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Damn it.

115
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
<i>...car with one code 3-32 and one 3-27.</i>

116
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Is he alive or not?

117
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
Is he alive or not?

118
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
- Calm down.
- Tell me if he's alive.

119
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,960
He's in shock. He's distressed.
Can you take him?

120
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,160
- It's okay.
- One, two, three, four.

121
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,360
One, two, three, four.

122
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,440
He's lost consciousness.

123
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,400
- Everything okay?
- He's having convulsions.

124
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,560
You're leaving already?

125
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,520
Yes. It's 9:30.

126
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,400
Can I get you anything?

127
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,480
Can you bring the pills over?

128
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,160
Can you pass me the remote?

129
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Yes?

130
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Yes, I'm leaving.

131
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Okay, great.

132
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
Yes, see you later. Thanks.

133
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Who was it?

134
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,200
Roberto. He's a classmate.

135
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Right, Roberto.

136
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,680
So, you're good friends?

137
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,280
We're classmates.

138
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
He takes notes for me when I'm not there.
That's it.

139
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,280
That's why you get so dressed up to study?
Roberto's good-looking?

140
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Ángel.

141
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,000
- Don't start.
- Start what?

142
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Honey.

143
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,320
Get some rest.

144
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,720
<i>Spying on someone has never been so easy.</i>

145

150

<i>Want to know if your partner

151
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Where's Pedro?

152
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,040
He's on leave. Why?

153
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Is it a problem?

154
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
No, this is much better. You're prettier.

155
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
Oh, isn't that nice.

156
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,120
You can take me out dancing sometime.

157
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,360
We're done.
Do you have a cleaning cloth?

158
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,560
Yes. Can you pass him a cloth, Vane?

159
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,360
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

160
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,680
- Hi.
- Come in.

161
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Thanks.

162
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,360
How are things?

163
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,880
How about you?

164
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,280
Hanging in there.

165
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Hi, Ángel.

166
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
How are you?

167
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
Fucking great, how do you think?

168
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
You're okay, right?

169
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,160
Yes, all things considered.

170
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,360
You've got to be strong
at times like this, right?

171
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
You can't give up, ever.

172
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,400
"You can't give up."

173
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,560
What the hell were you thinking
when you were driving the ambulance?

174
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,880
No, it wasn't my fault. No.

175
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,120
Oh, come on.

176
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,080
All you had to do was drive the fucking
ambulance

177
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
without crashing.

178
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,720
All done.

179
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
- We'll start taking our things down.
- Okay, take them down now, please.

180
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,320
- Bye.
- Thanks.

181
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Thanks.

182
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I'll go too.

183
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
- I don't know why the hell you came.
- Ángel, stop.

184
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,680
I'm so sorry, really.

185
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Sure you are.

186
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
Why don't you study at home?

187
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,680
We're doing a group project.

188
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,640
Hey, can you go downstairs
and get me some ice cream?

189
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,400
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

190
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,400
INSTALLING

191
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Thanks.

192
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,840
Have fun.

193
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Thanks.

194
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

195
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
Hello, Ángel.

196
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,560
Come on, let's go.

197
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Quite the barker at night, isn't he?

198
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,840
Yes, he barks when he's alone.

199
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,160
I often visit my wife
at the hospital at night.

200
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Right.

201
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,600
And... sorry.

202
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,640
Come on, give me the chair.

203
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,680
You have one more to go.

204
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,240
- This is pointless. Give me the chair.
- Ángel, do the last one.

205
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
Give me the fucking chair.

206
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,480
You want the chair?

207
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,880
Yes, I want the chair.

208
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,760
Here you go.

209
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,200
If you want it,
you know what you have to do.

210
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,360
You're enjoying this.

211
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
You like torturing your patients,
don't you?

212
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
I love it.

213
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Especially you.

214
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Turn around.

215
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Turn around?

216
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Ta-da.

217
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
You smell good.

218
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,680
I told you you could do it.

219
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
Okay, time to rest.

220
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,720
Noodle soup again?

221
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,160
It was on special.

222
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,360
Can you pass me a spoon?

223
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Yes.

224
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Thanks.

225
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,800
Sandra thinks I'm improving.

226
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
She said I'm making good progress,
and I could get some feeling back.

227
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
That's great.

228
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,920
You don't seem happy.
Something wrong?

229
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Of course I am.

230
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
What's wrong?

231
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,640
I've been offered a work placement
at a vet's.

232
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,720
Do you have time for that?

233
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,040
I thought I could ask to work
part-time at the call center.

234
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
And what would we live on?

235
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,760
I don't know, Ángel.

236
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
"I don't know."

237
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,880
You want to leave your job for this,
and you don't know what we'll live on.

238
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,720
I can't do everything.

239
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,760
You can't do everything?
So it's my fault.

240
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,040
I didn't say that.

241
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,640
So what will we live on?
My shitty disability payments?

242
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,680
Are you aware of everything I do for you?

243
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,320
What you do for me?
What about everything I've done for you?

244
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
You know what, just go look after
the animals at the fucking vet's.

245
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,040
- Don't start, please.
- I'll start if I want to.

246
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,280
<i>This offer is 45 euros per month,
including taxes.</i>

247
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,040
<i>You said your name is Vanesa, right?</i>

248
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,680
<i>That's a very pretty name.</i>

249
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,040
<i>As I said, this offer</i>

250
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,520
<i>has the same advantages
as your previous package.</i>

251
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,240
<i>For example,
it includes international calls.</i>

252
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,760
<i>Excuse me. I don't mean to bother you,
Vanesa. Where are you from?</i>

253
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
<i>I'm French.</i>

254
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,160
<i>Sir, I'm not allowed
to have personal conversations.</i>

255
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>Would you like me to change your package?</i>

256
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Shit.

257
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,160
<i>Hi, this is Vane. Please leave a message.</i>

258
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
Kiko, no, not in there.

259
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,760
Hey, beautiful.

260
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Come here.

261
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,240
It's okay.

262
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Come on, here.

263
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,600
Have a good day, Vane.

264
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,160
You too, Vicente.

265
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Morning.

266
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
Didn't you get my messages?

267
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,360
No. Did you call?

268
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,560
All night.

269
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,720
So, why was your phone off?

270
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,520
I ran out of battery.

271
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm in serious pain
and you left me with no painkillers.

272
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,360
- There's a bottle in the cupboard.
- I looked everywhere.

273
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,080
What do you mean? I left them here.

274
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,040
I'm telling you they're not there.

275
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,280
How could you forget
something so important?

276
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,320
I'm sure I left them here.

277
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,880
Well, they're not there,
and I had a terrible night.

278
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,480
I don't understand.

279
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm sorry, honey.

280
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm sorry?

281
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm the sorry one.

282
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,760
I'm in unbearable pain.

283
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Sorry.

284
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
I'll get some more right now.

285
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Good.

286
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,400
<i>I can't take it anymore.
I'm going crazy.</i>

287
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,440
<i>I'm sure I left the pills there.</i>

288
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,760
<i>I never liked Ángel.</i>

289
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,560
<i>You have to get out of there.</i>

290
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,720
<i>I can't leave him now.</i>

291
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,400
<i>Vane, you have to leave him.</i>

292
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,960
<i>I don't know what to do. It's such a mess.</i>

293
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,040
<i>He's abusing you.</i>

294
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Hi.

295
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
How did it go?

296
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,040
What's going on?

297
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,760
It's your favorite meal.

298
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Padrón peppers and roasted salmon fillets.

299
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
That's great.

300
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,040
Put on that dress I gave you.

301
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,600
Tonight is a special night, my love.

302
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,480
You look amazing.

303
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,360
Whoa.

304
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Cheers.

305
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Go on, try it.

306
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Very good.

307
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
I'm glad.

308
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,760
Today is a fresh start, Vane.

309
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm going to fight to get better.

310
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,920
I'm going to make you happy, I promise.

311
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Ángel...

312
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,800
You don't have to say anything.

313
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm so grateful
for everything you do for me.

314
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,360
We'll refurbish my grandma's room
so you have somewhere to study.

315
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,400
You've got to do
that work placement at the vet's.

316
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,560
I know this has been really hard for you.

317
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,400
Yes.

318
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,240
I'm getting used to this new situation.

319
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
My love...

320
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,960
I made an appointment
at the fertility clinic.

321
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,640
We're gonna have this baby
we've been trying for.

322
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,120
Hey, it's kicking in.

323
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,560
No, leave the dress on.

324
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,320
I can't feel anything.

325
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,160
Should I stop?

326
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,640
Vane, can you bring me a towel?

327
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Vane!

328
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,080
MONTHS LATER

329
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,760
Celebrate Christmas
with the best chicken in town.

330
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,560

It's Arturo García, from Jaime I.
From elementary school.

348

It's been ages.

You moved the Cocoa Krispies

Where have you been all this time?

354
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,800
Why? Did you miss me?

355
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Okay.

356
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,680
Roll your body to the right.

357
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,800
Very good. Try to roll back.

358
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Good.

359
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,800
Roll to the left.

360
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,440
Good.

361
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Go ahead.

362
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,320
- No, you go.
- I'm not in a hurry.

363

You go first.

364

- Go on.
- You go.

Go.

Stop here.

<i>China notified the WHO...</i>

379

<i>...unknown. Of the 44 documented cases,
11 patients are seriously ill,</i>

<i>while the other 33 patients
are in stable condition.</i>

381
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,440
<i>According to information
from Chinese media,</i>

382
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,960
<i>the cause could be a virus that originated
in a live animal market in Wuhan.</i>

383
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,840
<i>It's feared this could be
a respiratory virus similar to SARS,</i>

Morphine.

387
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,600
I'm in a lot of pain. I need anesthetics.

388
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,120
I'm risking my neck doing this.

389
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Vane.

390
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,880
What are you doing here?

391
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,160
I wanted to see you.

392
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,720
I haven't heard from you since you left.

393
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,320
It's best if we don't see each other.

394
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,640
I know. I'm sorry.
I needed to know how you are.

395
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,320
I'm fine, thanks,
but please stop this.

396
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,720
Just a second, please.

397
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
Ángel.

398
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,120
Don't follow me.

399
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,920
I don't want to bother you.

400
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,400
I just want to say goodbye.

401
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,240
You did the right thing, leaving me.

402
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,480
You deserve better.

403
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,720
And I just can't face carrying on.

404
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,720
I promise you'll never see me again.

405
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,720
Goodbye, Vane.

406
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,200
Ángel, wait.

407
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,200
I'll walk with you, if you like.

408
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,640
Are you sure?

409
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
It's fine.

410
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,880
So, how are you doing?

411
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,880
Good.

412
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,680
I'm doing the work placement at the vet's.

413
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,080
I told you.

414
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,920
Thanks for walking with me.

415
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,360
Well... I'm going to go.

416
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,120
I put your things in a box.

417
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,320
You can come get them, if you like.
I found your passport too.

418
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Come in.

419
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,120
Don't you have a cleaner?

420
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,160
The antidepressants
leave me without any energy.

421
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,520
I'll give you the number of an agency.

422
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,480
Why don't you stay for a while?
I'll make some tea.

423
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,680
I have to go.

424
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,120
Thanks.

425
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,800
You've forgotten me already, right?

426
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,640
Are you seeing someone?

427
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,920
You need help.

428
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,400
Where are my things?

429
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,440
In my grandma's room.

430
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,880
Next to the bed.

431
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,680
Over there.

432
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,920
Fuck!

433
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,080
What did you do?

434
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,600
What are you doing? What are...

435
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,720
Good morning.

436
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Get some rest?

437
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,040
Don't scream, Vane.

438
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,120
<i>I'll never be able to forget you.</i>

439
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,080
<i>Because you taught me to love.</i>

440
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,960
<i>With a sip of champagne.</i>

441
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,000
<i>Making a toast to new love.</i>

442
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,600
<i>The soft light in that spot.</i>

443
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,440
<i>Made my heart beat.</i>

444
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,600
<i>It's so easy to remember.</i>

445
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,280
<i>Vane, where are you?</i>

446
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,360
<i>I've been calling. I can't find you.</i>

447
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,280
<i>With a sip of champagne.</i>

448
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,160
<i>Making a toast...</i>

449
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,280
RICARDO, I'M SORRY.
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS BABY.

450
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,360
I NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU.

451
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:02,880
<i>...I kissed you.</i>

452
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,480
<i>I fell in love.</i>

453
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,960
<i>With your gaze.</i>

454
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,520
<i>With a sip of champagne.</i>

455
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,240
<i>Making a toast to new love.</i>

456
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,120
<i>The soft light in that spot.</i>

457
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,360
<i>Made my heart beat.</i>

458
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,680
Will you stop screaming?

459
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,560
I'm really happy
you're back home again.

460
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,240
I saw Ricardo today.

461
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,520
He says hi.

462
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,880
He told me you're having a baby together.

463
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Congratulations.

464
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,840
Untie me, Ángel.

465
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,800
Help!

466
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,240
Help!

467
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,840
Help!

468
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,440
We won't need this
once you learn to behave.

469
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Who is it?

470
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,520
It's Vicente.

471
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
What do you want?

472
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,040
Could you open the door, please?

473
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,800
What do you want? I'm busy.

474
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Coming!

475
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,360
What is it?

476
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,920
There was music playing all day yesterday.

477
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,240
It sounded like a nightclub.

478
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,720
I didn't sleep for months
because of your dog.

479
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,160
I play music one time
and you come and complain?

480
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,120
I've apologized for that, Ángel.

481
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,440
I was visiting my wife at the hospital,
and I couldn't take him.

482
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,480
But my wife passed away.

483
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,200
And so did my dog.

484
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,960
Well...

485
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,360
he was killed.

486
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Well, I'm sorry.

487
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,680
Wait. By the way, is Vanesa alright?

488
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,800
Vanesa left me months ago.

489
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,200
It's just...

490
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,520
I heard screaming.

491
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,800
It must have been another apartment.

492
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,720
I haven't seen Vane for ages.

493
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,920
But... I saw you come in together
the other day.

494
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,200
She came to get her things.

495
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
Look, Ángel.

496
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,720
I know the screaming came from here.

497
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,840
I heard it through the back window.

498
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,920
Okay.

499
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,720
Hang on.

500
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,560
Wait.

501
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,840
I'd prefer
not to have to explain this, but...

502
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,600
I'm with an escort.

503
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,320
You know, a prostitute.

504
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,080
How else could I be with a girl, Vicente?

505
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh, I see.

506
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
Well...

507
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Please don't play music so loudly.

508
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,080
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

509
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,480
You're very serious.

510
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Everything okay?

511
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,880
Better than ever.

512
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,520
My girlfriend and I are having a baby.

513
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,600
Really?

514
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Congratulations!

515
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,680
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

516
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,240
Are you still single?

517
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,920
Yes.

518
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,800
Don't you want to have kids?

519
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,200
Well, yes, but I'm not in a rush.

520
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,560
Have you thought about freezing your eggs?

521
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,120
Don't be silly. I'm 35. I'm still young.

522
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,160
Not that young.

523
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,120
I have friends your age who needed IVF.

524
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,160
I'd hurry up. The clock's ticking, Sandra.

525
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Ángel.

526
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,280
I need to talk to you.

527
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,600
What are you doing here?

528
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,480
Looking for Vane.

529
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,760
She's missing. Do you know anything?

530
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,760
I haven't seen her for months.
What do you mean, missing?

531
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,360
Well... Vane and I are together.

532
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,280
We've been going out for a while.
We fell in love.

533
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,920
We wanted to tell you,
but we didn't want to hurt you.

534
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,360
I don't know. I can't find her anywhere.

535
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,760
I'm worried.

536
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,200
Are you okay?

537
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,160
Yes, but my gut's blocked.
I have an operation on Tuesday.

538
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,400
I'm really sorry.

539
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,880
Do you mind if I go?

540
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,320
Sure.

541
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,440
Let me know if you hear anything. Please.

542
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,680
You should use the bathroom.
A shower will help.

543
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Come on.

544
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,240
What have you done to me?

545
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,280
- What have you done to me?
- Relax, it's only temporary.

546
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,320
What have you done?

547
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,520
It's just an epidural.

548
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,680
You're sick.

549
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,120
What do you want to listen to today?

550
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
This one.

551
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,160
You loved this.

552
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,800
<i>The blue sky above us could collapse.</i>

553
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:10,400
<i>And the ground could cave in.</i>

554
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:17,240
<i>Little matters if you love me.</i>

555
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,040
<i>I couldn't care about the whole world.</i>

556
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:31,440
<i>As long as love fills my mornings.</i>

557
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,920
<i>As long as my body trembles at your touch.</i>

558
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:44,840
<i>There are no problems that matter to me.</i>

559
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,680
<i>My love.</i>

560
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:55,760
<i>Because you love me.</i>

561
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,920
<i>Hi, Ángel.</i>

562
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,360
<i>You won't answer my calls.
I still haven't heard from Vane.</i>

563
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,600
<i>Are you sure you haven't heard from her?
I'm worried.</i>

564
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,720
<i>Please, if you know something,
let me know.</i>

565
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,880
<i>Ángel, I keep calling,
and you won't pick up. What's going on?</i>

566
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,320
<i>I need Vane to show up now.
I'm going to call the police.</i>

567
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,760
<i>Answer my calls, please.
Pick up the phone.</i>

568
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,920
Delicious.

569
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,920
If it's a boy,
I thought we could call him Ángel.

570
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,600
What do you think?

571
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If it's a girl, you can choose the name.

572
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,040
Would you like some wine?

573
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,120
Just a drop.
You shouldn't drink in your condition.

574
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,720
There you go.

575
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,600
It isn't easy to forgive you.

576
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,120
I swear that I'm really trying.

577
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,880
You should see me at physical therapy.

578
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,120
Sandra and I have
a very special relationship.

579
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,560
Don't be jealous.

580
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,640
No!

581
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,800
Help!

582
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,920
Help!

583
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,080
Help!

584
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,840
Help!

585
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,920
Help!

586
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,520
Help me!

587
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,320
Help!

588
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,400
Help!

589
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,000
Open the door!

590
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,640
I'm calling the police.

591
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,800
Coming!

592
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,480
- What is it?
- I'm calling the police.

593
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,080
I heard noises and a woman shouting.
I'm sure it was Vanesa.

594
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,080
- Vanesa isn't here. No one is.
- What happened to your head?

595
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,800
I'm calling the police.

596
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,880
Fine, come in.

597
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,520
Come and look.

598
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,560
Vane, dear.

599
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,240
What has he done to you?

600
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,880
I'm calling the police.

601
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,880
What are you doing?

602
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,880
You're...

603
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,280
You're crazy.

604
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,920
Fermín.

605
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,680
Come to my place now. I need you.

606
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,840
I'm telling you to come now.

607
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
Take it.

608
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,680
Now let's clean this up.

609
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:53,279
Yes?

610
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,160
Can you open the door, please?

611
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,320
Who is it?

612
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
The police.

613
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,320
Coming.

614
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,960
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

615
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,280
Are you Ángel Hernández?

616
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,360
Yes.

617
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,160
- Can we ask you some questions?
- Sure.

618
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,440
Come in, please.

619
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,200
This won't take a moment.

620
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,480
Were you involved with Vanesa François?

621
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,560
Yes.

622
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,760
Did you live together?

623
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,480
We used to live together,
but not anymore.

624
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,800
Do you know Ricardo Martín?

625
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,480
He was a colleague of mine. Why?

626
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,040
<i>Police. How can I help you?</i>

627
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,720
<i>Yes, I'd like to report a missing person.</i>

628
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,560
<i>Who is missing?</i>

629
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,840
<i>My girlfriend.</i>

630
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,800
<i>When did she disappear?</i>

631
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,960
<i>I haven't heard from her since yesterday.</i>

632
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,800
<i>Did she leave any note or...</i>

633
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,240
She sent a text message,
but I'm sure she didn't write it.

634
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,200
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

635
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,320
<i>What number was it sent from?</i>

636
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,960
It was sent from her phone,
but I'm sure she didn't write it.

637
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,240
<i>Okay. How do you know for sure?</i>

638
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,600
Because we're expecting a baby, okay?

639
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,160
Do you understand?

640
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,080
We're expecting a baby.
She wouldn't just leave without warning.

641
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,760
Please, I'm asking you to find her.

642
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,000
When did you see him last?

643
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,800
I haven't heard from him in months.

644
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,840
When was the last time you saw Vanesa?

645
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,360
She came to say goodbye a week ago.

646
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,120
To say goodbye?

647
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,880
Yes, she said she was leaving,
going back to France.

648
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,680
Did you know Vanesa and Ricardo
were in a relationship?

649
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,360
Yes.

650
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,240
I was happy for them.

651
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,040
Easy.

652
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,360
It'll all be over soon.

653
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,480
Don't worry about the baby.
I'll take care of him.

654
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,360
It's for the neuropathic pain.

655
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,760
Of course.

656
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,720
That's everything, Mr. Hernández.
You've been very helpful.

657
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,160
You're welcome.

658
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,960
Vane, wake up.

659
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,320
You spend all day sleeping.

660
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,680
Ángel.

661
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,400
You can't keep me here like this.

662
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,000
You'll kill us both.

663
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,320
Me and the baby.

664
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,760
Open your mouth.

665
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,680
Vane, hurry up. Lunch is ready.

666
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,320
I made a spinach omelet, for the iron.

667
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:06,520
Did you know that most birth defects
are linked to maternal nutrition?

668
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,280
No.

669
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,320
I didn't know that.

670
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Thanks.

671
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,200
Take a look over there.

672
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,560
It's lovely.

673
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,720
There's one other thing.

674
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,200
Will you marry me?

675
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,240
When I trust you, we'll get married.

676
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,640
Eat up.

677
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,040
Could you close the door, please?

678
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,800
Please.

679
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,840
Vane.

680
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,640
You're burning up.

681
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,560
Ángel...

682
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,600
We're going to lose the baby.

683
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,800
I'll go to the pharmacy.

684
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
No.

685
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,320
No!

686
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,240
Help!

687
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,120
Help me!

688
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,640
Get off me!

689
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,040
Bastard!

690
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,960
No! Stop!

691
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,400
Let me go!

692
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,600
Ángel.

693
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,920
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

694
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:56,880
Lucky guy.

695
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,520
Happy to see me?

696
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,240
From now on,

697
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,280
it'll be me that looks after you.

698
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:47,400
<i>I'll never be able to forget you.</i>

699
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,400
<i>Because you taught me to love.</i>

700
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:57,560
<i>With a sip of champagne.</i>

701
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:02,640
<i>Making a toast to new love.</i>

702
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:08,000
<i>The soft light in that spot.</i>

703
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:12,640
<i>Made my heart beat.</i>

704
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:18,880
<i>It's so easy to remember.</i>

705
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,920
<i>Every time I make a toast.</i>

706
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,200
<i>With a sip of champagne.</i>

707
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,080
<i>Making a toast to new love.</i>

708
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:39,320
<i>And that was when.</i>

709
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
<i>I kissed you.</i>

710
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,760
<i>I fell in love.</i>

711
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,200
<i>With your gaze.</i>

712
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:00,400
<i>With a sip of champagne.</i>

713
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:05,640
<i>Making a toast to new love.</i>

714
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:10,840
<i>The soft light in that spot.</i>

715
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,680
<i>Made my heart beat</i>

716
01:29:16,305 --> 01:30:16,672

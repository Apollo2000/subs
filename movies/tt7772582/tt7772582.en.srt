Are you okay?
You're not eating anything.

35
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,714
I told you
I wasn't feeling well.

36
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:48,121
Tell her how great she was.

37
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:49,890
It's kind of hard
to compliment someone

38
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:51,725
who's always in a foul mood.

39
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:52,993
It's a phase.

40
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,630
Keep telling yourself that.

41
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:58,867
You were really good.

42
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,739
- Mm.
- Tell her.

43
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:09,643
Your mother wants me
to tell you

44
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,680
how great you are.

45
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,484
Eat shit.

46
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,986
Can I have one?

47
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,023
What do you want today?

48
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,725
- Braid.
- Braid?

49
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:07,130
You got it.

50
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:19,173
Let's get your shirt on.

51
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,174
Up, up.

52
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:26,014
Are you feeling any better?

53
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,852
Not really.

54
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:33,820
Do you want me to call Dr. Pat?

55
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:35,755
No.

56
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,158
It's in her head.

57
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,095
She needs to get
her head checked.

58
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,932
All right, come on.

59
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:47,836
Jacket on.

60
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:52,038
- Let's go, let's go.
- Where's my arm?

61
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:37,218
Well, good morning.

62
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,253
- Morning.
- How can I help you?

63
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:42,789
Um, I wanted to know if I could
possibly take a test.

64
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,057
That's what we do.

65
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,959
That's what we're here for.

66
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,794
Uh, why don't you sign in,

67
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,063
take off your coat,
and have a seat.

68
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:51,833
Okay.

69
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,842
Yep.

70
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,917
- Hello?
- Hi.

71
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,355
Uh, we've got a girl
out here for a test.

72
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:16,923
Okay.

73
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:33,873
Autumn?

74
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,044
You ready?

75
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:45,018
Come on in
and make yourself at home.

76
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,057
You can just sit here, and...
and, uh, we'll talk for a bit.

77
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:59,400
What brings you here today?

78
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:02,836
I just haven't been feeling
that well lately.

79
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:04,904
I'm sorry to hear that.

80
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,141
How long has that
been going on?

81
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,609
A while.

82
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,945
And when was your last period?

83
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:14,080
I don't know exactly.

84
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:15,851
I'm kind of irregular.

85
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,852
How old are you?

86
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:21,089
Um, 17.

87
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,159
Does mom know you're here?

88
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,829
Uh, no. She's working.

89
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,897
Oh, I understand.

90
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,334
Uh, well, today,
we're going to be doing

91
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:35,636
a self-administered test.

92
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,338
But I want to let you
know something.

93
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,044
Even if it's negative,
it could still be positive.

94
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:45,446
What does that mean exactly?

95
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:49,216
Well, I mean, if it's negative,
you might want to redo the test

96
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:52,453
in a few weeks
if you're still concerned.

97
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:54,324
Okay.

98
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:36,062
So, just dip it in here.

99
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,932
Is that a test
from the supermarket?

100
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:40,267
Yes.

101
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,272
I told you it was
a self-administered test.

102
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,035
That looks like a positive.

103
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:20,374
Um, if it's positive,

104
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:23,144
is there any way
it could be negative?

105
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:24,478
No.

106
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,916
A positive is always
a positive.

107
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,948
Have a great day.

108
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,583
Hi. How are you?

109
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:00,661
- Just these? Card?
- Yeah.

110
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:02,663
- Hello.
- Hey.

111
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:05,401
- How are you doing today?
- Okay.

112
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:12,208
It looks suspiciously like
you are throwing a party.

113
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,676
Um, hey, you inviting yourself?

114
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:19,413
No, no, no,
just an observation.

115
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:21,749
- What, don't you like to party?
- Uh, no.

116
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,284
Sorry. That's not what I meant.

117
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:26,553
Well, what time
do you get off work?

118
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:27,821
Late.

119
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,723
How about if
I give you the address

120
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:31,727
if you change your mind?

121
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,298
Ten, 20, 30...

122
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,567
- 40, 50, 60...
- Wait, not at the same time.

123
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:42,571
- You'll mess me up.
- Sorry.

124
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:42,631
I saw you weren't
at school today.

125
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,334
I went to the doctor.

126
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:47,737
Are you okay?

127
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

128
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,574
What's wrong?

129
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,808
Girl problems.

130
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,543
Bad cramps?

131
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:57,780
Yeah.

132
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,814
I get those, too.

133
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,716
Pretty much burn through

134
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:04,818
a bottle of painkillers,
like, every month.

135
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,887
Yeah, same.

136
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,390
Don't you ever just wish
you were a dude?

137
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,394
All the time.

138
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,735
I like that thing.

139
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,772
Oh, thanks.

140
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:32,513
Hey.

141
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:33,814
Hey.

142
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:35,818
Sweetie.

143
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,465
Hey. Hi.

144
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,700
At least someone
in this house loves me.

145
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:54,768
Hey.

146
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,904
Hey, hey, hey.

147
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:58,507
Hey.

148
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:04,346
That's a girl.

149
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,918
Who's a good girl, hmm?

150
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:14,788
Yeah, you like that.

151
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,524
You little slut.

152
00:18:17,526 --> 00:18:19,793
- Who's a little slut?
- Stop.

153
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:21,831
What? She likes it.

154
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,532
That's a girl.

155
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,938
Look how easy she is.

156
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:18,454
Okay.

157
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:36,538
This is your beautiful baby.

158
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:42,478
You are about ten weeks along.

159
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:46,880
Hard to say precisely, but...

160
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:49,652
everything looks pretty normal.

161
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:54,554
And this...

162
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:57,658
is the most magical sound
you will ever hear.

163
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,997
Are you okay?

164
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:37,766
Yeah, I'm fine.

165
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,768
I know this is a lot
to take in,

166
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,872
but I'm sure once you have that
beautiful baby in your arms,

167
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:48,775
you'll forget
you ever had any doubts.

168
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:50,043
I know these things.

169
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:51,678
I'm a mother.

170
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,981
I just can't imagine that
for myself.

171
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,782
Well...

172
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,884
there are many wonderful people

173
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,887
who want children
and can't have them.

174
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:04,158
We can connect you
to an adoption agency.

175
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:08,564
I just don't know
what I want to do right now.

176
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,967
Are you abortion-minded?

177
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:16,705
Is that a possibility?

178
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:21,142
Do you have a minute?

179
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,512
Could I show you something?

180
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:46,967
The video you are about to see
unmasks the terrible truth

181
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:49,102
that abortion
is an act of violence

182
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:50,670
which kills a baby.

183
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,672
Some of the children
we'll show you

184
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:55,742
represent typical
nine- and ten-week abortions.

185
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:57,744
Because abortions
are never committed

186
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,080
prior to the sixth week
of pregnancy,

187
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,782
every child abortion kills

188
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:04,951
is already so fully formed
that her heart's beating

189
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:07,954
and her brain's producing
brain wave activity.

190
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:10,824
Many of the babies you'll see,
however, range in age

191
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:13,028
through the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy...

192
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,865
Here.

193
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:08,271
I'll put this in the bag
for you, if that's okay.

194
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,953
Hey. Are you okay?

195
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,396
Should I call your mom?

196
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
No, I'm okay now.

197
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:14,268
Are you sure?

198
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,038
Yeah.

199
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:20,408
What did the doctor say?

200
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,078
They couldn't really help me.

201
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,981
Why not?

202
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:30,353
I took a test.

203
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:34,390
Wh-What test?

204
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,143
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

205
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:58,978
Uh, my cousin isn't
feeling well.

206
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,381
What's wrong with her?

207
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:02,115
She has a stomach bug.

208
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:03,384
Okay.

209
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:05,686
I think I need
to take her home.

210
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:08,922
Well, she's on the schedule
for two more hours.

211
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:10,124
Can't she wait?

212
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:11,392
She can't.

213
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:14,961
It's really just
a few more hours.

214
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,166
I'd get lonely if you left.

215
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,066
I'll be fine.

216
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,003
There you go.

217
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,546
Hello?

218
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:34,381
Hi. It's Beth calling

219
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:36,417
from Ellensboro Women's Clinic.

220
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,385
Uh, hi.

221
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:41,455
Uh, I'd love to sit
with you more and talk.

222
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,257
Okay.

223
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,627
I'm wondering if you can
come back in later today.

224
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,595
Um, no, I'm really busy.

225
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:50,464
Of course.

226
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:52,700
Well, how about tomorrow?

227
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:54,468
Can I call you back?

228
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,670
- Now's not a really good time.
- Uh, no problem.

229
00:32:56,672 --> 00:32:59,373
Or I-I could try you again
in a little while.

230
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,344
- Either way.
- Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye.

231
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,872
I think we have to switch here.

232
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:33,407
Why?

233
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,277
I don't know why. We just do.

234
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:46,482
Hey.

235
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:49,585
Hey, excuse me.

236
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:57,459
Do you know what time
this bus gets in?

237
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:01,795
I don't know, like 2:00 p.m.

238
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:03,664
That's what I thought,
actually.

239
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,634
Cool.

240
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,837
You going to New York?

241
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,972
Yeah.

242
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:14,376
Freaking love New York.

243
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:18,745
It's kind of my favorite city.

244
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,781
Yeah, us, too.

245
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:22,549
Philly's cool and all...

246
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:23,917
you know, it's definitely
got history...

247
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:26,854
but New York, like,
I think because of the way

248
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,655
the city's s-set up
and everything,

249
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,424
you're forced to interact
with people

250
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:33,194
who are just nothing like you.

251
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:35,497
Kind of like this bus.

252
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,868
That's funny.

253
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:43,737
What are you doing there?

254
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,707
Seeing family and stuff.

255
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,576
Well, I mean, I know
you'll be pretty busy and all,

256
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:51,645
but, um...

257
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:54,648
by any chance,
do you girls like live music?

258
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,751
Uh, we're probably
gonna be, um, pretty busy.

259
00:35:57,753 --> 00:35:58,919
Yeah.

260
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:00,787
Yeah, I get it.

261
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,791
Sorry.

262
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:08,595
Well, if you give me your
number, I'll text you the info.

263
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:10,532
Maybe you'll change your mind.

264
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,644
Here you go.

265
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,616
Just texted you.

266
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:30,920
Oh, got it.

267
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,574
You girls know
where you're going?

268
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:28,976
- What?
- Do you know where you're going?

269
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:30,577
Oh, yeah, yeah.

270
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:31,945
- You sure?
- Yeah.

271
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:33,680
Okay.

272
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:35,651
I'll text you.

273
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:48,996
Uh, hi. Excuse me.

274
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:50,697
Hey, how you doing?

275
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:54,901
Can you tell me how to get
to 44 Court Street?

276
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:57,771
Yeah, take the A or C downtown.

277
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:59,840
Get off at Jay.

278
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,908
Uh, how do you get...

279
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,877
how do you get
to the subway from here?

280
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,879
Subway?
Just go directly that way.

281
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,881
Go downstairs.
Have a nice day.

282
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,818
Thanks.

283
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,927
I.D.s, please, ladies.

284
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,099
- Hi.
- Hi.

285
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,136
So, we're gonna get you
all signed in.

286
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,971
Um, you're gonna
sign your name over here.

287
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:20,909
All right,
and then your date of birth.

288
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:23,244
And then today's date.

289
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,011
- And then your signature.
- Okay.

290
00:41:25,013 --> 00:41:26,813
Let me know if you have
any questions,

291
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,051
- and we'll call you when we're ready.
- Yeah.

292
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:45,932
Okay.

293
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:49,803
I just want to review
some information,

294
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:51,871
and then we'll get you
all set up.

295
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:54,007
Okay?
Uh, can you start by verifying

296
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,042
your name
and date of birth, please?

297
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:58,312
Um, Autumn Callahan.

298
00:41:58,314 --> 00:42:00,880
August 19, 2002.

299
00:42:00,882 --> 00:42:02,115
Okay.

300
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:04,252
And in addition to
the pregnancy test

301
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:07,588
and the sonogram, we also like
to have you tested for STDs.

302
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,823
Is that okay?

303
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,159
Yeah, that's fine, um,
but I did already take

304
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,428
a pregnancy test,
and I did a sonogram.

305
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,364
Okay. All right, I understand.

306
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:20,900
Um, but we always have to go
by the one that we get today

307
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:22,203
here in our office,

308
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,372
with our technician
and on our equipment.

309
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:26,340
Is that still okay?

310
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,844
- Okay.
- Okay.

311
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,335
Are you okay?

312
00:43:27,102 --> 00:43:30,404
Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired.

313
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:32,273
Mm.

314
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:38,011
Well, the sonogram is showing
that you are about 18 weeks.

315
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:40,113
Does that sound about
as far along as you thought?

316
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:42,283
Uh, no, um...

317
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:46,119
the place I went to before
said that I was ten weeks.

318
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:48,155
Well, there can be
some margin of error,

319
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:50,291
but it's usually in
the three-to four-day range.

320
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:52,159
Which is why it's always
important for us

321
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,427
to do them again.

322
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,397
Um, no, the-the sonogram
I did before,

323
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:58,965
they definitely said
I was ten weeks.

324
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:01,268
Where was that?

325
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,138
Back in my town.

326
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,342
I have a feeling
that that was inaccurate.

327
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:10,244
At this specific facility,

328
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:13,447
in-clinic abortions are offered
up to 12 weeks

329
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:16,152
after the start date
of your last menstrual period.

330
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:20,120
Then what am I supposed to do?

331
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:22,423
I'm going to send you
to our Manhattan facility,

332
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:25,461
and they should be able to
take you first thing tomorrow.

333
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,264
Uh, can't you call and see
if they'll take me now?

334
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:33,066
By the time you get
there, they're gonna be closed.

335
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:35,336
I really can't wait until then.

336
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:38,139
I just don't think
it's gonna be possible.

337
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,174
But they are going to be able
to give you

338
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:41,975
the care that you need
tomorrow.

339
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:43,979
It's gonna be okay.

340
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:02,123
Look at this.

341
00:46:05,828 --> 00:46:07,628
Who's that?

342
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,096
You know.

343
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,266
It's that guy.

344
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:14,268
Don't encourage him.

345
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,170
I'm not.

346
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,272
He seriously texted me
three times.

347
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:20,407
- Look.
- Did you write back?

348
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:22,243
No.

349
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:25,212
Well, then delete,
delete, delete.

350
00:46:25,214 --> 00:46:27,015
Yep.

351
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,219
This area's closed.

352
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:33,287
You cannot sleep here.

353
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,688
This area's closed
between the hours

354
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,157
of 1:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.

374
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:52,479
It's called
a French whore bath.

375
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:54,350
Oh.

376
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:05,926
Oh, pass. Pass.

377
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:07,628
I'm good.

378
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:17,640

- Hi.

379
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,912
Can I get one of those?

380
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,919
Um, can I get one of these?

381
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:35,724
Can I get one of those, too?

382
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,762

Autumn?

399
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:02,004
Hi. Come on in.

400
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:06,106
Okay.

401
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:08,608
So, I'm your
financial counselor.

402
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,611
I'll be helping you sort out
the payment for today.

403
00:54:11,613 --> 00:54:13,647
Are you currently insured?

404
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:15,015
- Yes.
- Great.

405
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:16,719
Can I see your insurance card?

406
00:54:29,765 --> 00:54:31,665
Great.

407
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:34,001
Oh, wait.
Um, if I do this,

408
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,870
would my parents get
some kind of bill?

409
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:38,739
They'd get a statement.

410
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:40,574
That's correct.

411
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:43,912
Um, is there anything else
I can do?

412
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:48,715
Um, well, why don't we just
figure out what you can pay,

413
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,884
and then the rest, we can...

414
00:54:50,886 --> 00:54:53,354
figure out a way to supplement
with private funds.

415
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,757
- All right?
- Okay.

416
00:54:59,661 --> 00:55:01,661
Oh. Go ahead,
and just hold on to that.

417
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:04,198
That'll be for downstairs
for payment.

418
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,201
All I need you to do
is fill out this form,

419
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,203
right here,
and we'll get you started.

420
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,540
- Okay?
- Okay.

421
00:55:25,687 --> 00:55:28,688
Hi, Autumn. I'm Kelly.
I'm your counselor.

422
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,893
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

423
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:40,967
So, you had a sonogram at the
Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn,

424
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:44,138
and the sonogram is showing
that you're 18 weeks pregnant.

425
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,174
Is that about what you thought?

426
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,841
Um, no.

427
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:50,110
Okay, how many weeks
did you think you were?

428
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:52,146
I thought I was ten weeks.

429
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,015
Ten weeks?
Okay, that happens sometimes.

430
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:58,219
Because you're 18 weeks,
you're in the second trimester,

431
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:01,222
this is gonna be
a two-day procedure, okay?

432
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:04,024
Is there any way
you can do it all in one day?

433
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:05,826
Unfortunately,
it has to be done

434
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:07,661
over the course of two days.

435
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:09,863
We have to put dilators
in the cervix

436
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:12,032
so that the cervix
can open up slowly overnight.

437
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:16,270
That way, the procedure
can be done safely tomorrow.

438
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,905
Will you be able
to come back tomorrow?

439
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:20,241
Yeah.

440
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,975
Okay.

441
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:24,911
I also need to know
that you're absolutely sure

442
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:28,449
of your decision
to terminate this pregnancy.

443
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,784
Are you sure of your decision?

444
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:32,153
- Yeah.
- Okay.

445
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,921
'Cause if you, for any reason,
change your mind,

446
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:36,857
there could be serious
medical considerations

447
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:39,460
if you don't complete the
second part of the procedure.

448
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,795
- Okay.
- Okay?

449
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:43,797
Do you have a place
to stay tonight?

450
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:45,899
I know you came from far away.

451
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:47,100
Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:56:47,102 --> 00:56:49,137
Where are you gonna stay?

453
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,173
I don't know. I was just gonna
go to a hotel or something.

454
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,309
Okay.
Hotels are pretty expensive.

455
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,711
Do you have the money for that?

456
00:56:57,713 --> 00:56:59,112
I'll figure it out.

457
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:01,482
We work with volunteers
that can help you

458
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,949
with a place to stay.

459
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:05,785
I can reach out to them
if you want me to.

460
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:07,854
Yeah, I... I got it.

461
00:57:07,856 --> 00:57:09,923
- It's fine.
- Okay.

462
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:11,791
Who came with you today?

463
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:13,261
My cousin.

464
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,061
Have they been supportive?

465
00:57:15,063 --> 00:57:16,963
- Yeah.
- Okay.

466
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:19,099
Can you tell me
what led to your decision

467
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:20,936
to terminate the pregnancy?

468
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,938
I... I'm just not ready
to be a mom.

469
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,207
That's totally fine.

470
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,974
Whatever your decision is

471
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:30,246
is totally fine
as long as it's yours.

472
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,114
Is there anyone
who's pressuring you

473
00:57:34,116 --> 00:57:36,350
to be here today
to terminate this pregnancy?

474
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,851
No.

475
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,119
Okay.

476
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:41,087
I'm gonna ask you
some questions

477
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:42,956
about your medical history.

478
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:44,325
Okay?
There's lots of questions.

479
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,229
Just answer as best you can.

480
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,163
Do you take any medication

481
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,932
or use any drugs
on a regular basis?

482
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:54,034
- No.
- Have you taken any medication

483
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:56,137
or used any drugs
of any kind today?

484
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,837
No.

485
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,073
Have you ever had
any medical problems before,

486
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:02,976
like anemia, asthma,
high blood pressure,

487
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:04,978
anything like that?

488
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
I don't know. Don't think so.

489
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:08,114
Okay.

490
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:10,184
Are you allergic
to any medication?

491
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,918
- No.
- No?

492
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,854
You have any allergies
to latex or shellfish?

493
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:16,056
No.

494
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,857
Have you ever
had surgery before?

495
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:19,160
- No.
- No?

496
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,894
Ever been in the hospital
for anything?

497
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:22,129
No.

498
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,997
Have you ever
had anesthesia before?

499
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:26,099
- No.
- No? Okay.

500
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,935
Anyone in your family
have any major illness,

501
00:58:28,937 --> 00:58:31,905
like cancer, diabetes,
high blood pressure?

502
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:34,074
- Parents, grandparents?
- Uh...

503
00:58:34,076 --> 00:58:36,876
- No, not that I know of.
- Okay.

504
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:39,380
And do you have a healthy diet?

505
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,047
I think so.

506
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:42,216
Kind of?

507
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,285
Do you exercise regularly?

508
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,019
- Not really.
- Okay.

509
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,021
- Do you use seat belts?
- Yeah.

510
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:49,390
Okay, good.

511
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,593
Any recent life changes
or stresses?

512
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,060
Um, no.

513
00:58:54,062 --> 00:58:55,229
Okay.

514
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,398
Any health hazards at home?

515
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,133
Not really.

516
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,435
When was the last time
you went to the doctor?

517
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:04,205
Uh, like a year ago.

518
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,039
Okay.

519
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,177
And at what age
did you first have sex?

520
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,313
- Uh, 14.
- Okay.

521
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,914
And what types of
sexual activity have you had?

522
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:16,952
Vaginal, anal, oral?

523
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,221
- All of them.
- Okay.

524
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,257
And how many sexual partners
do you currently have?

525
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,359
- Uh, one.
- Okay.

526
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,628
And could your partner have
any other partners

527
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,297
that you're aware of?

528
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,332
- Probably.
- Okay.

529
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,134
And how many sexual partners

530
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,236
have you had
in the last 12 months?

531
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,437
Uh, two.

532
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,205
How about in your lifetime?

533
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,073
- Six.
- Okay.

534
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:43,076
Do you use any condoms
or any other barriers

535
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:46,180
to protect yourself against HIV
or other infections?

536
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:47,914
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

537
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:49,082
Okay, good.

538
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,987
I want to spend a few minutes
talking with you

539
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,989
about your relationships, okay?

540
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:57,458
Because they can affect
your health.

541
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,092
Did you know that?

542
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:00,428
No? All right.

543
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,463
So I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

544
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,432
They can be really personal.

545
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,100
And all you have to do
is answer either

546
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:09,969
"never," "rarely,"
"sometimes" or "always."

547
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:11,439
It's kind of like
multiple choice,

548
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,240
but it's not a test.

549
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,276
- Okay.
- Okay?

550
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:20,247
In the past year, your partner
has refused to wear a condom.

551
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,116
Never, rarely,

552
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,921
sometimes, always.

553
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:29,390
Um, sometimes.

554
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:30,990
Okay.

555
01:00:30,992 --> 01:00:33,194
And your partner messes
with your birth control

556
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:36,096
or tries to get you pregnant
when you don't want to be.

557
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:39,400
- Uh...
- Never, rarely,

558
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:43,002
sometimes, always.

559
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,372
Uh, never.

560
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,072
Okay.

561
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:48,376
Your partner has threatened
or frightened you.

562
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:52,112
Never, rarely,

563
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:55,349
sometimes, always.

564
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,152
Why are you asking me this?

565
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,989
I want to make sure
that you're safe.

566
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:06,494
Your partner's threatened
or frightened you.

567
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,131
Never, rarely,

568
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:14,168
sometimes, always.

569
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,404
Um, rarely.

570
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,139
Okay.

571
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,307
Your partner has hit you,
slapped you

572
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,443
or physically hurt you.

573
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:26,313
Never, rarely,

574
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,918
sometimes, always.

575
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,125
Has your partner ever hit you,
slapped you

576
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,129
or physically hurt you?

577
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,467
Is someone hurting you?

578
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,204
Some...

579
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,341
It's okay.

580
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,978
It's just a couple more
questions, all right?

581
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,414
Your partner
has made you have sex

582
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,416
when you didn't want to.

583
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:06,052
Never, rarely,

584
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:09,559
sometimes, always.

585
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,031
It's okay.

586
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,505
I want to make sure
you're safe,

587
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,210
and I want to help you
if I can.

588
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,251
I have just one more question
for you, okay, Autumn?

589
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,520
Has anyone forced you
into a sexual act

590
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,288
ever in your lifetime?

591
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,024
Yes or no?

592
01:02:45,093 --> 01:02:47,261
Uh, yeah.

593
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,829
Okay.

594
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,664
Do you want to tell me
about it?

595
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,134
- No, not...
- It's okay.

596
01:02:54,136 --> 01:02:58,205
I'm gonna give you my number,
and you can call me.

597
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,673
We don't have to talk
about it today,

598
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:02,142
but you can call me
if you need to talk

599
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:04,079
or if you need some help, okay?

600
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,154
Do you have
any questions for me?

601
01:03:14,156 --> 01:03:16,557
Um, is it...

602
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,493
the procedure...
is it gonna be painful?

603
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,629
It's gonna be
a little uncomfortable.

604
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,298
Have you ever had
a GYN exam before?

605
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,433
- No.
- Okay.

606
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,669
It's gonna be
in an operating room.

607
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,438
There's gonna be a doctor.
There's gonna be a nurse.

608
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,707
There's gonna be
a medical assistant.

609
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,577
I can be there with you
if you want me to be.

610
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,546
Would you like me
to go with you?

611
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,581
- Sure.
- Okay.

612
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:44,318
Okay, so it's kind of like
having a GYN exam today.

613
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,321
They're gonna put
a speculum in the vagina.

614
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,557
They're gonna put laminaria
into the cervix,

615
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,160
and that's what's gonna help
the cervix open overnight.

616
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,728
All right, so it's gonna
feel uncomfortable...

617
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,498
kind of like pressure,
kind of like you have to pee...

618
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,732
but it shouldn't hurt.

619
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,601
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:04,505
If you have any really bad pain
tonight, you have to call us.

621
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,707
- Okay.
- Okay?

622
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,609
Then, when you come back
tomorrow

623
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,444
for the second part
of the procedure,

624
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,746
for that part,
you're gonna be asleep.

625
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,916
Okay, and I can be
with you then, too.

626
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,551
I'm gonna, like, go under?

627
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,553
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

628
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,488
Just for about ten minutes.

629
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,357
It's pretty quick, all right?

630
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,758
- Okay.
- And then,

631
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,927
when you wake up,
you'll be in the recovery room.

632
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,295
You're gonna be all done.

633
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,497
- Then you can go home.
- Okay.

634
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,632
All right.

635
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,367
Are you ready?

636
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,504
- Think so.
- Okay.

637
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,934
Where's the rest of the money?

638
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,670
I had to use it all
for the appointment.

639
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,807
Why couldn't they
do it all today?

640
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,709
You can go home if you want.

641
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,564
Hi.

642
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:24,865
How can I help you?

643
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,600
Um, I'm sorry.

644
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,468
We lost our tickets,
and we were wondering...

645
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,871
is there any way that you
could reprint them for us?

646
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,606
Do you have a receipt?

647
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,809
No, we lost that,
too, unfortunately.

648
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,446
I can't reissue the tickets
without proof of purchase.

649
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,614
Okay.

650
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,617
Um, how much
for two tickets, then,

651
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,485
to Ellensboro, Pennsylvania?

652
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:47,554
$66.50 each.

653
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,458
$66.50.

654
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,494
Thank you.

655
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,542
Do you want me to call my mom?

656
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:09,945
No.

657
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,882
Do you want me
to call your mom?

658
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,785
No.

659
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:22,923
Then what do you want me to do?

660
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,927
Fuck off.

661
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,672
Your attention, please.

662
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,097
Look at me.

663
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

664
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:24,738
How was, uh, your family thing?

665
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,008
It was okay.

666
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,977
I wasn't sure if I was
gonna hear from you.

667
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,715
We were pretty busy.

668
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,117
Want to come with me
to this thing downtown?

669
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,986
Um, we actually kind of need
to hang around here,

670
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,755
if that's okay.

671
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,191
Okay.

672
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,959
Uh, well, let's get a drink.

673
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,262
Oh, I'm-I'm not 21 yet.

674
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:50,697
How old are you?

675
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,666
20.

676
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,869
Okay, well, no one really cards
in New York, so...

677
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,737
Um... if we can just

678
01:12:57,739 --> 01:13:00,776
grab a bite to eat in here,
if that's okay.

679
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,679
492!

680
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,217
Sure you don't want anything?

681
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:12,453
- We're good.
- Okay.

682
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:14,020
It's always so embarrassing

683
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,224
to eat in front of people
you don't really know.

684
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:19,025
It's even worse when you're
the only one eating.

685
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,763
We just ate, but thanks.

686
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:25,968
So, the show was,
like, super fun.

687
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:30,971
It was more like an event
than a show.

688
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:34,941
It was in, um,
an abandoned subway station.

689
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,147
Sure you don't want
to come check it out?

690
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,848
Another time.

691
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,252
I mean, this city has
a lot of secrets.

692
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:46,655
Subterranean levels.

693
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,191
Go ahead, just take some.

694
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:51,660
As many as you want.

695
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,131
Where you from exactly?

696
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,133
Pennsylvania.

697
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:00,969
Northumberland County.

698
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:04,205
Sounds exciting.

699
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:06,806
What do you like to do there?

700
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:08,309
Normal things.

701
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:10,076
Like?

702
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,846
School, work.

703
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,684
Sounds like
a fascinating place.

704
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:18,954
Yeah, it's-it's nice.

705
01:14:22,824 --> 01:14:25,727
Sure you don't want to come
with me downtown?

706
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,964
W-We really can't.

707
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:32,868
Okay.

708
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,131
Are there any lanes open?

709
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:06,167
- We can squeeze you in. Yeah.
- Perfect.

710
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,169
- Uh, how many players today?
- Three.

711
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,338
It's $90.47,
including tax and shoes.

712
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,774
- I got it.
- Thanks.

713
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,294
Oh! Jesus Christ.

714
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,877
Wow.

715
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,879
You're starting out killing it.

716
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,183
You hustling me?

717
01:16:06,296 --> 01:16:08,028
Hey.

718
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,299
You good?

719
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:15,136
Should I order
a pitcher of beer?

720
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:17,340
Just water will be fine.

721
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:20,343
Will you drink with me?

722
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:31,077
Hello?

723
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,414
Autumn?

724
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,282
Mom?

725
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,551
Are you okay?

726
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:41,056
Where are you?

727
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,930

01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:46,173
What time is your bus?

759
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,143
I'm sorry, this is
really awkward, but, um,

760
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:51,178
can we ask you something?

761
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,747
Yeah, sure.

762
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:58,619
We lost our bus tickets,
and it got super late,

763
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,188
and we don't have
anyone to call.

764
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,623
Could we...

765
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,159
borrow a few bucks?

766
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,260
- Sorry.
- Sure.

767
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,394
No, no problem.

768
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:08,762
I mean, yeah. Sure.

769
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:10,397
Thank you.

770
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:11,932
Just, uh...

771
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:13,634
just come with me downtown,

772
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:16,672
and we can stop
at an ATM on the way.

773
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:19,640
I w-wish we could.

774
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:21,575
Sounds great, but...

775
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,580
we're really just cutting it
too close with our bus.

776
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:29,385
Okay.

777
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:32,321
Um...

778
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:37,391
I mean,
everything's closed, so...

779
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,259
Yeah.

780
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,662
I guess
we can find one outside.

781
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:43,664
Okay. Yeah.

782
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,733
And you're probably tired
of lugging that thing around.

783
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,267
- It's fine.
- We'll just... we'll run out

784
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:48,569
and be right back.
We'll be quick.

785
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,673
- It's-it's...
- Um...

786
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:54,443
Okay.

787
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:57,244
- Okay.
- Come.

788
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,681
Okay.

789
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:38,901
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

790
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:47,040
Um, we'll get you back.

791
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:49,710
No worries.

792
01:25:49,712 --> 01:25:51,712
I'll, uh...

793
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,782
- I'll text you.
- Yeah.

794
01:26:01,624 --> 01:26:03,626
Bye.

795
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,552
Want to see a trick?

796
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:07,688
Sure.

797
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:09,692
Look at this, okay?

798
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:45,159
How are you doing?

799
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:46,927
I'm okay.

800
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:50,065
Any pain, cramping,
bleeding overnight?

801
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:53,167
Nothing too bad.

802
01:27:53,169 --> 01:27:54,868
Okay, good.

803
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,903
And anything to eat or drink
since midnight?

804
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:58,105
No.

805
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,973
Okay.
You must be hungry, right?

806
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:01,342
- Yeah.
- Okay.

807
01:28:01,344 --> 01:28:03,744
You can eat
as soon as you're done.

808
01:28:03,746 --> 01:28:05,779
- Great.
- Okay.

809
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,648
I also want to make a
follow-up appointment for you.

810
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,684
Oh, um, do I have to come back?

811
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:12,652
No, you don't have to
come back here.

812
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:14,054
I know you live far away.

813
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:16,357
But I would like to help you
make an appointment

814
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:18,658
somewhere closer to home.

815
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,826
Okay?

816
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:21,728
Yeah, sure.

817
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,897
Okay.

818
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:25,634
You ready?

819
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:29,803
I think so. Yeah.

820
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,738
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

821
01:28:59,235 --> 01:29:01,701
Can you tell me
your name, birth date

822
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:03,639
and what procedure
you're having?

823
01:29:06,242 --> 01:29:09,843
Um, my name is Autumn Callahan.

824
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:12,946
August 19, 2002.

825
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:15,617
And what did you just ask me?

826
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,720
What procedure are you having?

827
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:23,157
Uh, I'm having an abortion.

828
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:25,859
Do you have any questions
before we start?

829
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,928
No.

830
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:30,200
Are you ready to go to sleep?

831
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:29,658
Thanks.

832
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:47,075
- Hi.
- Hi.

833
01:30:51,214 --> 01:30:53,216
- You okay?
- Yeah.

834
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,220
So, should we go?

835
01:30:58,221 --> 01:31:00,022
Mm-hmm.

836
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:43,966
So, how was it?

837
01:31:46,269 --> 01:31:48,003
What do you mean?

838
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:51,106
Like, what was it like?

839
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:55,110
It was kind of whatever.

840
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,182
Were they nice?

841
01:32:02,151 --> 01:32:04,019
Nice enough.

842
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:10,159
Did it hurt?

843
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:13,762
Just uncomfortable.

844
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:20,068
How do you feel now?

845
01:32:22,438 --> 01:32:24,307
Tired.

846
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,352
Want to try this?

847
01:32:37,853 --> 01:32:39,353
It's like a bug.

848
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:43,126
- Yeah, roly-poly.
- Yeah.

849
01:32:46,296 --> 01:32:48,997
A delicious one.

850
01:32:51,334 --> 01:32:53,367
And probably bad
for your health.

851
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:55,935
Oh, yeah,
so it's good for the soul.

852
01:32:55,937 --> 01:32:58,639
It's kind of all that grease,
you know.

853
01:32:58,641 --> 01:33:00,907

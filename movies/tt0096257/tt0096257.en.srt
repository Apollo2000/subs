00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:02,098
<i>In October, my brother and I left Ohio.
We were driving to California.</i>

3
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,238
<i>We got into Dallas on a Thursday night.</i>

4
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:10,242
Friday morning, while I'm eating eggs
and drinking coffee, I get a good job.

5
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:14,142
I mean, it's, you know... all these people
are supposedly out of work.

6
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:18,248
I'm not in town a half a day,
and I've got a job.

7
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:22,246
Everything clicked.
It's as if I was meant to be here.

8
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:32,330
I'd run away from home a couple
of times. Once or twice. I don't know.

9
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,974
And this all started,
David is running away from home.

10
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:42,074
<i>And he takes... I took
a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.</i>

11
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,737
Took a neighbor's car.

12
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,750
I had broken into their house
and got the keys to it.

13
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,780
I forget exactly what it was.

14
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,221
Ended up coming to Dallas.

15
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,797
<i>I went to work and no one showed up.</i>

16
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:12,671
<i>Being a weekend, sometimes
they worked, sometimes they didn't.</i>

17
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,179
On the way home, I ran out of gas.

18
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,380
And as I was walking down the street
with the gas can...

19
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,845
a person, at that time, pulled over.

20
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,656
I guess since I had the gas can...

21
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:31,154
he figured I was out of gas.
I wasn't 100 yards from the car.

22
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,497
And being Thanksgiving weekend,
there was no gas stations open.

23
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,992
He stopped and asked me
if I needed any help.

24
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,136
<i>I'm driving down some street
somewhere in Dallas.</i>

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,764
<i>I had just turned 16.</i>

26
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,913
<i>And there was a guy over there,
I think he'd run out of gas...</i>

27
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:55,081
<i>I took him to get some gas.
This was Randall Adams.</i>

28
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:03,948
<i>Ended up following him where
him and his brother were staying.</i>

29
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,424
Eventually, that evening...

30
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,833
we went out and got some beer.

31
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,803
We smoked a little marijuana
and what have you.

32
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,798
Went to a movie that night.

33
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,411
I get up, I go to work on Saturday.

34
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:25,214
Why did I meet this kid? I don't know.

35
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:29,450
Why did I run out of gas at that time?
I don't know. But it happened.

36
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:19,088
<i>The day they picked me up, December 21.</i>

37
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,933
They took me upstairs.
What floor, I don't know.

38
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,825
But they put me in a little room.

39
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,528
<i>Gus Rose walked in.</i>

40
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:36,973
<i>He had a confession there
he wanted me to sign.</i>

41
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,052
<i>He said that I would sign.</i>

42
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:47,516
<i>He didn't give a damn what I said.
I would sign this piece of paper.</i>

43
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,049
<i>I told him I couldn't.</i>

44
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:57,667
"I don't know what the hell
you people expect of me.

45
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,231
"But there's no way I can sign that."

46
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,068
He left. He came back in 10 minutes.

47
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,832
<i>And threw a pistol on the table.</i>

48
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:12,407
Asked me to look at it.
Which I did. I looked.

49
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,509
<i>He asked me to pick it up.</i>

50
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,978
<i>I told him no, I wouldn't do that.</i>

51
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,421
<i>He threatened me.</i>

52
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:25,158
<i>Again, I told him no.</i>

53
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,625
<i>He pulled his service revolver on me.</i>

54
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,933
<i>We looked at each other for...
To me, it seemed hours.</i>

55
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:40,005
I do not like looking down
the barrel of a pistol.

56
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,400
I do not like being threatened.

57
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:47,211
When he finally saw
that he would either have to kill me...

58
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,352
or forget the signature...

59
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:53,088
I guess he forgot the signature,
because he put his pistol up.

60
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:58,521
He took the pistol on the table,
put it up and stormed out.

61
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:03,065
I had a casual, friendly conversation
with him to start with...

62
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:05,735
to try to size him up...

63
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:09,027
to see what he liked
and what he didn't like.

64
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:14,377
I found almost immediately
that he didn't have much conscience.

65
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:18,773
Anything he had done,
it never really bothered him.

66
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:21,817
He had done other things
that he told me about...

67
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,453
that didn't seem
to bother him in the least.

68
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:27,244
He showed no expression whatsoever.

69
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:33,294
It's just like he's sitting here
talking about the color of this wall...

70
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,761
or the shooting of the police officer.

71
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:42,170
He showed no reaction
to any of the questions.

72
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,044
He almost overacted his innocence.

73
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,680
He protested he hadn't done anything.

74
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,711
Couldn't imagine
why we were bringing him in.

75
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:59,522
He didn't fight or he didn't resist.

76
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,847
He just protested his innocence.

77
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:07,018
I told them what happened that
Saturday, that I had met this kid.

78
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,924
<i>I kept telling them the same thing.</i>

79
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,391
<i>They didn't want to believe me.</i>

80
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:16,997
<i>Never once was I allowed a phone call.</i>

81
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,906
<i>Never once was an attorney there.</i>

82
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:23,101
<i>I don't know how long this had been.</i>

83
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:27,576
<i>I had smoked two packs of cigarettes
and had been out for a long time.</i>

84
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:47,136
Wood didn't take his ticket book
out of the car.

85
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,572
He left it in the car
on the front seat...

86
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,541
which indicates
that he was not going to write a ticket.

87
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:56,278
What he was probably going to do
was have them turn on the headlights.

88
00:09:56,378 --> 00:10:00,241
He didn't know that the car was stolen.

89
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,886
I think that there's
a very good chance...

90
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:06,522
that he was going
to check the driver's license...

91
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:10,226
and tell him to turn on his headlights,
and let the guy be on his way.

92
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:13,051
Officer Wood's wife had purchased him...

93
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,966
a bulletproof vest
and had it under the Christmas tree.

94
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:21,168
<i>Or had it stored away,
to give to him at Christmastime.</i>

95
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:27,176
His partner was one of the first
female police officers...

96
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:28,377
that was assigned to patrol.

97
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:32,481
They were from the Northwest Station.
Just patrol officers following the clock.

98
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,306
<i>Working the graveyard shift
and everything.</i>

99
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:39,553
<i>They had been into a fast-food
restaurant. And she had a malt.</i>

100
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:44,524
<i>This car came by, these
two dudes in it, with no lights on.</i>

101
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,438
<i>It wasn't a serious problem...</i>

102
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:59,241
<i>but he just pulled up,
turned his lights on to stop him.</i>

103
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:02,237
<i>Just to warn the man
that his lights were off.</i>

104
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>Got out of the car and walked up.</i>

105
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:19,395
<i>Before he got to the window,
where the driver was...</i>

106
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,863
he was in the right position.

107
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,299
This man just turned around and just...

108
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,090
with a little small-caliber pistol.

109
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,535
The first shot hit him in the arm.

110
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:40,015
He had his flashlight. It hit
the flashlight and went into his arm.

111
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,078
The next one hit him right in the chest.

112
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,562
<i>The officer falls in the street
and he was in the first traffic lane.</i>

113
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:55,853
<i>He lay there and bled to death.</i>

114
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:58,601
<i>So she's out of the car.</i>

115
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,236
<i>She empties her pistol
at the fleeing suspect...</i>

116
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:03,231
<i>and she runs to his aid.</i>

117
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:09,845
Procedure says you grab the radio
and call for an ambulance.

118
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:13,114
Common sense would tell you that.
But what do you do?

119
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:17,181
<i>And that time,
she's so... just tore down.</i>

120
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,911
<i>And the blood.
An enormous amount of blood.</i>

121
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:31,799
How do we hold her responsible
for not following procedure?

122
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:37,401
But the main thing was, she
couldn't remember the license number.

123
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:57,884
When we started putting facts together
on how much information we had...

124
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,163
from the leads we had,
we found out we didn't have anything.

125
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:08,464
The only thing that we knew
we were looking for was a blue Vega.

126
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:13,542
<i>Probably every Vega that was
registered in the state of Texas...</i>

127
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,639
<i>was stopped and checked.</i>

128
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:19,348
We had people calling the office...

129
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:22,484
saying, "I've got a Vega
and it's not blue.

130
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,820
"But would you come out
and be sure to check it.

131
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,724
"Be sure it's not mine, because
I don't want to get stopped anymore.

132
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,286
"I'm afraid."

133
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:38,133
If you're the investigator
assigned to the murder...

134
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,536
you get frustrated with other witnesses.

135
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,872
But when you got a police officer
that witnessed it...

136
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:47,903
you expect that they would know
a little more than she knew.

137
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:49,912
<i>Procedure.</i>

138
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,315
<i>When there's a two-person unit,
when either one approaches the car...</i>

139
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,085
<i>the other positions himself
to the right rear...</i>

140
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,521
<i>where they can watch
all the activity in the car.</i>

141
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:03,258
<i>And if the man on the left of the driver
gets in trouble...</i>

142
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:06,254
<i>their partner is in a position to help.</i>

143
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,232
Speculation was, at the time...

144
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:13,296
that his partner was sitting in the car.

145
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:37,452
<i>That's where the discrepancies were.</i>

146
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:41,663
<i>Just a matter of time, and whether
or not she was out of the car...</i>

147
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:44,466
<i>completely out of the car,
or partially in the car...</i>

148
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:47,326
<i>or just sitting in there
with the door closed.</i>

149
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:52,534
<i>And the thing I think we did then
that really helped...</i>

150
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:57,212
It didn't really help anything at all.
Let me back up.

151
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,882
But it was interesting,
and it cost a lot of money...

152
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,413
but it was worthwhile.
You got to cover every trail.

153
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,540
<i>A guy out of California...</i>

154
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,709
<i>I don't recall his name,
he was an expert in hypnosis.</i>

155
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,945
<i>He came down,
hypnotized her and questioned her.</i>

156
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,346
What was interesting was...

157
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:34,183
she couldn't remember anything
particularly about the car.

158
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,818
She remembered getting a malt.

159
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,353
They'd stopped in the fast-food.
It was a Whataburger.

160
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,622
They remembered all that,
and stopping the car.

161
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,025
Got back on the road.
She didn't remember anything.

162
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,962
But she remembered a license number
off a hit-and-run vehicle...

163
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,594
that they had worked
earlier in the night.

164
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,926
<i>It was getting awfully close
to Christmas.</i>

165
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:21,797
We'd never gone that long in Dallas
without clearing a murder of an officer.

166
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,000
We'd had several killed,
but we'd cleared them pretty quick.

167
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,403
And this case had gone a month,
or nearly a month...

168
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,305
and we still hadn't cleared it.

169
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:34,564
We finally got the break that cleared it.
It came out of Vidor, Texas.

170
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:42,751
Mr. Calvin Cunningham, who lives
in Vidor, had his home broken into...

171
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:47,078
and his little Mercury Comet stolen.

172
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:50,081
<i>We felt as though
David had committed that crime.</i>

173
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,661
<i>For several days, though,
he was missing. We couldn't find him.</i>

174
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:58,934
It was one afternoon, one of our
officers spotted Cunningham's car...

175
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:01,236
on North Main Street, here in Vidor.

176
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:04,630
David abandoned the vehicle
and ran on foot.

177
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:10,312
We started getting
little bits of information, though...

178
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:15,049
that David had been involved in a
shooting in Dallas of a police officer.

179
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,678
<i>We would always get
third-hand rumor, fourth-hand rumor.</i>

180
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:24,289
So we went back to a few of his other
comrades in crime, we could call them.

181
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:27,629
They said,
"We thought he was just bragging.

182
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:30,065
"We didn't really take him seriously."

183
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:33,035
Sitting down, watching the
evening news, well, the night news.

184
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,462
My father was asleep on the couch.

185
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,069
Heard somebody knocking at the door.
It was David Harris.

186
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,143
I let him in. He came in.

187
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,679
He was standing there beside my chair...

188
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,382
and a news broadcast advertised
about a police officer shot in Dallas.

189
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,920
Right then and there he starts
swearing up and down.

190
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,557
He says, "I swear to God,
I shot that fucking pig."

191
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,559
He says, "I'm the one that killed him."

192
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,429
Somewhere around Dallas,
they got pulled over.

193
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,032
I think he said because
they were checking out a stolen car.

194
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:08,003
He said that the cop
had pulled him over...

195
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,905
and walked up to the window.

196
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,374
When the cop came,
he rolled down the window...

197
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:14,843
and just pulled the gun up and shot him.

198
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,445
He swore up and down.

199
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,881
He made a big scene about it.
Jumped up and down...

200
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:21,917
trying to get anybody and everybody...

201
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,243
to listen to him.
"Yeah, I shot that son of a gun."

202
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:28,317
And everybody said,
"Sure you did, David. Sure."

203
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,190
"I swear to God I killed that cop."

204
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,092
I asked him if he'd been to Dallas.
He denied having been to Dallas.

205
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,900
I asked him if he'd been involved
in any shooting...

206
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,193
or knew anything about a shooting,
and he denied that to the end.

207
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:47,209
Which is fairly consistent with David.
Even if he had some involvement...

208
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:50,979
his first way that he always treats you,
he would deny.

209
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,949
Then, if he felt as though
you really knew he had done it...

210
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,114
then he would be truthful with you.

211
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,109
He give me a pistol,
a .22 caliber pistol.

212
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:03,690
He showed it to me. He says,
"That's the one I shot him with."

213
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,490
He gave me the pistol.

214
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,898
I didn't really consider it that much.

215
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:13,429
I don't guess I really realized
he did shoot the cop.

216
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,671
He led me to a swampy area...

217
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,608
several hundred yards
behind his residence in Rose City.

218
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,244
<i>There was a sock under water.
He said, "There it is."</i>

219
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,240
<i>And he had sprayed
this sock with boot oil.</i>

220
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,116
When we retrieved the gun...

221
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,653
I said, "I better do something with it.
It's going to rust up."

222
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:36,191
Even the time that I saw the gun
at the trial in Dallas...

223
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,194
it looked just as good
as when I'd taken it out of the swamp.

224
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:43,362
So he had taken pretty good care of it,
even though he did put it under water.

225
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,237
He got to thinking...

226
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:52,836
"I didn't do that
and I've been saying that I did...

227
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,711
"and I'm in over my head now,
I better tell them what happened.

228
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,649
"Because they are going to send me
to the penitentiary for life...

229
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:03,285
"if I don't tell them
what really happened."

230
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:06,721
So he said,
"I am just bragging about this.

231
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:10,752
"I didn't do it, but I was there,
and I know who did do it."

232
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,157
And, of course, he came clean then.

233
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,992
<i>He tried to hide no facts.</i>

234
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,031
<i>He just seemed like a friendly kid.</i>

235
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:27,334
I may have talked to him
15 or 20 minutes on a friendly basis...

236
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,107
just to keep him friendly.

237
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,242
We didn't want to make him mad.

238
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:44,092
But we didn't want him to tell us
something that he thought.

239
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,656
We wanted him to tell us what we knew.

240
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,358
It wasn't very long until I realized
that what he knew...

241
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,769
was the facts of the case,
and it matched with what we knew.

242
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,696
And it had to be right.

243
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,539
<i>The story that I told was...</i>

244
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:04,469
It was like 12:00 something.
So it was the next day...

245
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,911
early in the morning. We were stopped.

246
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:15,146
When we were stopped,
the officer came up to the car...

247
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,526
and asked to see the driver's license,
and he just started shooting.

248
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:29,096
I don't know why, but it's always
seemed like time just stopped.

249
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,035
It didn't seem like any time passed.

250
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,713
It just seemed like it was, boom!

251
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:42,278
Time stopped or something.
I don't know what it is.

252
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,721
It's like a flash.

253
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,121
<i>We went back to his room.</i>

254
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:57,999
He was supposed to ask his brother
if I could stay there that night.

255
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,496
But he said
that his brother don't like to do that.

256
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:06,173
Anyhow, he went in
and never came back out. So I left.

257
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,006
Ended up pulling into a parking lot.

258
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:15,717
I slept there I think, for a while.

259
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,787
Then, finally, the next morning,
early or something...

260
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,783
I found my way to Freeway 45.

261
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:24,022
And went back home.

262
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,302
After riding around with him,
I come to find out he's got an arsenal.

263
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:38,834
He's got pistols. He's got rifles.

264
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:43,144
He's got this pistol.
He's waving it around. He's doing this.

265
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:47,505
I told him, "Hey, why don't you put
those in the trunk of the car?"

266
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,019
<i>We stopped at a restaurant...</i>

267
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,955
and ordered
and ate sandwiches in the car.

268
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:55,813
I bought a six-pack of beer.

269
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,661
<i>He pulled this pistol back out.</i>

270
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,521
And I ask him why he got the pistol out.

271
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:06,067
And he kind of laughed...

272
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,894
rolled the window down,
and fired the pistol outside the car.

273
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:14,598
And I asked him to please put it up.

274
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:20,715
And I think he handed me the pistol,
and I put it under the driver's seat.

275
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:24,542
<i>He wanted to go to the movies,
so we went to the movies.</i>

276
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,286
<i>We got there probably at about 7:00.</i>

277
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:39,301
<i>He was the one
that had picked the movie out.</i>

278
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:42,337
<i>I call them drive-in movies,
beer-drinking movies.</i>

279
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:45,307
<i>$0.50, put them together
and make a bunch of money...</i>

280
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:48,343
<i>with a bunch of people
getting drunk at the drive-in.</i>

281
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:51,746
<i>- Are you going to concede?
- Please, sit down...</i>

282
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:53,775
<i>What is this, Mr. Brooks?</i>

283
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,751
<i>- Anybody can see it's an ashtray.
- Wrong!</i>

284
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,921
<i>Anybody can plainly see
it's a wall-breaker!</i>

285
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,057
<i>I'm trying to speak for you!</i>

286
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:06,760
<i>I'm trying to speak for all of you!
I am the student body!</i>

287
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:13,494
<i>The show that was on was half over.
We watched half of the one show...</i>

288
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,905
<i>we started watching
the first part of the second show.</i>

289
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,071
<i>We want a victory,
and we're gonna get it.</i>

290
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,925
<i>I didn't really care
for the second feature...</i>

291
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:40,862
<i>which is an R-rated,
cheerleader-type thing.</i>

292
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:42,891
<i>I don't know what it was.</i>

293
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,355
<i>May I have some wine?</i>

294
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,352
<i>It's good, Ross.
I didn't know you could cook.</i>

295
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:06,176
<i>It is good, isn't it?</i>

296
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:09,952
<i>You got to try my celery rémoulade.</i>

297
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,271
<i>No.</i>

298
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:32,714
<i>I told him I wanted to leave.</i>

299
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:37,041
"I don't really care
to sit here and watch this. Let's go."

300
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:44,992
He's acting strange, he wanted
to watch the end. Anyway, we left.

301
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,121
<i>We drove back towards Dallas
and we drove to the motel.</i>

302
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,536
<i>There's a little store.
I bought a pack of cigarettes...</i>

303
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,204
<i>and a newspaper.</i>

304
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,337
And when I left,
this kid was still sitting there.

305
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,812
I leaned against the car and we
talked to him for a few minutes...

306
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:07,916
and I told him
that since he was looking for a job...

307
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:09,918
and there hadn't been anybody at work...

308
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:12,720
that if he wanted to stop back
Monday morning...

309
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,657
that sure, he could ride out
and follow me to work...

310
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:19,324
and he could talk to the boss.
And he would probably get a job.

311
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:23,932
I told him that I would catch him
Monday morning if he showed up.

312
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:26,367
I told him what time I went to work.
Why, I left.

313
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:29,397
I walked around the store
and went to the house.

314
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:34,140
When I walked in, the television was
on and my brother was sleeping.

315
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,442
He had been home this whole time
that I had been gone.

316
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:39,876
<i>So I made me a sandwich...</i>

317
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:43,640
<i>and sat there and watched the end of
The Carol Burnett Show.</i>

318
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:51,553
<i>When it went off, the news came on
and I watched 15 minutes of it.</i>

319
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:55,824
And that was it.
I turned the TV off and went to sleep.

320
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:13,915
<i>Finally, they bring in a stenographer.</i>

321
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:17,013
<i>She sits down and I run the story.</i>

322
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,321
<i>I tell them what happened this Saturday.</i>

323
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,919
<i>She leaves. She types.</i>

324
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:52,654
<i>She comes back
in about 25 to 30 minutes...</i>

325
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,548
<i>with a copy of this statement.</i>

326
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:58,381
<i>I read through it...</i>

327
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:03,121
<i>and when it was basically
what I liked...</i>

328
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:05,797
<i>yes, I signed it.</i>

329
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:20,437
He admits driving the car
and taking a right on Inwood Road...

330
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,908
off of Interstate 35...

331
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,379
or Highway 183.

332
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,594
He admits driving it.

333
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:36,489
After he made his right turn
on Inwood Road...

334
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,859
<i>this is where our statement ends.</i>

335
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:45,266
<i>He says he does not
remember anything after that.</i>

336
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:48,476
He didn't remember anything
about a shooting.

337
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:53,145
He didn't remember anything about
a police officer stopping him.

338
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:57,984
That part of his mind
just conveniently went blank.

339
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,455
He remembered driving the car...

340
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:03,391
and he remembered approaching
the scene of the shooting...

341
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,593
and then, from that point,
he blacks out...

342
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:08,096
and can't remember
until he gets to the motel room...

343
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:12,000
which is some 10 minutes later.
Everything else he remembers vividly.

344
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,531
And that's just a convenient memory
lapse, is all that is.

345
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:23,011
<i>The Morning News in Dallas County...</i>

346
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,246
stated that I had signed a confession...

347
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,949
that I had confessed
to the killing of Robert Wood...

348
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:31,343
and they had their killer
and they were ready to go with it.

349
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:37,114
<i>The statement that I signed
for Dallas County...</i>

350
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:40,094
was never...

351
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:44,490
and never would have been anything
as "a confession."

352
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,658
But yet, they labeled it as such.

353
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:52,571
<i>Of course, I couldn't dispute this
because I didn't even know about it.</i>

354
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:57,245
I heard no news.
I knew nothing for two weeks.

355
00:29:57,345 --> 00:30:00,241
They kept me completely away
from everybody.

356
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:08,389
Several times we talked to her,
trying to get her to recall.

357
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:12,627
"Do you recall the license number?
Do you recall anything to help us?"

358
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,396
And she gave us
a pretty good description of the car.

359
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:18,995
As it turned out, her description
of the car was real close.

360
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:30,611
It comes out that we weren't
looking for a blue Vega.

361
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,038
We were looking for a Comet.

362
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:39,178
No telling the man-hours
we literally wasted...

363
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:41,177
looking for a blue Vega.

364
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:50,658
There is a difference
between a Vega and a Mercury Comet.

365
00:30:50,998 --> 00:30:54,531
So in reality, in regard to cars...

366
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:58,236
every piece of information
that was called in...

367
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:02,673
they were calling in regard to a Comet,
I mean, a Vega.

368
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:14,255
The people that called in were truthful,
trying to help.

369
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,958
They really were trying to help.

370
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,556
We just all had the wrong information.

371
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,451
There wasn't a mark on this car
David Harris had stolen.

372
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:45,116
Wasn't a mark.

373
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:48,013
Do you think a car sitting still...

374
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,857
starting from a stop,
heading up a hill...

375
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,996
with a woman standing right behind it...

376
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,298
<i>that is a very good shot
with a pistol...</i>

377
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,301
She should have hit
the damn thing one time. She didn't.

378
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:04,205
I wish to God she had blown whoever
was driving the car's head off...

379
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,666
because I wouldn't have been here.

380
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,046
I went back several times...

381
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:15,616
and with Mr. Cunningham,
he and I both searched...

382
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:20,216
and could find no indications that
that car had been hit by gunfire.

383
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:24,992
Later on, he finally found one place...

384
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:28,591
that he felt as though
that a bullet had been creased on it.

385
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:32,797
But before he could tell me about it,
his daughter totaled the car out.

386
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,826
<i>Totally demolished it.</i>

387
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:42,299
I was doing burglaries
and some robberies...

388
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,981
and a few possession cases
and stuff like that.

389
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,283
I think he just came up to me and said:

390
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:52,987
"Are you Edith James?
I'd like to talk about my case."

391
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:55,482
That's the way I remember it, anyhow.

392
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:58,993
And I said, "Sure."
And I said, "What sort of a case is it?"

393
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,829
<i>He said, "It's a capital
murder." And I said...</i>

394
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:03,497
Inside, I kind of thought:

395
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:07,927
"I've never done one,
but I can surely talk to him about it."

396
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:13,199
I hate to be considered...

397
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,678
some kind of dummy that believes
in the innocence of her clients.

398
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:22,583
A lot of people think,
"A woman lawyer...

399
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:26,649
"she's bound to stupidly believe
anything she's told."

400
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:30,823
I admit, I'm sort of a gullible person.

401
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:34,362
But on the other hand,
I've seen an awful lot of people...

402
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:37,265
who admitted guilt
or were found guilty...

403
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:42,093
and all but Randall turned out
to be guilty, in my opinion.

404
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,933
<i>Douglas Mulder had a perfect win record.</i>

405
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:53,814
<i>I believe he resigned from the
D.A. 's office without any defeats.</i>

406
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:55,945
<i>That's why he's legendary.</i>

407
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,354
Everything, as I recall,
that Mulder ever said...

408
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:02,523
was about what a great guy Mulder was...

409
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,816
<i>and how marvelous it was that
he was getting all these convictions.</i>

410
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:13,227
<i>I wanted somebody else in on it,
so I got Dennis interested in it...</i>

411
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:16,270
because Dennis has a lot more
trial experience...

412
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,539
and Dennis wins
practically all of his jury cases.

413
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,477
And Dennis was very enthusiastic
about the Randall Adams case...

414
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:25,713
because he kept saying,
"This is one we can win.

415
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,881
"They don't have substantial evidence.
All they've got is David Harris."

416
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,583
I prepared a motion for a continuance
to get more time to try the case...

417
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:39,860
and in doing that had to lay out
my schedule for several weeks...

418
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,685
as to exactly what time
I'd be in Vidor, Texas.

419
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:47,034
<i>Vidor is the headquarters of the
Ku Klux Klan for the state of Texas.</i>

420
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:50,104
<i>It's a city where black people
will not spend the night.</i>

421
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:54,363
<i>Black people won't even stop there
to get their car filled with gasoline.</i>

422
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:57,778
<i>And furthermore, the people of Vidor
were under the impression...</i>

423
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:01,047
<i>that the policeman that was murdered
was a black man.</i>

424
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:04,149
<i>I had to stop at a motel on the way.</i>

425
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:07,521
My wife and I stayed in one room,
the lady lawyer in another room.

426
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:12,087
We arranged to get up very early,
go to Vidor and start our investigation.

427
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:14,717
At about 6:00 in the morning...

428
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,887
Edith James, the lady lawyer, got up...

429
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:20,801
and was looking for me.

430
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:24,405
While she went out in the parking lot
to find me, she went to one room...

431
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,140
and someone in the parking lot said:

432
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,442
"If you're looking
for the lawyer from Dallas...

433
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,045
<i>"he's in room..."
And he gave her the room number.</i>

434
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,847
I immediately began to suspect...

435
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:37,174
from the time I was that close to Vidor,
I was being followed and observed.

436
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:40,688
<i>Doug Mulder had been there
the week before I had...</i>

437
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:43,354
<i>and had told the people
in Vidor that I was...</i>

438
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:46,921
an Eastern-educated
civil liberties attorney...

439
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:51,930
and that I was down there
to discredit David Harris.

440
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:58,039
And then I had been recommended
to see one particular policeman...

441
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,942
who had been led
to the solution of this case.

442
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,944
And I had the impression...

443
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:07,645
that he was the one honest policeman
I could trust in Vidor.

444
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,319
<i>He told me that
after the policeman was killed...</i>

445
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,622
David Harris went back to Vidor.

446
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:18,592
But before he was arrested,
he committed a robbery down there...

447
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:22,763
and had someone on the floor
of a 7-Eleven type of store...

448
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:24,758
with a shotgun at her throat.

449
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,056
Got back there...

450
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:31,704
robbed O'Bannion's 7-Eleven
with a.22 rifle.

451
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,873
Committed some other burglaries
and what have you.

452
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,746
All this time I was on probation.
Juvenile probation.

453
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,577
Eventually I turned myself in
for this stuff in Vidor.

454
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:55,227
I think I made a confession.
I can't even remember exactly.

455
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,295
So I'm told I did.

456
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:06,740
He had told us he had robbed stores,
and we laughed.

457
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,642
"Sure, we know you have."

458
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:10,744
I'd given him one of my hats.

459
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:13,848
It's an old Bonnie-and-Clyde-looking
hat, it's turned sideways.

460
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:17,151
<i>We said, "We'll draw you a little
mustache, walk in with that gun.</i>

461
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,646
<i>"Nobody'll know who you are."</i>

462
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:23,791
About 2:00 that morning,
I was asleep and the phone rings.

463
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:27,161
I said, "Hello?" He said, "This is
David." "This is David Harris?"

464
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,830
"Yeah," he said, "I did it.
Will you come and get me?"

465
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,325
I said, "I'm not coming to get you.
I'm asleep."

466
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,702
He didn't have a conscience.

467
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,743
If I do something bad,
it kind of gets to me.

468
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,809
I feel, "Shucks, I shouldn't have done
that. I feel bad about it."

469
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:50,549
But it didn't bother him.
Didn't bother him at all.

470
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,769
<i>We asked the D.A. In Vidor, Texas...</i>

471
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,372
what they were going to do
with little David. They said:

472
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:14,175
"We'll send him
to the Texas Youth Council."

473
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:16,210
And we sort of tried to inquire...

474
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,847
didn't he think it was strange
that there was a robbery committed...

475
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,582
with that same pistol.

476
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:24,851
And here it was David Harris' pistol...

477
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:29,178
David Harris' automobile
that picked up Randall Adams.

478
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,492
Didn't he think it was a little odd...

479
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:35,729
that all the utensils for committing
this so-called murder...

480
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:39,733
were furnished by David Harris
who got off scot-free...

481
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,603
and was being a witness
for the prosecution?

482
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:47,397
And all he said was, "We don't
feel that way in Vidor, Texas.

483
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,610
<i>"Our people just are not that...</i>

484
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,142
"We're not that keen
on ruining a young man's life."

485
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,321
I tried to introduce
the crime spree theory.

486
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,920
The theory that David Harris
was on this series of crimes...

487
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:06,827
both before and after
the killing of the policeman.

488
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,789
That he would be the person who had...

489
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,361
the heart filled with malice
most apt to commit a murder.

490
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:17,562
<i>But the judge would not allow me
to introduce any of those crimes.</i>

491
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:21,233
<i>They'd had a 28-year-old man.</i>

492
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:25,012
The only alternative
would be prosecuting a 16-year-old...

493
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,249
that could not be given
the death penalty under Texas law...

494
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:30,574
where our 28-year-old man could.

495
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,889
That's always been the predominant
motive, in my opinion...

496
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:39,215
for having a death penalty case
against Randall Adams.

497
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:42,162
Not that they had him so dead to rights.

498
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:44,396
But just that he was a convenient age.

499
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:51,639
<i>The judge is supposed to have said...</i>

500
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:55,500
That Don Metcalfe
is supposed to have said...

501
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:59,113
to Jeanette White,
Dennis White's wife...

502
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:02,041
"What do you care? He's only a drifter."

503
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:07,254
I grew up in a family...

504
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:10,785
where I was taught a great respect
for law enforcement.

505
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:14,595
I became acutely aware of the dangers...

506
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:18,365
that police officers go through,
law enforcement officials go through...

507
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:23,102
that I think much of the public
is not really sensitive to.

508
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,273
<i>My father was an FBI man.</i>

509
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:29,643
<i>Probably at the worst possible time
to be in the FBI.</i>

510
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:33,970
<i>It was from 1932 to 1935 in Chicago.</i>

511
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:39,346
<i>He was at the Biograph Theater
the night that Dillinger was killed.</i>

512
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:45,592
<i>It was a hot summer evening.
Little air conditioning in Chicago...</i>

513
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:47,883
<i>and people were out for a walk.</i>

514
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,780
<i>My father would tell me
that when Dillinger was killed...</i>

515
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,349
<i>within a matter of two minutes...</i>

516
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:11,379
<i>people were dipping their
handkerchiefs in the blood...</i>

517
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,287
to get souvenirs.

518
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,456
And he vividly remembered one lady...

519
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,859
who, all she had was a newspaper,
held it up and said:

520
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:23,425
"I bet I'm the only lady from Kansas
City with John Dillinger's blood."

521
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,896
<i>He told me, the "Woman in Red"...</i>

522
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:33,640
she had on an orange dress.
This is trivia, okay?

523
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,777
It looked red under the lights.
He said it was really orange.

524
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:40,581
So she got to be known as the
"Lady in Red" that fingered Dillinger.

525
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:43,441
<i>He said, "It was really
the Lady in Orange."</i>

526
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,354
As her reward, she got a new fur coat...

527
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:51,055
and a one-way ticket
back to her native Romania.

528
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:03,028
His whole story
from the start was two hours late.

529
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:07,438
I met this kid
at around 10:00 in the morning.

530
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,868
He says we met at noon.

531
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:14,615
I say we were at the Bronco Bowl
at 2:00 or 3:00.

532
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,906
<i>He says it was 5:00 or 6:00.</i>

533
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:22,521
Everything that we did coincide with,
he was two hours late.

534
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:28,458
<i>Two hours later.
Two hours into the night.</i>

535
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,199
<i>His testimony is that...</i>

536
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,935
<i>as we were getting off the freeway
on Inwood Avenue...</i>

537
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:38,872
he stated that I'm driving the car...

538
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:40,833
that we're pulled over.

539
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:44,803
He gets scared and he slumps down
in the seat of the car.

540
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,979
<i>That, as the officer walks up...</i>

541
00:42:57,624 --> 00:43:02,454
<i>and shines his flashlight,
and I roll down my window...</i>

542
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:09,167
I pull the pistol out
and blow this man away.

543
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,144
<i>His testimony is...</i>

544
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:20,174
when I finally do drive to the motel...

545
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,684
I get out. I tell him,
"Don't worry about it.

546
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,918
"Forget this ever happened."

547
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,419
<i>That's crazy.</i>

548
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,094
The police officer
was killed at 12:30...

549
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,557
which is about two and a half hours
after he last saw me.

550
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,570
<i>Just before he went into the motel...</i>

551
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,206
he'd gone across the motel courtyard...

552
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:49,543
to a little store over there
and bought some cigarettes.

553
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:53,280
And I was supposed to go and find out
if the man remembered him...

554
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,573
coming in there just before 10:00
to buy the cigarettes.

555
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,745
I didn't get over there
to Fort Worth for a long time.

556
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:06,448
<i>We got some pictures from his family
that didn't show him in jail clothes.</i>

557
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,926
<i>I took the pictures in to show them
to the man behind the counter.</i>

558
00:44:11,698 --> 00:44:14,924
<i>He was very cooperative
and he wanted to help us.</i>

559
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:16,637
<i>But he honestly... He said:</i>

560
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,506
"I don't remember anything
about this guy coming in there...

561
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:23,744
"I couldn't tell one night from another.
Might have been that night or another.

562
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:26,274
"Cause they were always coming
for cigarettes."

563
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,942
His brother...

564
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,377
at first...

565
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:38,281
was saying that at the time
of the murder, that he was home...

566
00:44:39,526 --> 00:44:44,186
watching... I believe it was
a wrestling match on TV.

567
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:49,299
And he said, "Me and my brother likes
wrestling matches. He was with me.

568
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:52,306
<i>"Randall, my brother,
was with me all night long.</i>

569
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,301
<i>"He couldn't have done it."</i>

570
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:57,475
<i>He was trying to cover for his brother.</i>

571
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:02,378
Later, as I recall, he changed...

572
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,245
because he said:

573
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,247
"If I get down there
and perjure myself...

574
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,559
"there's nothing that they can do
because they've got the case."

575
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,259
This is the way I think that he thought.

576
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,765
"They know that my brother did it.

577
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:22,970
"If I get up there and lie,
they are going to have me for perjury.

578
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,640
"I'll be in the penitentiary with him,
and it ain't going to do any good...

579
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,143
"so I just ain't going to testify.
I ain't gonna say nothing."

580
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:33,435
So he backed off
of his story completely...

581
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:37,773
and Adams was left
without any witnesses.

582
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:47,361
Her in-court testimony
and her original statement...

583
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,929
which should be the best.

584
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:51,632
You're talking 15 to 20 minutes
after the killing.

585
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:54,765
Should be the best eyewitness
testimony she's got.

586
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:58,503
It doesn't match. Doesn't match at all.

587
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:18,325
<i>In court, she testified...</i>

588
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:21,617
he got out of the car,
she got out of the car.

589
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:25,359
She positioned herself
at the back of the automobile.

590
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:42,444
Her original statement,
15 minutes after the killing...

591
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:45,252
<i>"a fur-lined collar on the killer."</i>

592
00:46:45,352 --> 00:46:49,454
<i>In court,
"It might have been bushy hair."</i>

593
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,326
The kid testified
that I had a Levi jacket on...

594
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:56,963
which is the same type collar,
basically the same as this.

595
00:46:57,063 --> 00:47:00,934
He testified at pretrial
that he had a fur-lined parka.

596
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:03,168
She's telling you who killed the man.

597
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,697
<i>One person in the car
with the fur-lined collar.</i>

598
00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:21,521
Very convenient that the driver
happened to have bushy hair.

599
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:24,891
All she's got to do
is look at a picture they took of me.

600
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:27,194
But that is not her original statement.

601
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:31,225
It's a hell of a big difference
from "fur-lined collar" to "bushy hair."

602
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:33,491
<i>It's crazy.</i>

603
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:39,539
She went through
two weeks Internal Affairs...

604
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,908
when she comes out,
her testimony changes.

605
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:45,278
She goes in saying one thing,
she comes out saying another.

606
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:47,080
Something happened. What?

607
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,144
"We refreshed her memory."

608
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,926
Friday afternoon,
I think it was Good Friday...

609
00:48:00,026 --> 00:48:02,996
we came back in the courtroom
that afternoon...

610
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:05,766
<i>and we were sort of elated
because we thought...</i>

611
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:07,761
<i>"He's gonna walk."</i>

612
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:10,871
And there's nothing really
in that evidence.

613
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,374
There's just little David Harris,
and nobody believes him.

614
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,544
And so we were very optimistic
about his chances...

615
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,279
until we walked into the courtroom...

616
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:22,549
and here were all these people
standing in front of the bench.

617
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,180
Three of them, anyway.

618
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:27,351
<i>They were taking the oath
to be sworn as witnesses.</i>

619
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:32,184
<i>Mrs. Miller got on the stand
that last afternoon.</i>

620
00:48:32,592 --> 00:48:36,663
And she said,
"That's the man, I saw that man!

621
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:40,200
<i>"I saw Randall Adams' face
just right after..."</i>

622
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,271
She said, "I saw the gun
sticking out of the car...

623
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:48,308
"when he shot that police officer.
And that's the man."

624
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:50,911
And she waved her finger
right toward Randall Adams.

625
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,475
<i>She's the one that got him convicted.</i>

626
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:57,384
When I was a kid,
I used to want to be a detective...

627
00:48:57,484 --> 00:49:00,312
because I used to watch
all the detective shows on TV.

628
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,987
<i>When I was a kid they used to show
these movies with Boston Blackie...</i>

629
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:14,298
<i>and he always had a woman with him.</i>

630
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:18,538
I wanted to be a wife of a detective
or be a detective...

631
00:49:18,638 --> 00:49:20,863
so I always watched detective stories.

632
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:28,515
I'm always looking because
I never know what might come up.

633
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:30,016
Or how I could help.

634
00:49:30,116 --> 00:49:33,376
I like to help in situations like that.

635
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,380
I really do.

636
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,328
It's always happening to me,
everywhere I go...

637
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:44,764
lots of times there's killings
or anything.

638
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:47,055
Even around my house. Wherever.

639
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:51,836
I'm always looking or getting involved,
to find out who did it, what's going on.

640
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,381
I listen to people.

641
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:05,242
And I'm always trying to decide
who's lying, or who killed who...

642
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,680
before the police do.
See if I can beat them.

643
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:10,611
Yeah.

644
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:26,864
<i>I was working at a gas station.
My husband and I both.</i>

645
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:31,206
<i>We weren't getting along well at all.</i>

646
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,047
We were arguing back and forth.

647
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:38,418
We didn't wanna go home, because
we'd rather talk it out in the car...

648
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,220
than go home with the kids and fight.

649
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,953
Had to listen to them, too.

650
00:50:42,555 --> 00:50:46,521
<i>So we were really arguing,
and decided to get something to eat.</i>

651
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:50,664
About that time,
a police came out of a restaurant...

652
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:52,898
on the right hand side of the road...

653
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:56,566
<i>and he went to pull the man over.</i>

654
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:08,113
She turned around.
She was looking hard. She looked.

655
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:11,952
I didn't think she seen the guy,
but she did.

656
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:15,588
Because I said, "What you looking at?"
I knew something had went wrong.

657
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:17,913
She said, "You just shut up and drive."

658
00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:24,155
And I kept telling my husband:
"Slow down so I can see."

659
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:27,434
He said, "Come on,
we're getting out of here.

660
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:30,897
"You're too nosy.
You don't even know what's going on."

661
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:37,042
I had no idea that somebody
was gonna get killed or shot.

662
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,344
So I just drove on.

663
00:51:42,415 --> 00:51:46,186
He was one of these kind
that didn't like getting involved.

664
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:50,286
He wanted to go on. He told me
to shut up and turn around. Don't look.

665
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:53,084
I turned around and looked anyway.

666
00:51:58,398 --> 00:52:02,796
So we heard something,
like backfire or firecrackers.

667
00:52:03,503 --> 00:52:06,506
And so we drove over the bridge,
and I got to thinking.

668
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:10,537
I said: "Em, there're no firecrackers
this time of the year."

669
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,416
I was thinking to myself:

670
00:52:16,516 --> 00:52:20,208
"That couldn't be somebody shooting."

671
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:27,360
It was real dark, and it was cold.

672
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,753
It was hard to see in that car.

673
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:34,555
But his window was down.
The driver's window was down.

674
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:37,867
This is how I got such a good look.

675
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,881
I really couldn't see anything inside.

676
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:51,785
It was kind of... shadows on the window
and stuff.

677
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:55,588
But when he rolled down the window,
what made his face stand out so.

678
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:57,480
The car was dark blue.

679
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:05,565
He had a beard, mustache...

680
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:07,765
kind of dishwater-blond hair.

681
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:13,969
But, like I said, when he was in court,
he sure looked a lot different.

682
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:19,236
All I could just tell by this and this,
that it was him.

683
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,952
I knew that there was
some shots over there.

684
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:28,188
But I didn't want to be
involved in it...

685
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,890
because West Dallas
is a high-crime neighborhood.

686
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,258
One of the biggest.

687
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:34,753
He was more scared of it than I was.

688
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,665
But when you have
black people like that...

689
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:41,501
they don't like
getting involved in nothing.

690
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:43,236
That's just common.

691
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:47,097
Like here, nobody wants
to see nothing or hear nothing.

692
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:50,443
And they'll stay completely
in the background.

693
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:53,179
That's why they were having
such a hard time there...

694
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,682
finding anybody that would come forward.

695
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:58,314
Because it was in
a totally black neighborhood.

696
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:07,221
<i>She believe in, see somebody done
something wrong she should tell it.</i>

697
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,352
'Cause she told on me...

698
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,792
a couple of times...

699
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,766
that I was hauling drugs out of El Paso.

700
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:25,008
Called the sheriff down there,
going to make me open my trunk.

701
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:29,672
So I ended up opening it,
but there was nothing in it.

702
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:36,850
Good grief.

703
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:41,557
She's a ho, but she find out
you done something, she turn you in.

704
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:51,638
Mrs. Miller had testified
at the trial...

705
00:54:51,738 --> 00:54:55,141
that she had gotten off early from her
gas station job...

706
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:59,012
and gone down to pick up her husband
to help him with the bookwork.

707
00:54:59,112 --> 00:55:02,515
We found out that she was not doing
any bookkeeping for that station...

708
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:06,319
because she had been fired
from her job two weeks earlier...

709
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:08,610
for till-tapping, for stealing.

710
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:13,059
<i>The reason that they were
talking to the police at all...</i>

711
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:16,963
was that there'd been a three-day
running knife fight in their apartment.

712
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,932
And they were all booked...

713
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:21,901
for disorderly
and drunk behavior in there...

714
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:25,659
including assault with knives,
and all kinds of stuff.

715
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,876
When they were at the police station,
they suddenly decided to volunteer...

716
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:32,412
all this information
about what they had seen...

717
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:35,044
<i>about the police officer's killing.</i>

718
00:55:36,516 --> 00:55:38,684
A woman called me at my home...

719
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:40,653
and said that she knew this woman...

720
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:44,090
who had testified and identified
Randall Adams from a passing vehicle.

721
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,551
This woman had never told the truth
in her life.

722
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:54,734
<i>She also told me that she had tried
to call the D.A. During the trial...</i>

723
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:58,171
and give this evidence
that this woman was not believable.

724
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:02,430
If their case hinged on this testimony,
this was not believable testimony.

725
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:05,575
They were scum. They were just...

726
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:09,782
actually scum.

727
00:56:09,882 --> 00:56:12,642
<i>He was a black man
and she was a white woman.</i>

728
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:15,178
<i>He came to work the day after.</i>

729
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:20,627
He told me about the policeman
that had gotten shot the night before.

730
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:22,862
And I hadn't heard anything about it.

731
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,154
<i>And I thought
it was another one of these stories.</i>

732
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:29,394
<i>And he brings in these newspapers...</i>

733
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:34,671
and he says he didn't see a thing.
He couldn't see nothing, it was dark.

734
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:37,970
<i>Wheels started rolling
in his head about money.</i>

735
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,111
<i>That's when he got the idea.</i>

736
00:56:44,283 --> 00:56:46,152
Let me put it in his words.

737
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:49,216
For enough money, he would testify...

738
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:51,852
to what they wanted him to say.

739
00:56:52,024 --> 00:56:54,927
He would say anything
they wanted him to say.

740
00:56:55,027 --> 00:56:58,754
Or he would see anything
that they wanted him to see.

741
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:01,066
Those were his words.

742
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,640
I was shocked that he did go ahead...

743
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,137
and get up and tell
that he saw the actual shooting...

744
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:15,610
and recognized the boy. Identified him.

745
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:20,576
<i>That's when I called Dennis White.
I told him, "That man's lying."</i>

746
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:25,947
Nobody has that good of an eyesight.

747
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:34,490
From where the policeman was shot
and from where they were at...

748
00:57:36,836 --> 00:57:39,971
I doubt if you could have
even seen them with binoculars.

749
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:45,743
<i>I'm a salesman.</i>

750
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:48,705
<i>And you develop
something like total recall.</i>

751
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,850
I don't forget places, things...

752
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:55,613
or streets.

753
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:59,158
Because it's a habit,
something I just picked up.

754
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:02,894
I just stare intensely at people
and try to figure them out.

755
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:07,724
<i>Being nosy, I just stare.</i>

756
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,203
<i>I was leaving the Plush Pub one night...</i>

757
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:18,806
driving a 1977 Cadillac...

758
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,810
<i>heading west on Hampton.</i>

759
00:58:22,014 --> 00:58:25,513
I noticed an officer had
two individuals pulled over...

760
00:58:25,785 --> 00:58:28,510
to the curb in a blue...

761
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:31,021
<i>some type of vehicle.</i>

762
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:34,025
<i>It was a blue...</i>

763
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:39,386
It was a blue Ford.
It was a blue something.

764
00:58:42,668 --> 00:58:46,472
The driver, I think, had long blond hair
and a moustache.

765
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:49,639
And the other one
didn't have no hairs on his face.

766
00:58:54,146 --> 00:58:57,850
<i>A person that is white
going through that area at night...</i>

767
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,517
he's a sore thumb,
he stick out for the first reason.

768
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:05,157
And if they don't look right,
they're gonna stop you.

769
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,956
<i>The officer,
he walked up to the vehicle.</i>

770
00:59:12,598 --> 00:59:14,133
<i>His car was behind...</i>

771
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:16,436
I don't know
if it was behind or in front...

772
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:20,194
but I know he had him pulled over,
and he was up to the car.

773
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:24,171
I think he was up to the car.
Let me think.

774
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:26,936
Yeah, he was up to the car.

775
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,749
As we was coming by
he had to have been up to the car.

776
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,461
I didn't see no bullet.
I didn't see no gunfire.

777
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:43,422
Because I went on.

778
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:02,571
We have three people
that testified and identified him...

779
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:06,984
positively as being the driver
at the time that Wood was walking...

780
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:08,877
right beside the car.

781
01:00:09,288 --> 01:00:12,792
So we know that he was the driver
from the witnesses...

782
01:00:12,892 --> 01:00:14,427
and we also know...

783
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,719
that it was the driver
that shot Officer Wood...

784
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:19,756
coming from his partner.

785
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:22,468
<i>We couldn't have made a case...</i>

786
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:25,538
<i>with the voluntary statement
that we got from Adams.</i>

787
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:27,965
We had to rely on witnesses.

788
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,202
And this is what we did.

789
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:35,002
I always tried very hard,
every judge I know of does...

790
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,609
to not show emotion on the bench.

791
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,386
The reason, if you do show emotion...

792
01:00:40,486 --> 01:00:44,281
the jury might take it that
you're favoring one side or another.

793
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:49,124
So you try to remain passive,
emotionless, objective.

794
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:52,098
I do have to admit
that in the Adams case...

795
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:54,033
and I've never really said this...

796
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:57,803
Doug Mulder's final argument
was one I'd never heard before.

797
01:00:57,903 --> 01:01:00,840
About the "thin blue line" of police...

798
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,734
that separated the public from anarchy.

799
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:08,314
I have to concede that there
my eyes kind of welled up...

800
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,982
when I heard that.

801
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:13,581
It did get to me emotionally,
but I don't think I showed it.

802
01:01:36,008 --> 01:01:37,903
<i>In death penalty cases...</i>

803
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:41,180
we have a question,
or we did at the time...

804
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,984
of whether or not that person
is of a dangerous mentality...

805
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:47,878
and might be expected
to commit other crimes.

806
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:50,783
<i>To answer that question...</i>

807
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:55,795
<i>the Dallas District Attorney sends
psychiatrists to the defendant's cell...</i>

808
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:58,030
to discover
whether he is without remorse...

809
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,959
and therefore is a dangerous
and psychopathic personality.

810
01:02:02,268 --> 01:02:04,737
Of course,
in the instance of a person...

811
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:09,303
who did not commit the crime,
they're not going to show remorse.

812
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:12,678
<i>There were two psychiatrists
that appeared again and again.</i>

813
01:02:12,778 --> 01:02:15,913
<i>Holbrook and Grigson,
the "Killer Shrinks."</i>

814
01:02:16,716 --> 01:02:21,148
There was certain criticism
directed against these two people...

815
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:27,593
because, in effect, whenever they
showed up, the purpose of their visit...

816
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:29,884
was to kill the defendant.

817
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:34,460
It was April 15th, tax day.

818
01:02:35,768 --> 01:02:38,604
I think I was filling out
my taxes at the time.

819
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:40,531
Afraid I might be late.

820
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:44,299
A guard walks up to the door...

821
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:48,044
tells me, "There's someone out here
who wants to talk to you."

822
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:52,251
I ask him who it was.
He said he didn't know...

823
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,488
but the court ordered me to talk
to him. I said, "All right."

824
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:59,417
<i>And here come this real tall,
ostrich-looking dude.</i>

825
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:03,152
<i>He introduced himself as Dr. Grigson.</i>

826
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:07,400
He pulled a pad out
of his coat pocket...

827
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,998
that had a line drawn across it.

828
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,429
On this pad, on the upper half...

829
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:17,105
he had six images.

830
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,546
I will say a box, a square,
a circle with a diamond in it.

831
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:23,314
<i>I don't... It's been awhile.</i>

832
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:28,180
<i>He slides this piece of paper across
to me and he hands me a pencil.</i>

833
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:31,081
<i>He says,
"I'm going to get a cup of coffee.</i>

834
01:03:31,323 --> 01:03:34,083
<i>"Please copy
what's on this piece of paper."</i>

835
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:39,790
I'm looking at this man.

836
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,936
I said, "What? You want it copied
just the same way you did?

837
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:47,139
"Or you want me to change them
around? What do you want me to do?"

838
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:49,842
He said, "Just do
whatever you think you want to do."

839
01:03:49,942 --> 01:03:51,268
And he left.

840
01:03:52,478 --> 01:03:55,314
So on the bottom half
of this piece of paper...

841
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,484
I made my boxes and X's...

842
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,275
and zeros with diamonds in it.
Exactly like his.

843
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:05,991
He asked me...

844
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:10,250
"What's the meaning of
'A rolling stone gathers no moss?"'

845
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,159
I'm looking at this man.

846
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:16,602
I said, "Are you kidding? Is this
a joke? What are you doing?"

847
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:20,497
He said, "No, I really want to know
your answer to that question."

848
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:24,610
I said, well,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss."

849
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,844
I said, "To me...

850
01:04:27,012 --> 01:04:31,342
"it would represent that a person
that doesn't stand still long enough...

851
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:34,485
"it's kind of hard for people
to cling to him.

852
01:04:34,587 --> 01:04:38,450
"If he keeps moving around,
it's hard to get close to him."

853
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:40,490
He shook his head.

854
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:44,923
He said, "What about 'A bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush"'?

855
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:49,468
I said, "If you have a hold of
something, why give it up...

856
01:04:49,568 --> 01:04:52,738
"for a chance of getting something
that might be a little better?

857
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:56,408
"It doesn't make sense. You've got
something good, why let go of it?

858
01:04:56,508 --> 01:04:58,878
"If you can get the other one,
get it if you can...

859
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,705
"but don't let go of what you got
to try to get something else."

860
01:05:03,215 --> 01:05:06,018
He asked about my family.

861
01:05:06,118 --> 01:05:08,343
He asked about my background.

862
01:05:09,688 --> 01:05:11,150
And he left.

863
01:05:12,324 --> 01:05:15,288
Total time we had talked,
maybe 15, 20 minutes.

864
01:05:17,963 --> 01:05:22,401
Dr. Grigson was up there testifying
he would commit violent crimes...

865
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,794
in the future if he was released.

866
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:29,241
Grigson is known as "Dr. Death"
because he always testifies that way.

867
01:05:29,341 --> 01:05:31,343
<i>In about 99% of the trials...</i>

868
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:34,647
<i>that he's been a witness for the
prosecution, he always testifies...</i>

869
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:38,212
<i>that they will commit
violent crimes in the future.</i>

870
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:42,485
<i>You can't tell what
somebody's gonna do years from now.</i>

871
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:44,214
<i>Not really.</i>

872
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:48,684
<i>Except based on your past record,
which anybody can do.</i>

873
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:55,525
Randall never had any prior record.

874
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:59,899
And as far as we know, he never had
any history of violence whatever.

875
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:05,075
Grigson testified for...

876
01:06:05,644 --> 01:06:08,870
two and a half hours
about all these degrees he's got.

877
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:12,978
He's been here, and he's been there,
and he's studied here.

878
01:06:13,852 --> 01:06:16,043
He called me Charlie Manson.

879
01:06:16,221 --> 01:06:18,616
He called me Adolf Hitler.

880
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:21,557
He said I'm the type of personality...

881
01:06:21,994 --> 01:06:25,027
that can work all day
and creep all night.

882
01:06:26,932 --> 01:06:29,396
He testified, Grigson...

883
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,541
that the future seriousness...

884
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:39,637
of my mental state...

885
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:42,381
would be such
that if they released me...

886
01:06:42,481 --> 01:06:45,317
I would go crazy and
probably butcher half of Dallas County.

887
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:48,245
Even though he talked to me
15 minutes...

888
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:52,458
I have no prior convictions,
no prior arrests...

889
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:55,294
I was nonviolent for 28 years.

890
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:56,729
On one instance...

891
01:06:56,829 --> 01:07:00,055
and that's saying if I did this,
which I didn't...

892
01:07:00,399 --> 01:07:04,436
<i>he's stating that, that's enough...
For the rest of my life, watch me.</i>

893
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:08,570
Don't ever turn your back on me.
And he talked to me 15 minutes.

894
01:07:10,976 --> 01:07:12,200
He's crazy.

895
01:07:16,548 --> 01:07:19,852
You can understand why a man
might steal if he needs money...

896
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,780
to put food on the table.

897
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:26,292
I can understand why a 17-year-old
boy who doesn't have a car...

898
01:07:26,392 --> 01:07:28,227
would steal one to ride around in.

899
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:31,553
I can understand
why the heroin addict needs heroin.

900
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:35,990
But it's very hard to understand
why anybody has to kill a police officer.

901
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:38,198
It just doesn't have to be.

902
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,450
When I'm asleep
and I close my eyes and think...

903
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,818
"Why would he do it?

904
01:07:52,918 --> 01:07:55,354
"He had no background
that would lead to murder...

905
01:07:55,454 --> 01:07:57,656
"no reason to commit a murder."

906
01:07:57,756 --> 01:08:00,652
And I look at the facts
of the case and say...

907
01:08:01,126 --> 01:08:04,396
David Harris knew the car was stolen,
knew the guns were there...

908
01:08:04,496 --> 01:08:05,965
knew the guns were stolen...

909
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:08,233
was on a crime spree...

910
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:12,071
had had a criminal record prior to
stealing this car and these guns.

911
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,473
He was the one
that wanted to commit the murder...

912
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:15,874
and get away from the scene.

913
01:08:15,974 --> 01:08:18,410
He was the one that,
after the murder was committed...

914
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:21,873
went right back home
and bragged about it to his friends.

915
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:25,673
I looked at all the evidence...

916
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:29,676
and I found that I believed
that David Harris committed murder.

917
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,422
The jury looked at the same evidence...

918
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:36,590
and found they believed that
Randall Adams committed murder.

919
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:39,225
<i>And it was their verdict that counted.</i>

920
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:05,913
You have a D. A...

921
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:09,628
he doesn't talk about...

922
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,988
when they convict you
or how they convict you...

923
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:17,325
he's talking about
how he's going to kill you.

924
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,439
He don't give a damn if you're innocent.

925
01:09:20,539 --> 01:09:24,140
He don't give a damn if you're guilty.
He's talking about killing you.

926
01:09:31,517 --> 01:09:34,413
<i>You get numb. You get...</i>

927
01:09:35,554 --> 01:09:39,713
It's like a bad dream. You want
to wake up, but you can't do it.

928
01:09:44,463 --> 01:09:48,033
Fifteen times, 20 times a day,
I hear this same story...

929
01:09:48,133 --> 01:09:50,961
about what happens
when a man is electrocuted.

930
01:09:53,205 --> 01:09:55,007
His eyeballs pop out.

931
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,909
His fingernails pop out.

932
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:58,733
His toenails pop out.

933
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:01,645
He bleeds out of every orifice he's got.

934
01:10:08,187 --> 01:10:09,786
<i>They don't care...</i>

935
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:12,921
They don't care.

936
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:17,396
All they want to do is talk about
how they're going to kill you.

937
01:10:17,496 --> 01:10:21,063
That's the only thing that they cared
about and talked about.

938
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:25,800
At that point,
that's all they're wanting.

939
01:10:31,343 --> 01:10:34,774
I didn't have any idea
what happened to him.

940
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:38,876
<i>After I testified, I was gone.</i>

941
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:43,812
<i>I never really concerned myself with it.</i>

942
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,551
Maybe I didn't want to know.
I don't know.

943
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:55,300
I didn't have any interest in knowing...

944
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,068
otherwise I might have tried
to find out.

945
01:11:01,807 --> 01:11:03,775
<i>Dennis filed the motion
for a new trial...</i>

946
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,044
<i>then we filed an amended motion
for a new trial.</i>

947
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:09,108
<i>About 20 days later,
we were to have a hearing on it.</i>

948
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,751
<i>Both Robert Miller and his wife
testified there.</i>

949
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,853
But we could not bring out the fact...

950
01:11:14,953 --> 01:11:18,557
that they had said that they were
gonna get that reward money...

951
01:11:18,657 --> 01:11:21,860
and that they didn't care
whether they saw anything or not...

952
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,651
but their car was too steamed up.

953
01:11:25,797 --> 01:11:27,833
We were not allowed
to get any of that in...

954
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:30,469
because it was held
that it was impeaching testimony...

955
01:11:30,569 --> 01:11:32,704
and therefore it came too late.

956
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:35,666
<i>We kept running into blank walls.</i>

957
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:40,412
<i>A reporter
from the Dallas Morning News...</i>

958
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:44,773
discovered that one week
after the trial was over with...

959
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:49,121
the daughter of this woman
had a robbery case in this court.

960
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,756
<i>She offered her testimony...</i>

961
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:54,193
<i>at a time when her daughter
was in danger of going to jail for life...</i>

962
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:56,428
<i>and got her daughter out of jail.</i>

963
01:11:56,528 --> 01:11:58,330
How can you believe her...

964
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:01,963
when the very next week
the same judge dismisses that case?

965
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,840
The Millers are the kind of people
that would do anything...

966
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,438
if there was something to be gained...

967
01:12:11,943 --> 01:12:15,681
such as her daughter not being sent
to the penitentiary for armed robbery...

968
01:12:15,781 --> 01:12:17,448
or for money.

969
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:22,154
<i>When we went to court that day,
the District Attorney was hard-nosed.</i>

970
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:24,786
<i>Wouldn't let me answer any questions.</i>

971
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,826
He'd ask me questions,
but then he'd cut me off real short.

972
01:12:29,895 --> 01:12:32,598
And that's when he said something
about my big fat nose.

973
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:35,167
If I'd kept my big fat nose
out of their business...

974
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,492
the Millers would be better off.

975
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:41,707
<i>When I started to leave
out of the courtroom...</i>

976
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:44,209
he started laughing, like:

977
01:12:44,309 --> 01:12:46,745
"Didn't do you any good to get up here."

978
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:49,775
It really didn't.
Didn't help the guy at all.

979
01:12:57,656 --> 01:12:59,091
To the best of my recollection...

980
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:01,493
the brief conversations
I have had with Mr. Adams...

981
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:03,262
and they have been brief...

982
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:07,089
I don't even recall ever asking him,
or my having told me...

983
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:09,257
that he did not do it.

984
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:14,434
Because, for my purposes,
representing him on appeal...

985
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,035
<i>it's totally irrelevant.</i>

986
01:13:20,645 --> 01:13:23,473
When the Court of Criminal Appeals
of Texas...

987
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:29,221
voted 9-0 against us,
I was a little upset about that.

988
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,323
I felt we, A: Should have won...

989
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:33,859
B: Certainly shouldn't have been
slapped so hard...

990
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:36,252
with the unanimous decision against us.

991
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:41,867
I was with my family
in an ice-cream parlor...

992
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:45,762
and the judge and his family
happened to come at the same time.

993
01:13:46,104 --> 01:13:49,933
And he came over to me
and made the comment...

994
01:13:51,576 --> 01:13:55,940
"I see where the Court of Criminal
Appeals gave me an 'A'...

995
01:13:56,114 --> 01:13:57,906
"in the Adams case."

996
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:00,252
Our highest state appellate court...

997
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:04,613
the Court of Criminal Appeals
in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.

998
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:08,750
Then it was reversed by the
United States Supreme Court, 8-1...

999
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:13,326
When the Appellate Court
reverses a case...

1000
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:17,423
they are never saying
the trial judge was right or wrong.

1001
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:20,629
They are saying
they disagree with the judge.

1002
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:24,576
You can't, for instance,
in the Adams appeals...

1003
01:14:24,676 --> 01:14:28,647
say the appellate courts
were saying I was right or I was wrong.

1004
01:14:28,747 --> 01:14:31,973
After all, if in Austin...

1005
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:35,220
in our state appeals court,
I was 9-0 correct...

1006
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,751
and in Washington, I was 1-8 incorrect.

1007
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:42,127
If you tally all those votes,
I come out 10-8.

1008
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,258
<i>Yet the case was reversed.</i>

1009
01:14:46,431 --> 01:14:51,227
Eight justices of the Supreme Court
were the first people to agree with me.

1010
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:56,041
They're the only people anywhere
that ever agreed about that statute...

1011
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:58,809
<i>were eight justices
of the Supreme Court.</i>

1012
01:15:00,912 --> 01:15:05,515
<i>The Dallas Morning News
had a very nice front-page story...</i>

1013
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:08,353
either the same day...

1014
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:11,923
or the day after the reversal was
announced by the Supreme Court...

1015
01:15:12,023 --> 01:15:15,283
in which Henry Wade,
the District Attorney...

1016
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,451
<i>vowed a retrial of Randall Dale Adams...</i>

1017
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:22,534
<i>because there was no room
in his book for a cop-killer...</i>

1018
01:15:22,634 --> 01:15:25,997
<i>getting off with anything less
than the death penalty.</i>

1019
01:15:26,738 --> 01:15:30,305
I took that to heart. I thought
I was going to get my chance.

1020
01:15:31,476 --> 01:15:35,168
For reasons
that were never really made public...

1021
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:39,117
Mr. Wade requested
the governor to commute...

1022
01:15:39,217 --> 01:15:42,147
Mr. Adams' death penalty to life...

1023
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:46,625
and that eliminated
the possibility of a retrial...

1024
01:15:46,725 --> 01:15:48,256
based on the reversal.

1025
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:52,524
<i>I was absolutely shocked.</i>

1026
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:54,266
I can't help but believe...

1027
01:15:54,366 --> 01:15:57,169
that some of the motivation
behind that decision...

1028
01:15:57,269 --> 01:15:58,959
was a fear that...

1029
01:15:59,571 --> 01:16:02,569
Adams may be vindicated at a retrial.

1030
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:07,200
I just felt they prosecuted
the wrong person. I don't know why.

1031
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:11,871
I felt that some policeman,
whether in Vidor or in Dallas...

1032
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:16,788
made a decision to prosecute and set
the wheels of justice in motion...

1033
01:16:16,888 --> 01:16:20,625
in the wrong direction and they got
going so fast no one could stop them.

1034
01:16:20,725 --> 01:16:23,462
So I felt it was up to me
to stop them and I didn't.

1035
01:16:23,562 --> 01:16:27,666
I felt it was up to the Supreme Court
and they did what they could, but...

1036
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:30,958
it's all gotten messed up
and derailed again.

1037
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:37,131
<i>Since his trial, I have given up
my practice of criminal law.</i>

1038
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,013
I have not had a jury trial...

1039
01:16:42,113 --> 01:16:45,183
since I heard the verdict
of this jury in this case...

1040
01:16:45,283 --> 01:16:47,508
and don't intend to.

1041
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,755
I just feel like...

1042
01:16:50,855 --> 01:16:55,287
I'll let other people
handle these problems for a while.

1043
01:16:57,262 --> 01:17:01,057
Because if justice
can miscarry so badly...

1044
01:17:01,933 --> 01:17:04,067
I'd rather do something else.

1045
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:08,069
Prosecutors in Dallas
have said for years...

1046
01:17:08,573 --> 01:17:11,367
"Any prosecutor can convict
a guilty man.

1047
01:17:11,843 --> 01:17:14,841
"It takes a great prosecutor
to convict an innocent man."

1048
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:20,619
To this day, I think Mr. Mulder...

1049
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:25,583
believes that the Adams conviction
was one of his great victories...

1050
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:31,084
probably because of some reservations
he has about Adams' guilt.

1051
01:17:37,068 --> 01:17:40,237
I got a call one morning,
a lady here in Vidor...

1052
01:17:40,472 --> 01:17:43,402
had been hit over the head
with a rolling pin...

1053
01:17:44,376 --> 01:17:47,943
and the attacker thought
she'd been knocked unconscious...

1054
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:49,614
when, in reality, she wasn't.

1055
01:17:49,714 --> 01:17:52,781
And she recognized the attacker
to be David Harris.

1056
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,582
He voluntarily
came to the police station.

1057
01:17:59,491 --> 01:18:02,394
I told him,
"David, this girl knows who you are.

1058
01:18:02,494 --> 01:18:04,763
"I don't even have to tell you
I know the truth.

1059
01:18:04,863 --> 01:18:06,565
"You know I know the truth this time."

1060
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:11,436
He said, "I was wrong.
I smoked marijuana, I was drinking.

1061
01:18:11,536 --> 01:18:14,573
"I don't know what got over me
but something just came over me."

1062
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:18,741
<i>But he forgot to mention one thing,
that he was only wearing underwear.</i>

1063
01:18:21,246 --> 01:18:23,882
I felt as though
the attack was sexually oriented.

1064
01:18:23,982 --> 01:18:26,051
He never wanted to admit that...

1065
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:29,354
and, as I recall,
he never really finally admitted it.

1066
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,815
He'd just get
to where he wouldn't deny it.

1067
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:34,656
<i>He posted his bond and went to Germany.</i>

1068
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:39,197
We had a crime
with basically the same M.O. As his...

1069
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:43,524
and so it led me to want to check
and see if he was in town.

1070
01:18:43,702 --> 01:18:46,738
I contacted
the Worldwide Military Locator...

1071
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:49,207
to see if, through the military,
I could locate him.

1072
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:52,533
<i>I did, and found out
that he was in prison at the time.</i>

1073
01:18:53,344 --> 01:18:55,146
<i>He really didn't remember what happened.</i>

1074
01:18:55,246 --> 01:18:57,315
<i>He said he woke up in the stockade...</i>

1075
01:18:57,415 --> 01:19:01,019
<i>and he'd been told that he beat up
one of his ranking officers.</i>

1076
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,156
We had another occasion to have
a crime that fit his M.O. A lot...

1077
01:19:05,256 --> 01:19:08,159
so I started looking for him again,
and this time...

1078
01:19:08,259 --> 01:19:10,128
I found him in prison in California.

1079
01:19:10,228 --> 01:19:13,865
<i>So I realized again that unfortunately,
he hadn't straightened up.</i>

1080
01:19:13,965 --> 01:19:15,996
<i>He was still having a lot of problems.</i>

1081
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:26,304
I was 16 years old.

1082
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:31,475
I really didn't have no real dealings
with the court systems, etc.

1083
01:19:32,717 --> 01:19:35,112
Didn't know how they worked, really.

1084
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:37,444
Didn't know much about the law.

1085
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,887
<i>Just a young, dumb kid.</i>

1086
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:45,697
Police give you the time of this
and the time this happened...

1087
01:19:45,797 --> 01:19:48,099
and you just correlate
from those events.

1088
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:51,493
You just estimate from that event
what time it was.

1089
01:19:52,137 --> 01:19:53,634
<i>You don't know.</i>

1090
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:55,764
<i>You're taking a guess.</i>

1091
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:01,436
<i>Police tell you, "It was 12:30
when this crime happened.</i>

1092
01:20:07,318 --> 01:20:09,645
<i>"What time did you leave the movie?"</i>

1093
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:12,689
<i>"I know it was somewhere
around midnight.</i>

1094
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:20,198
<i>"It might have been before then.
I don't know.</i>

1095
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:22,432
<i>"I didn't have a watch on."</i>

1096
01:20:33,978 --> 01:20:38,137
<i>He went over my testimony with me
pretty extensively.</i>

1097
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,351
How I should answer certain questions...

1098
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:46,057
things of this nature.

1099
01:20:46,157 --> 01:20:49,383
That's what you call
"coaching the witness."

1100
01:20:49,727 --> 01:20:54,227
<i>Let's get this evidence in a spectrum
where it's going to be most effective.</i>

1101
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:04,973
At the time,
I didn't really ponder on it...

1102
01:21:10,281 --> 01:21:14,315
but he was deceiving the jury.
He wanted to deceive justice.

1103
01:21:14,586 --> 01:21:18,289
That's why I think
that statue with the scales...

1104
01:21:18,389 --> 01:21:21,854
Justice? What is she called?
I don't know what she's called.

1105
01:21:22,493 --> 01:21:24,388
She's got that blindfold on.

1106
01:21:25,063 --> 01:21:28,061
<i>We don't see what goes on
behind the closed doors.</i>

1107
01:21:29,334 --> 01:21:31,627
<i>I had another woman in the car.</i>

1108
01:21:32,437 --> 01:21:35,840
<i>I didn't tell them about that.
My wife'd kill me.</i>

1109
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:40,311
She would've tore my head off if she
knew I was out with another woman.

1110
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:42,169
Would you tell?

1111
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:46,082
That's what happened.
I was trying to get her home.

1112
01:21:49,053 --> 01:21:51,517
The driver's side was down because...

1113
01:21:52,223 --> 01:21:55,688
the lady was a little sick.
She needed some air.

1114
01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:58,422
Because she was pretty drunk.

1115
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:08,873
<i>See, the Millers,
one is black and one is white.</i>

1116
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:12,610
<i>They said I was going with...
The reason I was over that night...</i>

1117
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,946
I was over there
messing with this man's wife.

1118
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:19,046
<i>And I ain't never gone with her in
my life. She was too old and ugly.</i>

1119
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:23,922
Like I said, the D.A. Will
put something into their mouth.

1120
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,850
They could have
prefabricated the whole story.

1121
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:29,561
They sure could have.

1122
01:22:29,661 --> 01:22:32,330
But what I saw is just what I saw.
That was it.

1123
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,565
So if they got paid,
they got paid for lying.

1124
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:42,139
They already decided
what to do with you in the hall.

1125
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:46,511
That's why they call it the Hall of
Justice, the scales are not balanced.

1126
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:49,547
The scales are in the hall,
and they go up and down.

1127
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:54,079
They might go up for you, favor one
way, they might go down against you.

1128
01:22:54,385 --> 01:22:58,612
<i>So if the D.A. Wants you to hang
15 or 20 years, you're hung.</i>

1129
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:04,858
I had all these charges
still pending in Orange County.

1130
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,424
I could have been certified
as an adult...

1131
01:23:12,236 --> 01:23:15,337
maybe given a life sentence.
I don't know.

1132
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,000
I'm 16 years old.
I know I don't want that.

1133
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:24,373
<i>That District Attorney told me,
"Don't worry about them charges."</i>

1134
01:23:24,816 --> 01:23:29,248
<i>"I'm gonna ask your...
Defense Attorney is gonna ask you...</i>

1135
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:31,987
"if you had any kind of deal...

1136
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:35,252
"or anything of that nature...

1137
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:39,228
"in exchange for your testimony
in this case...

1138
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:41,722
"as relating to those charges.

1139
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:48,033
"Don't answer that 'Yes.'
Answer it 'No."'

1140
01:23:53,011 --> 01:23:55,907
My husband,
he didn't get that good a look at him.

1141
01:23:58,549 --> 01:24:02,617
He wasn't sure, because they put
a bunch of them that looked alike.

1142
01:24:03,955 --> 01:24:07,292
<i>They had about three or four
in the lineup that had bushy hair...</i>

1143
01:24:07,392 --> 01:24:11,551
but he had his combed down,
different to what it was in the killing.

1144
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:14,999
I didn't pick him out right then...

1145
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:17,563
because I picked out
this bushy-haired man.

1146
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:25,372
I understand one other witness
did pick out the man at the lineup.

1147
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:28,336
I'm not sure, but I think he did.

1148
01:24:28,546 --> 01:24:32,113
Of course I picked out
Randall Adams just like that.

1149
01:24:33,951 --> 01:24:36,085
I don't know about the others.

1150
01:24:36,954 --> 01:24:39,679
Evidently they did at that time.

1151
01:25:02,547 --> 01:25:04,305
<i>I just took off.</i>

1152
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:07,151
It's like, kids run away...

1153
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:09,821
they don't think about
where they're going to stay...

1154
01:25:09,921 --> 01:25:13,420
how they're going to eat,
all these things.

1155
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:19,130
They had that roof over their head
all their lives.

1156
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:21,466
They don't really think
about those things...

1157
01:25:21,566 --> 01:25:25,133
till you get out there and you say,
"My stomach's growling now."

1158
01:25:26,671 --> 01:25:29,999
<i>Or, "It's getting cold out here.
It's raining."</i>

1159
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:35,880
<i>There was ice on the road.</i>

1160
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:40,674
I remember there was a car coming
pretty fast up the road behind me...

1161
01:25:41,419 --> 01:25:44,122
and didn't see me or something...

1162
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:47,759
or was in one lane and came into
the other lane and I was in that lane...

1163
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:50,595
and tried to stop me.
He went off the side of the road.

1164
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,031
I remember this car
went off the side of the road.

1165
01:25:53,131 --> 01:25:55,356
I'm just looking back.

1166
01:25:59,704 --> 01:26:01,428
I remember that.

1167
01:26:06,944 --> 01:26:10,307
I got a call at my house
about 3:30 one morning.

1168
01:26:10,815 --> 01:26:13,384
One of the patrolmen
in my department called...

1169
01:26:13,484 --> 01:26:17,188
and said, "We just arrested
this boy named David Harris...

1170
01:26:17,288 --> 01:26:21,025
"and he won't even tell us his name.
He said he wants to talk to you."

1171
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:25,125
<i>They told me something that really
made me interested. He'd been shot.</i>

1172
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:29,757
David had initially told me
that he had gone to a bar in Houston...

1173
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:35,139
and was flirting with a young lady
and her boyfriend became upset...

1174
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:39,432
and chased him out with a pistol,
shooting at him.

1175
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:44,042
<i>We knew that wasn't true.</i>

1176
01:26:44,148 --> 01:26:46,684
I said,
"David, I know you're lying to me.

1177
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:50,977
"We go through this all the time,
all my dealings with you in the past.

1178
01:26:51,389 --> 01:26:53,291
"I don't know what you've done just yet.

1179
01:26:53,391 --> 01:26:54,592
"I know you were shot.

1180
01:26:54,692 --> 01:26:57,995
"I know you were shot doing something
that you shouldn't have been...

1181
01:26:58,095 --> 01:27:01,966
<i>"we know you burglarized a gun shop.
We know you were driving drunk.</i>

1182
01:27:02,066 --> 01:27:06,637
"Got witnesses who can identify you,
who can identify your truck."

1183
01:27:06,737 --> 01:27:10,168
I said, "You're caught.
So tell the truth."

1184
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:12,736
And David said, "Okay, I killed him."

1185
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:20,473
<i>Their home was entered while he
and his girlfriend were there alone.</i>

1186
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,520
<i>The man was sent into the bathroom
at gunpoint and told to stay there.</i>

1187
01:27:29,093 --> 01:27:32,353
<i>David took the girl
and was starting to leave.</i>

1188
01:27:33,097 --> 01:27:36,130
<i>The man exited the apartment with a gun.</i>

1189
01:27:37,902 --> 01:27:40,304
The man fell to the ground,
or near the ground...

1190
01:27:40,404 --> 01:27:44,041
holding onto a pole there in the
parking lot of the apartment complex...

1191
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:47,778
and these last, whether it be two,
three, or how many shots...

1192
01:27:47,878 --> 01:27:51,673
I don't know, were fired at point-blank
or near point-blank range.

1193
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,123
David thought that the one
that was really at fault that night...

1194
01:27:59,223 --> 01:28:02,260
was the guy that got killed.
He said, "That guy's crazy.

1195
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,828
"He came after me with a gun."

1196
01:28:03,928 --> 01:28:06,464
I told him,
"David, you'd broken into his house...

1197
01:28:06,564 --> 01:28:09,600
"you abducted his girlfriend,
what was he supposed to do?"

1198
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,336
He said,
"Man shouldn't come out with a gun.

1199
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:15,036
"That dude's crazy.
He should have been killed."

1200
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:20,511
<i>When we went to retrieve the pistol...</i>

1201
01:28:20,611 --> 01:28:22,446
I had to go into the water to get it.

1202
01:28:22,546 --> 01:28:25,416
It was a bayou and it was grassy,
snaky-looking area.

1203
01:28:25,516 --> 01:28:27,718
I was not real pleased
about being there myself...

1204
01:28:27,818 --> 01:28:31,289
but David enjoyed watching me have to
go down there and look for the gun.

1205
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:34,956
I'd been searching several minutes,
he was up on the bridge...

1206
01:28:35,092 --> 01:28:37,195
and probably 25 feet from me...

1207
01:28:37,295 --> 01:28:41,761
directing me to where he thought
that the gun had landed in the water.

1208
01:28:44,635 --> 01:28:46,037
<i>He was handcuffed.</i>

1209
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:49,006
Traffic would come by,
and he would turn around...

1210
01:28:49,106 --> 01:28:52,076
and show them his handcuffs
and holler at them, "Help me!

1211
01:28:52,176 --> 01:28:55,277
"The officials will throw me
in this water and drown me."

1212
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:58,416
<i>Just anything he could do
to make a joke and cut up out there.</i>

1213
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:00,775
<i>He was just really having a good time.</i>

1214
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:06,312
The kid scares me.

1215
01:29:07,858 --> 01:29:12,119
To think that he could actually be
out there, walking the streets...

1216
01:29:12,496 --> 01:29:14,565
and Dallas County let him go.

1217
01:29:14,665 --> 01:29:17,390
The kid had seven crimes
coming down on him.

1218
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:23,033
He had armed robberies.
He had firing on a peace officer.

1219
01:29:23,741 --> 01:29:26,677
He had breaking and enterings,
aggravated assaults.

1220
01:29:26,777 --> 01:29:28,646
God knows what all this kid had.

1221
01:29:28,746 --> 01:29:31,882
And Dallas County gives him
complete immunity for his testimony.

1222
01:29:31,982 --> 01:29:33,376
Just lets him walk.

1223
01:29:44,228 --> 01:29:46,497
<i>My mom had a good phrase.</i>

1224
01:29:46,597 --> 01:29:50,201
She said the first night
she pulled into Dallas, it was raining...

1225
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:52,069
and that it was lightning.

1226
01:29:52,169 --> 01:29:54,372
And they're coming into Dallas...

1227
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:58,335
and she said if there was ever
a hell on earth, it's Dallas County.

1228
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:02,936
She's right.

1229
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:19,563
You deal with people who you sense
bad vibrations, more or less.

1230
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:22,933
You feel, this guy doesn't like me
anyway because I'm a policeman.

1231
01:30:23,033 --> 01:30:26,904
You can just kind of sense something.
Maybe I shouldn't even be saying it...

1232
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,940
because police shouldn't
take these things to the bank.

1233
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:34,700
When you deal with people over
and over, you sense a lot of things.

1234
01:30:34,845 --> 01:30:38,845
<i>Talking to David, you don't ever
feel hostile feelings coming from him.</i>

1235
01:30:39,717 --> 01:30:41,986
I have never seen David any way...

1236
01:30:42,086 --> 01:30:45,722
other than cordial,
friendly to me as he could be:

1237
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:50,353
"Yes, sir." "No, sir."
Never disrespectful.

1238
01:30:51,162 --> 01:30:53,597
I've never seen the bad side.
I've seen the results...

1239
01:30:53,697 --> 01:30:56,434
and I've talked to him about it,
and he's aware of it.

1240
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,827
He remembers the bad side.

1241
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:02,540
But I've never seen him
committing a crime...

1242
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,832
or in a violent or volatile state.

1243
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,744
<i>When his crimes were confessed to...</i>

1244
01:31:11,949 --> 01:31:16,381
he seemed to feel better and do better
during those times.

1245
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,357
His parents would tell me
he would to do better at home...

1246
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:22,526
he seemed to get along better
with the people in town...

1247
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:24,395
his neighbors and friends.

1248
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:26,464
But something happens to David...

1249
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:30,860
I don't know what it is. I don't know
if anybody can put their finger on it.

1250
01:31:35,973 --> 01:31:38,809
<i>But there's no other indication
of anything in the family...</i>

1251
01:31:38,909 --> 01:31:43,045
<i>that would lead you to believe
he had exposure to these activities.</i>

1252
01:31:49,019 --> 01:31:52,723
David's got at least one other brother
and sister that I know of.

1253
01:31:52,823 --> 01:31:57,187
And he had one brother that drowned
numerous years ago.

1254
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,926
I was 3 years old...

1255
01:32:06,403 --> 01:32:08,503
I had a 4-year-old brother...

1256
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:12,302
and he drowned in 1963...

1257
01:32:13,477 --> 01:32:16,514
<i>right after President Kennedy
was assassinated, I believe.</i>

1258
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:19,339
<i>Sometime right after that,
during the summer.</i>

1259
01:32:19,984 --> 01:32:23,415
<i>We was living in Beaumont
on Harrison Street...</i>

1260
01:32:24,955 --> 01:32:27,988
<i>and my dad was working on his truck
out in the yard...</i>

1261
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:32,186
<i>and mom was in the house
doing her housework or fixing dinner.</i>

1262
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:37,031
<i>Me and my brother, we had
one of these little blow-up pools...</i>

1263
01:32:38,168 --> 01:32:40,199
<i>and we were playing in that.</i>

1264
01:32:41,038 --> 01:32:45,197
<i>My dad was supposed to be watching
or keeping an eye on us or something.</i>

1265
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,978
<i>My brother wandered off
down the street...</i>

1266
01:32:48,078 --> 01:32:50,781
<i>and these people had a
swimming pool in their backyard...</i>

1267
01:32:50,881 --> 01:32:53,584
<i>and they were elderly people.
They never used the pool.</i>

1268
01:32:53,684 --> 01:32:56,682
<i>I guess it had a bunch of leaves
and stuff in it.</i>

1269
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,485
<i>And he, evidently,
fell in there and drowned.</i>

1270
01:33:05,796 --> 01:33:10,228
I used to sit up in my room at night
and talk to him and he wasn't there.

1271
01:33:14,004 --> 01:33:18,766
So that might have been some kind of
a traumatic experience for me.

1272
01:33:20,744 --> 01:33:22,343
<i>I guess my dad...</i>

1273
01:33:25,816 --> 01:33:28,886
I don't know, maybe he couldn't
get rid of the responsibility...

1274
01:33:28,986 --> 01:33:32,087
or the guilt or something.
I don't know what it was.

1275
01:33:33,991 --> 01:33:37,061
I was there and I guess maybe
I reminded him of that...

1276
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:39,329
all the time, growing up.

1277
01:33:41,465 --> 01:33:44,225
It was hard for me
to get any acceptance from him.

1278
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:47,805
<i>When my younger brother was born...</i>

1279
01:33:47,905 --> 01:33:51,973
<i>it was kind of like he was Daddy's
favorite or something, I don't know.</i>

1280
01:33:54,745 --> 01:33:59,378
Everybody's life is going to take some
kind of path regardless of what happens.

1281
01:34:02,453 --> 01:34:06,020
I think maybe that a lot of the things
I did when I was younger...

1282
01:34:06,156 --> 01:34:10,759
was an attempt to get back at him
or something...

1283
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:13,157
for the way he treated me.

1284
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:17,560
But I wasn't doing nothing
but hurting myself.

1284
01:34:18,305 --> 01:35:18,226

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,417
No, not at that time of year.

3
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:55,738
She's nice.

4
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,150
To me at least.

5
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:58,903
Well, don't let her fool you.

6
00:00:59,003 --> 00:00:59,947
A tiger.

7
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:03,542
She wears white perhaps the
way other women wear jewelry.

8
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:04,847
The trophy bride.

9
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:06,400
You got her come up and...

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,744
Viagra!

11
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:16,667
If all the pricks that have been stuck into her
were sticking out of her, she'd be a porkey pine.

12
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,203
Ugh, Carl. What an image.

13
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,593
I saw that. That was a cheat.

14
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,979
Now wait. Are you calling me a cheat?

15
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,407
I'm not. Come on.

16
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:28,179
I didn't mean the word pejoratively.

17
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,166
This is Washington after all.

18
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,315
And I happen to be your partner.

19
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,784
Yeah. That too.

20
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,035
Your turn.

21
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:37,445
She just said no and walked out.

22
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:39,069
Well how much did you offer?

23
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,425
400 a week.

24
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,590
The rich have such a touching faith
in the efficacy of small funds.

25
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,522
Tennessee Williams said that.

26
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:47,924
So did I.

27
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:51,904
That's a beautiful meld
you got going there.

28
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:53,879
What have you got over there?

29
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,628
Nothing. Really. My hand is so bare.

30
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,886
Hey, do you wanna take some of these?

31
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,102
Is that a legal?

32
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,128
Did you notice Candice Howard?

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,911
Purple is an acceptable color.

34
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,418
Just not her color.

35
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,183
Not on a dress at least.

36
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:13,370
I told her it was a wonderful fabric and
she was fortunate to get so much of it.

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,944
Some day her prince will come.

38
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:21,746
Not before she kisses a lot of frogs.

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,756
The city is asking, What
can they be talking about?

40
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,089
Such different women. What
do they have in common?

41
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,105
You, Carl.

42
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,258
Besides that?

43
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,089
Nothing.

44
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,179
They know damn well
what we're talking about.

45
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,178
Them.
- They wish.

46
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,806
Wednesday's canasta at the Hargrave.

47
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:45,462
I don't understand these women today.

48
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,323
God forbid a man to give them anything!

49
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:48,459
Have you played?

50
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,283
Yes. I will. No, I've
not thrown down. Here.

51
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:52,666
Yes, you're absolutely right, Natalie.

52
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,653
I mean is that enough to
be a wife and a mother?

53
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:57,764
You've got to stand in a
soup kitchen and wear a suit.

54
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,973
That's the former First Lady.

55
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:05,940
No politics, girls. Surrounded by a
sea of special interest, we float above.

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,560
Carl Page has crowed.

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,692
You want that Jack?

58
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,888
Well, they make it sound like a coven.

59
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,460
Let them wonder how much we know.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,932
How much do we know?

61
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,819
Everything.

62
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:19,756
All the dirt dished in this great city.

63
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:24,477
All the human waste exited by our
friends and fellow human beings.

64
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:28,295
All of it, sooner or later,
passes through these ears.

65
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:30,545
This is shit centre, darlings.

66
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:32,451
Lovely.

67
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:34,042
Come on, Carl. Finish that story.

68
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:34,855
Which story?

69
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,141
John Corring.

70
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:37,765
And Faye Juliette?

71
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:38,733
Yes.

72
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:43,879
Quiet dinner for six in the
South that's like Tenderwood.

73
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,470
'John?', Julia says to her husband.

74
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,095
Why is it you never fuck me anymore?

75
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,612
Her tone changes.

76
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:56,122
Because when you do,
you're so good at it.

77
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,326
The room quiets.

78
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,775
She turns to Jessie,
'Isn't he good at it?'

79
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:07,146
Jessie and her husband freeze.

80
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:11,057
Just as the guests smell
danger, Corring says...

81
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:16,084
Precious lamb, I never fuck you because
ever since you went to Jenny Craig...

82
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:20,298
You're such a little bitty thing
I can't find you under the covers.

83
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:25,151
Thrilled, Julia had answers, 'You
really think I did some good?'

84
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:27,274
Oh, my goodness.

85
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:29,564
I heard Corring throws
from the other side.

86
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:30,503
Really?

87
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:32,628
He's straight. Believe me.

88
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:33,862
You're pretty sure?

89
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:38,028
One thing I can tell is whether
a man is homosexual or not.

90
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:39,154
Oh, how?

91
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:42,057
I am the gay 'Wether Vain'.

92
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:45,949
Little signals you know. It
might be his choice of words...

93
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,852
The way his tie's knotted. Or...

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,819
How hard he gets when he hugs me.

95
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,520
It's your turn.

96
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,129
Stop.

97
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,274
I'll never understand you, Carl.

98
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:18,805
You luxuriate in the
company of these... Ugh!

99
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,988
You know the damage
those women... Well, no.

100
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,487
Their husbands have done
to the things we care about?

101
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:27,962
I will fuck a congressman to
stop nuclear proliferation.

102
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,435
Please, Carl.

103
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:34,117
Mr. and Mrs. Stanley, he of the State
Department, opened up to Washington Post.

104
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:39,013
To see their precious baby daughter
chained to a nuclear train. With who was it?

105
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:40,461
Peter Bayhon.

106
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:44,966
Holding up a sign that says I
will eff Esther as a congressman.

107
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,871
I'd be careful. I remember
you in Jordash jeans.

108
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,773
Oh, please. Okay?

109
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,128
You still on for the
opera benefit Saturday?

110
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,448
I thought Larry was back.

111
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:57,804
My husband hates high culture.

112
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:59,552
He wasn't born to it.

113
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,436
Neither was I.

114
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,306
You transformed yourself.

115
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,248
Yeah.

116
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:08,686
What about next week?

117
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,664
Do you mean...?

118
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:16,691
You gotta watch yourself. This
is a brutal political climate.

119
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,966
Whatever ruth there ever was in this
town, there's less now than ever.

120
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,082
You only get to live once. What's
wrong with a little pleasure?

121
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,217
That my dear is a very
difficult question to answer.

122
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,481
Promise me you'll always be my friend.

123
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,426
I promise.

124
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,360
Hey, Carl. It's Emek here once again.

125
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,449
Please call me back. I've
been trying to reach you.

126
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,658
Please call me. Okay? Bye-bye.

127
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:52,344
Carl, are you there? Pick
up darling. It's Abby.

128
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,925
Carl? Are you there?

129
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,717
If you're there pick up.

130
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:36,992
Hallo?

131
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,111
Abby.

132
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,489
My Sunflower.

133
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:41,427
Carl.

134
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:43,238
So, tell...

135
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:46,053
How was that dinner party?

136
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:47,762
I need a dirt fix.

137
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,719
Was it just...? Well...

138
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,915
Too much?

139
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,801
Oh, God. I can hear my hair growing.

140
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:59,338
The Austrian embassador. Imagine
wasting me seated next to him.

141
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:04,146
And the House Speaker. I mean is he always
that tedious or is it just around me?

142
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:08,736
He's like one of those circus midgets.

143
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,383
They grow and answer
two, they lose their job.

144
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,445
Are you in bed yet?

145
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,350
No.

146
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,303
Tuck yourself in.

147
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,485
Let me tell you a bedtime story.

148
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:31,564
I went public transport for the help.

149
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:38,198
Yes. It's a little pricy.
But what isn't these days?

150
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,786
Okay. I'll call you back.

151
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,281
Send this out as quick as you can.

152
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,732
Yes, Sir.
- Good.

153
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:49,920
Carl, I swear, you are
my most punctual employee.

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,962
Well, I was brought up right.

155
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,468
Besides, it's only one day a week.

156
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,779
So what's new on the grape vine?

157
00:09:57,218 --> 00:10:01,374
Embassador Sing still hasn't
closed on that town house.

158
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:05,986
Problem getting foreign affairs minister
to prove the allocation. All that red tape.

159
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:07,918
He's not too smart as it is.

160
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:11,170
The wheel is turning
but the hamster's dead.

161
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,930
One thing I do hear though.

162
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,731
This is interesting. The debt
notes after the energy scandal...

163
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,459
They are overextended.

164
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:25,709
I can list ten buyers
who jump at that property.

165
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:54,246
Abby.

166
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:55,412
You know what you are?

167
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:57,734
You are the absolutely perfect date.

168
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,751
Keep it coming.

169
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:00,584
Carl?

170
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,126
I'm glad you could make it.

171
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,961
We must support the arts.

172
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,336
Where's Larry?

173
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,532
Public policy conference.

174
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:11,407
Lucky guy.

175
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:12,937
He'd rather be anywhere than here.

176
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:14,456
She exaggerates.

177
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,434
We don't see enough of each other.

178
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,501
Let's get together.

179
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:20,457
Why don't you call the
office and set something up?

180
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:21,839
Be my pleasure.

181
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,508
Your father was a great man.

182
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,726
He was so proud of you.

183
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,438
Yes, he was.

184
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,064
Hey.

185
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:30,875
Al.

186
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:36,273
Fuck him.

187
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,420
He knows exactly how
my father felt about me.

188
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,841
He hates my guts.

189
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,002
Mine too.

190
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,933
Why people marry whom they
marry, I'll never understand.

191
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,599
Darling, don't let me commence.

192
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:48,884
U.S. Attorney

193
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,108
Do you know Mungo Tenant?

194
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:53,727
Not really.

195
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,693
I was just being polite.

196
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,694
Will you excuse me for a moment?
There's someone I have to see.

197
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,241
I'll be right back.

198
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,742
Carter? Lynn? How are you doing?

199
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:13,783
Peachy.

200
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,200
Peachy?

201
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:16,663
That's the word.

202
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,993
How are you?

203
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,629
I'm fine, Robbie.

204
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,418
How are things in the private sector?

205
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,469
Any more investment tips?

206
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,258
Carl? You're not still
sorry about AltiMed?

207
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,715
Let's get together. Maybe
I can make it up to you.

208
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,924
I don't wanna be scolding twice.

209
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,166
How about next week?

210
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,284
Here we go.

211
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,704
I'll see you then.

212
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,946
Will you excuse me? I have
to get back to my seat.

213
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:58,115
<i>Come la notte i furti miei seconda.

214
00:12:58,215 --> 00:12:59,021
What?

215
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,984
It's from tonight's performance.
The Marriage of Figaro.

216
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:06,555
<i>How the night favors my secret plans.

217
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,893
You're so smart.

218
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:55,698
Hey, Emek.

219
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:57,403
Hey, Carl.

220
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,275
I tried to call you.

221
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:02,406
Not very hard, you didn't.

222
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:04,484
Don't be like that.

223
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:07,264
How should I be?

224
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:12,262
What? Now?

225
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:13,437
Yes, now.

226
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,683
We've had this discussion, didn't we?

227
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,339
Don't be such a kid.

228
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,866
Do you wanna talk?

229
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,064
I got a date.

230
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:33,093
With who?

231
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,661
Fun Barry.

232
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,879
Don't quote Oscar Wilde to me.

233
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,709
Anybody, but Wilde.

234
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:45,722
Say good night, Carl.

235
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,461
We talk tomorrow.

236
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:54,230
<i>I'm very sorry to keep you waiting.

237
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,773
<i>Do you want another drink
or something?

238
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:56,926
<i>That's okay.

239
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:20,235
He sees himself as quietly a state.

240
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:24,055
But when she's done with him,
he'll eat red meat and women.

241
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,589
What about you?

242
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,429
You talk about everyone else.
But you never talk about yourself.

243
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,785
I'm not that interesting.

244
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:37,564
I mean you do have a private life.

245
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:40,747
I let you in on a little secret.

246
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:43,839
I've invented my own sex.

247
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,294
See how they hushed?

248
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:51,649
Absolutely hushed when I leaned forward?

249
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:55,508
All those big ears wondering
what old Carl was saying.

250
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:58,949
You haven't always been old, Carl.

251
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:03,851
In fact, I remember a young
Carter Page who once...

252
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,627
I believe...

253
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,737
Attempted to ask me out.

254
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,878
The seventies were a confusing decade.

255
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:14,271
A lot of things were blurred.

256
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,375
Still that was an interesting notion.

257
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,884
You wanna hear a personal story?

258
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:26,032
Okay, I tell you a personal
story. Not about me, of course.

259
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:32,032
About my grandfather, Carter Page I.
- plantation Page

260
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,958
This is before he started devilling
in politics, became governor.

261
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:40,001
19 years old. Coldville, Virginia.

262
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:47,576
He had fallen in love with a photograph of
a young woman, Johanna Comb of Philadelphia.

263
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,130
For a year they corresponded daily.

264
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,965
My grandfather looking at
her picture as he wrote...

265
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:56,977
I honestly hope...

266
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:59,756
The day another Christmas
shall have come...

267
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:04,269
Our longings will have been
displaced by full fruition.

268
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:10,584
My grandfather always talked like a
man with a Bible half-open in his head.

269
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,127
He boarded the National to Philadelphia.

270
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:16,603
That night they went to the Opera.

271
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,221
And in a mission he got up...

272
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:22,914
Returned home to Coldville,
married my grandmother.

273
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:28,983
The two pen pals, Carl and
Johanna, never saw each other again.

274
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,861
When my grandfather and grandmother had
their first child, they named her Johanna.

275
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:43,741
And that's it?

276
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:45,873
That's the story?

277
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,100
That's all I ever heard.

278
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,929
I'd give my right arm
to know the rest of it.

279
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,630
Don't say it.

280
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:14,211
I mean is it so
important? It's just sex.

281
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,394
And that stuff you're
breathing, it's just oxygen.

282
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:20,939
You must get pretty lonely
up there on that pedestal.

283
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,284
I appreciate it. I really do.

284
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:28,819
Oh, yes.

285
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:30,886
I bet you do.

286
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:31,787
Stop.

287
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,094
He's...

288
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:49,689
He's dead.

289
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:51,686
What?

290
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:53,955
Oh, no.

291
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:00,521
He is all... He is stabbed over.

292
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:02,828
Robbie is dead?

293
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:04,129
With a knife.

294
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:10,955
I called him this morning.
I was gonna see him tonight.

295
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,167
You're gonna call the police?

296
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:23,223
Yeah. We should.

297
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,499
Carl?

298
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,378
It would destroy everything.

299
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:45,475
It would destroy Larry.

300
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,616
The media.

301
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,744
It would destroy me.

302
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:05,678
Carl?

303
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:10,998
What did you touch?

304
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,618
Nothing.

305
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:15,273
The doorknob and the door was open.

306
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,089
Is the door still open?

307
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,062
Let's get you home.

308
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,698
If anybody asks just...

309
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:31,468
Tell them we went for a drive, talked
about the old days. I dropped you off.

310
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:38,403
Lynn?

311
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:43,012
Is there something
you're not telling me?

312
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:44,243
No.

313
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,356
No. Honest, Carl.

314
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,635
There were no fights. No.

315
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:52,850
Not anything.

316
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,386
You must believe me.

317
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:55,858
I do.

318
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:02,277
He was all blood.

319
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,173
Thank you.

320
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,340
There's been a murder.

321
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:04,299
Please send the police and the EMS.

322
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,784
943, 25th Street, North West.

323
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:14,215
Carter Page III.

324
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:17,219
Yes. I'll be here.

325
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:41,466
Check out the vases
in the cabinet. Okay?

326
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:48,439
So.

327
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,532
What did your friend do?

328
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,965
He was a lobbyist.

329
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:58,597
Who will get Lancelot?

330
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:00,345
The cat.

331
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,812
They'll take it to a shelter.

332
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,904
No. I'd like to have him if possible.

333
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:09,682
How long did you know Mr. Kononsberg?

334
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:11,480
20 years.

335
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,790
We were gonna meet
about some investments.

336
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:17,955
I got here and the door was open.

337
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,384
What do you think?

338
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,176
I don't know.

339
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:28,906
Robbery, perhaps.

340
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:31,335
A bit violent for that.

341
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:32,402
And...

342
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:34,304
Who'd steal...?

343
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:35,807
A computer tower?

344
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,452
He have a laptop as well?

345
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:43,924
I think so, yes.

346
00:26:47,236 --> 00:26:48,562
You were close?

347
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:54,028
I didn't say we were close. I said
I'd known him for twenty years.

348
00:26:59,526 --> 00:27:00,248
Yes.

349
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:01,788
Senator Lockner?

350
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:03,428
Carter. You heard?

351
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:04,459
Yes.

352
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:08,766
When it comes to crime,
nothing in this city shocks me.

353
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,913
Lynn said that he was
at the benefit Saturday.

354
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:13,842
Would you like to speak with her?

355
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:14,839
Please.

356
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:21,686
Carl?

357
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:24,023
How are you holding up?

358
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,643
Fine.

359
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:28,459
Can you talk?
- Not really.

360
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,393
I just called to say
everything's under control.

361
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:35,875
It's an ongoing
investigation, of course.

362
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:37,624
Carl.

363
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:39,114
I know.

364
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:41,047
Don't worry.

365
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:49,402
Darling, you kill me.

366
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:54,887
And it's true. The rat is with
the stars of human sexuality.

367
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:58,218
I like this.

368
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,243
I bet it's a hell of a
lot less expensive than...

369
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:03,378
Than a stroller a man Highman fees.

370
00:28:03,478 --> 00:28:06,893
Mrs. Delorean, Mr. Page.
How nice to see you again.

371
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:09,248
I like this. Made in the U.S. of A.

372
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:15,152
Oh, yeah. I've sworn off Europeans all
together. It's only Americans for me.

373
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,471
I know what you mean, Sir.

374
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,950
If you have any questions,
I'll be right over here.

375
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,380
Oh, look.

376
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,607
This is the material that Louise de
Vilmorin had on her favorite shares.

377
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,566
I hope it's made of stronger stuff.

378
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:35,232
Louise's couldn't have lasted
long, given the wear she gave it.

379
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:36,903
Oh, my God.

380
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:40,492
There is a more handsome
man. I wanna meet him.

381
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:43,984
Carl, you are outrageous.

382
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,861
But you are gorgeous.

383
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:47,517
Thank you.

384
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,987
I didn't know Robbie
Kononsberg very well.

385
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:54,153
I didn't know you were close.

386
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,099
Yes. That was quite a shock.

387
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:05,123
Jack knew him. Of course
Jack knows everyone.

388
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,037
He hates me.

389
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:10,079
No, he doesn't. Nobody hates you.

390
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,104
One day everything is fine. The next
sure an episode of murder she wrote.

391
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:17,713
Who's the woman?

392
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,655
What?

393
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,860
Isn't there a woman in
every murder mystery?

394
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,040
Are you gonna get this fabric?

395
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,549
It will make the carpet
rig without competing.

396
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,752
I think it's a real find.

397
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,108
Carl, you're absolutely right.

398
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,727
Write this up.

399
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,359
What would I do without you?

400
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:44,316
That we won't even contemplate.

401
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,071
We could deliver in Georgetown.

402
00:29:46,171 --> 00:29:48,665
Or if you like, we could send
everything to your Middleburg residence.

403
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:50,717
To get around all that nasty sales tax?

404
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:51,954
Please.

405
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,850
God. He makes
obsequiousness an art form.

406
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,568
Detective Dixon.

407
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:02,589
What a coincidence.

408
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:05,041
Oh, I was told you might be here.

409
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,256
Detective Dixon.

410
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:08,837
Abigail Delorean.

411
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,102
How do you do?

412
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:13,010
I need to speak with Mr. Page.

413
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:14,442
Shall I wait?

414
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:17,980
No. No. You go on. I'll take a taxi.

415
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,820
Step into my office.

416
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,790
So what? You're an
interior decorator now?

417
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,182
Any progress in the investigation?

418
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:30,992
Why did you go to the apartment?

419
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,840
We've been over this.
We had an appointment.

420
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,298
And the door was open?

421
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:38,427
Yes. That's what made me suspicious.

422
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,119
Have you contacted your lawyer?

423
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,255
Should I?

424
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,390
We'll need a DNA swab.

425
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:47,969
And Mungo Tenant wants to talk to you.

426
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,846
Why would the U.S.
Attorney's Office be involved?

427
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,588
He's made it his business.

428
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,504
<i>A passer, a d'essayer.

429
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,048
From the possible to the real.

430
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:04,459
That is the motto of Woodberry Forest, the
prep school Carter attended, Mr. Withal.

431
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,225
I looked that up.

432
00:31:06,373 --> 00:31:09,084
I'm one of Woodberry's
less illustrious alumni.

433
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:14,048
Myself, I went to Cumberland.
It was good. But not Woodberry.

434
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,950
Woodberry was for the
sons of the well-connected.

435
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:19,993
I didn't fit in.

436
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,434
No, I don't imagine you didn't.

437
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,514
Mungo, Carter has answered
all your questions.

438
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:24,961
What's the point?

439
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:32,323
What was the relationship between the
deceased and Senator Lockner's wife?

440
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,403
Were acquaintances.

441
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:41,724
In fact the last time I saw Robbie
I was with Lynn at the opera benefit.

442
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,575
That was the extent
of their relationship?

443
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:44,860
To my knowledge.

444
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,417
Have you asked Lynn?

445
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:51,554
What if we found evidence of Lynn's
presence at Kononsberg's condo?

446
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:53,419
Wouldn't surprise me.

447
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,095
Robbie did a lot of entertaining.

448
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:57,864
You had a business relationship?

449
00:31:57,964 --> 00:32:01,968
He advised me to purchase AltiMed stock.

450
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:05,006
I made money for a while.
And then I lost money.

451
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,380
A lot.

452
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:07,454
Considerable.

453
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:09,012
Because of Robbie.

454
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:11,699
I have only myself to blame.

455
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:19,712
If you're holding anything back about
Kononsberg or Lynn Lockner's relationship...

456
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,233
If you are going to
press charges, do so.

457
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,307
Otherwise we're leaving.

458
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:27,950
Carter.

459
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:37,319
Every year your father would come to Cumberland
to speak at a civics or an American history class.

460
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:40,006
He was an inspiration.

461
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:42,766
A great American.

462
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,563
Like his father before him.

463
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:50,186
It was because of him, I
decided to enter public service.

464
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:56,307
When I heard him at the Watergate hearings
I was proud to say I was a Virginian.

465
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:58,903
What are you?

466
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:03,670
What have you contributed
to your father's memory?

467
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,020
Is there a name for what you are?

468
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,163
I believe...

469
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:15,264
He's called the walker, Sir.

470
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:19,424
He walks rich women from place to place.

471
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:28,534
Carl, is there any
you're not telling me?

472
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,663
Tell me now. I can't
be responsible later.

473
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,786
And don't fuck with offense.

474
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,252
After 9-11 they took the leash off.

475
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,277
They do whatever they want.

476
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:41,952
Do you want something?

477
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:43,019
No.

478
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,902
It'll all work out.

479
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:49,792
Don't be naive.

480
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:51,854
I'm not naive.

481
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:54,633
I'm superficial.

482
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:00,580
Mungo Tenant knows the right questions.

483
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,073
Somebody's leaking information
about Lynn's connection to Robbie.

484
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:06,469
How did you get involved in this?

485
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:10,653
You'll listen to real music.

486
00:34:10,753 --> 00:34:12,451
This is real music.

487
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:19,966
Lynn finds a body,
all hell breaks loose.

488
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:22,316
I find a body? Awkward.

489
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:24,530
But I didn't think it
was such a big deal.

490
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,911
But now it is.

491
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:30,741
This is a mean crowd,
this administration.

492
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:33,414
I ain't never seen anything like it.

493
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,659
It's a cultural revenge.

494
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:39,635
They want to revenge
you? Why? For your father?

495
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,414
No. That's just coincidence.

496
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:46,021
Lynn almost got pulled
in. Instead it's me.

497
00:34:46,394 --> 00:34:50,117
Robbie's death has been
exploited for political reasons.

498
00:34:50,217 --> 00:34:51,520
Oh, can I...?

499
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,732
Can I mention this to my editor?

500
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:56,111
Can you put down that crack pipe?

501
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,044
Just kidding.

502
00:34:58,283 --> 00:35:01,087
Just don't know how much longer
I can stand to shoot photo ops.

503
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:02,985
Scarlet. Look this way.

504
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:07,954
Is this an...?

505
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,421
Is it a new suit?

506
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,373
This whole thing.

507
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:14,397
Do you like it?

508
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:23,042
Looks a little bit like a...

509
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:25,292
Medieval suit of armor.

510
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:27,000
Thank you.

511
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,144
Welcome.

512
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:33,243
I've got to figure
out who tipped Tenant.

513
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,740
D.C. and Salt Lake.

514
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:41,600
These are the last two cities where
homosexuality is a ground for extortion.

515
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,771
Lots of hypocrites.

516
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,624
Good American family men.

517
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,182
You can squeeze them.

518
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:52,955
That's crazy.

519
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,998
You do that for me?

520
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:56,692
Yeah.

521
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,495
Why?

522
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:03,005
L.O.V.E.

523
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,127
Love.

524
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,878
It's normal.

525
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,633
My first spelling lesson.

526
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:17,590
No, thanks.

527
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,045
Oh, I think I'll sit this one out.

528
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,100
Chrissie, it's your turn.

529
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:23,523
Ma'am?

530
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:25,854
I'm thinking about going on a diet.

531
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:29,106
It's been proven. Thinking
about it doesn't work.

532
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,599
To dear departed friends.

533
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:33,892
Here.

534
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:40,315
All right, girls.

535
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:41,511
Theories?

536
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:44,904
I have one word Altimed.

537
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:48,148
Kononsberg plumped for them all
over town, both sides of the aisle.

538
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,091
Everybody took donations.

539
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:51,994
Even Larry.

540
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:53,907
No. He's investigating.

541
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:56,523
The whole thing collapses.

542
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:58,796
Biggest scandal since Teapot Dome.

543
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:00,460
And nobody cares.

544
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,198
It's a lack of moral values.

545
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:03,395
No. It's a wrack.

546
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,296
A wrack turns everything.

547
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:07,009
No water, please.

548
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:11,250
Wasn't Robbie supposed to testify
in front of Larry's committee?

549
00:37:11,456 --> 00:37:13,718
I don't think so. I think
he was just a messenger.

550
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:14,933
Thug villain.
- Yeah.

551
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,654
<i>Chercher la femme.

552
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,314
Abby thinks there was a woman involved.

553
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:20,537
Isn't there always?

554
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:21,861
It could be just a robbery.

555
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:22,736
No.

556
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:24,649
Well, how about you, Carl?

557
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,520
It's uncharacteristic of you to be so
reticent about a subject so sensational.

558
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,555
Well, a friend is murdered and I'm
told not to comment because perhaps...

559
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,865
Perhaps I am a suspect.

560
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,512
Well, who thinks that?

561
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:39,942
Mungo Tenant.

562
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,183
How could anyone suspect you?

563
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:45,082
They go with what they
have. And I'm what they have.

564
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,622
Tenant's an absolute botcher.

565
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:50,561
He's ambitious. He wants to be a star.

566
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,304
I heard that Robbie was in trouble.

567
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:54,997
Define.

568
00:37:55,163 --> 00:37:57,279
Overextended, as in...

569
00:37:57,427 --> 00:38:01,089
His financial means couldn't
accommodate his lifestyle.

570
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,373
Where did you hear this?

571
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:04,895
Where do you ever hear such things?

572
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:07,181
Robbie would never let himself
get into such a situation.

573
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:09,438
Not where he'd die of the money.

574
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:11,408
It's always about money.

575
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:13,818
People say it's sex.

576
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:15,751
But it's money.

577
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:18,843
That's very simplistic of you, Natalie.

578
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:23,058
Speaking of money...

579
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:31,291
Did you know that Josh Milford wrote a campaign song for
the presidential race, Al Smith vs. Herbert Hoover, 1928.

580
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:37,639
You've seen good days with Hoover.

581
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:39,732
Better days are on the way.

582
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:45,382
Money will fall from blue
skies. Prosperity's here to stay.

583
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:46,501
Oh, darling.

584
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,450
So say goodbye to Herbert.

585
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:55,275
And say hello to Al.
Say goodbye to Herbert.

586
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,885
And say hello to Al.

587
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:58,956
Hello, Al.

588
00:39:00,649 --> 00:39:02,987
A year later the market crashed.

589
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:04,239
I remember.

590
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:11,527
But you were just a young slip of a girl
then, not the beautiful woman you are now.

591
00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:15,374
Cut the shit.

592
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:17,012
Oh, cut the cards.

593
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:33,609
Thank you, Sir.

594
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:34,915
Ma'am.

595
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:11,523
Tenant called you?

596
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:15,020
Yeah.

597
00:40:15,517 --> 00:40:16,897
What did you say?

598
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:20,468
Last time I saw Robbie was
at the National with you.

599
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:25,535
There is an informant.

600
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:30,535
Somebody is telling Tenant that you
were having an affair with Robbie.

601
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:36,094
What did you tell Larry?

602
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:40,733
Same thing I told Tenant. We
were acquaintances. End of story.

603
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,122
What would he do if you
were connected to the murder?

604
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:47,450
He'd resign.

605
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,880
How did I get in this?

606
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:57,003
Is that what you're thinking about?

607
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,157
Never.

608
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:01,494
I was thinking about you.

609
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:08,690
Tenant is a baby sleaze who
wants to be a big sleaze.

610
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,456
Nail a star, become a star.

611
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,825
It's how these justice boys think.

612
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:15,754
A liberal star.

613
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:17,929
Two liberal stars. Even better.

614
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,414
I don't just play cards, you know.

615
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:21,574
Sorry.

616
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:25,365
How come you're always so polite?

617
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:30,996
It was my mother's answer to chaos.

618
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:32,597
Now it's mine.

619
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,081
We had a fight.

620
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,216
Robbie and me. An argument.

621
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:44,781
Somebody could have heard something.

622
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:49,787
He had a lot of anger in him.

623
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:56,394
He said people have been treating him like
shit too long. He wasn't gonna take it.

624
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,713
Why didn't you tell me this before?

625
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:03,038
I didn't think it was
important. I'm telling you now.

626
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,191
And you saw him again after this?

627
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:14,522
I have been such a fool.

628
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,392
You do care for me, don't you?

629
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:30,682
Yes.

630
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,670
I always have.

631
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:48,646
There's something I've
always wanted to ask you.

632
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:49,898
What?

633
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,530
How do you survive all
those long political dinners?

634
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:59,689
Oh, I think about redecorating the room.

635
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:05,063
That, dear, is the most
practical thing you've ever said.

636
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:18,966
Kononsberg was near busted on AltiMed.

637
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:21,900
Then two weeks later he
opened two offshore accounts.

638
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,653
So he had money.

639
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,291
Two hundred thousand dollars
were deposited in these accounts.

640
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:34,093
Well, if you could have found this out
then the U.S. Attorney could have also.

641
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:35,782
I would imagine so.

642
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:42,116
Carl.

643
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:46,334
You asked me to look
into this, and I did.

644
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:48,176
Now I wanna ask you a favor.

645
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:49,134
Of course.

646
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,253
Don't drag me any
deeper into this. Okay?

647
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:26,824
I guess if it isn't
offensive, it isn't art.

648
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,211
Look.

649
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:35,447
These are Robbie Kononsberg's
phone calls for the past six months.

650
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,586
How did you get these?

651
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:39,282
Well, I know people, too. You know?

652
00:44:39,382 --> 00:44:41,615
There is this guy who used to work
for the District Attorney's office.

653
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:42,704
You got these from him?

654
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:43,548
No.

655
00:44:44,152 --> 00:44:46,541
That was someone else.
But the D.A. guy...

656
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:47,759
He said...

657
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,768
The night after the murder Tenant's at his
dinner, and he gets a phone call. All right?

658
00:44:51,868 --> 00:44:54,170
He's up and he's gone.
He doesn't say a word.

659
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,491
And next Monday he comes up with
this theory about Kononsberg and Lynn.

660
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,144
Who'd he talked to?

661
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:01,837
I'm working on it. But look...

662
00:45:01,937 --> 00:45:04,994
One number starts popping up the last
two months. Actually it's two numbers.

663
00:45:05,094 --> 00:45:08,283
One is for Jack Delorean's office
and the other one is for a cell phone.

664
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:12,567
Abby's husband.

665
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,043
The old lion.

666
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,669
You know what they say about him?

667
00:45:18,277 --> 00:45:22,013
He never ran for office 'cause
he'd have to give up too much power.

668
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,331
Oh, God.

669
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:36,980
Hey, the...?

670
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,502
The other thing?

671
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,538
Have you thought about it?

672
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:45,188
Is this really the right
time to discuss this?

673
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:47,396
I think it's a perfect time.
I have your full attention.

674
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:50,193
You want me to help you get
a gallery show. I understand.

675
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:52,661
I have discretely inquired.

676
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:55,518
Yeah, discretely. That's exactly the
word I would like to talk to you about.

677
00:45:55,618 --> 00:45:56,879
Be realistic.

678
00:45:57,909 --> 00:45:59,419
Look at this stuff.

679
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:01,775
Not exactly subtle. It's...

680
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,719
Agitprop. It's incendiary.

681
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:10,461
I guess that means you haven't.

682
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:13,093
I just don't wanna feel used.

683
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:17,114
If you don't wanna feel used...

684
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,347
Why are you in a relationship?

685
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:38,408
This embassy used to
be a society graveyard.

686
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:44,683
Supporting us in Iraq is the only
smart thing Colombia ever did.

687
00:46:45,162 --> 00:46:46,082
Natalie.

688
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:47,941
Oh, Jack.

689
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,457
Lovely. Thank you.

690
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,276
Carl.

691
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:55,248
Hi, Jack.

692
00:46:56,776 --> 00:46:58,451
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

693
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:00,237
Look at her.

694
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:02,151
Who?

695
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:07,120
People think marrying for money is easy.

696
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:08,740
Not true.

697
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,451
I'm living proof.

698
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:15,371
Marrying for money is the
hardest fucking job there is.

699
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,918
You don't get the money.

700
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:19,046
You just get to look at it.

701
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:21,384
She's just discovering that.

702
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:24,236
Have you heard from Lynn?

703
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:25,522
No.

704
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:27,862
I haven't been able to reach her.

705
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:30,033
Oh. Perhaps that's best.

706
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,279
Here I am.

707
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:39,089
Seating can make or break a party.

708
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,806
It's probably not a good time to
get involved in Lynn's problems.

709
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:47,646
Which problems?

710
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:49,100
Oh, Carl.

711
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:53,683
Let me give you a piece
of Washington wisdom.

712
00:47:54,032 --> 00:47:58,210
Never stand between your
friend and a firing squad.

713
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:01,192
And there you are.

714
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:05,150
And between us...

715
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:09,586
The sub-head of the
Task Force on Terrorism.

716
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:12,973
Man couldn't find the
ground if he fell on it.

717
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,231
Natalie, I need to
ask you a little favor.

718
00:48:16,654 --> 00:48:18,016
What might that be?

719
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,763
Do you know why...?

720
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:25,450
Robbie Kononsberg and Jack Delorean were in
close contact for the last month and a half?

721
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:26,904
Carl.

722
00:48:27,124 --> 00:48:30,787
I believe you've mistaken me
for a private investigator.

723
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,677
Natalie Van Miter, P.I.

724
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,010
You follow basketball?

725
00:49:12,108 --> 00:49:13,590
Yeah, some.

726
00:49:14,225 --> 00:49:16,176
Were you a Michael Jordan fan?

727
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:21,053
But I liked the team better
before they changed the name.

728
00:49:22,102 --> 00:49:24,145
Let's go over there. There's a room.

729
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:25,617
We can talk.

730
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,231
Who did you work for?

731
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:32,280
You know, some asshole
in the State Department.

732
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,733
You live by your eyes, don't you?

733
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,024
Stop and you won't be in trouble.

734
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:44,248
Who are you gonna tell?

735
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,296
Already fret?

736
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:46,567
What do you want?

737
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:50,405
Stop playing the detective or
you'll be working with a white cane.

738
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:51,593
And tell your friend that, too.

739
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:53,405
Tell him to do the right thing.

740
00:49:53,505 --> 00:49:55,452
Got it, sand nigger?

741
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:22,009
Do you know Mark Hoban?

742
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,560
Of Grandel, Klein & Hoban?

743
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,488
He's Lockner's lawyer.

744
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:27,555
He came to see me.

745
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:30,401
Our firms have a fee
sharing arrangement.

746
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:35,573
Hoban's firm has offered to cover
any legal expenses you incur.

747
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:38,150
Why would they do that?

748
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:39,678
I didn't ask.

749
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:45,328
Loyalty need not be dictated by financial
concerns. Those were Hoban's words.

750
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,304
Do you remember Susan McDougal?

751
00:50:49,488 --> 00:50:52,875
Two years in jail because
she wouldn't ride out Clinton.

752
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:55,120
Sounds like another era.

753
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:56,261
It was.

754
00:50:57,991 --> 00:51:00,015
Excuse me for one second.

755
00:51:03,181 --> 00:51:04,083
Yes?

756
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,095
What happened?

757
00:51:13,745 --> 00:51:14,904
Where are you?

758
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:27,186
Who is it?

759
00:51:27,286 --> 00:51:29,352
Carter Page. Friend of Emek's.

760
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:31,198
Step forward.

761
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,885
Put it in the camera.

762
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,210
Radley's from the gym. He's a
physical therapist, you know.

763
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,456
Thank you.

764
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,636
How is he?
- I'm fine.

765
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,596
Oh, he needs a couple of stitches.

766
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:49,346
And should have an X-ray.

767
00:51:49,446 --> 00:51:50,572
Just to be safe.

768
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,831
You can stay here?

769
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:53,395
No I'm fine to go home.

770
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:55,340
You got to stop this.

771
00:51:56,923 --> 00:51:58,855
Putting yourself in danger.

772
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:05,609
Or else what?

773
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,733
You're not going to help
me get a gallery show?

774
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:12,622
This is not a joke.

775
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:14,113
Listen.

776
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:16,524
He said to tell you to stop.

777
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:18,566
And do the right thing.

778
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:23,295
Would you recognize him?

779
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:27,050
Yeah, I would recognize him.

780
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:32,645
Who were you talking to?

781
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:36,620
Sorry.

782
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,724
What were you trying to find out?

783
00:52:42,472 --> 00:52:44,607
Robbie's connection to Delorean.

784
00:52:45,086 --> 00:52:48,534
Now this guy was supposed
to be an unhappy employee.

785
00:52:48,617 --> 00:52:49,401
Right?

786
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:53,009
And he would tell me things
that would make my ears ring.

787
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,635
That pal was right.

788
00:52:58,145 --> 00:53:00,740
So what Lynn say about the phone calls?

789
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:05,690
Huh?

790
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:07,568
Did you ask her?

791
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:10,629
I didn't have the chance.

792
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,476
What do you mean you
didn't have the chance?

793
00:53:14,414 --> 00:53:16,788
What has she done for you, huh?

794
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:18,524
Why are you trying to protect her?

795
00:53:18,624 --> 00:53:20,470
It's not that simple.

796
00:53:48,365 --> 00:53:50,101
That's all right officer.

797
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:51,770
It's his apartment.

798
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:02,981
What's going on?

799
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:04,898
We have a Court Issued Warrant.

800
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:07,972
Am I under arrest?

801
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,898
Not if you come in voluntarily.

802
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:12,941
Nice apartment.

803
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,236
Don't touch that.

804
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:24,739
It's Detective, Mr. Page.

805
00:54:26,285 --> 00:54:28,176
Do you recognize these?

806
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:29,009
No.

807
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:33,518
Is this Kononsberg's handwriting?

808
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,974
Kononsberg has no money...

809
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:40,489
Then suddenly he has
money. Then he's dead.

810
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:45,315
Doesn't that seem like a legitimate
avenue for a murder investigation?

811
00:54:45,426 --> 00:54:49,489
More relevant than, say, Lynn
Lockner's relationship to the victim?

812
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:52,001
You'll have to ask
Attorney Tenant about that.

813
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:53,806
I thought this was your investigation.

814
00:54:53,906 --> 00:54:54,775
It is.

815
00:54:55,843 --> 00:54:58,236
Things aren't always what they seem.

816
00:54:58,714 --> 00:55:01,143
You have the right to remain silent.

817
00:55:01,604 --> 00:55:03,459
Anything you say can and will be used...

818
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:06,444
Mungo you've kept my
client waiting all night.

819
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,928
I'm not sure you understand the
seriousness of your situation.

820
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:11,880
Possession of stolen property.

821
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,592
Who told you it was stolen?

822
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:15,571
Same person who told
you where to find it?

823
00:55:15,671 --> 00:55:17,301
You're saying he gave you his watch?

824
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,620
I have no idea how it
came to be in my apartment.

825
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,289
There's no crime here.

826
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:28,670
I believe you're lying about the
circumstances under witch the body was found.

827
00:55:38,424 --> 00:55:39,940
I wanna know why you're lying.

828
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,271
Why we've found a Zip disk from
Kononsberg's computer in your apartment?

829
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:46,179
My computer doesn't
even have a Zip drive.

830
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:48,148
Zips are twentieth-century...

831
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:51,455
We know Lynn Lockner visited Kononsberg.

832
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:54,326
So bring her in.

833
00:55:54,492 --> 00:55:56,958
She's not available. She's left town.

834
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,202
Where did she go?

835
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:02,387
Palm Beach. Her mother's sick.

836
00:56:02,645 --> 00:56:04,430
Don't you think that is convenient?

837
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:05,834
For you? Yes.

838
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:10,669
If you brought her in, a minority
leader's wife, it might backfire.

839
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:13,577
Assuming you are
thinking of high office.

840
00:56:16,632 --> 00:56:17,901
Carter Page.

841
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:21,840
Carter Page, the turd.

842
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,582
Mr. Withal.

843
00:56:24,877 --> 00:56:29,110
You should make it clear to your
client, he is on extremely thin ice.

844
00:56:30,564 --> 00:56:32,755
I believe he is aware of that.

845
00:56:33,472 --> 00:56:35,663
Ethan and I spoke earlier.

846
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:42,009
Out of respect for your father I'm gonna recommend
that you be released on your own recognizance.

847
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:45,142
That'll give you time to
give the matter some thought.

848
00:56:46,816 --> 00:56:48,378
In my experience...

849
00:56:48,478 --> 00:56:52,983
It's perjury that catches people
out who think they're above the law.

850
00:56:53,332 --> 00:56:57,216
Not so much the deed itself.
But the lying about it.

851
00:56:58,302 --> 00:57:00,397
If you decide to cooperate...

852
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:03,474
There're certain things
that can be overlooked.

853
00:57:03,658 --> 00:57:05,535
You contact Ethan.

854
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:10,621
Since you invoked my father's memory, there's
something I'd like to say on his behalf.

855
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:17,886
If alive, he would regret ever inspiring a
person such as yourself to enter public service.

856
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:18,898
Carl.

857
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:21,251
Shut up.

858
00:57:25,745 --> 00:57:28,520
Essentially he is giving
you a three-day pass.

859
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,843
There was nothing on that disk.

860
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:34,678
Does Mungo just hate me,
or is it all homosexuals?

861
00:57:34,778 --> 00:57:37,392
Or is he determined
to bring down Lockner?

862
00:57:37,492 --> 00:57:41,224
Or is it just plain
old-fashioned ambition?

863
00:57:41,463 --> 00:57:44,408
Perhaps it's a convergence of all four.

864
00:57:45,237 --> 00:57:47,114
What do you know about Lynn?

865
00:57:47,224 --> 00:57:48,788
I tried to reach her.

866
00:57:49,819 --> 00:57:50,646
And?

867
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:51,935
Unavailable.

868
00:57:52,322 --> 00:57:54,899
They've started a whispering campaign.

869
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,083
The bright-eyed little
errand boys from Justice.

870
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:01,820
Lynn and Robbie having an affair.

871
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:03,936
Lynn having something
to do with his death.

872
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:05,957
And Lockner knowing about it.

873
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:07,972
The press isn't gonna buy that.

874
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:10,024
At certain point it
doesn't matter to them.

875
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,990
Whispering campaign
itself becomes the story.

876
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:15,051
I need to see Lockner.

877
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:17,274
What makes you think he'll see you?

878
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:21,659
Just contact him discreetly.
See how he responds.

879
00:58:21,972 --> 00:58:23,689
It's wrong direction to take this.

880
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:25,266
What do you suggest?

881
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:28,685
Love yourself, Carl.

882
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:32,277
You may think you've got friends
in this situation, but you don't.

883
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:35,149
Decide what's in your best interest.

884
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:36,971
Then act upon it.

885
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:53,893
Carl.

886
00:58:54,316 --> 00:58:55,126
I know.

887
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:57,574
I'm just picking up some of my things.

888
00:58:57,721 --> 00:58:59,819
How do you what I'm gonna say?

889
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:01,775
Oh, you were gonna...

890
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:06,284
Tell me that because of market uncertainties
your accountant suggested scaling back.

891
00:59:06,384 --> 00:59:08,632
And I should take... What...?

892
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:10,227
A leave?

893
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:13,539
Well, yeah. Something like that.

894
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:15,674
I don't blame you, John.

895
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,434
There won't be a better moment.

896
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:09,661
Hello.

897
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:11,386
Sunflower.

898
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:12,939
Carl? Is that you?

899
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:17,417
No. It's a ravishing young
teenager pretending to be me.

900
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:19,625
How are you Abigail.

901
01:00:19,725 --> 01:00:20,868
How are you?

902
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:22,853
Isn't it terrible?
- What?

903
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:25,018
What they're trying to do to Lynn.

904
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:27,421
What who's trying to do to Lynn?

905
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:30,098
You know who. The
whisperers. The cave dwellers.

906
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:32,559
They're trying to ruin her reputation.

907
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:35,026
These are cruel times.

908
01:00:35,504 --> 01:00:39,884
In former days men caught lying
would have their testicles tied.

909
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,498
Today they get a TV show.

910
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,381
Did you just make that
up or were you saving it?

911
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,345
I was saving in. For you.

912
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,476
Let's have a lunch.

913
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:52,977
We need a laugh.

914
01:00:53,077 --> 01:00:55,388
Jack is meeting with
the vice-president.

915
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:57,099
His relatives are here.

916
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,624
It's keeping me busy.
- I understand.

917
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:01,832
I'll see you at the Hargrave then.

918
01:01:02,016 --> 01:01:02,844
Okay.

919
01:01:03,801 --> 01:01:05,421
Okay. Bye-bye, dear.

920
01:01:11,677 --> 01:01:13,204
Hear that, Lancelot?

921
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:17,585
It's the sound of doors
closing all over town.

922
01:01:48,592 --> 01:01:49,331
Carter?

923
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:50,331
Hop in.

924
01:01:55,364 --> 01:01:56,502
Senator Lockner.

925
01:01:56,602 --> 01:01:57,554
Larry!

926
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,444
Thanks for the offer,
the legal expenses.

927
01:02:01,544 --> 01:02:03,370
What are you talking about?

928
01:02:05,782 --> 01:02:06,790
How is Lynn?

929
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,954
She's fine.

930
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:10,438
She went to visit her mother.

931
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:12,886
Her mother's health is failing.

932
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,457
How much do you know?

933
01:02:18,408 --> 01:02:21,482
About Lynn?
Robbie Kononsberg's death?

934
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:23,671
I just know what Lynn told me.

935
01:02:24,702 --> 01:02:27,030
She and Robbie were good friends.

936
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:28,723
Nothing more.

937
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:32,128
But...

938
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:35,483
Kononsberg was a lobbyist for AltiMed.

939
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,876
Your committee is investigating AltiMed.

940
01:02:37,976 --> 01:02:41,944
We were investigating. Now we're
just pretending to investigate.

941
01:02:42,044 --> 01:02:44,143
It's not my committee anymore.

942
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:46,024
You would have liked to talk to him.

943
01:02:46,355 --> 01:02:49,373
Yes, but I won't mind talking
to the vice-president either.

944
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:50,643
The V.P.?

945
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,261
Why?

946
01:02:53,717 --> 01:02:56,330
Just the same line.

947
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:02,979
Lynn is afraid you'll resign if
she's somehow implicated in all this.

948
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,728
I'm sure you must have heard the rumors.

949
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:07,979
No. That's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna step down.

950
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:10,451
How do the rich get the
poor to give them more money?

951
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:11,807
They scare them.

952
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:16,058
Under no circumstances
am I stepping down.

953
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:17,365
But Lynn...

954
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:22,297
Lynn has an exaggerated notion of her
importance in the larger scheme of things.

955
01:03:30,414 --> 01:03:31,923
Why are we meeting?

956
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:36,102
I'm trying to decide what to do.

957
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,696
On the one hand I'm disloyal.

958
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:41,034
On the other...

959
01:03:41,973 --> 01:03:43,096
Dishonest.

960
01:03:44,347 --> 01:03:45,672
It's never easy.

961
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:49,389
Look at the big picture.

962
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:01,381
Hey, listen to this.

963
01:04:02,613 --> 01:04:07,606
Mungo Tenant. William and Mary
School of Law. Class of '86.

964
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:11,585
First intern then partner
in Colin, Macken & Klein.

965
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,998
A firm originally
founded by Jack Delorean.

966
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:19,113
And senior partner, the vice-president.

967
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,897
What are you doing?

968
01:04:21,154 --> 01:04:21,890
What?

969
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:24,835
Are you still playing
private investigator?

970
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:27,987
Only a little bit just in cyberspace.

971
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:29,067
Just stop.

972
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:32,625
I'm trying to help you.

973
01:04:32,725 --> 01:04:34,386
I don't want your help.

974
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,165
Don't you see what's going on?

975
01:04:43,975 --> 01:04:46,000
They got you on a railroad.

976
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:47,515
And they're going to railroad you.

977
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,835
And you just...

978
01:04:49,516 --> 01:04:52,773
You just let it happen to
you. You don't confront them.

979
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:55,000
You're gonna end up in jail.

980
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,835
I can take care of myself.

981
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:00,063
No, you can't.

982
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:06,265
Anytime anything unpleasant happens, you
just smile and tell a joke to your friends.

983
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,345
You know what?

984
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:12,634
You should be more like your father.

985
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:19,296
He stood up.

986
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:23,635
He wasn't afraid of scandals.

987
01:05:23,735 --> 01:05:26,074
He wasn't even afraid
to take on the president.

988
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:27,872
You're a paparazzi.

989
01:05:28,461 --> 01:05:31,129
You make your money off a scandal.

990
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,696
You have no idea what
a scandal really means.

991
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:37,626
How it destroys people.

992
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:41,435
And then what comes after.

993
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:43,731
We move to New York.

994
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:47,284
Buy a brownstone. Adopt a brown baby.

995
01:05:47,384 --> 01:05:51,558
Walk arm in arm around the village
for the tourists to point at.

996
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,112
Why fucking not?

997
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:55,956
It's ridiculous.

998
01:05:56,637 --> 01:05:57,719
It's normal.

999
01:05:57,819 --> 01:05:59,656
We're ridiculous.

1000
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:07,275
Okay.

1001
01:06:09,962 --> 01:06:10,754
Okay.

1002
01:06:12,355 --> 01:06:13,625
You know I've...

1003
01:06:14,435 --> 01:06:16,459
I've stayed here only for you.

1004
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:21,557
I don't know why. I should
have left six months ago.

1005
01:06:27,097 --> 01:06:28,845
I don't wanna lose you.

1006
01:06:33,629 --> 01:06:38,360
God, I always thought ringing
one's hands was a figure of speech.

1007
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:45,476
I thought you could change.
But you can't.

1008
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,819
Carter Page III.

1009
01:06:53,644 --> 01:06:55,915
You'll never be like your father.

1010
01:07:38,736 --> 01:07:40,749
They say I bend over.

1011
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,287
You should have seen my father.

1012
01:07:44,747 --> 01:07:47,335
That was a man who bent over.

1013
01:07:47,622 --> 01:07:51,859
Carter Page II. The legendary Carl Page.

1014
01:07:52,724 --> 01:07:55,631
The Watergate hearings' great moment.

1015
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:59,441
Every day someone comes up and says...

1016
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,729
<i>Your father was a great man.

1017
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:05,478
And I smile and say, Oh, yes he was.

1018
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,275
He left Congress twenty times
wealthier than when he entered.

1019
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,263
What does that tell you?

1020
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:15,251
He was a crook.

1021
01:08:15,417 --> 01:08:17,147
A fraud.

1022
01:08:19,614 --> 01:08:21,822
He was deeply shame to me.

1023
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:26,663
But he's dead now.

1024
01:08:28,246 --> 01:08:29,921
Don't judge the dead.

1025
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:32,259
Why not?

1026
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:36,417
They judge us each and every day.

1027
01:09:56,186 --> 01:09:57,775
<i>Well, I was going to invite her today.

1028
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,662
<i>But I understand
she's gone on vacation.

1029
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,503
Well, well, well.

1030
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:11,705
I was wondering if you'd
got the guts to show up.

1031
01:10:11,805 --> 01:10:13,613
It's Wednesday, isn't it?

1032
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:16,448
And you're ready to play?

1033
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:17,478
Yes.

1034
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:21,159
Looks like it's just the two of us.

1035
01:10:21,325 --> 01:10:24,987
Canasta is not ideally
a two-handed game.

1036
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:28,436
Carl.

1037
01:10:29,635 --> 01:10:31,052
I love your nerve.

1038
01:10:32,948 --> 01:10:34,438
How about a drink then?

1039
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:36,702
Why not?

1040
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:40,527
You look wonderful, Nat.

1041
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:41,837
I thank you.

1042
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,157
Henry, I'll have a Seabreeze.

1043
01:10:45,257 --> 01:10:46,807
A vodka and tonic, please.

1044
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:48,367
Certainly, ma'am.

1045
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:50,746
We'll drink to the good memories.

1046
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:53,746
Oh, don't talk to me about memory.

1047
01:10:53,892 --> 01:10:57,260
Memory is a very unreliable organ.

1048
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:58,870
Trust me, Carl.

1049
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:01,447
It's right up there with the penis.

1050
01:11:04,153 --> 01:11:06,589
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

1051
01:11:06,689 --> 01:11:11,010
I thought of it last night and
I can't get it out of my head.

1052
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:16,941
Which actor portrayed the
most U.S. presidents in movies?

1053
01:11:18,285 --> 01:11:19,904
Oh, you.

1054
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,069
Henry Fonda?

1055
01:11:23,181 --> 01:11:24,493
No. Actual presidents.

1056
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:28,674
He played Lincoln, but in 'Fail-Safe'
he was a fictional president.

1057
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,638
I don't know.

1058
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:33,662
Charlton Heston?

1059
01:11:33,883 --> 01:11:35,775
Close. But only two.

1060
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:36,771
No.

1061
01:11:36,828 --> 01:11:38,871
It was Rip Torn.

1062
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:43,837
He played Grant, Lyndon
Johnson and Richard Nixon.

1063
01:11:43,937 --> 01:11:46,196
L.B.J. and Nixon amazing.

1064
01:11:46,657 --> 01:11:49,344
- Your drinks, Mr. Page.
- Thank you, Henry.

1065
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:59,466
Don't let them get you down.

1066
01:12:05,246 --> 01:12:08,411
I have had some illusions shattered.

1067
01:12:08,797 --> 01:12:09,957
We all have.

1068
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,570
I thought we weren't
an aggressive nation.

1069
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:17,614
And I thought there was a
separation between church and state.

1070
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:22,399
Hell, I even thought that the
people elected the president.

1071
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:27,468
You know, Carl.
You've always intrigued me.

1072
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:29,732
You think you're a black sheep.

1073
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,585
You're not a black sheep at all.

1074
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:38,222
Do you remember the question you asked
me about Robbie and Jack Delorean?

1075
01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:41,704
Yeah. I apologize. I was out of line.

1076
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,237
Your friend, Robbie,
was up to something.

1077
01:12:45,421 --> 01:12:47,979
Always follow the money.

1078
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:51,808
Sometimes it's oil. Sometimes
it's pharmaceuticals.

1079
01:12:52,249 --> 01:12:55,342
I think it's time you and
Lynn had a talk about that.

1080
01:12:55,452 --> 01:12:57,115
I tried to reach her.

1081
01:12:57,215 --> 01:13:01,250
She left town. I've tried
her mother's to no avail.

1082
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,882
Do you have a pencil and paper?

1083
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,011
A pen? Even better.

1084
01:13:11,464 --> 01:13:13,452
You can be so naive.

1085
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:20,409
Now you can meet her here.

1086
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:25,452
Don't be so goddamn polite.

1087
01:13:27,882 --> 01:13:29,066
Now...

1088
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,065
What were we talking about?

1089
01:13:32,243 --> 01:13:33,329
Rip Torn.

1090
01:13:34,267 --> 01:13:35,148
No.

1091
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:38,942
We were talking about your
wanting to be a black sheep.

1092
01:13:40,009 --> 01:13:41,340
In the end...

1093
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,672
All you have is your breeding.

1094
01:13:43,948 --> 01:13:46,691
It's all that separates them from us.

1095
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,227
Breeding?

1096
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:54,389
My great grandfather
got rich of slavery.

1097
01:13:54,489 --> 01:14:00,217
And when the Yankees took that away, my
grandfather made his money raising tobacco.

1098
01:14:00,972 --> 01:14:02,978
I don't have any breeding.

1099
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:07,457
If your great grandfather
were alive today...

1100
01:14:07,557 --> 01:14:10,230
He'd fit right in.

1101
01:14:48,502 --> 01:14:49,529
Who is it?

1102
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:51,079
FedEx package.

1103
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:53,504
I'm not expecting any FedEx.

1104
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:55,625
Lynn, it's Carl. Open up.

1105
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:03,981
FedEx?

1106
01:15:04,423 --> 01:15:05,840
That was lame.

1107
01:15:09,098 --> 01:15:09,908
Jesus.

1108
01:15:10,736 --> 01:15:12,098
What's going on?

1109
01:15:12,872 --> 01:15:14,326
How did you find me?

1110
01:15:14,712 --> 01:15:16,258
I did some checking.

1111
01:15:17,454 --> 01:15:19,773
Oh, your friend from the newspaper.

1112
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,890
Maybe I should move.

1113
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:23,988
Who are you afraid of?

1114
01:15:27,025 --> 01:15:28,295
May I sit?

1115
01:15:28,681 --> 01:15:29,730
Forgive me.

1116
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,154
- Would you like some water?
- Please.

1117
01:15:44,216 --> 01:15:45,468
I left Larry.

1118
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,443
Does he know where you are?

1119
01:15:50,543 --> 01:15:51,467
No.

1120
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:53,764
Palm Beach.

1121
01:15:56,415 --> 01:15:59,126
My mother has always been helpful.

1122
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:00,317
Out with it.

1123
01:16:01,955 --> 01:16:03,866
I've been getting a
lot of advice lately.

1124
01:16:03,966 --> 01:16:08,305
Let me give you some advice.
Tell me what the fuck is going on.

1125
01:16:09,796 --> 01:16:11,293
Are you threatening me?

1126
01:16:11,393 --> 01:16:12,428
Yes.

1127
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:15,781
Now.

1128
01:16:15,782 --> 01:16:17,839
What was the deal with Robbie?

1129
01:16:21,354 --> 01:16:23,434
You don't know what it's like.

1130
01:16:24,465 --> 01:16:25,974
Think you do?

1131
01:16:26,765 --> 01:16:28,771
You act as if it's awesome.

1132
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:31,955
I hate it.

1133
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:35,287
I'm not special.

1134
01:16:35,802 --> 01:16:38,765
I just want what other women
want. Is that so terrible?

1135
01:16:38,931 --> 01:16:42,115
A husband. A marriage.
A family. To be loved.

1136
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:45,870
There is no such thing
in this environment.

1137
01:16:46,275 --> 01:16:48,342
They talk about it. Oh,
they talk. But there isn't.

1138
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,188
They don't need women.
They fuck each other.

1139
01:16:52,219 --> 01:16:53,986
And Robbie was different.

1140
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:03,962
I was gonna leave Larry.
I had made up my mind.

1141
01:17:05,673 --> 01:17:07,483
Robbie was making all
the arrangements and...

1142
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:10,348
Abby said he was broke.
That was not true.

1143
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:12,244
He had money coming in.

1144
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:19,164
Now let's go real slow.

1145
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:26,048
He was gonna testify before
Larry's committee on AltiMed.

1146
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,722
But he backed out.

1147
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:28,919
Why?

1148
01:17:29,176 --> 01:17:32,287
He said why give away
something valuable for free.

1149
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:36,667
I said he was crazy, he was
playing with fire, but...

1150
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,482
I was crazy, too. We both were.

1151
01:17:40,882 --> 01:17:43,905
I'd go back to when you found him.

1152
01:17:44,005 --> 01:17:47,268
What did you see when you
came into the apartment?

1153
01:17:50,084 --> 01:17:52,108
What did Robbie know?

1154
01:17:52,826 --> 01:17:55,771
He was expecting someone
to get the payment?

1155
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,187
What did he have that was so valuable?

1156
01:18:01,287 --> 01:18:02,618
A computer disk?

1157
01:18:08,826 --> 01:18:11,016
What was Robbie thinking?

1158
01:18:12,157 --> 01:18:15,434
What was he doing with Jack Delorean?

1159
01:18:20,974 --> 01:18:22,999
He was dead when I came in.

1160
01:18:24,361 --> 01:18:27,674
The crouch came after
the first stabbing.

1161
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:29,810
It was an afterthought.

1162
01:18:31,411 --> 01:18:33,049
He took something.

1163
01:18:34,282 --> 01:18:35,644
What do you mean?

1164
01:18:35,865 --> 01:18:39,877
The killer took something off Robbie.
It was a photo of him and me.

1165
01:18:40,651 --> 01:18:43,264
It wasn't explicit. But it was...

1166
01:18:44,718 --> 01:18:45,970
Affectionate.

1167
01:18:49,705 --> 01:18:51,325
That's sad, isn't it?

1168
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:56,994
That's how I got pulled into this.

1169
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,098
Oh, Robbie.

1170
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:04,024
Robbie, you fool.

1171
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:10,061
I loved him.

1172
01:19:11,589 --> 01:19:13,135
What am I gonna do?

1173
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:22,282
Hallo?
- Abby.

1174
01:19:22,392 --> 01:19:23,810
Carl, is that you?

1175
01:19:24,215 --> 01:19:26,364
I missed you at the Hargrave today.

1176
01:19:26,464 --> 01:19:30,233
It was like Christmas without a tree.

1177
01:19:30,877 --> 01:19:33,067
There was something I had to do.

1178
01:19:33,233 --> 01:19:34,834
Robbie's murder...

1179
01:19:34,963 --> 01:19:38,975
I was just going over it in my head
and I think I know what he was up to.

1180
01:19:39,122 --> 01:19:41,521
He was blackmailing the vice-president.

1181
01:19:41,621 --> 01:19:43,042
That's crazy.

1182
01:19:43,521 --> 01:19:44,919
Think about it.

1183
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,950
Robbie being tight for money.

1184
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:52,741
His involvement with the V.P.
in AltiMed. His resentment.

1185
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:55,398
On the phone he said
something about making a sales.

1186
01:19:55,498 --> 01:19:58,318
He said things were finally
coming around his way.

1187
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,452
He couldn't be that stupid.

1188
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,214
I think he was.

1189
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:04,484
Carter?

1190
01:20:04,944 --> 01:20:05,770
What?

1191
01:20:06,122 --> 01:20:07,484
Elvis is dead.

1192
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:11,386
Yeah. It is a bit farfetched.

1193
01:20:11,497 --> 01:20:13,705
Did the fabric arrive yet?

1194
01:20:13,871 --> 01:20:15,137
Yesterday.

1195
01:20:15,237 --> 01:20:16,539
How does it look?

1196
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:19,655
We'll get together.
I'll call you next week.

1197
01:20:19,755 --> 01:20:21,500
Choose the day.

1198
01:20:21,702 --> 01:20:23,561
Good night then. I gotta run.

1199
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,273
Good night, Sunflower.

1200
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:32,856
Well, Lancelot.

1201
01:20:32,985 --> 01:20:35,193
Let's see what comes of that.

1202
01:21:07,054 --> 01:21:08,541
What's it called?

1203
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:09,649
The kiss.

1204
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:11,691
Appropriate.

1205
01:21:13,991 --> 01:21:16,822
I'm going back to my place to
get some clothes. I'll be back.

1206
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:18,390
I should come along?

1207
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:20,973
I thought you had that movie opening?

1208
01:21:21,073 --> 01:21:22,071
Premiere.

1209
01:21:22,817 --> 01:21:24,608
And it's a good story. You know the...

1210
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:30,051
The daughter of a liberal black congressman falling
in love with the son of a right-wing senator.

1211
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:34,542
And they run off and their
parents join forces to find them.

1212
01:21:35,462 --> 01:21:39,462
It all ends up in Disney World
where, after much hilarity,...

1213
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:42,456
They all understand the
meaning of tolerance.

1214
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,107
That sounds terrific.

1215
01:21:45,861 --> 01:21:48,438
I'll see you later.
- Take care.

1216
01:22:13,606 --> 01:22:14,505
Hey.

1217
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:20,782
Hey.

1218
01:22:26,527 --> 01:22:27,392
Miss Page.

1219
01:22:28,883 --> 01:22:30,410
I just want to talk.

1220
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,595
Hey. It was only a warning.

1221
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:23,221
Hey, motherfucker.

1222
01:23:44,405 --> 01:23:45,307
Come on.

1223
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:49,191
Let's go.

1224
01:23:49,559 --> 01:23:50,669
Do you have a phone?
- Yeah.

1225
01:23:50,769 --> 01:23:51,749
Call 911.

1226
01:23:54,381 --> 01:23:55,528
Come on. Let's go.

1227
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:56,388
Wait.

1228
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,247
<i>There's been an accident.

1229
01:23:59,573 --> 01:24:00,511
<i>He's badly injured.

1230
01:24:01,045 --> 01:24:02,076
Let's go.

1231
01:24:07,394 --> 01:24:08,134
Let's go.

1232
01:24:08,135 --> 01:24:09,134
Sicked it is.

1233
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:11,996
Come on.

1234
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:14,480
Is that his ID?

1235
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:23,706
It took some humongous testes.

1236
01:24:23,806 --> 01:24:25,302
Kononsberg, I mean.

1237
01:24:25,781 --> 01:24:28,081
He blackmailed the vice-president.

1238
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:31,928
Desperate men do desperate things.

1239
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:34,376
Stupid men do stupid things.

1240
01:24:37,837 --> 01:24:38,941
Yeah. That's it. Right there.

1241
01:24:39,144 --> 01:24:41,132
Over here?
- Turn to left. Here.

1242
01:25:21,059 --> 01:25:22,453
What are you doing here, Carl?

1243
01:25:22,553 --> 01:25:24,212
Abigail, my Sunflower.

1244
01:25:24,312 --> 01:25:25,981
I need to see Jack.

1245
01:25:26,165 --> 01:25:27,600
Is he expecting you?

1246
01:25:27,784 --> 01:25:28,665
No.

1247
01:25:29,073 --> 01:25:30,343
What's going on?

1248
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,087
Is Jack in his office?

1249
01:25:32,187 --> 01:25:34,693
He does not like to be
disturbed, Carter. You know that.

1250
01:25:34,793 --> 01:25:36,073
Well, I'm gonna speak with him, Abby.

1251
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,135
This is my friend Emek. He
needs something to drink.

1252
01:25:38,235 --> 01:25:40,398
Coffee? Diet Coke?
- Regular, thank you.

1253
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:42,717
Abby will take you in the
kitchen and get you a Coke.

1254
01:25:42,817 --> 01:25:45,147
While you're in there make sure
she doesn't make any phone calls.

1255
01:25:45,247 --> 01:25:46,435
Doesn't make any phone calls?

1256
01:25:46,535 --> 01:25:49,601
I am gonna talk to him
now. This won't take long.

1257
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:51,958
Jack does not like to
be disturbed, Carter.

1258
01:25:52,058 --> 01:25:53,718
Don't worry about it. He will be
fine, just take a minute. Come on.

1259
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,399
What the hell is it now?

1260
01:25:59,074 --> 01:26:00,841
I'll call you right back.

1261
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:03,731
I need to talk to you.

1262
01:26:04,504 --> 01:26:06,584
Call and make an appointment.

1263
01:26:06,823 --> 01:26:09,437
Now will you please get out of my house?

1264
01:26:13,505 --> 01:26:15,424
His name's Edgar Comensky.

1265
01:26:15,524 --> 01:26:18,033
Ex-Marine
Corps. Ex-FBI.

1266
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:22,096
His last known employment
was head of AltiMed security.

1267
01:26:22,196 --> 01:26:24,567
He also worked for you.

1268
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,892
No need to track him down.

1269
01:26:26,992 --> 01:26:29,628
This photo was taken
about a minute later.

1270
01:26:31,763 --> 01:26:34,769
It's criminal act to leave
the scenes of a crime.

1271
01:26:34,869 --> 01:26:36,088
Call the cops.

1272
01:26:37,597 --> 01:26:38,965
You what I think?

1273
01:26:39,065 --> 01:26:41,904
I think Comensky was two-timing you.

1274
01:26:42,124 --> 01:26:47,562
Worked for you. Found out about
Lynn and Robbie. Sold it to Mungo.

1275
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:50,526
Pretty good guess.

1276
01:26:53,085 --> 01:26:53,821
Sit.

1277
01:27:00,244 --> 01:27:01,661
What do you want?

1278
01:27:03,004 --> 01:27:05,416
You wanna get Tenant off your back?

1279
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,808
That would be good.

1280
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:10,937
That man is an asshole.

1281
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:14,103
Where did he get that name 'Mungo'?

1282
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:16,182
I believe it's British.

1283
01:27:18,795 --> 01:27:20,249
I'll do what I can.

1284
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:22,145
Lynn Lockner's as well.

1285
01:27:22,973 --> 01:27:25,439
Have you talked to her husband, Larry?

1286
01:27:25,623 --> 01:27:27,334
Did he tell you that..?

1287
01:27:27,574 --> 01:27:29,469
'This is a war. '

1288
01:27:29,837 --> 01:27:31,714
He likes to talk like that.

1289
01:27:32,506 --> 01:27:34,512
Well, this little war is over.

1290
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,966
He lost.

1291
01:27:36,647 --> 01:27:37,788
You lost.

1292
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:40,126
I wasn't a combatant.

1293
01:27:40,586 --> 01:27:43,273
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

1294
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,144
Listen, Carl. It's not personal.

1295
01:27:46,255 --> 01:27:48,426
I like you. I liked your father.

1296
01:27:49,071 --> 01:27:51,905
But you're on the wrong side of history.

1297
01:27:52,182 --> 01:27:58,862
People don't want your radical
ideas, your agenda, your lifestyle.

1298
01:28:00,536 --> 01:28:03,592
People want a story.

1299
01:28:04,106 --> 01:28:06,425
A good American story.

1300
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,219
And maybe a murder story.

1301
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:10,769
One that you wrote.

1302
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:12,223
Me?

1303
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:14,781
Of course not.

1304
01:28:15,978 --> 01:28:19,272
People think I have some
kind of secret power.

1305
01:28:19,714 --> 01:28:21,021
I don't.

1306
01:28:21,628 --> 01:28:23,506
I'm not even elected.

1307
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:26,653
I'm just an old man.

1308
01:28:27,324 --> 01:28:29,138
Has lot of old friends.

1309
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:33,471
I'm an old man that always
puts my country first.

1310
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:36,857
And Robbie's death.

1311
01:28:38,311 --> 01:28:40,777
The cemeteries are full of dead guys.

1312
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:42,613
He was a criminal.

1313
01:28:42,713 --> 01:28:44,454
He was involved in a criminal act.

1314
01:28:44,554 --> 01:28:47,311
And he met criminal consequences.

1315
01:28:47,651 --> 01:28:49,842
As for the opportunists...

1316
01:28:50,136 --> 01:28:52,731
Like Attorney Tenant.

1317
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:57,315
Who try to exploit the situation
for political purposes...

1318
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,032
They were on the wrong side, too.

1319
01:29:01,805 --> 01:29:04,160
And they will get their due.

1320
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,054
It's time to move on.

1321
01:29:08,956 --> 01:29:11,478
Lynn, to get back to her life.

1322
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:14,643
You did the right thing, Carl.

1323
01:29:15,857 --> 01:29:17,882
So how I was forgotten?

1324
01:29:19,078 --> 01:29:20,808
Nothing to remember.

1325
01:29:20,973 --> 01:29:23,624
Whoever knows what really happens?

1326
01:29:25,022 --> 01:29:25,961
I know.

1327
01:29:29,982 --> 01:29:31,511
Well... Bully for you!

1328
01:29:31,787 --> 01:29:33,286
Are we finished?

1329
01:29:35,321 --> 01:29:36,580
Good.

1330
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,979
How did you get past Abby?

1331
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:50,375
How did she ever let you in here?

1332
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:54,406
She is more interested
in her television program.

1333
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,597
Antiques Roadshow.

1334
01:29:57,296 --> 01:29:58,511
Figures.

1335
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:01,769
Good-bye, Carl.

1336
01:30:03,094 --> 01:30:04,198
Bye.

1337
01:30:16,806 --> 01:30:19,548
So do you still feel comfortable
staying at my place tonight?

1338
01:30:21,186 --> 01:30:23,689
Maybe we should look for another place.

1339
01:30:32,045 --> 01:30:33,058
Ah, shit.

1340
01:30:35,561 --> 01:30:37,254
We're speeding?
- No.

1341
01:30:37,935 --> 01:30:40,365
Put your seatbelt on.
- It's broken.

1342
01:30:45,444 --> 01:30:47,413
All right. Just relax.

1343
01:30:59,156 --> 01:31:00,537
Emek Yoglu?

1344
01:31:00,942 --> 01:31:03,151
Please step outside the vehicle.

1345
01:31:03,519 --> 01:31:04,660
Both of you.

1346
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:08,599
Turn around.

1347
01:31:09,022 --> 01:31:10,334
Get your feet apart.

1348
01:31:10,434 --> 01:31:12,409
Hands on top of the vehicle.

1349
01:31:14,065 --> 01:31:16,016
Place your hands up behind your backs.

1350
01:31:17,985 --> 01:31:20,366
You're under arrest for leaving
the scene of an accident.

1351
01:31:20,466 --> 01:31:22,058
Said Delorean took care of it, huh?

1352
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:24,427
I doubt he knows. Just shut up.

1353
01:31:30,243 --> 01:31:32,139
Any additional charges?

1354
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,200
That's what we'll find out.

1355
01:31:34,605 --> 01:31:35,415
Here.

1356
01:31:36,078 --> 01:31:37,513
Emek, put that on.

1357
01:31:39,059 --> 01:31:40,869
Mungo is putting on a bit of a show.

1358
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:42,814
It's called the 'Perp Lock'.

1359
01:31:43,182 --> 01:31:45,157
It's a little like a society opening.

1360
01:31:45,257 --> 01:31:46,638
Cameras, reporters...

1361
01:31:46,738 --> 01:31:49,659
But a different jewelry.

1362
01:31:50,193 --> 01:31:55,144
In all the years I've known you Ethan,
I never knew you had a sense of humor.

1363
01:31:58,603 --> 01:32:00,794
Here's what. Come and test it.

1364
01:32:39,906 --> 01:32:41,176
How are you?

1365
01:32:42,336 --> 01:32:43,117
Good.

1366
01:32:43,118 --> 01:32:44,194
Considering...

1367
01:32:44,724 --> 01:32:50,853
There is a refreshing lack of choice
and a completely new social set.

1368
01:32:52,073 --> 01:32:54,190
I've spoken to your attorney.

1369
01:32:54,558 --> 01:32:59,067
We're gonna keep you till the morning
then you and Mr. Yoglu will be released.

1370
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:01,680
And the search for Robbie's killer?

1371
01:33:01,846 --> 01:33:05,490
That would be Mr. Cominsky,
the fellow hit by the SUV.

1372
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:07,091
He left some blood at the scene.

1373
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:08,941
We have a DNA match.

1374
01:33:10,321 --> 01:33:12,144
And Mungo Tenant?

1375
01:33:15,457 --> 01:33:19,478
Attorney Tenant has
taken a leave of absence.

1376
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,124
I don't think he'll be returning.

1377
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:27,835
Sorry about the publicity and
everything. A mistake was made.

1378
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,670
But it's all worked out.

1379
01:33:30,314 --> 01:33:31,142
Yeah.

1380
01:33:48,971 --> 01:33:55,339
Do you remember what I was telling you about
that offer for the gallery show in New York?

1381
01:33:55,689 --> 01:33:57,014
It came through.

1382
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:03,313
Notoriety has its upside I guess.

1383
01:34:03,413 --> 01:34:06,823
They'll explode the headlines.
You can't avoid that.

1384
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,811
Listen.

1385
01:34:10,449 --> 01:34:13,081
I want you to come to the opening. Okay?

1386
01:34:15,456 --> 01:34:17,131
Let me think about it.

1387
01:34:24,198 --> 01:34:25,762
See you in New York.

1388
01:34:29,424 --> 01:34:31,536
Not for long.
- I wish I had been there.

1389
01:34:31,636 --> 01:34:33,220
He said it was on a consignment.

1390
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,552
Oh, he wasn't asking you to pay retail?

1391
01:34:35,672 --> 01:34:36,769
No, I said...

1392
01:34:36,869 --> 01:34:42,597
Don't start pulling on that string or the
whole fabric of our world will unravel.

1393
01:34:46,849 --> 01:34:47,935
Knock-knock.

1394
01:34:51,026 --> 01:34:51,855
Carl?

1395
01:34:54,634 --> 01:34:56,217
We're trying to play.

1396
01:34:59,419 --> 01:35:03,722
Don't worry I'm not staying. I just
have something to return to Lynn.

1397
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:05,511
You're welcome to stay.

1398
01:35:07,149 --> 01:35:11,254
Yes, please stay. We're
so happy to see you.

1399
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:26,033
Lynn.

1400
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:31,812
Excuse me.

1401
01:35:40,794 --> 01:35:42,097
Congratulations.

1402
01:35:42,197 --> 01:35:43,132
For what?

1403
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,604
I hear the happy couple, Lynn and
Larry Lockner are back together.

1404
01:35:48,764 --> 01:35:50,899
There is a function tonight, in fact.

1405
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:53,292
We'll be there together and make nice...

1406
01:35:53,531 --> 01:35:55,317
Consort with the enemy.

1407
01:35:56,936 --> 01:35:58,924
You have something for me?

1408
01:36:00,616 --> 01:36:02,609
I didn't want you to worry about...

1409
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:04,435
Where this might be.

1410
01:36:06,991 --> 01:36:08,049
Thank you.

1411
01:36:12,172 --> 01:36:14,601
Why did you stand by me?

1412
01:36:14,987 --> 01:36:17,619
You thought I killed Robbie, didn't you?

1413
01:36:18,926 --> 01:36:20,140
Of course not.

1414
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:22,607
Not even a little?

1415
01:36:24,649 --> 01:36:25,956
Maybe a little.

1416
01:36:27,023 --> 01:36:29,619
But after everything you went through.

1417
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:31,478
You stood by me. Why?

1418
01:36:32,932 --> 01:36:38,122
I spent my life without any
real idea why I behaved as I did.

1419
01:36:38,692 --> 01:36:40,797
I thought Robbie's murder was a mystery.

1420
01:36:40,897 --> 01:36:42,852
That's not a mystery.

1421
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:47,361
One's own life. That's a mystery.

1422
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:52,529
A grown man acting on
the fears of a child.

1423
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:57,125
Trying to impress a
father dead ten years.

1424
01:36:57,502 --> 01:36:59,223
Now that's a mystery.

1425
01:37:02,057 --> 01:37:04,377
Strange how things work out.

1426
01:37:07,248 --> 01:37:08,279
Bye, Lynn.

1427

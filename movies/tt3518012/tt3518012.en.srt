2
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,121
I keep nothing but a few
photographs in the bathroom

3
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,874
of myself at an earlier time.

4
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:30,214
The first shows me at the age of 25,
looking rather anxious.

5
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,092
I've just bought a large house
in the country

6
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,136
and cannot afford it.

7
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,767
Here you see the young author
of Williwaw at the age of 19,

8
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,060
still in uniform.

9
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,939
Here, above the bathtub,
in the place of honor,

10
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,443
are the debates
with William Buckley in 1968.

11
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,404
He was a well known
right-wing commentator

12
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,199
whose name seldom passes my lips.

13
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,519
Cameras, please. Cameras.

14
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,729
William F. Buckley.

15
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,860
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,155
That was a very nice introduction.

17
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,367
On the other hand,
if it hadn't been,

18
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,202
I would've smashed you
in the goddamn face.

19
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,463
I do this so well...

20
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,715
and so terminally,

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,595
I have left the bleeding corpse
of William F. Buckley, Jr.

22
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,099
on the floor of
the convention hall in Chicago.

23
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,519
I would definitely have
Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley

24
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,979
on my television show.

25
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,315
I would guess that the rematch
of the great conflict

26
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,193
would attract people precisely
because it held out

27
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,863
- the possibility of something--
- Violence.

28
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,366
- Camera speeding.
- Action.

29
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,048
In the 60's

30
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,511
the institution in which
Americans had the greatest confidence

31
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,346
was television news.

32
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,772
Split-second organization
on a worldwide scale,

33
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,401
speed and efficiency in
the nerve centers of NBC News.

34
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,363
News was this big, bland center

35
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,825
that determined for us
what America was.

36
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,037
Which was white, Anglo-Saxon,

37
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,456
there were never any vowels
at the end of the names.

38
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,166
Chet Huntley and
David Brinkley

39
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,876
still are the team supreme

40
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,794
in the art of easygoing commentary.

41
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,883
Networks, did they deal
in controversy? No!

42
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,761
Did they invite controversy? No!

43
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,139
They were in the center.

44
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,267
They were cementers of idea,

45
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,520
not disrupters of idea.

46
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,690
This is the CBS Evening
News with Walter Cronkite.

47
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,193
Good evening from our CBS newsroom
in New York.

48
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,236
NBC and CBS
were fighting for the lead

49
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,656
and ABC was clearly number three.

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,620
The other two networks were doing
full coverage at the conventions,

51
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,830
gavel-to-gavel.

52
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,920
Turn the cameras and microphones on
and let them roll.

53
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:02,426
And ABC had less money to spend
on these things.

54
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,766
So, in 1968 ABC went to the truncated
version of convention coverage

55
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,811
to do an hour and a half
from 9:30 to 11:00 at night.

56
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,440
They didn't have Cronkite,
didn't have Huntley and Brinkley.

57
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,568
They didn't have the standards.

58
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,696
Cameras, please. Cameras.

59
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,456
ABC was the third
of the three networks.

60
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,421
Would've been fourth,
but there were only three.

61
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,215
They had the weaker programming.

62
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,469
Somebody famously said
that the way to end the Vietnam war

63
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,848
was to put it on ABC and
it'd be canceled in 13 weeks.

64
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:56,397
In order to be competitive,
with the 1968 convention,

65
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,776
ABC needed something.
Provocative.

66
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,611
A media event.

67
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,656
And they settled on
Buckley and Vidal.

68
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,583
It wasn't necessarily sensible.

69
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,252
It was a shot in the dark.

70
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,257
And it changed television... forever.

71
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,472
Why are the races unreconciled?

72
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,557
Why does poverty persevere?

73
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,059
Why are the young disenchanted?

74
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,519
Why do the birds sing so unhappily?

75
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,605
It is easy to be carried away.

76
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,816
And yet always there is
a strain of seriousness,

77
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,568
something in the system
that warns us.

78
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,905
Warns us that America had better
strike out on a different course,

79
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,574
rather than face another
four years of asphyxiation

80
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,825
by liberal premises.

81
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,579
This is William F. Buckley, Jr.
in New York.

82
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,041
Perfect.

83
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,669
This is the William
F. Buckley America knows best.

84
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,672
Grimacing or incredulous
or disdainful.

85
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,550
Readying himself
for a deceptively quiet attack

86
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,803
on his intellectual prey
of the moment.

87
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,348
This is the William F. Buckley
Barry Goldwater insists

88
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,308
fills a crying national need.

89
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,520
We want Buckley!
We want Buckley!

90
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,149
William F. Buckley, Jr.

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,402
has a strong
definite opinion on every subject.

92
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,239
So, wherever he goes,
he has to have an answer

93
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,907
about every question.

94
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,784
Do you think
America doesn't

95
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,369
believe in itself
as much as it used to?

96
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,995
Yes, I think that's true.

97
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,834
I think it's happening
because of a restlessness

98
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,795
for so long,
as liberalism suggested,

99
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,381
that it could bring
happiness to the individual.

100
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,050
Then people tended to look
to government agencies

101
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,763
for those narcotic substitutes
for a search for happiness

102
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,058
and contentment, which they ought
to have found in their religion,

103
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,018
in their institutions
and their culture themselves.

104
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,402
Buckley was the first
modern conservative intellectual

105
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,656
to see that ideological debates
were cultural debates.

106
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:15,536
And what he did was to put
conservatism on the march.

107
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,664
And that's the creation of
the movement that we have today.

108
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,252
He's stimulating.
He's exhausting. He's fun.

109
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,424
Sometimes I could kill him...
but not too often.

110
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,802
He could've been
the playboy of the Western world

111
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,807
but he chose to be the St. Paul
of the conservative movement.

112
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,476
Most work days,
he winds up

113
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,604
in the offices of
the National Review,

114
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,355
his journal
of conservative opinion

115
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,110
which reaches 110,000 subscribers
and is read by many more.

116
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,949
National Review
is the most influential

117
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,743
magazine of our time.

118
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,872
Why?
The magazine attached to a movement.

119
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,418
My brother, Bill,
he was a conservative,

120
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,712
right-wing libertarian Christian.

121
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,380
That's what he was.

122
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,052
But most of all,
Bill was a revolutionary.

123
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,389
When the people at ABC
had first approached Bill,

124
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,475
they had asked him would he
be willing to be

125
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,479
the conservative debater commentator
with the national conventions.

126
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,147
And he said, yes, he would.

127
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,399
And they asked him, "Well, is there
anybody you wouldn't go on with?"

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,819
And he said, "Well, I would
refuse to go on with a Communist."

129
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,907
"And, apart from that, the only one
I can think of is Gore Vidal."

130
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,118
Camera's rolling.

131
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,372
Men and women
who are sexually repressed

132
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:46,877
regard all sexual pleasure as
"dirty," "evil," "the devil's work."

133
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,047
Yet we are all prostitutes
in one sense or another,

134
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,674
ethically, if not sexually.

135
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,261
For Buckley, Vidal was the devil.

136
00:09:55,428 --> 00:10:01,809
He represented everything
that was going to moral hell...

137
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,522
that was degenerative
about the country.

138
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,944
A cultural war has now joined
the race war in the United States.

139
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,031
And the change
is going to be very difficult.

140
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,076
And as our own
Thomas Jefferson once said,

141
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,246
"The tree of liberty must
occasionally be watered with blood."

142
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,127
In a sense, this was the beginning
of a war between an old order

143
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,587
and what I hoped
would be a new order.

144
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,177
Gore didn't just see
rioting in the streets,

145
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,388
he saw revolution breaking out.

146
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,184
Remember, Gore Vidal
was always an iconoclast.

147
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,230
An apostate.
A writer against the grain.

148
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,277
And he saw Buckley and his ideas
as anti-Democratic.

149
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,073
If Buckley were not taken out,
his ideas would take down the nation.

150
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:04,079
It occurred to me that the central
drive in human beings is power.

151
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,167
And that has always been my theme,
that ideal in politics,

152
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,419
which is an obvious
manifestation of power.

153
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,173
Gore Vidal is one of
America's most successful

154
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,674
and distinguished writers.

155
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,303
He also lives in a personal cloud
of outrageous legends.

156
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,556
After the early books, which first
brought him to the public eye,

157
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,768
came a group of highly praised
historical novels

158
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,311
which sold in the millions.

159
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,689
But it was Myra Breckinridge
that confirmed Vidal's place

160
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,401
as the enfant terrible of the
respectable American literary scene.

161
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,113
By 1968, he had just
published a bombshell of a book,

162
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,450
his greatest satire, and, I think,
one of the greatest satires written

163
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,285
in English, Myra Breckinridge.

164
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,663
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

165
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,333
what you've all been waiting for...

166
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,001
The book that couldn't be written

167
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,463
is now the motion picture
that couldn't be made:

168
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,673
Myra Breckinridge.

169
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,261
He'd gotten, you know,
the cover of TIME magazine for it.

170
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,305
And his career
was soaring at the time.

171
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,266
But, it was edgy material.

172
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,811
I don't know where Myra came from.

173
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,022
I really was like the character,
each day wondering what Myra would do

174
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,401
and roaring with laughter as this
thing presented herself to me.

175
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,404
Gentlemen...

176
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,116
I am Myron Breckinridge.

177
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,077
Uncle Buck, your fag nephew
became your niece

178
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,580
two years ago in Copenhagen,
and is now free as a bird

179
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,626
and happy in being the most
extraordinary woman in the world!

180
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,713
And suddenly, it occurred to me,
about sexual relations.

181
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,592
How indeed much of it is based
not upon any pleasure principle,

182
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,969
or even a procreative one,

183
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,888
but of people
gaining power over others.

184
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,557
Ah-ha! Gotcha!

185
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:51,270
And so I conceived
of my androgynous protagonist

186
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,190
who is a man who becomes a woman
who becomes a man.

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,026
A transsexual seducing men,

188
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,279
or in one case,
I believe, raping a man...

189
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,865
Yay-haa!

190
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,575
Uh...

191
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,995
The themes of Myra Breckinridge,

192
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,289
and also sexuality
and transsexuality,

193
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,999
was way ahead of its time

194
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,750
and got under Bill Buckley's skin.

195
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:21,258
Mr. Buckley, did you see the film
Myra Breckinridge, and why not?

196
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,721
That told the people at ABC:

197
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,432
"Wow, we have a chance
for some great theater here!

198
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,892
Let's get Gore Vidal."

199
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,485
Gore Vidal is a whore of debate.

200
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,197
And when it comes to values
of our country,

201
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,240
and of historical forces,

202
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,367
the man is brilliant.

203
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,996
And the man is fun to watch.

204
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,459
But there is always a residue,
in my opinion,

205
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,378
when I watch him,
of nausea.

206
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,300
I didn't say anything nasty
about him, did I?

207
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,679
It is under... No.

208
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,765
All right.

209
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,732
It is understandable
that the Republicans decided

210
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,693
to hold their convention
south of the Mason-Dixon line.

211
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,821
They had not done so in 104 years.

212
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,034
And it is obvious why anyone
might want to come to Miami Beach.

213
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,371
But the real reasons for
the Republican presence here

214
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,207
are less obvious.
And I blew that one. Let's--

215
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,721
This nine-mile-long sandbar
has one advantage above all others,

216
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,014
it is remote.

217
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,809
It's therefore easy
for the Republicans

218
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,853
to avoid the danger of large,
militant demonstrations.

219
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,697
There's a huge, almost empty
convention hall down there

220
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,783
waiting for
the 1968 Republican convention.

221
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,495
There's very little work left to do
before the first gavel on Monday.

222
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,044
Every political convention has
features no other before it has had.

223
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,213
What's going to be distinctive
about this one?

224
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,091
First of all, this is the first one
available to the public

225
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,051
completely in beautiful color,

226
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,387
and lady delegates have received
careful instructions

227
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,932
about how to dress so as
to appear vivid, but not garish.

228
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,065
Bill Buckley took off
for a week sailing

229
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,484
before the Republican
National Convention.

230
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,487
They sailed down to Cozumel.

231
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,366
I would be rather surprised
if he did any special preparation

232
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,869
for this encounter with Gore Vidal.

233
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,496
Buckley expected this to be

234
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:01,793
an opportunity to debate the issues,
to have some fun.

235
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,297
He was not prepared for Mr. Vidal.

236
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,634
Gore told me he hired a researcher.

237
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,388
He wanted to paint National Review
as being racist,

238
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,849
if he could, anti-Semitic.

239
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:21,396
I don't think he was really
interested in conducting a debate

240
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,025
about the issues
or about the parties

241
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,779
or about the policies or about
the platforms of the two parties.

242
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,449
What he wanted to do
was to expose Bill Buckley.

243
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,459
Their confrontation
is about lifestyle,

244
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,380
what kind of people should we be.

245
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,759
Their real argument,
in front of the public,

246
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,303
is "who is the better person."

247
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,144
In one minute, A Second Look
with William Buckley and Gore Vidal.

248
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,484
Across from us
was Howard K. Smith.

249
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,238
Suave, intelligent,
madly apprehensive.

250
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,825
Rehearsing with his lips the lines
he would presently deliver.

251
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,870
Thirty, 40, 50 technicians,
reporters, directors

252
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,747
filled the enormous room,

253
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,501
at one corner of which,
earphones attached,

254
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,796
Vidal and I awaited
the sound of the bell.

255
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,841
From past experience, I knew

256
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,719
that Buckley
would have done no research.

257
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,222
That what facts he had at his command
would be jumbled

258
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,391
by the strangest syntax.

259
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,936
We'd exchanged minimal amenities.

260
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,399
And I scribbled on my clipboard to
avoid having to banter with him.

261
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,818
And he did the same.

262
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,320
For all their
ideological differences,

263
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,072
they both see what the problem is.

264
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,450
That America can't stay
on the course it's on.

265
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,869
And that the country's
being split at the seams.

266
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,872
And each has staked out his position

267
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:08,128
in ways that portend where our
country is divided right now.

268
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,634
To help us extract meaning
from these conventions,

269
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,971
two of America's most eloquent
and most decided commentators

270
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,556
have joined us this year.

271
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,769
They are Gore Vidal
and William F. Buckley, Jr.

272
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,189
Can Mr. Vidal
assess the Republicans for us?

273
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:32,402
Can a political party based almost
entirely upon human greed

274
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,447
nominate anyone for President

275
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,700
for whom a majority
of the American people would vote?

276
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,579
May I comment, Mr. Smith?

277
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,830
- Please do.
- Yeah.

278
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,919
It seems to me that the author
of Myra Breckinridge

279
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,588
is well acquainted with
the imperatives of human greed.

280
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,007
Well, I would like to say,
Bill, if I may--

281
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,177
If I may say, Bill,
before you go any further,

282
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:01,515
I would like to say if there were a
contest for Mr. Myra Breckinridge

283
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,225
you would unquestionably win it.

284
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,936
I based her entire style
polemically upon you:

285
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,479
passionate and irrelevant.

286
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:14,361
Now, my point is that for Mr. Vidal
to contend a particular party

287
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,613
as engaged in the pursuit
of human greed,

288
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,658
requires us to understand
his rather eccentric definitions.

289
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,618
Is it greedy really
for a people to suggest

290
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,496
that what matters to poor people
is that they have houses?

291
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,998
Is it really greedy to want to
preserve our freedom?

292
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:32,254
We have the luxury of being able
to focus on those who are poor

293
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,548
in our midst as though we can
do something about it.

294
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,091
Which is something
that no other country

295
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,885
less occupied with human greed has--

296
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,180
The nice thing about the Republican
party is that every four years

297
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,766
after denigrating the poor
amongst themselves,

298
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,143
referring to them as "freeloaders,"
"they don't want to work,"

299
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,271
and I have many quotes here
from Ronald Reagan.

300
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,566
And then every four years you get
this sort of crocodile tears

301
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,110
for the poor people
because they need their vote.

302
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,947
It is quite true that Reagan is
capable of talking about freeloaders,

303
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,367
so am I,
because there are freeloaders.

304
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:07,163
It is one thing to say that
a society ought to concern itself

305
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,957
with the plight of its poor.
I think the Republican party

306
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,250
is saying that.

307
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,751
Perhaps the Republican party
should have

308
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,921
a platform on how to deal with Vidal.

309
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,757
If absolutely necessary, I will write
it for them, but meanwhile--

310
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,760
Meanwhile, I'd be very, very nervous.
You have written lately of your

311
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,388
intimacy with Reagan and with Nixon

312
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,682
and that you've discussed
the Vietnam War with them

313
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,809
and that you are satisfied
with their positions.

314
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,855
Since you're in favor of the nuclear
bombing of North Vietnam,

315
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,817
I'd be very worried about
your kind of odd neurosis--

316
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,613
Or more like neurosis being a friend
of anybody who might be a president.

317
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,032
I've never advocated the nuclear
bombing of North Vietnam.

318
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,619
You have, and I'll give you
time and place even.

319
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,662
- Well, you won't, because I never--
- I will.

320
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,414
I will if we don't mind.
The record--

321
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,625
No, now wait a minute,
don't duck away from the record.

322
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,086
You suggested the atom bombing
of the north of Vietnam

323
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,339
in your little magazine,
which I do not read,

324
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,051
but I'm told about,
on February 23, 1968.

325
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,719
So you're very hawkish.

326
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,764
And now, if both Nixon and Reagan
are listening to you,

327
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,557
I'm very worried for the country.

328
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,518
Now, it seems to me that
the Republican party

329
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,189
has shown a record of greater
sobriety than Mr. Vidal,

330
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:17,067
who boasts of not reading something
which he has prepared to misquote

331
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,902
in the presence of the person
who edits this.

332
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,572
Now, Bill Buckley,
if the quotation is exact...

333
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,826
Now don't be... We know your
tendency is to be feline, Mr. Vidal,

334
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,789
but just relax for a moment
and think very simply on this.

335
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,209
I have not advocated...
I'm not horrified at the prospect.

336
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,670
Bill, I just quoted where you said
these things and where.

337
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,506
- Are you saying you didn't say them?
- I'm saying that I didn't say them.

338
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,883
- You're taking them back?
- That your misquotation--

339
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,511
Tune in this time tomorrow night
and we will have further evidence

340
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,263
of Bill Buckley,
cold warrior turned hot.

341
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,182
Right, and about the human greed
of everybody in the world

342
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,601
- except yourself.
- There are saints.

343
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,979
Tomorrow, what Mr. Vidal
thinks about the Kennedys.

344
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,106
Good night, and let me tell you.

345
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,817
Excuse me, gentlemen.

346
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,319
It's been very enjoyable
hearing you articulate

347
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,571
two points of view.
Thank you very much indeed.

348
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,032
I think I detected some
unfinished lines of thought.

349
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,493
We'll have time to follow them
through tomorrow.

350
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,997
And tomorrow. And tomorrow.
Every night, we...

351
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,374
There's nothing feigned
about the mutual antipathy.

352
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,585
They really do despise one another.

353
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,089
Each thought that the other
was quite dangerous.

354
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:25,135
And it was drawn from quite a deep
well in both cases.

355
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,638
Gore Vidal and William Buckley
first clashed,

356
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:34,019
almost by proxy, in 1962
on The Jack Paar Program.

357
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,062
Vidal had gone on Jack Paar's show

358
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,732
and they both started
mocking Buckley:

359
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,986
his eccentric mannerisms,
the voice,

360
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,905
the facial tics, all the rest.

361
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,324
So, in effect,
Buckley was given equal time.

362
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,744
And he went on Jack Paar's show.

363
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:56,750
And Paar expected that kind of
troglodyte Neanderthal

364
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,880
man-of-the-right whom Vidal had
caricatured on the program.

365
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,884
And instead,
you have this genius of debate.

366
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,387
And Paar was stunned.

367
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,684
We next met in San Francisco, 1964,

368
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,228
during the Goldwater convention.

369
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,523
I confessed to having prepared
a trap for Buckley.

370
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,692
I egged him on.

371
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,111
The next day, Buckley sent me
a letter to the effect

372
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,363
that he never wanted to see me again.

373
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,284
I found this sentiment agreeable.

374
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,456
Buckley was eager
to be on television.

375
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,669
The downside of it for Gore was that
he contributed to Buckley's...

376
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,881
becoming an onscreen celebrity.

377
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,722
Mr. Buckley,
read by many, but not that many,

378
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,058
would be nothing if it wasn't for
his program Firing Line.

379
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,811
Buckley sat in his chair
with a clipboard

380
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:02,440
and would invite left-wingers
or liberals on his program,

381
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,026
and they would go back and forth
for half an hour.

382
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,238
People on the left are
more law-abiding than anybody else.

383
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,323
That's why they're on the left.

384
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,242
- Explain that, would you?
- I'd be happy to.

385
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,202
You're marvelous. I adore you.

386
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,787
You're the only man
who can ask your question,

387
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,248
and convict the man
before he can answer the question.

388
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,459
Television was happy to have Bill

389
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,379
because everybody else
was saying the same thing.

390
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:28,424
From my point of view,
what Elijah Muhammad is doing to you

391
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,719
is diseasing your mind.

392
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:37,767
You sit and tell me that we white
people like to divide and conquer.

393
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,769
- You do.
- I grew up as a white child,

394
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,398
I heard much more talk against Democrats
than I did against black people.

395
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,735
When he began Firing Line
he did it in part to show off.

396
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,697
But he actually did just what
pundit television should do.

397
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,117
Which is he elevated the discourse
and he educated people through it.

398
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,332
On the eve of the Republican
Convention, the heat is on.

399
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,918
We bring you a report
on who did what to whom

400
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,587
in the last hours before the gavel.

401
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,340
Plus commentary and some dissent
from our guest commentators:

402
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,800
author Gore Vidal...

403
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,052
ABC's unconventional
convention coverage

404
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,471
was a subject of ridicule

405
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,184
as we were abdicating our
journalistic responsibility.

406
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,730
But if the goal was to raise
ABC News' visibility,

407
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,107
we certainly succeeded.

408
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,402
Everybody watched the news.

409
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,697
Nearly 80 percent of the country
watched coverage

410
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,575
of the Republican and Democratic
conventions in 1968.

411
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,662
We're going live
to the West Coast

412
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,414
in about six or seven minutes.

413
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,626
And then, ABC News' studio collapsed.

414
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,722
The lighting grid fell down
onto the floor of the set.

415
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,100
And the roof fell in...
...literally.

416
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,478
It was built inside the arena.

417
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,063
Hard hats on.

418
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:10,151
ABC was really the Budget car rental
of television news.

419
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,155
Pieces of the ceiling start flying,
and then all of a sudden,

420
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,491
the whole thing started giving away.

421
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,453
Mr. Lower, ABC promised to be
unconventional this year

422
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,457
- but this is ridiculous.
- We're gonna be unconventional, Sam.

423
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,667
I can tell you that.

424
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,378
Thank you very much.
Now let's just cut it.

425
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,934
This is Miami, day one.

426
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,354
From Miami Beach,
ABC News presents...

427
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,898
Race to the White House.

428
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,651
They did what they could.

429
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,653
Basically, they hung a lot of drapes.

430
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,489
Lit the set with C stands and lamps.

431
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,367
Frankly, I think it was
an improvement.

432
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,954
We would like now to demonstrate how
the English language ought to be used

433
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,415
by two craftsmen,
our guest commentators.

434
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,166
On the air in ten...

435
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:14,132
If you view debate purely as sport,
let's call it blood sport.

436
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,427
Then really, all bets are off.

437
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,180
Nine, eight, seven, six.
Standby now!

438
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:26,477
You have one objective,
and that's to win in that moment.

439
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:32,900
When you attack
the position of your opponent,

440
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,862
you have to first attack it
clinically and rationally.

441
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,449
Six, five, four...

442
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,745
But mostly what you have to get at
is what's behind those things.

443
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,165
What is driving the human being
who is in front of you.

444
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,877
...three, two, one.

445
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,300
- Gore Vidal.
- Tonight, the key question

446
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,011
for every patriot is

447
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,474
"Can an aging, Hollywood, juvenile
actor with a right-wing script

448
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,727
defeat Richard Nixon,
a professional politician

449
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:12,607
who currently represents no
discernible interest except his own?"

450
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,693
As of yesterday morning,
Ronald Regan says,

451
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,570
"The only function of government

452
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,282
is to get out of our way and leave us
alone as much as possible."

453
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,785
Now, on this occasion,
I'm afraid I have to agree

454
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,537
with William Buckley,
the distinguished thinker,

455
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,997
when he says...

456
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:31,000
My favorite quotation from you.
I have a treasury here.

457
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,295
"Today as never before, the State
has the necessary instrument

458
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,464
of our proximate deliverance."

459
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,925
As usual, in your slightly Latinate
and inaccurate style.

460
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,135
But you do feel,
as most of us do,

461
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:45,098
that the State must
have some responsibility

462
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,642
for what happens in the country.
And now you have Ronald Regan,

463
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,310
whom you approve of,
who does not want to use

464
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,187
the federal government
to do anything at all.

465
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,732
Mr. Smith, I confess
that anything complicated

466
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,359
confuses Mr. Vidal.

467
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,861
This has been plain
for a very long time.

468
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,906
He has a great difficulty
reconciling

469
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,660
even axiomatic positions
concerning political philosophy,

470
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,330
but we were treated to
Mr. Gore Vidal, the playwright.

471
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,333
Saying that, after all,
Ronald Regan

472
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:18,131
was nothing more than
an "aging Hollywood juvenile actor."

473
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,008
Now, to begin with,
everybody's aging,

474
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,178
- even Mr. Vidal. That's right.
- Even you are, Bill.

475
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,931
- Perceptibly before our eyes.
- Then he said "Hollywood."

476
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,684
Now, one has either
acted in Hollywood

477
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,563
during the time Mr. Reagan acted,
or one didn't act at all.

478
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,858
Mr. Vidal sends all of his books
to Hollywood,

479
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,609
many of which are rejected,

480
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,570
but some of which
are ground out into--

481
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,405
Bill, I never send any there.

482
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:45,992
But he called him a juvenile actor
which is presumably

483
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,954
to be distinguished from
an adult actor. Now my point is--

484
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,458
Buckley was
his generation's greatest debater.

485
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,294
He knew very well
how to make an argument.

486
00:29:56,462 --> 00:30:01,007
What he was even better at was
dismantling your argument.

487
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:04,385
- Now, I think this kind of--
- Now, Bill, I think...

488
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:08,681
- Bill, if I may say so--
- ...as I think ABC has the right...

489
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,767
Just as I think ABC has
the authority... I'm almost through.

490
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,769
No, you're n... In every sense.

491
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,313
Let Mr. Buckley finish his sentence.

492
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,982
Then, Mr. Vidal,
I assure you time to refute it.

493
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,279
If ABC has the authority to invite
the author of Myra Breckinridge

494
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,532
to come and to comment
on Republican politics,

495
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,577
I think that the people
of California have the right,

496
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,996
when they speak overwhelmingly,
to project somebody

497
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,833
into national politics
even if he did commit the sin

498
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:41,172
of having acted in movies that
were not written by Mr. Vidal.

499
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,758
If Buckley was the great debater
of his time,

500
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,594
Vidal was the great talker
of his time.

501
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,804
Well, as usual, Mr. Buckley...

502
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,433
with his enormous
and thrilling charm,

503
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,895
manages to get away from the issue
toward the comedy.

504
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:00,191
He's always to the right, I think,
and almost always in the wrong.

505
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,903
And you certainly must, Bill,
maintain your reputation as being

506
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,614
the Marie Antoinette
of the right wing

507
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,201
and continually imposing your own
rather bloodthirsty neuroses

508
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,037
on a political campaign.

509
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,624
He also rehearsed his ad libs.

510
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,878
All the great bon mot
that he unleashed on the air

511
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,090
he tried out first on the reporters
in the press room.

512
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:30,179
So calling Buckley the
Marie Antoinette of the right wing

513
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,765
he had done that
with a reporter beforehand.

514
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,809
This is the hobgoblinization

515
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,103
- of the Marxists.
- Gentlemen, you have about

516
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:41,065
one concluding sentence apiece.
Can you give us one?

517
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,610
Well, I think that it is
something for which

518
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,445
all of us have to be grateful,

519
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,283
that there are left in America people
who believe in the democratic process

520
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,538
sufficiently to know that
occasionally people can penetrate

521
00:31:55,706 --> 00:32:01,252
such myths as have been energetically
projected by Mr. Vidal.

522
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:06,632
Which would be not only a philosophy
in an economy of stagnation,

523
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,635
but also a spiritual world
of stagnation.

524
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,513
Thank you very much indeed,
gentlemen. While...

525
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,183
So these two guys were
circling each other early on.

526
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:20,271
Why? Partly because each one
saw in the other

527
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:25,484
a kind of exaggerated image of his
own anxious version of himself.

528
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,741
It's almost as if they were
matter and anti-matter.

529
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,410
Sort of parallel lives.

530
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,460
They spoke with
these patrician languid accents.

531
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,670
They'd both been to boarding schools.

532
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,632
Very prestigious families
and backgrounds.

533
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,966
So everyone thought.

534
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:54,180
These were two guys who were not so
much of the Eastern establishment,

535
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:57,266
as conquerors
of the Eastern establishment.

536
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,603
Gore never went to college,

537
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,773
which he was very proud of actually.

538
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,733
We are savages, my family.

539
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,985
Father was from the frontier.

540
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:14,033
We didn't belong to Long Island
society, nor did we wish to.

541
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,371
This has always been
an anti-intellectual country.

542
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,917
These days, anybody who spoke
like those two men in public

543
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,086
would be seen to be heartless.

544
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,131
In fact, they're supposed to be what
American mass audience despises.

545
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,343
They're intellectual.
They sound like elites.

546
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,886
But people warmed to it.

547
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,098
Mr. Buckley, do you think miniskirts
are in good taste?

548
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,141
On you I think they are.

549
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,482
- Those legs are in good taste.
- Great legs.

550
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,776
I never would've
figured you for that kind.

551
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,072
Gore Vidal famously said,

552
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,617
sex and appearing on television."

553
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,285
- Go ahead, Gore.
- Joanne Woodward.

554
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,830
Very good.
That's one down and nine to go.

555
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,417
Hey, put on your--

556
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,546
They both instinctually knew
about the power of television

557
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,716
in a way that a lot of American
intellectuals of that era did not.

558
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,677
Why don't you just talk to me instead
of talking to the audience?

559
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,304
Well, by a curious thing,
we have not found ourselves

560
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,433
in a friendly neighborhood bar,
but both by election are sitting here

561
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,518
with an audience.
So therefore it would be

562
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,229
dishonest of us to pretend otherwise.

563
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,483
Mr. Buckley, I've noticed that
whenever you appear on television,

564
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,026
you're always seated.

565
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,612
Does this mean
you can't think on your feet?

566
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,743
It's very... very hard to stand up

567
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,246
carrying the...
the weight of what I know.

568
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:50,463
They were both very much aware that
TV is the present and the future.

569
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,007
And you have to be on it
and you have to use it well.

570
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,104
In a way, I think
the brilliant thing about Gore Vidal

571
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,649
is he had opinions and he was willing
to air them and very, very bravely.

572
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,152
I mean, this was the person that
wrote The City and the Pillar,

573
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,279
published in 1948.

574
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,741
It was the first novel
that dealt very openly...

575
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:24,914
with homosexuality as being
a perfectly normal sexual activity.

576
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,417
He was willing to take these risks

577
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:33,088
that almost no one statistically
was ever willing to take.

578
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,842
He deserved so much credit for that
that he does not get.

579
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,471
You have your own narrow views
of what is correct sexual behavior.

580
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,722
I happen to disagree with it

581
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,516
and I think there are
a great many people who do.

582
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:48,187
We cannot in any way encourage young
boys into this kind of relationship.

583
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,898
You have every right to propagandize
from the pulpit,

584
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,151
and give us the same right to
propagandize with books.

585
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,529
I certainly am not gonna try
to shut down your church,

586
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,948
as appalling
as I find your argument.

587
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,492
Vidal's view is that sexual
orientation

588
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,955
amongst civilized humans
is not named, discussed, or labeled.

589
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,794
Gore Vidal would never
answer to the question:

590
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,755
Are you gay?
"Yes, I'm gay."

591
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,552
You have to understand
that Gore was obsessed

592
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,304
with shedding sexual labels.

593
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,182
It is as natural
to be homosexual

594
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,600
as it is to be heterosexual.

595
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,436
And the difference between a
homosexual and a heterosexual

596
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,355
is about the difference between
somebody who has brown eyes

597
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,190
- and somebody who has blue eyes.
- Who says so?

598
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,819
I say so. It is a completely natural
act from the beginning of time.

599
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,240
The morays of the country
are going to hell.

600
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,243
And if there was one thing
William Buckley cared more about

601
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,203
than anything,
it would have been that.

602
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,747
We go on like this,
abortion will be on demand.

603
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,418
Women will have sex with women.
The family will be over.

604
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,420
The church won't be respected.

605
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,548
People will be screwing in the
street, frightening the horses.

606
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,508
Buggery will be legal.

607
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:04,263
And if you'd said all that to Gore,
he'd have said, "Okay, bring it on."

608
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,186
In a very moving piece
called "A Blow for Peace,"

609
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,856
in that magazine I will not mention,

610
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,400
on the 29th of December, 1964--

611
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,986
We know that you'd like nothing
to sully your lips.

612
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,531
You came out...
You will eat it first.

613
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,370
You came out in favor of history
at H for such an act of greatness.

614
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,123
That is the bombing of the Chinese
nuclear capacity.

615
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,417
Mr. Vidal, I have no doubt
that there are...

616
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,128
there is somebody in
Haight-Ashbury or Greenwich Village

617
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:40,132
who considers that your caricature
is fetching. I don't.

618
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,802
I was invited here and
am prepared to try to talk about

619
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,846
- the Republican Convention.
- Yes.

620
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,140
But I maintain that
it's very difficult to do so

621
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:52,061
when you have somebody like this
who speaks in such verse

622
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,563
and he likes to be naughty.

623
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,607
Which has proved to be
a professionally

624
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,567
highly merchandisable vice.

625
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,946
Not unlike your so public vices
and wickedness.

626
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,576
We have to keep in mind
the left-wing was never hesitant

627
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,037
about smearing anybody
from the right-wing.

628
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,916
That was a battle
Bill had to fight all the time.

629
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,086
The disease of the right
is greed, bigotry,

630
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,755
insensitivity and general stupidity.

631
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,091
On a radio interview,
you said that you thought

632
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,594
"the Jews tend to construct ongoing
political myth centered around

633
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,389
the Hitlerian experience,
which more or less suggests

634
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,474
that Hitler was the embodiment
of the ultra-right."

635
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,311
True. Most Jews suggest Hitler was
the embodiment of the ultra-right.

636
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,480
He certainly wasn't the embodiment
of the ultra-left.

637
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,275
And do you care to read the context,
or shall I cram it down your throat?

638
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,485
No, no, no.

639
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,445
If you are a right-winger,

640
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,240
you don't want to have
anything to do with

641
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:50,077
the Gnostic heresies
of Nazism and Fascism.

642
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,665
And that was a label that the
left-wing kept trying to pin

643
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,291
on the right-wing.

644
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,796
Which is the cherry bomb
that is waiting to go off.

645
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,298
And eventually does.

646
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,886
Good evening from Miami Beach.

647
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,724
Again we bring you in 90 minutes
all that's worth seeing and knowing

648
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,269
as the convention's moment of truth
comes near.

649
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,901
- Can you hear me?
- Yes!

650
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,279
I said "rich America!"

651
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,365
Quiet!

652
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,579
Never has obedience to law

653
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,915
been so disdained.

654
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,335
In 1968, you see the beginning

655
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,921
of a Republican kind of rhetoric

656
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,967
in which strategies of dividing
the country racially

657
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:51,555
are disguised with language
along the lines of law and order.

658
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,308
Let's make America first again,

659
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,810
in respect for order
and justice under law.

660
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,729
Now, isn't that what you want?!

661
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,898
Isn't that where
we're going to go?

662
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,777
You wanted law and order
in this town. You've got it.

663
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,029
He's bluffing, boys. Let's get him.

664
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,159
The next one gets a load of buckshot.
Any takers?

665
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,498
Must we avoid
our great cities by night,

666
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:23,253
as if they were guerilla-infested
hamlets out in Vietnam?

667
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,630
No!

668
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,548
10-27, we're setting up.

669
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,928
There was a racial
protest that turned into a riot

670
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,055
at the convention in Miami.

671
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,519
These were two visions
of America clashing.

672
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,854
Don't give me any
of that crap. Turn around.

673
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,316
Look at that man back there.
You wanna look? Look at that picture.

674
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,903
To be sure, this might have been
a trick by the lily-white climate

675
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,073
of the Republican Convention
which is in progress right now

676
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,825
just a few miles from here.

677
00:40:55,161 --> 00:41:00,791
The fault lines in our politics
were decided in the 1968 election.

678
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,962
Alliances that connect
in shifting ways.

679
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,591
Racial, religious, socio-economic.

680
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,178
What we now call "identity politics"
was being formed then.

681
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,307
And Buckley knew it, because to
some extent he'd helped create it.

682
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,939
The subject for William
Buckley and Gore Vidal tonight:

683
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,649
"Beyond the Nominations."

684
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,069
What issues can the Republicans use
effectively to win?

685
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,029
Well, I think two primarily.

686
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,866
law and order.

687
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,869
I wish there was a way of saying
"law and order"

688
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,538
that didn't make critics say,

689
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,582
"You're talking about
the racial question."

690
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,878
I would like to know how to say
"law and order" by other means,

691
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,796
but still mean law and order.

692
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,925
And one of the problems that we face,
and that Nixon's gonna face, is this.

693
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,136
What do we do about the growth

694
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:58,557
of really mutinous members
of the American community?

695
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,559
These people have got to be faced
not only politically,

696
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,060
but philosophically.

697
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,022
And this is something which,
in my judgment, Mr. Nixon

698
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:10,152
has got to elevate into the status
of the genuine national debate.

699
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,530
I think that if Richard Nixon
were elected President,

700
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,575
it would be an absolute,
no matter with what good will,

701
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,329
it would be a disaster because
the young, the black, the poor

702
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:24,082
are disaffected and I don't see him
ever drawing them to him.

703
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,086
Vidal understood what
it meant to take the positions that

704
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:32,716
William F. Buckley, Jr. took towards
civil rights during those years.

705
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,263
This was at a time when political
leaders had been able to block

706
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:41,308
civil rights legislations
with the support

707
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,977
of entities like
the National Review

708
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,855
and figures like
William F. Buckley Jr.

709
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,817
In the United States,
five percent of the population

710
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,611
have 20 percent of the income.

711
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,739
And the bottom 20 percent
have five percent of the income.

712
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,742
- I think this is irrelevant.
- I know that you revel

713
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,497
in this kind of inequality.
Your business is based upon that.

714
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,750
I believe that freedom
breeds our inequality.

715
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,377
Say that again?

716
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,004
Freedom breeds inequality.

717
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,840
- I'll say it a third time.
- No, twice was enough.

718
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,551
- I think you made your point.
- Unless you have freedom

719
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,680
to be unequal,
there is no such thing as freedom.

720
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:24,059
And with Buckley, you see
a shrill defense of what he sees

721
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:27,646
as a completely collapsing
social and cultural order.

722
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,732
- What can I say?
- Not much.

723
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,111
You've given that
ghastly position once again

724
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,698
of the well to-do
and those who inherit money

725
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,616
and believe that others
who do not...

726
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:44,663
- This is balderdash.
- ...must somehow achieve equality.

727
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,208
But, in actual fact,
you're going to have a revolution,

728
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,544
if you don't give the people
the things they want.

729
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,587
Now, I'm putting it
to your own self-interest,

730
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,589
they're going to come
and take it away from you.

731
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,719
Because Vidal is so educated,

732
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,596
and so one of his class,

733
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,224
for Buckley,
the betrayal of those values

734
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,143
seems to be almost personal.

735
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,646
Buckley, he didn't believe
in democracy.

736
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,942
He believed in rule by elites,
starting with him.

737
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,413
The conservative party
in New York state

738
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,249
had gone to Buckley and said,
"Put your money where your mouth is.

739
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,084
Run for mayor."

740
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,547
So it was Bill Buckley,
the conservative candidate,

741
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,926
and John Lindsay, the darling
of liberal Republicans,

742
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,804
whom Buckley was intent on defeating.

743
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,015
He has said
that you're out to destroy

744
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,725
everything that he stands for.

745
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,685
That is roughly correct.
I couldn't have put it better.

746
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,520
I'm out to destroy
everything that he stands for:

747
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,397
hypocrisy and ultra-leftism.

748
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:58,111
Conservatism
in America is an insurgency.

749
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,117
It's not the right
fighting the far left,

750
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:09,164
it's the right fighting people
who are not quite far enough right.

751
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:15,295
Buckley discovered a new constituency
for the Republican party.

752
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,215
It was angry white ethnics

753
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,384
in Brooklyn, in Queens,

754
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,969
in Staten Island,
in the outer boroughs.

755
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,640
The same people who voted
for Goldwater in '64

756
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:31,103
at a time of mounting
racial unrest in America.

757
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,855
The conservatives,
more than 1,200 of them,

758
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,526
paid one dollar each
to see William F. Buckley Jr.

759
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,986
There was nothing fancy
on the menu here.

760
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,822
Just hot tongue and cold shoulder

761
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,241
for everything distasteful
to the conservatives.

762
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,661
Ladies and gentlemen, the
apparent winner of this election...

763
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,206
is Mr. John Lindsay.

764
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,921
He was realistic enough in 1965

765
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,048
to realize that he could not win.

766
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,970
What has made a difference is that
thanks to your efforts,

767
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,975
we have begun to reintroduce the
two-party system to New York City.

768
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,437
What Buckley had found
all through his career,

769
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,730
he wrote about this when he was
still a fairly young man,

770
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,859
is he said,
"I lose all the big battles,

771
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,194
but I win all the small,
personal ones."

772
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,364
He said it with kind of frustration.

773
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:29,077
What he wanted to do
was to win the big war.

774
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:35,459
The next president of
the United States, Richard Nixon!

775
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,589
Bill Buckley says,

776
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,050
"This election, it'll be decided
on the issue of law and order."

777
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,095
And he was right.

778
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:54,769
What is on people's minds,
what frightens them

779
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,482
is the fear that a generation that,
by the New Deal,

780
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:03,653
was put into the middle class is now
going to lose all of those gains.

781
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:08,366
These are the debates
we're having today.

782
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,959
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

783
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,295
You'll certainly be back,
I'm delighted to know,

784
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:23,006
for the Democratic Convention,
where Mr. Buckley may attack

785
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,842
and Mr. Vidal will have to defend.

786
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,053
We'll be back after this message.

787
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,141
♪ ♪

788
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,396
ABC was very happy
with the coverage.

789
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,776
When you talk about Buckley-Vidal,
people took notice.

790
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,986
And they got noticed in the press.

791
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:49,407
That was very important in 1968
to everybody in television.

792
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:54,538
It turned out that
this was kind of a hit.

793
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,874
"About the only fun to be had
during the GOP convention,

794
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,043
from a television observer's
point of view,

795
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,128
was found
in the nightly tête-à-tête

796
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,089
between William F. Buckley
and Gore Vidal."

797
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:09,928
I'm never sure whether
politics leads what argument is,

798
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,097
or argument leads what politics is.

799
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:18,311
But together, Buckley and Vidal
are enormously successful.

800
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,238
I've always tried to keep my
political life and my literary life

801
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,614
somewhat apart.

802
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,867
But in 1959,
I decided to bring the two together

803
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,787
in a play that became a film.

804
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,458
Gore does have a sense
of a deep America and a deep history.

805
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,044
He's written The Best Man.

806
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,549
The best play ever written about
an American political convention.

807
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,969
Do you think people mistrust
intellectuals like you in politics?

808
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,763
Intellectual?
You mean I wrote a book?

809
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,558
Well, as Bertram Russell said,

810
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,269
"People in a democracy tend to think
they have less to fear

811
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,771
from a stupid man
than an intelligent one.

812
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,566
Actually, it's the other way around.
It's the stupid man--"

813
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:10,155
Vidal's interest in politics
was not only ideological.

814
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:13,783
It was a very personal
and social thing.

815
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,620
What image do you feel Senator
Campbell is projecting at the moment?

816
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,496
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about images.

817
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,291
That's a term from advertising where
you don't try to sell a product,

818
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,793
you sell the image of the product.
Sometimes, the image is a fake!

819
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,005
- After all, your own image is--
- A poor thing, but mine own.

820
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,341
Paint me as I am, wart and all.

821
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,676
Gore was born
into a political family.

822
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,387
He's the grandson of a senator,
T.P. Gore of Oklahoma.

823
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,348
His father was
in the Roosevelt administration.

824
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,185
He saw himself as the heir
to this political dynasty.

825
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,145
And he was going to be
the greatest of them all.

826
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,445
Candidate Gore Vidal.

827
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,573
Most of my plays,
most of my writing is political

828
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:56,326
or in criticism of society,
should we say.

829
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,746
Actually, for a change I'm getting
out and trying to do something.

830
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,668
When Gore ran for Congress
from upstate New York in 1960,

831
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,004
he saw it as the first stepping stone
to the Presidency.

832
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,093
He doesn't exactly
have the common touch.

833
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,846
He's not exactly someone
who's going to appeal

834
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:20,892
to the working class voters
of the United States of America.

835
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:28,525
He had a sense of himself
as being equal to and belonging

836
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,696
in the world of
the powerful and the elite.

837
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:37,033
Gore and Jackie Kennedy
were related by marriage.

838
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,995
And Jack Kennedy gave campaign
appearances for him.

839
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,123
He was on the Kennedy ticket.

840
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:48,253
He was a welcome visitor
at the White House

841
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:51,881
until there was a run-in
with Bobby Kennedy.

842
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,052
This will sound absurd
with hindsight,

843
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,014
but he probably saw Bobby Kennedy
as competition for the presidency

844
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,850
later in the 60's.

845
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,936
And that's one reason
Gore didn't like Bobby.

846
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:08,398
Bobby Kennedy is neither liberal,
nor is he much of anything

847
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,693
except a political opportunist
like most of them.

848
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,070
The whole thing has been taken over
by this camera,

849
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:19,492
by people projecting images,
a ghastly word, and it's...

850
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,078
These are the cards
with which we play.

851
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:28,001
Bobby Kennedy immediately took
a dislike to Gore Vidal.

852
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:31,463
Thought he was pompous,
thought he was arrogant.

853
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,798
What is your
current relationship

854
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,760
with Mrs. Onassis, your stepsister?

855
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,429
I haven't seen her since 1962.

856
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,723
There's no reason
for our lines to cross.

857
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,851
She was devoted to Bobby Kennedy,
and I was, as you know, plainly not.

858
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,103
And we fell out over that.

859
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,736
When Gore lost
the race for Congress,

860
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,490
that led to not only a
disillusionment with politics,

861
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,618
but a disillusionment
with the United States.

862
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,455
Naturally,
I wanted to be a politician,

863
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,415
but unfortunately
I was born a writer.

864
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:13,129
And I would not say that
I've exactly had the life I wanted.

865
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,509
Most of Vidal's work
is done at Ravello

866
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,093
from the Sorrentine coast,

867
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:22,972
amid lemon groves and vineyards,
2,000 feet above the sea.

868
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,727
His house is improbably perched
above a precipice.

869
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,648
The ideal spot, as he would say,
to observe the decline of the West.

870
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,487
Playboy After Dark,
show number 15.

871
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,905
Take one.

872
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:52,252
Mr. Vidal, will you please sign
my copy of Myra Breckinridge?

873
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,588
With great pleasure, with my
extra-special William Buckley pen.

874
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,843
I wouldn't be seen without this pen.

875
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,221
- I think this is the property--
- A gift from Bill.

876
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,266
A gift from Bill?
Bill's not as nice as he looks.

877
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,934
I know Bill personally.

878
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,937
- I know both sides of him.
- That's the best way to know him.

879
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,897
Personally.

880
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,407
In the interval
between Miami and Chicago,

881
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,534
I read Myra Breckinridge.

882
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,829
It attempts heuristic allegory,
but fails,

883
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,707
giving gratification only
to sadist homosexuals

884
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,586
and challenge only to
taxonomists of perversion.

885
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,964
I thought and thought about it.

886
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,633
There is nothing left to say
about Myra.

887
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,931
And so we met again,
in Chicago.

888
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,483
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman...

889
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:02,530
Good evening from the
International Amphitheater in Chicago.

890
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,116
There are almost as many problems
still to be solved

891
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,076
as there are flies
in this building

892
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,330
located in the heart
of Chicago's stockyards.

893
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,796
The cheery welcome sign
that is everywhere here

894
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,507
is as much a command
as an invitation.

895
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,594
Mayor Daley
has beautified everywhere.

896
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:30,141
What he cannot beautify,
he's tried to hide behind new fences.

897
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:33,686
Part of the tightest security checks
an American city

898
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,689
not under riot conditions
has ever experienced.

899
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,276
We want Eugene!
We want Eugene!

900
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:45,156
Eugene McCarthy and Hubert
Humphrey arrived in Chicago today.

901
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:48,660
The Democratic party
was in terrific disarray.

902
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:53,831
Bobby Kennedy had just been killed
a couple of months earlier.

903
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,584
He was already becoming a martyr.

904
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:01,923
The fight over the Democratic
platform will move here,

905
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,841
right onto the floor
of this convention

906
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,469
demanding a repudiation
and a reversal

907
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,597
of the Johnson administration
policies on Vietnam.

908
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,811
At this moment, it is
the calm in the eye of the storm.

909
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,567
Their wounds have had time to heal
since Miami Beach.

910
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,821
They've had time to restock their
arsenal for new assaults.

911
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,907
"They," of course,
are William Buckley and Gore Vidal.

912
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:32,036
Mr. Vidal, do you feel more
comfortable, philosophically, here

913
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,705
than you did in Miami?

914
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,875
Philosophically. I wonder if that
word will ever be used again

915
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,460
while we're here in Chicago.

916
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,381
This place is a shambles.
It's a police state.

917
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,592
One's aware of the horrors
of the world here:

918
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,177
the smell of old blood,

919
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,264
the shrieking of the pigs as
they're slaughtered in the morning,

920
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,767
all this reminds one of...
of life and death.

921
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,729
So, in a sense,
I do feel at home in a way,

922
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,647
but not happy.

923
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:04,193
Buckley realized
he had his intellectual equal

924
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,862
sitting right next to him.

925
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,781
Vidal had done
the homework in Miami.

926
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,075
By the time we got to Chicago,

927
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,162
Buckley had caught up
and done some homework as well.

928
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,165
William Buckley,
while on the defensive in Miami,

929
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,708
may now take the offensive.

930
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,419
He was also
an extremely aggressive debater.

931
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:26,257
And so he thought that justified
every technique he could use to win.

932
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:31,012
As a matter of
testamentary integrity,

933
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,766
I reveal a concrete proposal
contained in a letter

934
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:38,644
sent to me by Senator Kennedy
about six months ago.

935
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,355
The P.S. of which was:

936
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,443
"I have changed
my platform from 1968

937
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,695
from 'let's give blood
to the Viet Kong'

938
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,573
to 'let's give Gore Vidal
to the Viet Kong."'

939
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,366
May I see that? Really?

940
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,078
I think, however,
that would be immoderate.

941
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,915
In any case,
I do share Mr. Kennedy--

942
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:03,294
- I must say.
- Mr. Kennedy's notion that Mr. Vidal

943
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,380
is marred by his sort of
strange fantasies

944
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,133
concerning the realisms of politics.

945
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,763
We all recognize that moment
when we reach for a weapon

946
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,599
that we know is sort of off-bounds.

947
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,185
- This is Senator Bobby Kennedy.
- Yes, I realized.

948
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,313
What a very curious handwriting.
It also slants up.

949
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,023
Sign of a manic depressive.

950
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,109
You still mad about Senator Kennedy?

951
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,736
I did say that.
Whether you forged it or not,

952
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,489
I don't know and I will have to have
my handwriting experts,

953
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:34,492
the graphologists will have to look
at it. I put nothing beyond you.

954
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,121
But to get back to the plank
while we...

It's been fun inspecting your
correspondence, but...

956
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,627
Vidal is relatively unfazed.

957
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,963
He had almost a Zen technique.

958
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,424
You let the guy lean forward
so that he falls over.

How do we get out?
Have we really been beaten?

What matters here is that we have,
in a word, lost the war.

Something like 90 percent of
the casualties are civilians.

So when they accuse us of genocide,

I don't expatriate myself.
I have an apartment in Rome.

And I think, to be perfectly bleak,
and to be perfectly blunt,

What Vidal saw
was that the American empire

1007
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,982
was completely overextended.

1008
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,530
These empires are
very dangerous things to possess,

1009
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,532
as Pericles once pointed out.

1010
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,785
And once you get one,
it's very difficult to let it go.

1011
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,580
But if we don't let it go,
it's going to wreck us economically.

1012
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:08,372
We're already in trouble.

We're already in trouble.

1014
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,500
And it has certainly divided
the country at a time

1015
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,795
when resources should go
to the slums and to the poor

1016
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,507
and to trying to revise
an extremely shabby country.

I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom

1018
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,680
such as the world
has never heard before!

1019
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,558
Gore Vidal disliked
the United States of America.

1020
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:32,146
He always talked about the empire
in which he is now right.

1021
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,398
Gore Vidal was correct
in prophesizing

1022
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,025
that we would become an empire.

1023
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,986
That is our present dilemma.

The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

This is the year
of "the whole world is watching."

1026
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,676
This is the year where all politics
is suddenly televisual.

1027
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,555
This is the year where the phrase
"living room war" comes.

Gore asked me to drive him

you've seen the roughing up.

1043
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,419
There's very little that we can say
after those pictures...

1044
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,130
that would be in any way adequate.

1045
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:04,965
Let Mr. Buckley comment now.

1046
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:08,344
The effort here,
not only on your program tonight,

1047
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,388
but during the past two
or three days in Chicago

1048
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,808
has been to institutionalize
this complaint.

1049
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:19,855
So as to march forward and say we've
got sort of a Fascist situation,

1050
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,985
but don't infer from individual
and despicable acts of violence

1051
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:29,490
of Chicago policemen,
a case for implicit totalitarianism

1052
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:31,116
in the American system.

1053
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,410
If we can all work up an equal sweat,

1054
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,705
and if you all would be obliging
enough to have your cameras handy,

1055
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,333
every time a politician
commits demagogy,

1056
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:44,046
or every time a labor union beats up
people who refuse to join his union,

1057
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:47,550
then maybe we can work up some kind
of impartiality and resentment.

1058
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:50,094
These people came here
with no desire other

1059
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:51,595
than anybody's been able to prove,

1060
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,056
- than hold peaceful demonstration.
- I can prove it.

1061
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,685
I was 14 windows
above that gang last night.

1062
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,605
And the chant between 11:00
and 5:00 this morning

1063
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,482
from four or 5,000 voices

1064
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,068
was sheer utter obscenities

1065
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,445
directed to the president
of the United States.

1066
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:12,866
I think it is remarkable that there
was as much restraint shown

1067
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,537
as was shown, for instance, last
night by cops who were out there

1068
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:21,792
for 17 hours without inflicting a
single wound on a single person,

1069
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,920
even though that kind of disgusting
stuff is being thrown at them

1070
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,880
and at all of American society.

1071
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,426
Mr. Vidal, wasn't it a provocative
act to try to raise

1072
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:34,597
the Viet Kong flag in the park
in the film we just saw?

1073
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,933
Wouldn't that invite...
Raising a Nazi flag in WWII

1074
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,685
would've had similar consequences.

1075
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,854
- Yes, and--
- People in the United States

1076
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:46,066
happen to believe that the United
States' policy is wrong in Vietnam

1077
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,320
and that Viet Kong are correct in
wanting to organize their country

1078
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,155
in their own way politically.

1079
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:54,074
If it is a novelty in Chicago
that is too bad,

1080
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,368
but I assume that the point
of the American democracy

1081
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,996
is you can express
any point of view that you want.

1082
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,956
- Shut up a minute.
- No, I won't.

1083
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:04,501
Some people were pro-Nazi and the
answer is that they were well treated

1084
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:08,088
by people who ostracized them.
And I'm for ostracizing people

1085
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:11,050
who egg on other people to shoot
American Marines

1086
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,218
and American soldiers.
I know you don't care--

1087
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,596
As far as I'm concerned,
the only sort of pro

1088
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,098
or crypto-Nazi I can think of
is yourself.

1089
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,268
- Failing that, I will only say--
- Let's not call names.

1090
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:24,104
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi

1091
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:28,192
or I'll sock you in the goddamn
face and you'll stay plastered.

1092
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,777
- Gentlemen, let's--
- Bill.

1093
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,988
Tell the author of Myra Breckinridge
to go back to his pornography

1094
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,907
and stop making
any allusions of Nazism.

1095
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,117
I was in the Infantry
in the last war.

1096
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:40,371
You were not in the Infantry.
As a matter of fact, you were not.

1097
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,706
You're distorting
your own military record.

1098
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,133
The network nearly shat.

1099
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,595
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi.

1100
01:06:56,763 --> 01:07:00,724
Or I'll sock you in the goddamn face
and you'll stay plastered.

1101
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,476
- Gentlemen--
- I was watching it

1102
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,771
with a number of the news executives
in the control room.

1103
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,357
Someone said,
"Can they say that?!"

1104
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,151
Well, you know, it's live.
They had.

1105
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,655
I think Gore Vidal was fortunate

1106
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:17,074
that Bill didn't
punch him in the nose.

1107
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:20,160
Bill could've broken Gore Vidal
over the back of his knee.

1108
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,372
When Gore Vidal called him
a crypto-Nazi,

1109
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,416
Bill let him have it.

1110
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,376
It is a slur.

1111
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:31,088
And the rictus of loathing
on Mr. Buckley's face

1112
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,631
is quite understated.

1113
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,051
Buckley called Vidal
"queer" on television.

1114
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,763
It's a slur. It would be
considered a hate slur today.

1115
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:49,148
Profanity today is "nigger,"
"faggot" and "cunt."

1116
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:52,693
Those are our only three
truly profane words.

1117
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,531
In 1968, you could
call somebody a crypto-Nazi

1118
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:01,118
or a queer,
and that was fighting words.

1119
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,330
You have every right in this country
to take any position you want to take

1120
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,374
because we are guaranteed
freedom of speech.

1121
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,419
We just listened to a rather
grotesque example of it.

1122
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,713
I think we've run out of time

1123
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:16,675
and I thank you very much
for the discussion.

1124
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,720
It was a little more heat
and a little less light than usual,

1125
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:21,889
but it was still very worth hearing.

1126
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,058
Tomorrow night, you'll have
a chance to...

1127
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,770
My pulse was racing
and my fingers trembled

1128
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,981
as wave after wave
of indignation swept over me.

1129
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,525
And then, suddenly,

1130
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,819
about to deposit the earphones
on the table stand,

1131
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,280
I stopped, frozen.

1132
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:42,034
Vidal, arranging his own set
was whispering to me.

1133
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,953
"Well," he said, smiling,

1134
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,123
"I guess we gave them
their money's worth tonight."

1135
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:54,171
It was a splendid moment.
Eyes rolling, mouth twitching,

1136
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,507
long, weak arms waving.

1137
01:08:57,217 --> 01:09:00,844
Buckley skittered from slander
to glorious absurdity.

1138
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,850
I reached my trailer
after taking great strides

1139
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,645
through the maze of technicians,
operators, executives,

1140
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,605
reporters, guests.

1141
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:16,276
All of whom looked at me as I stomped
by, and then quickly looked away.

1142
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:21,406
Afraid, perhaps, that I would greet
anyone guilty of a lingering glance

1143
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,534
with a sock on his goddamn face.

1144
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,913
The door slammed
and I heard shouting.

1145
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:31,458
Paul Newman had been
in Vidal's trailer,

1146
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,169
and had been watching it on
television, ran down the stairs,

1147
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:38,423
ran into Buckley's trailer and
Buckley came in at the same time.

1148
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:43,470
And Buckley, according to Newman,
responded that it was a disaster.

1149
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:53,355
These ad hominem attacks
were not characteristic of Bill.

1150
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:58,569
This was a totally unprecedented
thing for him to do on television.

1151
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,739
Vidal was a smart enough
tactician to know

1152
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,701
that he had won the debate
in that moment.

1153
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:16,295
And that brings up the one final
question now the election is over.

1154
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:20,924
Will Bill Buckley and Gore Vidal
kiss and make up?

1155
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,471
I think Vidal would love that.

1156
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,207
After we did it, no network
ever again did wall-to-wall,

1157
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,751
gavel-to-gavel coverage.

1158
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,504
It could be that some
executive said, "Hey,

1159
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:03,550
whatever you may think of it, that
Vidal Buckley thing had a big impact.

1160
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:07,054
Get Mr. Pro and Mr. Con,

1161
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,265
Ms. For Abortion
and Ms. Against Abortion...

1162
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:13,977
Jack, I spent the holidays flying
back and forth across this country

1163
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,312
and I'm worried.

1164
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,857
The place seems all out of focus,
sea to shining sea.

1165
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,235
We've both flown many times, Shana,
coast to coast.

1166
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,737
But we see a different land below.

1167
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,615
And you have them argue
and that's punditry.

1168
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,408
That's enlightenment.

1169
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,203
Dan, there's an old saying:
"Behind every successful man

1170
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,206
there's a woman,
a loving, giving, caring woman."

1171
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,918
Jane, you ignorant slut.

1172
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,841
Argument is sugar
and the rest of us are flies.

1173
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,429
Welcome to Radio 81.

1174
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,848
I think this is Ron
and Gore Vidal is also here.

1175
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,559
I invariably agree
with your social views,

1176
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,436
the content of your ideas.

1177
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,231
And I contest with Buckley's views.

1178
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:03,068
But I hear you talk,
and William Buckley talk,

1179
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,488
I feel that Buckley
is the more honest man.

1180
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,533
In what way do you find him
more honest than I?

1181
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,911
I think it goes way back
to the debates

1182
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,038
you had with him on television.

1183
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,958
And you literally blew his mind.

1184
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,168
I've never seen Buckley
lose it like that.

1185
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,337
He swore at you
and stood up and said,

1186
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,381
"How dare you call me a neo-Nazi!"

1187
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,967
I thought him the scum of the world,
you see.

1188
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,760
- I know, he was over-excited, yeah?
- Yes.

1189
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,721
- But I think--
- What did you find dishonest

1190
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,472
about my performance?

1191
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:35,517
It had to do with
the glee in your face,

1192
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,477
in your eyes,
that you could not hide.

1193
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:40,188
Well, that isn't...
I wasn't being dishonest.

1194
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,607
I am a happy warrior.

1195
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,443
I'm in battle, I'm enjoying it.

1196
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,653
This is what these things are about.

1197
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:49,031
If somebody that I regard
is a very bad person...

1198
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:53,785
politically, then to expose him
on television for what he is

1199
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,537
is my job.

1200
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,540
And I think I accomplished it
very nicely, so did he.

1201
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,959
He brought suit against me
as a result of it.

1202
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,256
A year after these debates,
in August of 1969,

1203
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,801
Esquire published a long essay
that Bill had written,

1204
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,429
something like 12,000 words

1205
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:17,059
trying to explore why he had
reacted the way he did.

1206
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,896
Buckley couldn't let it go.

1207
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,981
He couldn't let this thing go.

1208
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,111
He thought he would avenge himself
or explain himself

1209
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:32,240
by writing in a sophisticated way
about Vidal in Esquire.

1210
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,996
For days and weeks,
indeed for months,

1211
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,874
I tormented myself
with the question...

1212
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,835
"What should I have said?"

1213
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,671
Was my mistake that of
going on TV at all,

1214
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,882
in light of the abundant warnings,
with Vidal?

1215
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,220
Could it be that my emotional
reaction was defensible

1216
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,888
and even healthy,

1217
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,808
but that my words were ill-chosen?

1218
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:01,561
The problem was, instead of
putting a cap on the debate,

1219
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,439
he's perpetuating it
on another platform,

1220
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,982
which really made it worse.

1221
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,364
Vidal then replied

1222
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:18,078
in print to this barn burner piece
to take the stage back.

1223
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,501
On Wednesday,
August 28, at 9:30,

1224
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,504
in full view of ten million people,

1225
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:31,633
the little door in William F. Buckley
Jr.'s forehead suddenly opened

1226
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,971
and out sprang that wild cuckoo
which I had always known was there,

1227
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:39,808
but had wanted so much for others,
preferably millions of others,

1228
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,643
to get a good look at.

1229
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:46,398
Vidal is always suspicious
of Buckley's sexuality.

1230
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:51,153
And makes references
that suggest that

1231
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,698
Buckley has an attraction
to the homoerotic.

1232
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,451
There was always a question of...

1233
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,120
Um...

1234
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,082
I don't know how to put it.

1235
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:09,045
That there was a kind of
sexual ambiguity about Bill.

1236
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,340
There were rumors,
none of them substantiated.

1237
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,801
It was more a manner of affect,
really.

1238
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,138
Buckley was kind of an effete guy.

1239
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:22,267
If you read the piece,
you are led to believe

1240
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:27,564
that among other things, William F.
Buckley, Jr. was homosexual.

1241
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,405
Buckley instituted a suit
against Esquire magazine

1242
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,157
and against Vidal.

1243
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,703
Vidal instituted a countersuit
against Buckley.

1244
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:46,625
The litigation
went on for three years.

1245
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,877
Is that still going back
and forth in the courts?

1246
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:51,546
It's going more back than forth.

1247
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,549
Just... it keeps on ticking away
like a bomb.

1248
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:57,719
At the time, it was
one of the longest lawsuits

1249
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:00,889
between two American public
intellectuals there'd ever been.

1250
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,265
Neither of them ever tired of it.

1251
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:05,810
It gave them enormous opportunity
for the practice of malice.

1252
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,605
It's still litigious, is it?

1253
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,148
Very litigious.

1254
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:16,404
By the third year, Esquire
said, "We've had enough."

1255
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,033
Esquire ended up settling.

1256
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:23,036
And then Buckley,
in a stroke of brilliance,

1257
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,622
gives a press conference
and declares victory.

1258
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,376
In the public imagination,
people thought that he had won

1259
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,420
this lawsuit they didn't
understand in the first place.

1260
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,381
I know that Gore hated that.

1261
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,676
Was it ever resolved, who came out
ahead on that whole thing?

1262
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,679
Well, it sort of went on
for several years.

1263
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,681
And then about a week
before we'd go into court,

1264
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,349
he called off the suit.

1265
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,768
- Pulled the suit out from under you?
- Exactly.

1266
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,980
Exactly.
I was looking forward to that.

1267
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:03,660
Why do you work so hard?
Why do you work so darn hard?

1268
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,704
There's a lot to do.

1269
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,291
Bill Buckley,
the popularizer, laid the foundation

1270
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,543
for the conservative movement.

1271
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:13,920
Which enabled Ronald Reagan
to come along

1272
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:17,549
and to win that presidency
by the margin that he did.

1273
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:22,178
I can't tell you exactly when
I discovered National Review.

1274
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,056
It had a profound impact on me.

1275
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:31,438
Well, my relationship
to Ronald Reagan was pretty close.

1276
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,483
There was an affinity of ideas.

1277
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:40,155
I visited him and he visited me.

1278
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,824
We took a liking to each other.

1279
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,409
Certainly I to him.

1280
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,621
When Ronald Reagan
saluted William Buckley

1281
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,874
and the National Review
as president,

1282
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,542
Buckley became a king maker.

1283
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,252
And he was seen to be a king maker.

1284
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,590
And appearance is at least as
important as reality in this world.

1285
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:02,052
When Buckley
and Reagan were ascended,

1286
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:06,848
and Vidal's political ideology
was taking a backseat,

1287
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,267
I think this was actually
a great period for him.

1288
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,062
Some of his greatest writing
occurred in the '80s,

1289
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,147
both in essays and in literature.

1290
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,858
When another right-wing critic

1291
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,569
attacked Gore Vidal
as being anti-American,

1292
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,781
Gore's reply was,
"How can you call me anti-American?

1293
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,741
I'm the country's official
biographer."

1294
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,793
In Burr,
Vidal got off one of his great lines.

1295
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:39,631
It was the beginning of Vidal's
attempt at revenge on Buckley.

1296
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:44,386
I believe his name was
"William de la Touche Clancey".

1297
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,805
And I think Vidal said somewhere

1298
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,682
that it could not possibly
be based on anyone,

1299
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:53,103
meaning that of course
it's based on Bill.

1300
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,481
William de la Touche
Clancey's voice

1301
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,983
is like that of a furious goose,

1302
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,819
all honks and hisses.

1303
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,822
He detests our democracy.

1304
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,533
He fills the pages of his magazine,
America,

1305
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,619
with libelous comments
on all things American.

1306
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,622
Despite a rich wife
and five children,

1307
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,791
he is a compulsive sodomite,

1308
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:17,961
forever preying on country boys
new to the city.

1309
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,047
It is extreme and...

1310
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,759
He was a good hater, Vidal.

1311
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:31,224
God knows what is at the very bottom
of that animosity.

1312
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,186
He talked about it every day.

1313
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:39,482
You don't talk about something
every day that didn't cut you.

1314
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,193
And I don't think
that ever really healed.

1315
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:48,658
We were in Ravello,
not much to do after dinner.

1316
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:53,663
He had acquired a VHS copy
of the Vidal/Buckley debates.

1317
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,708
I naively said,
"Do you think we could watch them?"

1318
01:19:56,876 --> 01:20:00,420
Little did I realize this was
the main event for the night.

1319
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,841
We then watched them, I think,
again a couple nights later.

1320
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:09,220
And on subsequent trips we watched
them two or three times.

1321
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:12,015
And the thrill
of the first viewing was gone.

1322
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:13,975
And you began to have the sensation

1323
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,227
that you were edging
into Sunset Boulevard,

1324
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,354
Norma Desmond territory.

1325
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,108
It was Buckley
who was distressed by it.

1326
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:28,781
Buckley let it become personal
in a way that he had been a maestro

1327
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,200
of being able to avoid.

1328
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,952
And that haunted him
for a very long time.

1329
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,791
After 33 years on PBS,

1330
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:43,254
William F. Buckley, Jr. taped his
last program before an audience

1331
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,631
of invited guests.

1332
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,675
The last show was succeeded

1333
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,969
by an interview with Ted Koppel.

1334
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,764
And at one point,
he showed

1335
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:56,351
the now already infamous clip.

1336
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:59,562
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi,

1337
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,900
or I'll sock you in the goddamn face
and you'll stay plastered.

1338
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:08,863
Buckley, uncharacteristically,
said nothing

1339
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,282
and then they went
to the commercial break.

1340
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:13,660
I was in the audience that day.

1341
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:19,624
And he made a beeline up the aisle
to where I was sitting and said,

1342
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,086
"I thought that tape
had been destroyed."

1343
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,258
More than 30 years
after the original debates,

1344
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,469
he was still furious with Vidal,

1345
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,389
and still shaken
that he had reacted that way.

1346
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,892
- Do you wish you were 20?
- No!

1347
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,186
Absolutely not.

1348
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,897
No, I would...

1349
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,109
If I had a pill which would
reduce my age by 25 years,

1350
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,027
- I wouldn't take it.
- Why not?

1351
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:50,780
Because I'm tired of life.

1352
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:52,699
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

1353
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:54,993
I really am.

1354
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,788
I'm utterly prepared to stop...

1355
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:00,748
living on.

1356
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:05,837
Any regrets about this life
that you have lived?

1357
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,465
- Yeah...
- Like what?

1358
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,551
Well, I'm not sure I'd tell you.

1359
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:17,181
Someone asked when
Bill Buckley died what Gore thought.

1360
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:23,146
He said, "I thought that hell
will be a livelier place,

1361
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:28,943
that he will be permanently
among those he served in life,

1362
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:33,990
applauding their prejudices
and fanning their hatreds."

1363
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,702
The last line of that piece was:

1364
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:41,080
"WFB, rest in hell."

1365
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,292
It seems a little farfetched to say

1366
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,378
that Gore Vidal was waiting around
for Buckley to die

1367
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,880
so he could have the last word.

1368
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:52,717
But I promise you
that he took great pleasure in that.

1369
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,846
He was not satisfied if he didn't
have something to fight against.

1370
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,723
And at the end of his life,
I think he was fighting

1371
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,643
against the ghosts
of all these enemies.

1372
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,812
Truman Capote once famously said,

1373
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,900
that it wasn't a matter of when
Gore Vidal would be forgotten,

1374
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:11,861
it was more or less
when did he start to be forgotten?

1375
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,657
Gore was convinced this had
happened already.

1376
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:20,244
The young had forgotten him.
His books weren't being read anymore.

1377
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,794
These figures
become most interesting

1378
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,380
when they're not listened to
so much.

1379
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,925
Because then there's a kind of
big silence inside themselves.

1380
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,849
I compared it in an essay I wrote
to Wallace Stevens' great poem,

1381
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:45,603
The Snowman, where he says,

1382
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,647
"You have to have
a mind of winter

1383
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:50,900
to see nothing that is not there

1384
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,027
and the nothing that is."

1385
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:08,042
I think these great debates
are absolutely nonsense.

1386
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:12,046
The way they're set up, there's
almost no interchange of ideas,

1387
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,048
very little even of personality.

1388
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,926
There's also a terrible thing
about this medium

1389
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,720
that hardly anyone listens.

1390
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,389
They sort of get an impression
of somebody

1391
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,599
and they think they've figured out
just what he's like

1392
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,476
by seeing him on television.

1393
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:30,565
The Buckley-Vidal debate
was a harbinger

1394
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,150
of an unhappy future.

1395
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:37,363
Does television run America?

1396
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:41,909
There is an implicit
conflict of interest

1397
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,662
between that which is
highly viewable

1398
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,915
and that which is
highly illuminating.

1399
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:58,551
That was a time when
television was still a public square.

1400
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,222
Where Americans gathered and saw
pretty much the same thing.

1401
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:05,308
There's nothing like that now.

1402
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:20,281
That's terrifying!

1403
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,743
Well, it's because, see,
we're a debate show.

1404
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,369
- It's like saying--
- No, that'd be great,

1405
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,914
I would love to see a debate show.

1406
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,208
...a 24-hour day where we have
each side on as best we can--

1407
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:33,127
No. That would be great.
You're doing theater

1408
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,296
when you should be doing debate.

1409
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:43,346
The ability to talk
the same language is gone.

1410
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:48,976
More and more, we're divided
into communities of concern.

1411
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:53,272
Each side can ignore the other side
and live in its own world.

1412
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,024
It makes us less of a nation.

1413
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:59,487
Because, what binds us together
is the pictures in our heads.

1414
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,866
But if those people
are not sharing those ideas...

1415
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,536
they're not living
in the same place.

1416
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,013
You've got a few more seconds.
Are you capable

1417
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,515
- of summing up in ten seconds?
- No.

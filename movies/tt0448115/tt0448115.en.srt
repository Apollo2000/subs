2
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,065
Thad...

3
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,983
I said no toys at Grandfather's.

4
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,194
But it's Christmas.

5
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,197
- Stop it!
- Hey.

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,281
Hey, Dad!

7
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,242
Hey! Thad,

8
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,078
you can't go crying to other people
all the time.

9
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:20,790
A man needs to know
when to stand up for himself.

10
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,918
Dear Magic-Isn't-Real Ball,

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,753
will Thad ever be a man?

12
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:31,300
Ouch.

13
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,219
"Outlook not so good."

14
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,607
You broke it.

15
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,569
Dad? Sid?

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,326
Someone help me!

17
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,080
Help!

18
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,859
Hello?

19
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,547
Thaddeus.

20
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,914
Thaddeus Sivana.

21
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,333
Who are you?

22
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,293
How do you know my name?

23
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,755
I am the last of the Council of Wizards.

24
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:38,594
Sworn to protect the realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

25
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,891
But years have passed,

26
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,435
and I grow weak.

27
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,230
That is why I seek a champion

28
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,482
to inherit my magic.

29
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,110
You want me to do magic?

30
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,070
With this,

31
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,782
all of my powers will become yours.

32
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,914
Ah. But first...

33
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,001
you must demonstrate
that you're pure of heart

34
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,129
and strong in spirit.

35
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,467
He lies.

36
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,888
Don't be his champion.

37
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,684
We can give you power.

38
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,312
Take the eye.

39
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,525
Take it.

40
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,030
Your father thinks you're weak.

41
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,117
Show him your power.

42
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,246
Take the eye.

43
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,254
No.!.

44
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,882
What?

45
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,300
What happened?

46
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:04,054
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

47
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,973
But you,

48
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,725
you will never be worthy.

49
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,108
Wait.

50
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,235
I'm good enough, I swear!
- What?

51
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,570
Let me back in!

52
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,238
Calm down, Thad!

53
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,406
- Don't open the door!
- Stop it!

54
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,699
- Calm down.
- Stop!

55
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,159
Hey, I'm gonna kill you,
you little freak!

56
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,747
Stop... Oh!

57
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,930
I was just there.

58
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,183
This man, this wizard,
he took me to a castle and...

59
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,643
Stop. Stop!

60
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,061
Stop it!

61
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,023
You miserable, whiny, little shit!

62
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,942
You could have killed us!

63
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,652
Do you understand that?

64
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,241
Dad?

65
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,325
Dad!

66
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,131
Dad?

67
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,342
You're okay.

68
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,136
You're gonna be okay.

69
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,145
You did this.

70
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,688
You did this!

71
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,190
No.

72
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,191
Dad.

73
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,551
Your magic grows weak.

74
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:52,014
Soon, you won't be able to contain us.

75
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,683
Seeking Spell,

76
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,354
find me one soul who is worthy.

77
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,776
No matter how long it takes.

78
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,115
Holy moly! The boys in blue!

79
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,866
Sure glad to see you.

80
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,993
I called as soon as I saw.

81
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,246
They're in there.

82
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,414
You stay here.

83
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,294
Police!

84
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,130
I saw 'em hide back in there.

85
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,761
- Police, coming in!
- Police!

86
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,516
- There's nobody here.
- What do you mean?

87
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,518
- It's a closet.
- You really bought that, huh?

88
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,273
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Hey!

89
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,192
Stop, stop, stop!

90
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,779
Open this up right now, kid.

91
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,740
That's a federal offense, kid.
You can't do that!

92
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,700
Do not go in that car.

93
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,993
Come on, open the door. Please.

94
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,578
Please, come on.

95
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,541
Open this, right now!

96
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,544
Very good, very funny.

97
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,045
Very funny. That's great.
That's hilarious.

98
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,802
Uh, Dispatch, we need backup at
the Laurelwood shopping center, please.

99
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,182
Dispatch, cancel that request.

100
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,309
Some kid stole our walkie-talkies.

101
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,312
<i>Walkie-talkies? How old are you?</i>

102
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,778
No, no, no.

103
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,820
That's my lunch, kid!

104
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,618
Miss Batson...

105
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,287
I've been looking for you.

106
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,664
No. Gosh.

107
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,543
It's me. It's Billy.

108
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,637
Okay.

109
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,559
I want the tiger.

110
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,438
I know, honey, I know.
But Mom's not exactly going pro here.

111
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,068
We got one!

112
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,405
But I wanted a tiger.

113
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,117
Oh, but this is
the real prize, baby. See?

114
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,119
You can use that your whole life.

115
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,330
You'll always find your way.

116
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,602
I can't let the ball get away.

117
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,821
Mom?

118
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:42,995
Mom!

119
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,169
Mom!

120
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,381
Hey.

121
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,674
Who are you with, bud?

122
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,678
Yeah, he says it's Billy Batson.

123
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,681
Hey, don't worry, kid.

124
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,183
I'm sure she'll come looking
before too long, okay?

125
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,060
They always do.

126
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,905
Mom, I'm home.

127
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,397
Yes?

128
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,277
Yeah, uh, is this Rachel Batson?

129
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,695
Who's asking?

130
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,072
Um...

131
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,657
Yeah, see, the thing is...

132
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,826
I think you're my mom.

133
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,706
You sure about that?

134
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,336
Sorry to bother you.

135
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,511
Just had to take my lunch, huh?

136
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,179
You save me any fries?

137
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:29,434
Foster home in Pittsburgh
reported you missing two weeks ago.

138
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,519
You're sending me back?

139
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,062
No.

140
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,897
They don't want you.

141
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,650
- Harsh.
- You laugh,

142
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,028
but you've run from foster homes
in six counties, Mr. Batson.

143
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,115
From good people

144
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,243
who want you, all in pursuit of someone

145
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,036
who arguably does not.

146
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,083
It's time someone looked you in the eye
and told it to you straight.

147
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,503
I don't need parents
to play make-believe with.

148
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,588
- I got a mom.
- Yes.

149
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,008
You're some detective.

150
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,260
Seventy-three Batsons

151
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,555
between the ages of 28 to 40,
and you've crossed out every one.

152
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,891
She's still out there. I know it.

153
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,278
There's a couple outside, Mr. Batson.

154
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,946
They run a group home.

155
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,074
I can take care of myself.

156
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,367
When you're 18.

157
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,662
Until then,
I won't have you living on the streets,

158
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,748
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

159
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,333
Give these people a chance.

160
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,336
'Cause that's what they're giving you.

161
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,547
You're out of options.

162
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,726
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

163
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,603
Just know that me and Rosa, we get it.

164
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,188
We were foster kids back in the day.

165
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,773
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

166
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,358
Girl, I'm young at heart.

167
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,902
I got my finger on the pulse.

168
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,986
Yeah, that's a reference

169
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,780
to his blood pressure because he's old.

170
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,406
Billy, do you have any food allergies?

171
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,241
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cooking.

172
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,910
What?

173
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,081
We know
how overwhelming it can all be.

174
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,916
New house, new faces.

175
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,584
All up in your face.

176
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,253
Just take it at your own speed.

177
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,306
Hello?

178
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,937
We're home.

179
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,106
That's what happens when you suck!

180
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,858
So much for the welcome party.

181
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,069
Yeah, that thing
growing out of the couch

182
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,529
would be Eugene.

183
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,947
Is that him?

184
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,907
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

185
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,200
Whoa! Slow down, slow down.

186
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,368
Welcome home!

187
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,411
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

188
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,329
Big hugger.

189
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,789
I noticed.

190
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,083
Die, die, die!

191
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,835
He doesn't mean that.
It's a game.

192
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,588
Hey.

193
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,590
No sodas after dark, remember?

194
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,843
Whoa. When did it get dark?

195
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,886
Oh, the poster.
I made you one.

196
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,223
Come look! Oh, no!

197
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,517
Sorry, Pedro must've been working out.

198
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,686
His goal is to get swole.

199
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,396
Just one hit! Just one hit!

200
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,564
Oh...

201
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:21,815
Here.

202
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,778
Yes, exactly why your math department
is so uniquely suited for me.

203
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,405
Shut up! No!

204
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,657
I can't even with Eugene right now.

205
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,368
I'm sorry. Mary, hi. College interview.

206
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,494
I'm Billy.

207
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,079
What am I most excited about?

208
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,541
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

209
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,168
What am I most excited about?

210
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,297
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

211
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,717
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

212
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,262
As a foster child, I'm a big believer
in finding family and friends

213
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,598
in the most unlikely of places.

214
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,603
I'm gonna miss that girl so much.

215
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,271
It's Caltech.
It's a very prestigious school.

216
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,440
And also all the way in California.

217
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,859
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

218
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,277
It's a tough subject for me.

219
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,570
Do you like vegan food?

220
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,864
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because, see, I love animals.

221
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,618
Oh, no! The Tofurky!

222
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,411
Oh, no, we may have to eat
a real turkey!

223
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,579
- Is that...
- It's okay.

224
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,039
Come, I'll show you your room.

225
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,876
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

226
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,545
Time to dance on your grave!

227
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,214
Watch the bum step. Pedro...

228
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,133
Say hi to Billy.

229
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,804
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

230
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,851
Freddy.

231
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,771
This is Billy Batson.

232
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,356
Make sure you make him feel at home.

233
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,565
- Okay?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,567
Maybe don't say anything too weird?

235
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,693
Oh, one weird thing is,

236
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,528
did you know that Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

237
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,324
And apparently, it works.

238
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,493
Yep. Um...

239
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,004
Oh, it's a long way down.

240
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,298
Trust me, I speak from experience.

241
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,304
Victor pushed me.

242
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,848
They seem nice, but don't buy it.

243
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,351
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

244
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,479
What?

245
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,566
Dude, I'm just messin' around.

246
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,153
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

247
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,283
Kidding, again!
You look at me, and you're like,

248
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,827
"Why so dark? You're a disabled
foster kid. You've got it all."

249
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,953
Right?

250
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,791
Oh, yeah, that's the old Batarang.

251
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,585
I mean, it's a replica,
but feel how sharp.

252
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,129
I could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

253
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,923
You more of a Supes guy?

254
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,511
Yeah, me, too.
Behold, the holy grail.

255
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,139
One nine-millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

256
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,265
It's legit.

257
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,476
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

258
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,519
What's in the bag?

259
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,271
Hey.

260
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,690
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

261
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,402
You don't gotta talk so much,
you know.

262
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,822
Anyway, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

263
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,765
Dinner!

264
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,815
All hands on deck.

265
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,779
Thank you for this family.

266
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,030
Thank you for this day.

267
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:01,034
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

268
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,123
Big school.
2,000 students, you might think,

269
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,750
"Wow, so many strangers."

270
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,378
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

271
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,880
Then it's,
"Wow, so many friends."

272
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,925
The principal, her name's Shirley.
She's the best.

273
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,802
Next.

274
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,512
This is our security scanner.

275
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,972
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

276
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,516
I know what it is.

277
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,143
- Does she always do this?
- Mmm-hmm.

278
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,521
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

279
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,065
She's almost never uncomfortable.

280
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,902
Have a good first day, big brother.

281
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,154
Look, you don't have to hug me
all the time.

282
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,448
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

283
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,284
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,581
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,750
I didn't mean to make her...

286
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,548
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

287
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,302
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.</i>

288
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,888
<i>He call himself a wizard.</i>

289
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:08,309
<i>He even dressed like a wizard
from Harry Potter or some...</i>

290
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,814
<i>But you're saying
that other people have experienced this?</i>

291
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,609
In a sense, yes.
Do you remember what he said to you?

292
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,778
<i>He tested me.</i>

293
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,948
<i>There were these statues.</i>

294
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,453
<i>Their eyes, it's like they were
looking at me, making me think things.</i>

295
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,704
<i>Horrible things.</i>

296
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,373
And do these approximate what you saw?

297
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,420
<i>Yes, that's exactly how I remember it.</i>

298
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,839
<i>I don't understand.
How do you know...</i>

299
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:42,051
Recurrent imagery has proven very common
in cases of mass hysteria.

300
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,303
<i>Mass hysteria?</i>

301
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,014
I know. The term's a bit theatrical.

302
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,850
But take UFO sightings, for example.

303
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,436
Lights in the sky, flying saucers.

304
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,355
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

305
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,815
The symbols.

306
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,070
Ask her about the symbols.

307
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,993
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.
But as an example of recurrent imagery,

308
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,953
maybe you'll recall seeing

309
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,664
these symbols
before the alleged abduction.

310
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,542
<i>I don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

311
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,172
<i>I think I got it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

312
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,257
<i>I remember the numbers
on my alarm clock.</i>

313
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,592
<i>They kept shifting.</i>

314
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,676
Video?

315
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,222
Show me the video.

316
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,225
Uh, Ms. Kwan, this is Dr. Sivana.

317
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,561
Um, one moment, <i>I</i> can <i>send</i> it.

318
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:37,357
<i>Hello?</i> Oh, my <i>God!</i>

319
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,483
<i>Who's there?</i>

320
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,487
<i>Hello? What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

321
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,574
<i>I 'm going to call the police!</i>

322
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,328
<i>Then this blinding light all around me</i>

323
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,664
<i>and I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.</i>

324
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>It felt like a temple
carved inside a mountain.</i>

325
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,503
<i>He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard.</i>

326
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,713
<i>and how you were brought there
to save the world.</i>

327
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,757
<i>- Wearing</i> a <i>cape.
- And there's no ceiling.</i>

328
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,050
We ran the numbers again...

329
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,635
Dr. Sivana!

330
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:11,057
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

331
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,143
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

332
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,354
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

333
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,689
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

334
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,415
Doctor, what is all this?

335
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,418
All these years...

336
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,424
I was convinced
I had the incorrect sequence.

337
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:48,428
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

338
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,096
to open the door.

339
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,685
But on that woman's alarm clock,
the seven symbols.

340
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:02,650
The sequence
repeated itself seven times.

341
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,362
That's the difference.

342
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,489
Is this some sort of joke?

343
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,450
It may seem that way to you

344
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:14,162
because we're not
in actuality studying mass hysteria.

345
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,789
What all these people have seen,

346
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,960
every single one of them,
is absolutely real.

347
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,213
An alarm clock malfunctions

348
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,300
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

349
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,510
- Hmm.
- Come on, Dr. Sivana.

350
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,013
You can't believe any of this is real.

351
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:45,860
Why, yes.

352
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,743
Yes, I do.

353
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:36,869
I've been waiting for this moment
for so long...

354
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,872
and now here we are.

355
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,417
You don't remember me, do you?

356
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,008
I remember you.

357
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,095
You were a boy.

358
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,180
And now you dare intrude in my kingdom.

359
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,976
Do you know what it's like for a child
to be told you'll never be good enough?

360
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,145
No, you don't.

361
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:06,816
What you said to me all those years ago
made me realize who I really was.

362
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,443
And you know something?

363
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,406
I am not pure of heart.

364
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:18,536
The wizard
is too weak to stop us.

365
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,123
No!

366
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,374
No!

367
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,136
You never found your champion.

368
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,474
But we found ours.

369
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,618
You are the true champion.

370
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,442
They're using you.

371
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,195
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

372
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:44,247
Through you, they'll spread their poison
to everything they touch!

373
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,166
Make mankind turn on each other!

374
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,670
You seek a pure soul, old man,

375
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,922
but no one's worthy.

376
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,642
Flight or invisibility?

377
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,311
If you could have one superpower,

378
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,355
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

379
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,024
I mean, everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

380
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,985
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

381
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,486
No, no. 'Cause heroes fly.

382
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,280
And who doesn't want people to think
they're a hero, right?

383
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,032
But invisibility, no way.

384
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,284
That's pervy.

385
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,869
Spying around on people
who don't even know you're there.

386
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,538
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power, right?

387
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,881
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

388
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,091
They asked people the same question.
You know, what power do you want?

389
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,176
But this time, they made it
so the answers were anonymous.

390
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,430
And most people, since they knew
that it was secret, said invisibility.

391
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,764
And I think that's 'cause most people

392
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,392
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

393
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,518
You're gonna run away.

394
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,396
I mean, you stole my Superman bullet.

395
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,024
Dude, I get it. I get it.

396
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,609
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

397
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:55,860
You don't trust anyone.

398
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:00,156
That's the thing about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

399
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,910
I didn't steal
your dumb bullet.

400
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,250
Hey. How was it today?

401
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,753
<i>That good, huh'?</i>

402
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,883
Whoa!

403
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,927
Oh, my God! Freddy.

404
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,928
Are you okay?

405
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,429
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

406
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,307
What the hell?

407
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,433
- What is wrong with you two?
- Oh, ho!

408
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,019
No way that's gonna buff out.

409
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,437
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

410
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,022
For the dent you made almost hitting me?

411
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,190
Yeah, sure. Um...

412
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,232
You guys take these?

413
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,405
Brett, stop!

414
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,741
Don't touch my brother!

415
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,618
What, do you need your fake family
to stand up for you?

416
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,453
- Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
- Yeah, huh?

417
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,080
Hey, Freeman.
Freeman, here, stand up.

418
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,247
Stand up for yourself.

419
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,041
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

420
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,502
Oh, yeah.
You don't have a mommy.

421
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,505
Hey.

422
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,051
Man, sorry about that.

423
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,845
That wasn't fair, but then again
you don't fight fair, so...

424
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,478
Back off, assbags.
I know how to use these things.

425
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,152
Hey! He's getting away!
Where you going?

426
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:22,613
Freddy, are you okay?

427
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:25,658
Hey, let's go through the back.

428
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,784
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:35,960
Nowhere to run!

430
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,253
Hey!

431
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,130
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him! Move!

432
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,507
- Get out the way.
- Move, woman!

433
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:42,633
Whoa!

434
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,845
No, no, no.

435
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,388
You're dead, kid.

436
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,723
Yeah, you think you're funny.

437
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,641
We know where you go to school, buddy!

438
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,063
<i>Woman on PM Next stop,
30th Street Station.</i>

439
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,065
<i>Change for the regional rail lines.</i>

440
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,169
Uh... Hello?

441
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,838
What's going on?

442
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,145
Help!

443
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:51,911
Okay.

444
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,095
Holy moly.

445
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:26,695
Hello?

446
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,711
What the hell?

447
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,880
Who's doing this?

448
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,164
Hi. Um...

449
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,750
I was supposed to get off at 30th.

450
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,043
Billy Batson.

451
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,795
How'd you know my name?

452
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,632
I am the last of the Council of Wizards.

453
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,886
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

454
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:33,512
Oh...

455
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,055
You're...

456
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,558
that guy.

457
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,393
Hey, listen, I don't have any money.

458
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,478
Do not patronize me, boy.

459
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:47,443
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

460
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:52,656
The Rock of Eternity.
Seven thrones of seven wizards.

461
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,243
But long ago, we chose a champion

462
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,120
and we chose recklessly.

463
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:04,668
He used his power for revenge,

464
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:08,756
releasing the Seven Deadly Sins
into your world.

465
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:15,095
Millions of lives were lost.

466
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,558
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

467
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,358
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

468
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:31,654
until I find one truly good person.

469
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,698
Strong in spirit,

470
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,784
pure in heart.

471
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,454
Look, man, maybe this is magic

472
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,831
and, I don't know,

473
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,043
but the people you're looking for,
good, pure people,

474
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:47,920
I'm not one of them.

475
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,756
I don't know if anyone is, really.

476
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,343
You, Billy Batson,

477
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,720
are all I have.

478
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,014
All the world has.

479
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,352
Lay your hands on my staff.

480
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,478
Gross.

481
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:08,148
And say my name
so my powers may flow through you.

482
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:11,235
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

483
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,447
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

484
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,157
Thanks.

485
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,244
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

486
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,914
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

487
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,750
Their thrones lie empty.

488
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,045
My magic must be passed on.

489
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,798
Now, speak my name!

490
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,093
I don't know your name, sir.
We just met.

491
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,762
My name is...

492
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,098
Shazam.

493
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,393
Wait, for real?

494
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,103
"Say it!
- C)Kay!"

495
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:47,855
Jeez.

496
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,993
So just say it'? Like...

497
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,120
Shazam?

498
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,247
Yes!

499
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:08,709
Carry my name,
and with it, you carry all my powers.

500
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,587
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

501
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,965
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

502
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,677
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

503
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,106
What happened to me? Why am...

504
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,192
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

505
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,945
You have been transformed
to your full potential, Billy Batson.

506
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,825
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

507
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,787
The thrones of
our brothers and sisters await.

508
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,051
Get me outta here!

509
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,805
Dope!

510
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,393
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

511
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:10,229
Gold shoes, gold belt, white cape.

512
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,649
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

513
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,818
Ow!

514
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,076
Hey!

515
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,996
Hey, babe!

516
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,379
<i>Yes, Officer.</i>

517
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,214
I'm aware he's run away in the past.

518
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:39,800
Twenty-three times?

519
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,971
Guy's got no social media presence.
At all.

520
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,180
The guy is a ghost.

521
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,706
You know, guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

522
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,124
More than happy.

523
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,751
But no, you gotta wash the dishes.
That's what's more important.

524
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,295
"What are you gonna do,
Freddy, run after him?"

525
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,672
Very funny.

526
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,216
No, I said, don't scream.

527
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,801
- Uh... Victor? Victor!
- No, no!

528
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,261
- Victor!
- It's me. It's Billy.

529
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,429
It's Billy!

530
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,348
You asked me flight or invisibility.
I thought that was stupid,

531
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,476
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

532
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,769
Meet me back here after lights-out?

533
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,731
'Sup, bud? You all right?

534
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,067
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

535
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:43,071
I'm really sad because Billy's gone.

536
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,783
And, you know, maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

537
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,577
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

538
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,163
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

539
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,332
We'll find him, 'kay?

540
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,501
You don't snore that bad.

541
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,628
But you kinda smell.

542
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,307
Oh, thank God!

543
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,518
Hey. Stop right there.

544
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,895
How do I know you're not a supervillain
using telepathic abilities

545
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,813
to make me believe
that you're Billy? Huh?

546
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:17,856
What?

547
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,107
All I have to do
is press "dial" on this thing.

548
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,151
No! No., I have proof.
I have proof. Here.

549
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,821
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

550
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,907
- Oh, no! No., no, no.
- No!

551
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,326
Stupid adult hands.

552
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,494
But you saw it.

553
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:34,289
You saw it, right?
Look, Freddy, I swear. It's me, okay?

554
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,208
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

555
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,417
but you're the only person
that I know

556
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,253
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

557
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,171
- That's Batman.
- What?

558
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,840
Forget it.

559
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,842
Can l...

560
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,929
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

561
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,439
On... on, my God!

562
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,775
It's crazy, right?

563
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,860
What are your superpowers?

564
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,655
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even know
how to pee in this thing.

565
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,740
Okay. Can you fly?

566
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:11,910
<i>Okay!</i>

567
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,245
Let's do this.

568
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:14,746
How do we do this?

569
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,041
Just, um, like, Superman it.

570
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,171
Oh, my God.
Obviously, you have to jump.

571
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,089
Come on.

572
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,216
How is any of this obvious?

573
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,384
Okay.

574
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,804
Try, uh, to believe
that you can fly. Okay?

575
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,222
I read this deep dive

576
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,849
into peer-reviewed studies
about superpowers

577
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,852
and in six out of ten,
belief is the key.

578
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,396
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay. Okay.
I believe I can fly.

579
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,231
I believe I...

580
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,025
I believe I can fly.

581
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,276
I believe...

582
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,325
Whoa!

583
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,161
Did you believe?

584
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,998
Yeah.

585
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,042
You wanna try invisibility?

586
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,753
How do I do...

587
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,379
Forget it. You know, okay.

588
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,173
Okay, okay, okay.

589
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,261
Oh, my God! It worked!

590
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:12,846
Where'd you go?

591
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,390
I'm right here. You can't see me?

592
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:16,600
Where?

593
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,019
I'm invisible!

594
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,187
I'm right here. Over here.

595
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,650
I'm invisible! I'm invisible!

596
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,692
Hey!

597
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:27,194
Nice outfit, dipshit.

598
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,490
I might've been
testing invisibility

599
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,533
and super-intelligence at the same time.

600
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,827
Freeman, I'm gonna come over there
and beat you.

601
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,921
Oh, my God!
The lightning emblem!

602
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,382
It was staring us right in the face
the whole time.

603
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,592
Literally!

604
00:41:58,892 --> 00:41:59,851
Okay, okay.

605
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,645
Clearly, we gotta give you
a lightning-themed superhero name.

606
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:02,896
Yeah.

607
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,158
Oh, right.

608
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,118
Hey, yo! Back...

609
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,287
off.

610
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,249
Hyper-speed, check.

611
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,335
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

612
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:26,962
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

613
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,130
I doused him with pepper spray.

614
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:29,840
Smart move.

615
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:33,552
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady her purse back.

616
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,011
I'm your age.

617
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,264
And he didn't get a chance to take it
'cause I didn't let him take it.

618
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,600
Good. Yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

619
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:42,561
And that should teach you
that old ladies...

620
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:46,606
Regular-aged ladies like yourself
don't need your protecting, right?

621
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,941
So get woke, bro.

622
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,401
I'm sorry, who are you?

623
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,362
His name is Thundercrack,

624
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:56,116
hero to the people with all the
power and speed of lightning all in one.

625
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,200
Dude, that sounds like a butt thing.

626
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,704
Mister Philadelphia.

627
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,080
That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

628
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:03,540
Power Boy.
'Cause he's got all the powers.

629
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,209
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

630
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,628
Power Boy, do you know this child?

631
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,925
Like a teeny little bit.
I don't really know...

632
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,677
Yeah. He's like
a little miniature manager.

633
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,721
I'm his manager.

634
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,307
But Power Boy's not gonna work,
either, okay? So work on something else.

635
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,850
Hey, bud, what could...

636
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,983
Electricity manipulation, hyper-speed,
super-strength.

637
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,276
Dude, you're stacked!

638
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,195
You're almost as cool as Superman.
Almost.

639
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,322
I didn't see you.
I don't know what just happened here.

640
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,365
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

641
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,992
- I'm not doing it for the money.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

642
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,452
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

643
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,622
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

644
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,583
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

645
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,293
Seventy-three bucks?

646
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,961
Come on!

647
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,047
Hey, wait a minute.

648
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,132
I just got an idea.

649
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,844
I'd like to purchase
some of your finest beer, please.

650
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,533
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID even.

651
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,493
Freddy, Freddy, would you relax?

652
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,329
Look at me. lam the fake ID.

653
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,455
Everything from the register!

654
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,332
Go, go! Now!

655
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,292
Come on! We don't have any time.
Let's go. Move!

656
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,211
We want it all! Hurry.

657
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,546
This is your chance.

658
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,673
Oh! Okay.

659
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,176
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's do this!

660
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,011
That's it. That's it.

661
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,931
Gentlemen,

662
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,767
why use guns
when we can handle this like real men?

663
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,563
Billy, look out!

664
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,828
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

665
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,371
I'm bulletproof.

666
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,292
Today is December 8th,

667
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,669
and this is video proof of authenticity.

668
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,005
Shoot him again.

669
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,132
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here.
Go. Both of you!

670
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,508
Come on. Go to town.

671
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,600
Wait, wait, wait.

672
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,727
We still don't know if
the suit is bulletproof,

673
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,353
or if you are.

674
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,355
Shoot him in the face.

675
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:34,316
Shoot me in the face.
In the face?

676
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,325
It kinda tickles.

677
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,744
You're dead.

678
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,251
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night!

679
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:55,086
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

680
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:58,798
Come on! Let's get outta here.

681
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,175
Hey.

682
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,052
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

683
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,096
Bleh!

684
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:07,098
Ugh!

685
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,808
That tastes like actual vomit.

686
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,854
Hey, do you know habanero jerky,

687
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,732
if you eat enough of it,
it can burn a hole in your stomach?

688
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:16,900
Worth it.

689
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,861
Yeah. Probably not you, though.
You've probably got stomach superpowers.

690
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,363
Probably. Oh, hey.

691
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,572
What's up? I'm a superhero.

692
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:24,282
Yeah, his name is, uh,

693
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,825
Captain Sparklefingers.

694
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:28,036
No, it's not.
No, it's not! That's not my name.

695
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,497
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

696
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,165
Oh, okay. I'm out.

697
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,458
Hey, wait up!

698
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,550
I mean,
it's a pretty sick view.

699
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,720
I totally get why Rocky
was training so hard to get up here.

700
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,392
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

701
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,061
I mean, no offense,

702
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:57,732
but, like, at first you were kinda like
the opposite of how Darla is.

703
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,527
A dick?

704
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,904
Your words. Not mine.

705
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,406
But yeah.

706
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,534
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

707
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,619
is either on drugs or asleep by now.

708
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:10,996
Wanna head home?

709
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,415
Looking like this?

710
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,374
Well, yeah,

711
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,836
I mean, usually,
we'd have a lair to go back to,

712
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,295
but that's long-term.

713
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:22,507
Right now, we have a bunk bed.

714
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,180
Just scares me thinking of him out there
all alone.

715
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,182
This is what he does, Rosa.

716
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:36,938
Difference is, when they find him,
we'll be the first to take him back.

717
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,356
With open arms.

718
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:44,029
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

719
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:46,322
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

720
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,033
At least I did.

721
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,036
- Yeah.
- Even Mary did it.

722
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,412
Hmm? Twice.

723
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,332
That second time she ran off,

724
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,668
you said something to me
I'll never forget.

725
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,503
You said,

726
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,839
"It's not a home
until you call it a home.

727
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,632
It's something you choose."

728
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,305
All we can do is give him
a place full of love.

729
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,350
Whether he chooses to call it a home,
that's up to him.

730
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,812
Yeah.

731
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,774
You gonna help me with this tree?

732
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,194
This tree's so sad.

733
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,739
Hello?

734
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,365
Got lost finding the bathroom.

735
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,701
Oh, okay, Freddy, sweetie. Good night.

736
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:32,786
- Good night.
- Night.

737
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,414
Freddy, who is that?

738
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:39,417
It's Billy. He's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

739
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:40,627
What? Laryngitis!

740
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,795
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

741
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,338
He's really, really tired,
and he wants to go to beddy-bye.

742
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,715
- Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
- Just hide, hide.

743
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:47,258
Billy, you're back. Let us see you.

744
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,636
We've been so worried about you.

745
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,430
I told you this was a bad idea!

746
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,057
Freddy?

747
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,392
Freddy,
what happened to the stairs?

748
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,394
Mmm!

749
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,230
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

750
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,856
is not gonna make her less scared, okay?

751
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,903
Darla, it's me. It's Billy.
I know I don't look like me.

752
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,613
- A wizard made me look like this.
- Maybe don't start with "wizard."

753
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,031
It's just gonna make her more confused.

754
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,201
Some old guy brought me to a temple
and he made me say, "Shazam."

755
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:15,912
Rosa!

756
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,040
Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

757
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:20,375
You can switch by saying, "Shazam."

758
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:25,588
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

759
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:26,673
Uh...

760
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,092
I was screwing in a bulb.

761
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:32,595
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot tell
anybody about this, all right?

762
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,764
But it's Billy. He's a hero.

763
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,182
Yeah, but if a supervillain finds out
that he's a hero,

764
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:37,517
that endangers us, okay?

765
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,812
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

766
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,355
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

767
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,023
- Moderate.
- No.

768
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,066
Oh, God.

769
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,359
Okay, listen, D,

770
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,070
you cannot tell a single soul
about this, all right? Please?

771
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,781
Why? What if it's people we trust?

772
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,828
Because good sisters don't tell secrets.

773
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,414
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

774
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,166
You know what'd make you
an even better sister?

775
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,375
Is if you fixed the doorknob
for us, okay?

776
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,418
Yeah.

777
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,503
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams. Bye.

778
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:06,963
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

779
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,387
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

780
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,805
Hi. Sir?

781
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,142
Sir, you can't go in there.
Excuse me!

782
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,269
You cannot go in there!

783
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,482
Sorry I'm late.

784
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,943
Thad, this is for board members only.

785
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,403
I'm aware of that, Father.

786
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,661
Now, that night in the car.

787
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,374
I swore to you I saw something,
but you never believed me.

788
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,669
So much easier to blame me, wasn't it?

789
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,797
And say that if I hadn't screamed
that night,

790
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,299
you'd still have your legs.

791
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,761
Well, now I have proof.

792
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,890
That's enough, Thad.

793
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,809
Dear Sid, you think?

794
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:07,273
You know, even before the accident,
you belittled me.

795
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,776
Don't make me
throw you outta here, Thad.

796
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,570
You don't need to make a scene.

797
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,113
Oh, brother,

798
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,616
the scene has only just begun.

799
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,871
Ask that if you can throw me out.

800
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:23,081
What?

801
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,708
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

802
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,464
Let me spoil it for you.

803
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:43,309
Outlook not so good.

804
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,899
I've come here during
the season of giving to give you...

805
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,363
what you deserve.

806
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,919
Run!

807
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,881
Oh, my God! No!

808
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,133
No! No!

809
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:13,816
Help!

810
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,651
Somebody!

811
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:18,404
Help me!

812
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,615
You can't go crying to other people
all the time.

813
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,578
What sin best befits you, Father? Hmm?

814
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,789
I'll give you anything.

815
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,957
Money.

816
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,626
The company.
You want the company?

817
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:33,503
There it is.

818
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:36,506
Greed.

819
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,674
Do you honestly think

820
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:43,679
all this material you've accumulated

821
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,183
amounts to actual power?

822
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:52,522
This is power.

823
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,817
More than you ever had.

824
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:58,569
More than anyone has.

825
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,324
There is one more powerful.

826
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:07,787
The wizard found his champion.

827
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:13,501
Kill the champion
before he learns his true potential,

828
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,712
or he will defeat you.

829
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,673
Show me where to find him.

830
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,148
Oh, Greed,

831
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,192
you can have him.

832
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:40,486
No.

833
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,573
No.. Oh, no!

834
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:47,910
No.! No! No!

835
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,848
<i>Family is more than just</i> a <i>word.</i>

836
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:14,145
<i>At Sivana Industries,
our focus is family.</i>

837
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,254
Uh, Burke.

838
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,217
Where's the truck?

839
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:54,310
I can hear it.

840
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,280
Oh, my God!

841
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:07,907
My truck!

842
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,450
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

843
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:11,953
You know, guys,

844
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,497
I don't think that's gonna buff out.

845
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,215
Hey.

846
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,801
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work. Wow!

847
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,928
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

848
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,263
And I can't?

849
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,976
Your face gives off a very strong vibe
of someone who's hatching schemes.

850
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,478
- My face? This face?
- Yeah. Yeah.

851
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:38,563
Okay.

852
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:45,945
You boys got a hall pass?

853
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:49,031
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

854
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:50,908
You!

855
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:55,246
You look like you're up to something.

856
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,706
Me? Up to something?

857
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,833
No. Never am I up to something.

858
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,086
Our dad's picking us up.
He got held up at the...

859
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,005
The business office.

860
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:05,631
The business office, huh?

861
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,466
Sure, kid.

862
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,635
Look, parents or guardians

863
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:12,972
must appear physically
to check out students.

864
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:15,182
Gotcha.

865
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,184
Okay, well, you hear that, Dad?

866
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,644
- Hey!
- Shazam!

867
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:20,563
Well, hey there, son,

868
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,398
and hey there,
other son that I also have

869
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,483
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

870
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:28,946
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I got held up at the business office,

871
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,157
doing all the work stuff.

872
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,036
This is the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

873
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:36,078
Oh.

874
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,622
Actually, that's the other one.
This one sucks.

875
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,291
That's not funny.

876
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,461
I'm gonna talk to him about that.
I apologize.

877
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:46,380
Anyway, this is me appearing physically
to check my sons out of school.

878
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:50,843
So, thank you so much
for keeping 'em safe, Detective Moron.

879
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:55,056
It's Moran.

880
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,767
- You ready?
- Algebra!

881
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,311
Science!

882
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,396
English!

883
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,941
Health!

884
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:18,829
Oh. Oh.

885
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,809
Are you okay?

886
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,432
I'm sorry!

887
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,415
More powerful than a locomotive.

888
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,876
Locomotive.
What are you? An old prospector?

889
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,129
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

890
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,217
Single bound.

891
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:59,472
Oh!

892
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,723
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

893
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:01,932
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

894
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,184
- Your phone's charged.
- Wow!

895
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,894
Your phone's charged.

896
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,103
Your phone's charged.

897
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:09,565
You really need like a mic drop
catchphrase after you do some cool shit.

898
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,025
I've been thinking about that.

899
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,443
What about this?

900
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,196
"That's why you don't mess
with electricity."

901
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,198
Catchphrases obviously
aren't one of your superpowers.

902
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,908
And your phone's charged.

903
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:20,993
- Well, you think you can do better?
- What the hell?

904
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,579
Let there be light.

905
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,043
Yeah, yeah, baby. Yeah, baby, okay.

906
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:35,674
How do I... Never mind.

907
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:36,759
Shazam!

908
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:41,680
Shazam!

909
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,566
What'd you see? What'd you see?
Were there boobies?

910
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,693
You see nipples? Why aren't you talking?

911
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,446
We're gonna need more money.

912
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,948
Why? You were in there
for, like, five minutes.

913
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,533
Dude, they were very convincing!

914
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:06,914
Oh, get it, get it!

915
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:09,875
Go, go, go!

916
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:16,882
No.!

917
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,051
Stop! No!

918
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,177
- I'm not even looking!
- Stop!

919
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:22,555
- I'm not even looking! Oh!
- Stop!

920
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,431
- Why?
- Oh, and done!

921
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:25,933
Finished him.

922
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,355
A lair.

923
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,565
Yes.

924
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:33,649
And obviously, we're gonna have to

925
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,109
- be making this purchase anonymously.
- Mmm.

926
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,069
Obviously.

927
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:40,072
And, um,
if you have a location on a cliff.

928
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,782
Like a castle-esque type thing.

929
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:43,534
- Overlooking some water.
- Overlooking some water,

930
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,369
seas, below it. Rough, you know...

931
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,662
Like a waterfall,

932
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,039
- so you can drive into...
- Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

933
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,584
Look, Maximum Voltage, is it?

934
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,752
You can call me Max.

935
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:57,298
Look, Max, why don't you just start with
how many bedrooms you're looking for?

936
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,549
- One!
- Seven.

937
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,800
- One?
- Seven?

938
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,302
What, am I running a foster home now?

939
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,399
Have you seen the one
where he throws the football into space?

940
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:16,442
So dope.

941
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,444
Hey, you guys
gotta wonder who's filming those, right?

942
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,863
I mean, that's bravery in and of itself.

943
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,156
I mean, is it, though?

944
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,533
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

945
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:25,618
Holding a camera?

946
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,621
Staring in the face of danger.

947
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:30,080
Like some weirdo fanboy.

948
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:32,875
Hey, Freeman.

949
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,919
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

950
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:38,005
What, is your bestie gonna hit us
with a wheelchair this time?

951
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,506
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend

952
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,091
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

953
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,260
Okay, Freddy.

954
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:46,597
You may have heard of him.
The Human Power Storm.

955
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,933
Frequency Flinger. Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

956
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,768
Yeah. He's a man of many names.

957
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,019
You know the Red Cyclone?

958
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,855
You? My ass you do.

959
01:02:54,939 --> 01:02:56,774
Oh, we're a lot closer than you think.

960
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,817
Maybe even at this very moment.

961
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,110
Prove it.

962
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:03,030
I will, tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's gonna come to lunch.

963
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,490
Right, right, Billy?

964
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,951
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's
gonna be bringing us dessert, right?

965
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,789
Tomorrow at lunch. You'll see.

966
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:15,501
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

967
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,590
So, wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

968
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,135
Except when it makes you look cool,
then it's all good.

969
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,679
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains.

970
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:28,764
They're just super douchebags.

971
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,183
So, you're breaking your own rule?

972
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,267
Got it.

973
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,729
This thing is as much as mine
as it is yours.

974
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,483
Starting to think
you think it's all your thing.

975
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,860
Billy, you're still gonna do it,
though, right?

976
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,946
I mean, what would a good brother do?

977
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:47,032
All hands on deck.

978
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,539
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

979
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:57,001
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

980
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,465
Big news in Philly. Got a costumed hero.

981
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,009
He's doing good.

982
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,677
Yeah, but is he, though?

983
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:10,264
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

984
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,726
Share with us your perspective, Eugene.

985
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,687
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

986
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,606
So what?
I can charge a phone with a plug.

987
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,649
Preach.

988
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,610
Pedro, any thoughts?

989
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,155
Costume's stupid.

990
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,531
- Yeah.
- Okay.

991
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,742
Big white cape like
he's getting married or something.

992
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:32,077
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

993
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:34,329
Ever think about that?

994
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,248
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

995
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:40,335
Yeah, Freddy,
let's manage to see the positive.

996
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,337
Okay, Well, I think it looks like

997
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,214
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

998
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:47,092
Very specific. All right.

999
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:48,427
Maybe to the superhero,

1000
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,179
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1001
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:51,638
Clingy? Wow, interesting take.

1002
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:55,976
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just wants a little me time.

1003
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,188
You know, me time could also
be construed as pushing away his family.

1004
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,231
Family. ls that what they are now?

1005
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,400
It's a classic symptom of
"Superhero Syndrome."

1006
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:07,029
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

1007
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:10,282
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

1008
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,577
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1009
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,412
What he needs is a sidekick.

1010
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:17,039
Name one cool sidekick.

1011
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,375
Darla, why are you
so quiet over there, baby?

1012
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,544
You're never at a loss for words.

1013
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,213
I'm eating.

1014
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:36,642
Why am <i>I</i> still doing this?

1015
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,936
Well, you can't skip every day.

1016
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,771
Not at your age.

1017
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:43,107
But I'm not your age anymore.

1018
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,109
But I can go with you.

1019
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,778
We just gotta trick the guard out,
you know?

1020
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,738
Billy, where are you going?

1021
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:51,156
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1022
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,199
Billy!

1023
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:56,120
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's
still gonna eat in the cafeteria, right?

1024
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:07,548
All right.

1025
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,466
Did you check it to...

1026
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,262
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

1027
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:15,556
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

1028
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,484
Ooh!

1029
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,945
- Oh, my God.
- Mary, are you okay?

1030
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,405
How do you know my name?

1031
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,657
Uh... How do I know your name? Uh...

1032
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,869
One of my superpowers is name guessing.

1033
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:39,329
Which is really weird, I bet.

1034
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,957
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

1035
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,168
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1036
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:45,669
Are you hurt?

1037
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:50,007
No, I'm okay. Thank you. Um...

1038
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:54,428
I just need a second to think.

1039
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,054
This has been such a weird day.

1040
01:06:56,889 --> 01:07:00,434
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

1041
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,937
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college in your hand.

1042
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,607
Are you upset because you didn't get in?

1043
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:11,111
I got in.

1044
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:17,868
Well, now my superpowers
are failing me and I am very confused.

1045
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,704
Yeah. Me, too.

1046
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,123
I don't know. I know I should be excited

1047
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:26,418
'cause this is my dream and I've worked
really, really hard for this,

1048
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,420
but it's like...

1049
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,592
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1050
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,762
Could I give you
a little piece of advice?

1051
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:40,557
Don't be worried about everybody else.
Always look out for number one.

1052
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:41,600
Gandhi said that.

1053
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,518
- I don't think he said that.
- Yeah, he did.

1054
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,312
- Gandhi did not say...
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.

1055
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,271
"Take care of number one."

1056
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:48,440
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

1057
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,608
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1058
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,736
Agree to disagree.
The point is, you do you, you know?

1059
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:56,281
You gotta look out for you. And get
as far away from this place as you can.

1060
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,202
I don't know if I want to.

1061
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,870
Of course you do. What're you gonna do?

1062
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:03,997
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

1063
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:06,583
Look, families are for people

1064
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:09,378
who can't take care
of themselves, okay? So...

1065
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,839
And you can take care of yourself.

1066
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,883
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1067
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,974
I'll just call him. I'll just make sure.

1068
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,603
It's ringing.

1069
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:31,149
Red Cyclone, hey! Hey, what's going on?

1070
01:08:31,984 --> 01:08:33,527
Oh, that's crazy!
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1071
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,988
Yeah, it's crazy! Great story.

1072
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,074
He's not talking to anyone.

1073
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,993
I was!

1074
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,704
I was! We're friends. I know him, I do!

1075
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,706
I know him! I know him! Uh, yeah.

1076
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:50,627
Shit.

1077
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,258
Come on now.

1078
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,511
<i>Hands!
Lightning with my hands!</i>

1079
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,680
<i>Lightning with my hands!</i>

1080
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,724
<i>Lightning with my hands!</i>

1081
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,100
Hey. HEY-

1082
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,769
Hey, young man! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1083
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,730
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

1084
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,023
How can I help you?

1085
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:13,150
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1086
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:17,279
Yeah, I got a little something
called a, uh, suitcase wedgie, right?

1087
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:18,196
I don't know if you've ever heard of it,

1088
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,366
but it's when someone grabs
your underwear like that

1089
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,161
and holds you like a suitcase,
walks you down the hallway.

1090
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,496
And this was my underwear.

1091
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,167
Gross.

1092
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,252
You said you'd come.

1093
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:34,421
You said I would come!
I never said I was...

1094
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:35,922
I'm a superhero, dude!

1095
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,716
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1096
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,217
How much people paying you today?

1097
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,596
Listen, I have
serious responsibilities now, okay?

1098
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,057
But that's cool because
I can carry that burden with my...

1099
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,768
<i>Hands!
Lightning with my hands!</i>

1100
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:08,413
Oh, man!

1101
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,003
Holy moly.

1102
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:20,258
Don't move! Nobody move!

1103
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:29,893
Oh, no, no!

1104
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,480
Oh, no, no, no! Stay, stay! Stay!

1105
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:42,781
Oh!

1106
01:10:43,532 --> 01:10:44,574
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

1107
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:47,786
It's him! It's that superhero guy!

1108
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,539
Help us! Save us!

1109
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:51,957
Come on!

1110
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:56,294
Come on... Yeah.

1111
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,964
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1112
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,765
No way.

1113
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,608
Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1114
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:20,694
God, this is the worst idea ever!

1115
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:34,374
I did it! I did it!

1116
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,668
I got the bus! I got the bus.

1117
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,462
Nobody move in there.

1118
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,505
Oh, I gotta put this thing down.
I gotta put this thing down.

1119
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,091
Oh!

1120
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,219
Oh.

1121
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,221
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Doggy, doggy, you have to move.

1122
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:50,098
Move! Move! Shoo! Shoo!

1123
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:52,017
Please be a good dog, good dog!

1124
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,518
You're being a bad dog!

1125
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:55,145
Go! Go!

1126
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:57,564
Please go. Please move.

1127
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:00,775
Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1128
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,694
Thank you.

1129
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:21,254
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1130
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,215
I was in the neighborhood, you know,
so I thought...

1131
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,382
Thank you!

1132
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:26,259
It was kind of my fault anyway.

1133
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:32,891
So, it seems Philadelphia has gotten
an early Christmas present

1134
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:36,770
in the form of its very own superhero.

1135
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,104
And we're out.

1136
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,482
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1137
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,360
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1138
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:46,530
Yeah. You electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1139
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,281
And then I caught it!

1140
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,952
Freddy, I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1141
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,954
I caught a bus
like people catch fly balls.

1142
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,413
Like, who does that? I do that!

1143
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:56,873
Billy! You do nothing.

1144
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:00,418
You take selfies
and make people pay you.

1145
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:03,797
You know, forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

1146
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,590
You just wish it was you.

1147
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:07,217
No shit!

1148
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:11,596
You think?
I would kill to have what you have.

1149
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,723
Because everything I do is, like,

1150
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:16,601
some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

1151
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:18,728
To not feel sorry for me.

1152
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:21,523
I mean, look at me! Look at me.
Do you even see me?

1153
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,944
'Cause most people don't.
'Cause they don't want to.

1154
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,238
And now you don't either.

1155
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:31,074
I mean, you think this is who you are?

1156
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,701
I mean, Billy, you're 14,

1157
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:34,869
and now you're no better
than the Breyers.

1158
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:39,583
All this power, and all you did
was turn into a show-off and a bully.

1159
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:43,628
Whatever, kid!

1160
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,005
I do what I want!

1161
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:49,301
And I'm, like, mid-20s probably!

1162
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,095
Maybe even, like, 30.

1163
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:56,683
Chosen one.

1164
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,564
The so-called perfect man.

1165
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,275
Pure of heart.

1166
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,236
Flawless in every way.

1167
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:12,407
What made you so worthy?

1168
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,868
I'm sorry, can I help...

1169
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,202
Do you want an autograph or something?

1170
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,912
Give me your power.

1171
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,541
Or die.

1172
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:24,961
Oh, snap!
You're, like, a bad guy, right?

1173
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:28,298
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Before this gets really stupid for you,

1174
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,467
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1175
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,811
The weapons of man
draw no blood from our kind.

1176
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:43,938
I said, stop right there!

1177
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:46,191
The only thing
that extinguishes magic...

1178
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:48,485
is magic.

1179
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:52,280
Time to transfer your power to me.

1180
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:58,453
Oh, you did not see that one coming,
did you, grandpa?

1181
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,455
Them's street rules.

1182
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:11,299
Okay, okay, okay.

1183
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:13,176
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1184
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,220
I never should've punched you
in the nuts like that.

1185
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,262
That was totally my bad.

1186
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:17,639
We can talk about this.

1187
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,224
You grovel like a child.

1188
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,351
That's because I am one. I'm a kid!

1189
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:22,852
You don't wanna hurt a kid, do you?

1190
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,983
I believe I can fly!
I believe I can fly, I can fly!

1191
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:30,694
Freddy said if I believe I can fly,
then I can fly.

1192
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:32,654
So I believe! I believe! I believe!

1193
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:33,613
Okay.

1194
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:34,781
Superman!

1195
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,616
Superman! What arm is it?

1196
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,702
Why am I not flying?

1197
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:40,286
Please, I don't wanna die!

1198
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,436
I'm floating!

1199
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:12,944
What the hell was that?

1200
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,159
I can fly!

1201
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,040
Billy?

1202
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:29,252
Freddy! I need your help!

1203
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,129
You can fly?

1204
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,221
Who's the other guy?

1205
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:41,848
Santa!

1206
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:48,980
So, like, what do you and Mrs. Claus
do in the summertime?

1207
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:51,566
Well, in some ways,

1208
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,443
Santa is always here for you.

1209
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:01,284
Help Santa!

1210
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,829
Santa needs help! Help!

1211
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:06,372
Give us a shout if you need us.

1212
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:16,049
I'm just gonna chill in here
for a little while, if that's okay.

1213
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:21,054
This is crazy.

1214
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:22,555
This is crazy.
You don't have to fight this guy.

1215
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,766
This isn't your job. You can run, right?

1216
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,976
Yes, you can run. Awesome!

1217
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,028
Get back!

1218
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,530
Get away!

1219
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,534
- I'm Batman!
- Get him, Batman!

1220
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,496
Oh, sorry.

1221
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:13,690
Come on!

1222
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,009
Shazam!

1223
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,415
Billy!

1224
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:14,751
Billy!

1225
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,629
Billy, where are you?

1226
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:21,758
Billy!

1227
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,260
Where are you, Billy?

1228
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,224
Billy, come on!

1229
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,147
Billy. Where is he?

1230
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,607
Supervillain.

1231
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,360
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1232
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,529
Worse. Much worse.

1233
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:47,825
Radioactive anthromorph?
Psychic energy manipulator?

1234
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:51,079
I won't let you read my mind.
My mind is blank. You can't get in.

1235
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:54,874
I don't need to read your mind.
Because you are going to tell me.

1236
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,418
Where is he?

1237
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:11,307
Oh, my God, honey, are you okay?

1238
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,977
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1239
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,645
What happened? Are you hurt?

1240
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:16,562
Come inside.

1241
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:17,939
We need to have a talk.

1242
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:21,109
Just don't be
so hard on him, okay?

1243
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,784
Running out on us! Lying!

1244
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:33,538
Huh? Then I get a call from the school,
telling me you've been cutting class!

1245
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,747
Getting in fights!

1246
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:41,004
<i>Bill, the man saved nine people.</i>

1247
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,172
Whoa! ls that...

1248
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,299
<i>I'm questioning his motive.</i>

1249
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:47,719
What's Freddy doing with a superhero?

1250
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:54,267
Or what's a superhero doing with Freddy?

1251
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,063
You remember dinner,

1252
01:20:59,147 --> 01:21:03,151
when Billy and Freddy were arguing
like an old married couple, like this?

1253
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,821
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived in a group home.

1254
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,865
He knew my name. He called me Mary.

1255
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:21,044
Wait, are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

1256
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:22,920
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1257
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:24,464
All on your own. I didn't help.

1258
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,591
- I didn't break any promises.
- You knew?

1259
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,718
I'm a good sister!

1260
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,599
I mean, what were you thinking?

1261
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,310
And then you bring Freddy into it.

1262
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,235
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset, okay?

1263
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:57,288
Billy?

1264
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:03,753
You're him.

1265
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:06,172
You're the hero.

1266
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,217
Yeah, well, not anymore, so...

1267
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:16,557
Why do you have my notebook?

1268
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,144
Eugene finished your search.

1269
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,606
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1270
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,025
<i>But</i> I have <i>played Watch Dogs and Uplink.</i>

1271
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:29,195
And maybe I did pick up a few skills,
which maybe did get me

1272
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,280
into federal databases
most people can't get into.

1273
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:33,491
Good for you, but I'm gonna go.

1274
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:37,286
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1275
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:43,709
What?

1276
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:46,045
You were born
in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1277
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:47,839
They divorced when you were three.

1278
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:51,843
Your mom moved here that year.
Twenty months later, you got lost.

1279
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:52,760
You never found them

1280
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:55,972
'cause your dad's been in prison
in Florida for ten years.

1281
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,265
And your mom's...

1282
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,101
What?

1283
01:23:01,853 --> 01:23:02,979
Is she dead?

1284
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,231
She's two subway stops away.

1285
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:07,608
What?

1286
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:11,863
You know, you didn't find her
because she reverted to her maiden name.

1287
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,161
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1288
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,457
- Victor, get the keys.
- I got it.

1289
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,793
Kids, stay here
in case Billy comes back.

1290
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:35,303
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1291
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:46,564
Wait. I thought
we were running after Billy.

1292
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:49,358
No, we're gonna wait here for now.

1293
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,322
Billy?

1294
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:57,909
Freddy?

1295
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,457
Oh, how quaint.

1296
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,253
Actually, I take that back.

1297
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:13,424
What a shithole.

1298
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:57,718
Just a second.

1299
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,100
Hey, look, I'm late
for work already, all right?

1300
01:25:04,183 --> 01:25:06,894
We don't need any magazines or whatever.
Thanks, though.

1301
01:25:06,978 --> 01:25:08,062
Oh, I'm not.

1302
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,107
You probably don't recognize me...

1303
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:14,235
but I found my way home.

1304
01:25:15,695 --> 01:25:16,570
Mom.

1305
01:25:18,656 --> 01:25:19,782
It's me.

1306
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,201
Oh, God.

1307
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:24,453
Is it?

1308
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,583
Um... Hang on.

1309
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,128
Who's at the door?

1310
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,714
It's, um...

1311
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,258
It's no one, Travis.

1312
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:43,681
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1313
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,058
No.

1314
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:49,270
Listen, um...

1315
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:52,440
It's really you, huh?

1316
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:58,779
I didn't mean to run away.
You know that, right?

1317
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,199
I let go, but it was by accident.

1318
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:03,993
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

1319
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,203
I saw you.

1320
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:08,497
What?

1321
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,294
I saw you after.

1322
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:19,592
So, it was never your fault.

1323
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:24,305
Look, I was 17, okay?
And my daddy kicked me out.

1324
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:28,684
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

1325
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:32,897
<i>And I was hurting, and I was screwed up.</i>

1326
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,942
- I want the tiger.
- I know.

1327
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:38,736
I know, honey,

1328
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,489
but Mom's not exactly
going pro here, okay?

1329
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:45,326
Billy?

1330
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,744
Billy!

1331
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:48,829
Billy?

1332
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:52,083
Jesus Christ. Billy, this isn't funny!

1333
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:53,459
Here you go, buddy.

1334
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,670
That should warm you up. ls that better?

1335
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:02,760
<i>Look, it's just once
I saw you with the police,</i>

1336
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,970
<i>I realized that they could do</i>

1337
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:07,681
a <i>better job taking care of you
than I ever will.</i>

1338
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:14,688
But you're good, right?

1339
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:18,692
I mean, you landed on your feet.

1340
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:21,153
Because, I mean, you look real good.

1341
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:24,532
It's just...

1342
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:30,162
now is not a really good time
for me, Bill.

1343
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:39,338
All I wanted to do is
let you know I'm doing good,

1344
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:44,093
but I have to get back
to my real family.

1345
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,263
Here.

1346
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:51,725
What's this?

1347
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,521
Marilyn!
What's goin' on out there?

1348
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:57,731
You might need it more than me.

1349
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:18,210
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1350
01:28:18,294 --> 01:28:21,881
<i>Come home, Billy.
Come home.</i>

1351
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:25,593
<i>- Billy! Supervillain!
- Supervillain!</i>

1352
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:42,818
Shazam!

1353
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,667
Who are you? What do you want?

1354
01:28:59,293 --> 01:29:00,961
What do I want?

1355
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,796
I want...

1356
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:08,677
That.

1357
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:11,180
Whoa.

1358
01:29:14,642 --> 01:29:16,393
Kick his ass, Billy!

1359
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:20,940
Yes, Billy.

1360
01:29:21,524 --> 01:29:23,150
Try it, by all means.

1361
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:25,277
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1362
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:27,363
No, first, you come inside,

1363
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:28,948
then maybe I'll let them go.

1364
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:47,550
Good boy.

1365
01:29:50,386 --> 01:29:52,346
Because that's all you are, isn't it?

1366
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:54,348
How old are you?

1367
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:56,725
- Basically 15.
- Hmm.

1368
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:02,648
When I was a child, the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1369
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:05,651
Yet here you are, a coward.

1370
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:11,240
Run from me and the wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

1371
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,909
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1372
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:16,704
Give me the power of the champion.

1373
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:17,997
No. Don't do it, Billy.

1374
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:37,433
Give me the power and I'll let them go.

1375
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:38,726
Darla, no.

1376
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,394
Don't go, Billy.

1377
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,606
- Don't go, Billy.
- Darla, come here.

1378
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,524
No, I have to.

1379
01:30:45,608 --> 01:30:48,444
It's what a good brother would do.
Right?

1380
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:54,533
Billy.

1381
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:23,729
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

1382
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:26,482
I scoured the earth.

1383
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:28,400
No one believed me.

1384
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:31,070
No one helped.

1385
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,571
Not the wizard.

1386
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:34,907
Not my family.

1387
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:38,535
I only had myself.

1388
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:40,412
I get it.

1389
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:43,374
I get what that's like.

1390
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,169
Feeling like
you're all alone in the world.

1391
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,212
Stand.

1392
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:51,382
Feeling like there's that one thing,
and if you could just find it,

1393
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:53,425
then you'd finally be good enough.

1394
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:54,468
Stand.

1395
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:58,931
The champion's name.

1396
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:01,475
Say it.

1397
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,129
Look, no offense, mister,

1398
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:32,506
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1399
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:36,135
Don't listen to this child.

1400
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,221
Take the staff.

1401
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:43,684
Hold it
and say the champion's name.

1402
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,811
They're using you.

1403
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:48,897
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

1404
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:50,107
Say your name.

1405
01:32:53,736 --> 01:32:54,570
His name...

1406
01:32:55,863 --> 01:32:57,906
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1407
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,159
And we're gonna keep throwing things
at your big,

1408
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:02,202
fat, ugly-eyed head,

1409
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:04,163
until you let our brother go.

1410
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:30,481
Boy, am I glad
I didn't sell that Batarang.

1411
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,983
- Pedro, is that a lamp?
- It's an ugly one.

1412
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:34,860
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1413
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,111
Guys, I appreciate the thought,

1414
01:33:36,195 --> 01:33:38,238
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

1415
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:39,865
You can put 'em down now.

1416
01:33:41,492 --> 01:33:42,618
The door was right here.

1417
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,119
Billy, how do we get outta here?

1418
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:45,662
What, you think I know? I don't know.

1419
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:47,831
This way!

1420
01:33:47,915 --> 01:33:49,416
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

1421
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,293
Good job, Darla. Go, go, go!

1422
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,294
Kids?

1423
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:55,047
Why is this open?

1424
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:57,758
Freddy? Mary?

1425
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:02,846
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

1426
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:04,723
Freddy? Freddy, keep up.

1427
01:34:04,807 --> 01:34:06,099
Darla, stay in front.

1428
01:34:06,934 --> 01:34:08,101
We gotta hurry.

1429
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,960
Whoa!

1430
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,255
So many doors.

1431
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:39,132
One of these has to be a way out, right?

1432
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:40,509
Yeah, I would hope so.

1433
01:34:57,526 --> 01:34:58,569
Not this one.

1434
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:14,751
Okay, no more doors.
Nobody open any more doors.

1435
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:16,753
Come on, Billy. What are we gonna do?

1436
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:17,921
Darla, I don't know.

1437
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:20,507
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

1438
01:35:20,591 --> 01:35:22,718
Uh, last time, I thought about
the subway, and I was on the subway.

1439
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:24,720
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1440
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:27,514
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1441
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:50,871
Come on, come on, come on.

1442
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:52,664
Why are you covering my eyes?

1443
01:35:52,748 --> 01:35:55,375
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1444
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:56,543
You're welcome!

1445
01:35:56,627 --> 01:35:58,253
Why can't I see what's inside?

1446
01:35:58,337 --> 01:35:59,796
You are not old enough.

1447
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,757
Old enough to know that was great music.

1448
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:03,508
Not my thing.

1449
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:04,718
Where's Freddy?

1450
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:05,969
Yeah, you, too, Sriracha.

1451
01:36:06,053 --> 01:36:07,763
Hey, have a holly jolly Christmas.

1452
01:36:07,846 --> 01:36:09,139
Freddy! What are you doing?

1453
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:10,599
Nice people.

1454
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:11,558
Nice people? Come on.

1455
01:36:11,642 --> 01:36:13,602
Is that glitter?
They have glitter! Can I get glitter?

1456
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:14,895
No, not from them.

1457
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:16,021
Please?

1458
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:16,939
No..

1459
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:19,816
Darla.

1460
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:26,865
Go, go, go. Everybody, go!

1461
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:28,575
Freddy? Freddy, Freddy.

1462
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:29,993
One, two, three. Up, up. Up we go.

1463
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,087
Carnival, go! Go, Mary, go.

1464
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:41,964
Come on, Pedro. Come on.

1465
01:36:53,809 --> 01:36:55,394
Don't run, but don't walk.
Just be cool.

1466
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:58,146
Act naturally,
like kids naturally act in a carnival.

1467
01:36:58,230 --> 01:36:59,940
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- ls that him?

1468
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,483
- Oh, my God!
- Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

1469
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,527
- Power Boy!
- He's an impersonator, okay?

1470
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:04,820
Yeah, I'm an impersonator!
I'm a fake version of myself.

1471
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:06,321
Don't take pictures.

1472
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:09,700
Shazam!

1473
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:18,375
Hey! Where'd he go?

1474
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,668
What, is he invisible now?

1475
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,845
Oh, man, I just spit on a baby!

1476
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:32,889
Yo, what is that?

1477
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,686
Who is that guy?

1478
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:40,188
Champion.

1479
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:45,152
You don't deserve that name.

1480
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:49,197
See that? Look at that up there!

1481
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:52,909
Hiding behind
innocent people who will now die.

1482
01:37:54,703 --> 01:37:58,290
Because deep down
you're still just a scared little boy.

1483
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,085
Oh, no.

1484
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:05,964
Run! Run!

1485
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:21,396
- Oh! What do we do?
- Just hold on!

1486
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,148
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1487
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:34,201
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1488
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:35,327
Are you kidding?

1489
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:39,206
Okay, no. Old guy's up there
harboring multiple spiritual entities.

1490
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:40,999
Plus, he has the same powers as you.

1491
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:42,459
Plus, I mean, he knows what he's doing.

1492
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:44,169
Plus, I mean, you're my best friend.
I don't want you to die.

1493
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:48,548
If a superhero can't save his family,

1494
01:38:49,883 --> 01:38:50,926
he's not much of a hero.

1495
01:38:55,806 --> 01:38:57,015
That was a decent catchphrase.

1496
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,017
Shazam!

1497
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,903
Now, let's try this again.

1498
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:25,752
Or try that again!

1499
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,845
Billy, look out!

1500
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:40,433
Laser eyes!
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1501
01:39:40,517 --> 01:39:42,686
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1502
01:39:52,571 --> 01:39:53,780
That's his power matrix.

1503
01:39:53,864 --> 01:39:54,823
His what-what?

1504
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:57,909
When the demon guys leave his eye,
he loses his powers.

1505
01:39:58,702 --> 01:40:00,245
That's why the Batarang hurt him.

1506
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:02,372
Hey!

1507
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:03,331
Over here!

1508
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:06,543
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1509
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:08,962
We separate the Sins from the eye,
and he's just an old man.

1510
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,797
Gather the mutts.

1511
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:25,562
Run!

1512
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:33,904
Darla, no!

1513
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:50,587
Here. Take it.

1514
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,547
Take it. It's for you.

1515
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:54,216
Hold it tight.

1516
01:40:54,299 --> 01:40:57,260
Close your eyes.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1517
01:40:57,344 --> 01:40:58,803
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1518
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:00,805
Okay.

1519
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:42,264
Shazam!

1520
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:05,996
Shazam!

1521
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:12,585
Playtime's over, boy.

1522
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,672
Your friends can't help you anymore.

1523
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:16,923
Shazam!

1524
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:22,679
Hey!

1525
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:50,665
Shazam!

1526
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:16,941
Nice trick.

1527
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:18,026
Catchy.

1528
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:20,487
One simple word.

1529
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:22,238
I have a better trick.

1530
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:24,491
Four words.

1531
01:43:25,784 --> 01:43:26,951
Kill the little girl.

1532
01:43:27,035 --> 01:43:29,662
- Darla, no!
- Take me instead!

1533
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:35,001
Stop!

1534
01:43:50,517 --> 01:43:53,269
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1535
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:55,355
You gotta just rip it out
of his face hole!

1536
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,481
It's where he gets his power.

1537
01:44:01,111 --> 01:44:02,320
Reach for it.

1538
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:04,864
I dare you.

1539
01:44:14,124 --> 01:44:15,417
Wise decision.

1540
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:19,129
Hands on the staff.

1541
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:22,173
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1542
01:44:22,257 --> 01:44:23,842
- Billy.
- Don't do it, Billy!

1543
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:24,884
Don't!

1544
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,907
<i>Say my name so my power
may flow through you.</i>

1545
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:51,119
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

1546
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:55,039
And in so doing, choose you as champion.

1547
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:59,252
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1548
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:02,130
The thrones
of our brothers and sisters await.

1549
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:11,598
All hands on deck.

1550
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:18,438
Say my name.

1551
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:21,191
Billy!

1552
01:45:21,274 --> 01:45:22,275
No, not my name.

1553
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:23,902
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1554
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:26,279
Shazam!

1555
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:06,110
Guys.

1556
01:46:08,154 --> 01:46:09,072
What's happening?

1557
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:14,702
I can fly!

1558
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,209
Guys.

1559
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:23,336
Check out these guns.

1560
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:27,298
No. It's not possible.

1561
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,262
Gee-whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your cane.

1562
01:46:32,345 --> 01:46:33,513
Do you want it back?

1563
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:37,642
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1564
01:46:38,226 --> 01:46:41,521
but I think we should kick
this guy's butt, like, really hard.

1565
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:47,569
Whoa!

1566
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,492
Guys, I think I can move really...

1567
01:46:55,535 --> 01:46:56,452
fast.

1568
01:46:57,245 --> 01:46:59,247
Hyper-speed! Check!

1569
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:10,800
Billy! The eye!

1570
01:47:18,683 --> 01:47:19,601
Look out!

1571
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:22,729
Whoa!

1572
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:26,691
What?

1573
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:28,943
- What!
- Dude!

1574
01:47:29,027 --> 01:47:31,029
You almost exploded me.

1575
01:48:17,033 --> 01:48:18,951
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1576
01:48:19,035 --> 01:48:20,495
of every single superhero.

1577
01:48:21,788 --> 01:48:23,539
What do you got?

1578
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:28,419
Well, that's terrifying.

1579
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:04,372
Enough games, boy.

1580
01:49:05,415 --> 01:49:06,874
You think a pack of children can...

1581
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:11,379
Wait, what?

1582
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,756
You will beg for mercy

1583
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,800
as I feast on your heart...

1584
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:17,427
slow.

1585
01:49:19,345 --> 01:49:22,932
Are you making some big evil guy speech
right now or something?

1586
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:26,561
You're, like, a mile away from me
right now. There's cars and trucks.

1587
01:49:26,644 --> 01:49:29,605
I will have the world
eating out of the palm of my hand...

1588
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:32,150
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1589
01:49:32,233 --> 01:49:35,737
Only I have the power to unleash...

1590
01:49:37,655 --> 01:49:38,948
Ah, whatever. Screw it.

1591
01:50:09,896 --> 01:50:11,230
Oh, my gosh. Those people!

1592
01:50:19,322 --> 01:50:20,448
Hi!

1593
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:21,908
Wow. I caught you.

1594
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,963
I got it. I got it.

1595
01:50:42,178 --> 01:50:43,930
Oh, my God. I do got it.

1596
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:01,364
You're not gonna believe this,

1597
01:51:01,447 --> 01:51:03,366
but you're actually the first villain
I've ever fought.

1598
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:05,076
It's kind of a huge deal for me.

1599
01:51:19,465 --> 01:51:22,009
Somebody help!

1600
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:39,026
Hi. Wow. It's really you.

1601
01:51:40,069 --> 01:51:42,864
My name is Darla,
and I've been really good.

1602
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:43,823
What?

1603
01:51:47,994 --> 01:51:49,161
Oh, crap.

1604
01:51:50,663 --> 01:51:51,539
No, no, no.

1605
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:52,623
No, no. No!

1606
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:12,226
No! No, no.

1607
01:52:20,443 --> 01:52:21,485
Oh, my God!

1608
01:52:21,569 --> 01:52:23,237
ls he giving us
suitcase wedgies?

1609
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,276
So this is, like,
the Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1610
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:05,947
I mean, I've never been great at math,

1611
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:08,824
but, uh, the big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1612
01:53:08,908 --> 01:53:10,910
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1613
01:53:11,786 --> 01:53:15,247
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Lust,

1614
01:53:15,331 --> 01:53:18,960
who I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

1615
01:53:19,627 --> 01:53:22,713
But that's only six.
Where's lucky number seven?

1616
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:25,007
Where's little man? Where's Envy?

1617
01:53:25,091 --> 01:53:27,760
Is he just scared of me and my family
because we're so awesome?

1618
01:53:27,843 --> 01:53:28,678
Because I get that.

1619
01:53:29,428 --> 01:53:31,597
Like, the other sins,
they get to come out and fight

1620
01:53:31,681 --> 01:53:33,557
because they're big
and strong and scary.

1621
01:53:33,641 --> 01:53:34,725
But Envy...

1622
01:53:36,102 --> 01:53:37,561
he's just the runt.

1623
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:53,244
And that's why all the other sins
never invite him out to play, man.

1624
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:55,121
Because they all know who'd win.

1625
01:53:56,038 --> 01:54:01,335
And it's not weak, worthless, ugly Envy.

1626
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:29,155
Gotcha.

1627
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:31,282
Shazam!

1628
01:54:37,705 --> 01:54:39,081
Shazam!

1629
01:54:49,508 --> 01:54:51,260
Ready to go round up your buddies?

1630
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:23,918
No. No.!

1631
01:55:53,614 --> 01:55:55,991
Here's the thing about power.

1632
01:55:56,117 --> 01:55:59,829
What good's power,
if you got nobody to share it with?

1633
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:03,207
- Nice.
- Ta-da!

1634
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,208
That's disgusting.

1635
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:05,126
Fatality.

1636
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:08,045
I got the voice.

1637
01:56:11,799 --> 01:56:12,633
What's that?

1638
01:56:18,514 --> 01:56:20,683
I can have anything I've ever wanted?

1639
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,688
Billy.

1640
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:26,981
No, no, no!

1641
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:28,524
- Stop it!
- Don't look at that!

1642
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:29,859
Billy, don't do it!

1643
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:32,027
Ah!

1644
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:34,822
- You should hear yourselves!
- Not funny.

1645
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:36,949
You think I'm gonna put
a demon ball in my head?

1646
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:37,950
That's disgusting.

1647
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:40,411
That's funny. That's pretty funny.
You got me going.

1648
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:41,996
- You got me going.
- Uh... Guys.

1649
01:56:45,249 --> 01:56:46,083
What?

1650
01:56:48,127 --> 01:56:49,587
Oh. Hey.

1651
01:56:50,171 --> 01:56:52,548
Oh, wow.

1652
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:01,432
All right, We did it!

1653
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:05,519
Hey, all right, yeah! We did it!

1654
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:08,939
We did it!

1655
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:12,276
Hey, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

1656
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,695
- We're fine. It's okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

1657
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:15,821
We're good.

1658
01:57:26,207 --> 01:57:27,875
You sure this is gonna work?

1659
01:57:29,627 --> 01:57:30,669
Told ya.

1660
01:57:31,212 --> 01:57:32,421
Whoa!

1661
01:57:34,215 --> 01:57:35,174
Whoa!

1662
01:57:50,022 --> 01:57:51,482
You guys know what this place is, right?

1663
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:54,693
A dark, haunted cave with demon statues.

1664
01:57:54,777 --> 01:57:57,446
Well, yes, but also...

1665
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:03,327
Lair! We got a lair!

1666
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,536
- Lair.
- Yeah.

1667
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:05,663
No, you right.

1668
01:58:05,746 --> 01:58:07,289
We got a lair.

1669
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:10,542
What's a lair?

1670
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,212
<i>And thanks to six superheroes,</i>

1671
01:58:13,295 --> 01:58:17,383
<i>citizens are back in their homes,
safe again with their families.</i>

1672
01:58:17,466 --> 01:58:19,927
<i>And here with an eyewitness account
of the events...</i>

1673
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:22,263
<i>It was crazy, man!</i>

1674
01:58:22,346 --> 01:58:24,265
<i>Creatures from hell!</i>

1675
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:26,934
<i>Lightning coming out
of everyone's everything!</i>

1676
01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:29,770
<i>And that is not cool, man!</i>

1677
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:31,897
So, first day as a superhero.

1678
01:58:31,981 --> 01:58:35,109
Automatic top spot
for best ever.

1679
01:58:35,192 --> 01:58:37,027
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

1680
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:38,862
- No. That's racist.
- Not if I say it.

1681
01:58:38,946 --> 01:58:39,947
Guys.

1682
01:58:41,073 --> 01:58:42,449
- All hands on deck.
- Oh!

1683
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,996
Wait, wait, wait.

1684
01:58:47,079 --> 01:58:48,122
Wait.

1685
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:49,790
Thank you for this food.

1686
01:58:49,873 --> 01:58:51,917
Thank you for this day.

1687
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:53,043
Thank you for this family.

1688
01:58:54,128 --> 01:58:56,213
I thought maybe this time I'd stay.

1689
01:58:57,631 --> 01:59:00,384
I mean, after all,

1690
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,343
I'm home.

1691
01:59:33,459 --> 01:59:35,210
He better not sit at our table.

1692
01:59:38,547 --> 01:59:39,673
Nope!

1693
01:59:42,176 --> 01:59:43,093
Okay.

1694
01:59:46,764 --> 01:59:48,223
What are you doing?

1695
01:59:48,307 --> 01:59:50,351
Waiting for your imaginary BFF
to show up?

1696
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:51,602
Yeah.

1697
02:00:00,277 --> 02:00:01,195
What are you guys doing here?

1698
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:03,197
Well, we're having lunch with you.

1699
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,823
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1700
02:00:05,407 --> 02:00:06,909
Well, we made
a very special arrangement.

1701
02:00:08,744 --> 02:00:11,288
- Darla, what's going on?
- Why are you asking me?

1702
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:12,998
Freddy Freeman.

1703
02:00:15,459 --> 02:00:20,756
This guy taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1704
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:23,133
True story. You should get
some pointers from him.

1705
02:00:23,217 --> 02:00:27,721
What's going on,
my best bud in the whole world?

1706
02:00:27,805 --> 02:00:32,101
And also new kids that I'm meeting
for the first time but seem very cool?

1707
02:00:32,434 --> 02:00:33,394
Uh...

1708
02:00:33,477 --> 02:00:36,271
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

1709
02:03:32,990 --> 02:03:37,244
Sun of Ra.

1710
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:45,085
Ouroboros.

1711
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,465
Solomon's...

1712
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:52,843
Knot.

1713
02:04:04,021 --> 02:04:07,524
No! No.!

1714
02:04:13,905 --> 02:04:16,783
<i>Primitive symbols.</i>

1715
02:04:16,867 --> 02:04:21,580
<i>You walking, talking monkeys
with your cave drawings.</i>

1716
02:04:22,331 --> 02:04:26,418
<i>You assume there's only one way
to gain magic.</i>

1717
02:04:26,501 --> 02:04:28,295
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1718
02:04:29,546 --> 02:04:32,424
<i>There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.</i>

1719
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:35,427
What in God's name?

1720
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:39,973
<i>I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.</i>

1721
02:04:40,057 --> 02:04:43,268
<i>Oh, what fun
we're going to have together.</i>

1722
02:04:43,352 --> 02:04:47,314
<i>The Seven Realms are about to be ours.</i>

1723
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:16,036
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

1724
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:18,621
Yeah, I'm sure.

1725
02:11:18,705 --> 02:11:20,999
Because there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

1726
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:24,210
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.

1727
02:11:24,627 --> 02:11:27,255
Even if I could, I mean, honestly,
what could we do with that that's cool?

1728
02:11:27,338 --> 02:11:31,593
I don't know, maybe command
an army of billions in the ocean.

1729
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:34,846
Oh, yeah. Well, that's not that cool.

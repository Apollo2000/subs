3
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:53,905
Here we go, guys,

4
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,373
the man you've all
been waiting for...

5
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:57,942
Mr Bob Hope!

6
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:06,650
Welcome, everybody,
to Long Binh,

7
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,420
in what I like to call
the United States of Vietnam.

8
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,425
I hear you guys have been petitioning
the president to let me retire.

9
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:18,028
If you think you can
shake me off that easily,

10
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,632
you need to talk to
Raquel Welch.

11
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,700
- Come on, now.
- Give it to her, Bob!

12
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:25,770
Uh-huh.

13
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,379
- S. Alexander?
- Yes.

14
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:42,287
Right now, I want you
all to sit back and relax.

15
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:46,324
It's time to introduce the most
beautiful girl in the world.

16
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:49,993
Of course, that's not my opinion.
That's her actual title.

17
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,062
From Vienna, Austria,

18
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:55,066
please welcome
1969 Miss World...

19
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:58,703
Eva Rueber-Staier.

20
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:04,741
- 34-24-36.
- Wow. Yes!

21
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:07,544
There you go, boys.

22
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,616
This show just got
a lot hotter.

23
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:13,751
Yeah!

24
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,888
Eva, honey, would you like
to say hello to these fellas?

25
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,656
Hello.

26
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,699
The mature student.

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,768
- Sally Alexander?
- Yes.

28
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:51,355
So, history.

29
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,457
Why have we never had
a revolution in Britain?

30
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:57,929
Eva Rueber-Staier.

31
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:01,031
Oh, boy!

32
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,867
Ooh! I'm telling you,

33
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:05,570
if the commies had someone
like that to go home to,

34
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:07,604
we'd be out of here by now.

35
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:10,108
Oh, yeah!

36
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,547
The Civil War was won by
the rebels, but, even then,

37
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,750
the new order
only lasted a generation.

38
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,552
So surely the real question is,

39
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:23,954
why have all
our revolutions failed?

40
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,694
It says here
you left school at 15.

41
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:34,598
My school didn't really
foster academic ambition.

42
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,603
It was more about preparing us
for marriage and so forth, so...

43
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:41,872
Which is why I would like
to get back into education.

44
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,709
I have just completed
my diploma in history.

45
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,678
- At Ruskin College?
- Yes.

46
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,647
Don't they require
a trade union background?

47
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,150
I... I have
a trade union background.

48
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,817
I was an Equity member.

49
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:58,423
So, you're an actress?

50
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,025
No, er...

51
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,894
After school,
I had to do something.

52
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,630
And my mother thought
that drama school

53
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,800
sounded better than
secretarial college, so...

54
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,901
I was never any good.

55
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,004
I don't like people
looking at me.

56
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:17,774
And after drama school?

57
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,177
I got married
and had a baby.

58
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,146
What does your husband
think about you

59
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:25,081
applying for university
as a mature student?

60
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,785
We're divorced, so it doesn't
really matter what he thinks.

61
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:29,887
You have a child,
Miss Alexander.

62
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,856
Studying here
is a big commitment.

63
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,126
Yes. Erm...

64
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,663
I managed my diploma whilst
looking after my daughter.

65
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,063
I got a distinction.

66
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,666
And the man I live with
shares the child care.

67
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:50,475
I would never be late for
lectures or miss deadlines.

68
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:52,043
I would be mature.

69
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:55,712
I would be a mature...
mature student.

70
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,096
Hurry up.

71
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:14,931
Go, go, go! Come on!

72
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,132
Go, go, go!

73
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,144
I had to do that.

74
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,155
- Hello.
- Sally.

75
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,658
- We're gonna need more chairs.
- Oh, okay.

76
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,730
- Here's Mummy.
- Hello!

77
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,634
- Mummy!
- Hello!

78
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,269
What...

79
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,205
It arrived this morning
after you left.

80
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,605
Oh.

81
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:07,919
Ah!

82
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,221
University College London.

83
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,557
They're offering me a place.
I got in!

84
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,262
- Course they bloody did!
- Ohh!

85
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:20,730
I'm...

86
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:25,235
Oh, give me a cuddle!
Give me a real cuddle!

87
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,672
"It's my great pleasure to offer
you a place to study history..."

88
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,875
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it, I can't believe it.

89
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:52,596
This is a women's conference.
Why are there men everywhere?

90
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:55,865
They don't look that happy about
it, do they? Look at that face.

91
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,737
Oh, God!

92
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,671
Cheer up, mate.

93
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:03,873
We're not permanent.
We're only here for the weekend.

94
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:07,110
You can have a party hat.

95
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:09,379
Don't you worry, mate.
We're not gonna leave you out.

96
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,283
Erm, excuse me.

97
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:15,886
Sorry. Do you mind?

98
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:18,055
Somebody's gonna have to
clean that up when you're gone.

99
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,789
What, cos...

100
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,659
Cos God forbid we should
offend the authorities?

101
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:26,730
Typical Oxford student.
No stomach for a fight.

102
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:28,899
Actually, I'm not
an Oxford student.

103
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,168
This is a place for people
trying to get into university.

104
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:34,170
Oh, right. So you don't want to
bring down the male establishment.

105
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,539
You just want a seat
at the table.

106
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,875
If I'm in it, it won't be the male
establishment any more, will it?

107
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,977
Ooh, there she is.

108
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,014
Let's sit down. Jo.

109
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,158
What does it mean
to be a woman?

110
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,730
That our work
will be underpaid

111
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,066
and our minds
undervalued.

112
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:07,437
Last year, when we proposed a
women's conference, men laughed,

113
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:10,341
and yet here we are,
on the road to liberation.

114
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:16,247
It won't be easy.

115
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,415
We have to recognise
the ways

116
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,450
in which
we've all been conditioned,

117
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:24,689
trained to be pleasing
rather than powerful,

118
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,359
told that our purpose
is to enable men,

119
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,860
serve them, service them.

120
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:36,734
We have to find a language
to describe injustices

121
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,470
we haven't even been able
to name until now.

122
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,240
If the word "racism"
describes one tyranny,

123
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,743
doesn't "sexism"
describe another?

124
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,448
The belief that women
are inferior to men.

125
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:56,153
We have to learn to look
at the world with new eyes.

126
00:09:56,253 --> 00:10:00,458
We have to ask ourselves,
if there was no patriarchy,

127
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:03,259
how would I dress...

128
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,495
or work...

129
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:06,964
or think?

130
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,100
How would I have sex?

131
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,002
And who would
I have sex with?

132
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:13,471
No one.

133
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:19,309
But if we need to change,
so does the world.

134
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:23,813
Which is why today we are launching
the Women's Liberation Movement.

135
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:31,489
We demand
an end to discrimination!

136
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,257
Yes!

137
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,458
We demand equal pay
for equal work,

138
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:38,928
and the childcare
to enable that.

139
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:42,799
We want control
over our own bodies,

140
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,201
contraception and abortion
on demand.

141
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,870
Yes.

142
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:51,942
Up until now,
working as individuals,

143
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,844
we've just been a ripple
on the surface.

144
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:54,944
But together...

145
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:00,551
Together, I promise you,
we will be a revolution.

146
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,094
Miss Bristol.

147
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:49,166
Miss Bristol is 34-22-36.

148
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,402
Lovely face, obviously.
Good legs.

149
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,040
No defects... knock-knees,
wonky teeth, that sort of thing.

150
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,042
They also have
to be unmarried,

151
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:00,110
by which
I also mean untouched.

152
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,581
And if they're not
pretty much 36-24-36,

153
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,584
it goes without saying the curves
won't be in the right places.

154
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:09,118
But we really do believe

155
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,155
that beauty isn't
just skin deep.

156
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:15,259
The girls also get marks
on charm and grace, deportment.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,360
Swimsuits.

158
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,028
And who's your money on?

159
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,264
Well, Miss Totnes
is definitely a corker.

160
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,000
Nice eyes.

161
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,002
And whatever she may be lacking
in the boob front,

162
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:28,105
she more than makes up for
in the derriere department.

163
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,242
And I wouldn't rule out
Miss Nantwich either.

164
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:34,177
Lovely blonde hair
and a very nice set of curves.

165
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,947
Very nice, Miss Nantwich.

166
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,350
And for the Miss World
competition,

167
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,319
what about this
year's special guest?

168
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,654
Who have we got
lined up for us?

169
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,025
Who indeed, boys, eh?
Who indeed?

170
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,895
Ladies and gentlemen,
a warm round of applause, please,

171
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:54,264
for our seven
lovely finalists.

172
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:58,101
Who in-bloody-deed?

173
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,403
We have, in first place,

174
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,072
Miss Nantwich!

175
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,554
Golf?

176
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:20,024
Oh, I just have
a little work to do.

177
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,192
Hiring.

178
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,394
Again?

179
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:40,110
And you must be Joan.

180
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,279
- Wow.
- Bob.

181
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,548
Joan Billings.

182
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,716
- And right this way.
- Thank you.

183
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,052
- How old are you, honey?
- Eighteen.

184
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,221
Eighteen?
Pretty as springtime.

185
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:54,291
Good morning, Mr Hope.

186
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,559
Welcome to the Fort Knox
of laughter.

187
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,062
Wow.

188
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,264
Got a whole warehouse
full of this stuff.

189
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:05,636
Fifty years of memorabilia just
waiting for the Bob Hope Museum.

190
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,705
Just gotta get around
to building that museum.

191
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:12,208
We got all my gags,
538,000 of them.

192
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:17,413
Every cabinet is fireproof
and earthquake-proof.

193
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,182
Isn't it something?

194
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:21,151
Wow, Mr Hope. Wow.

195
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:26,189
Academy Awards, Advertising,
Agriculture, Airplanes.

196
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:29,058
We got every subject
under the sun, A to Z.

197
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:33,463
Little group of writers down there
toiling 24/7 like worker bees,

198
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:35,565
just bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz.

199
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,569
Magicians, Malibu,
Marriage. Massage.

200
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,303
- Bob Hope's office.
- Go ahead, pick one out.

201
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:43,240
Sir, it's Mecca
calling again.

202
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,442
The Miss World people.

203
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,644
Wanna handle this one, Miss Billings?
What do you think?

204
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:49,446
Show me what you can do.

205
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,290
Hello.

206
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,360
This is
Miss Billings,

207
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,463
Mr Hope's
personal secretary.

208
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:09,232
I'm sorry
to keep badgering you,

209
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:11,534
but if you could just
let us know either way,

210
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,605
we would be
so terribly grateful.

211
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,307
Yes, I understand.

212
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,209
Please hold
for a moment.

213
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:22,578
She's asking someone.

214
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:25,214
Let's hope
it's not Mrs Hope.

215
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,284
After what he got up to
last time.

216
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:33,556
Do I wanna host
the Miss World competition?

217
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:36,360
Well, that's a big decision for
a boy to make all on his own.

218
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,394
What do you think,
Miss Billings?

219
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,398
Do I wanna host the Miss
World competition this year?

220
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:46,636
Sure, you do.
I've always loved that show.

221
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,306
All right, let them know.

222
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:58,581
Mr Hope has just confirmed that
he'll be delighted to join you again.

223
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,518
That is marvellous news.

224
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:04,855
Eric will be so pleased.

225
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,424
- Thank you. Many thanks.
- Yes!

226
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:11,227
Onwards and upwards.

227
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,730
Well done, Mrs Morley.

228
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:18,469
Well, thank you,
Mr Morley.

229
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:21,337
I think we should celebrate.
What do you say?

230
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:23,740
Oh, sure, Mr Hope.

231
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,643
What'll it be?
Scotch and sofa or gin and platonic?

232
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:32,182
It's not about context.
Some things are universal.

233
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,651
The point is
that it isn't true.

234
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,587
- Not when you consider historicism as a theory.
- But don't you think...

235
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:40,591
Historicism isn't a theory.

236
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:43,660
- It's just Marxist pseudo-science.
- But that wasn't the point.

237
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,495
Of course you'd say that.
You're a bloody imperialist!

238
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:48,764
- Argumentum ad hominem.
- All right, gentlemen, thank you.

239
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:51,435
Interesting opinions
all round.

240
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:54,370
I look forward to more
of the same next week.

241
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:06,315
Fantastic.

242
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,519
You've really made
some good choices.

243
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:27,471
- Excuse me? Hello?
- Can't talk now.

244
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,872
No, I don't want to talk.
I just want to tell you...

245
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:32,509
- Look, police.
- Oh, shit! Run!

246
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,677
Oi, you two! Come back!

247
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:39,715
Come on!

248
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,752
Come in here.

249
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,428
Oh, my God!
What is the point...

250
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,731
What is the point in getting
arrested just for sloganising?

251
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:58,335
I like slogans.

252
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:02,239
Blimey, that looks racy.

253
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:06,742
So, you enjoying
your seat at the table?

254
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:10,246
Very much, thank you.

255
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:11,781
I'm starting
a women's group.

256
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,320
Every Wednesday.
29 Grosvenor Avenue, Islington.

257
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,255
6:00. You should come.

258
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:21,557
I'm... I'm busy Wednesdays.

259
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:23,526
- You got homework?
- Leafleting.

260
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,361
Leafleting?

261
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:29,333
We're helping women cleaners unionise.
You should come along.

262
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:32,769
Er... Thanks, no.
I don't really do organised.

263
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:35,605
Well, that's all right.
I don't really do illegal.

264
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:38,942
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find us.

265
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,012
Just ask for the commune.

266
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,881
Enjoy your leaflets!

267
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:52,623
And she told me that her
daughter, who is also a divorcee,

268
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:54,924
remarried
in the sweetest little frock,

269
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,027
from Marks and Spencer,
would you believe?

270
00:18:57,126 --> 00:19:00,396
Clothes from a clothes shop?
Who'd have thought?

271
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:03,500
The frock isn't the point,
as you know.

272
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:08,005
Come on, sweetheart.
Let Granny do your tangles.

273
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,876
You look tired, darling.

274
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:17,781
Is it still
all essays and reading?

275
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,684
Don't they ever have
socials

276
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,020
or dances you and Gareth
could go to?

277
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,289
You know me, Evelyn.
I'm not one for dancing.

278
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,959
Veteran comedian
Bob Hope has been confirmed

279
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:31,894
as the special guest at this
year's Miss World Competition.

280
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:34,430
- Leave it there.
- Last year, 100 million people

281
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,067
tuned in live to watch
Miss Austria take the crown,

282
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,903
more viewers than saw
either the moon landings

283
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:41,904
or the World Cup Final.

284
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:44,074
Oh, isn't she lovely?

285
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,977
Lovely long legs.
I wish I'd had legs like that.

286
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:50,881
Her Miss World win has taken Eva
Rueber-Staier all around the globe.

287
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,949
I'm a Miss World lady.

288
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:54,718
You look beautiful, darling.

289
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:55,819
Mum, don't.

290
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,456
You and your sisters used to
love playing Miss World.

291
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,658
We also liked to
eat our own snot.

292
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:03,994
...thrill of being
the most beautiful girl...

293
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,663
I don't want Abi watching that.
It's degrading and sexist.

294
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:09,932
For goodness' sake.
What does that even mean?

295
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,034
Right,
I'm gonna put supper on.

296
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,440
Well, I think that's sexist.

297
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,110
Making poor Gareth cook dinner.

298
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:24,013
I wish
you'd be careful, darling.

299
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:28,785
Some of your attitudes,
they're very... emasculating.

300
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:36,058
Look at you. Give us a twirl.

301
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:09,492
Hello.

302
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:11,995
"21st Century Schizoid Man."

303
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,730
Not "Court of
the Crimson King"?

304
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,698
"Schizoid" every time.

305
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,569
You're talking about
sexism, not women's groups.

306
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,872
Who's looking
at their vagina anyway?

307
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:28,177
Have you bloody seen it?
Topless model on page three.

308
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:30,180
We should go and burn
their bloody offices down.

309
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,947
That'd put women's liberation
on the map.

310
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:34,451
I've got matches.
Anyone got the bus fare to Fleet Street?

311
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,186
- I'm serious.
- Isn't arson a bit male, anyway?

312
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,423
Oh, er...

313
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:42,425
Everyone, this is...
What's your name?

314
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:45,695
- Sally.
- She's a student.

315
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,031
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

316
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,600
- Well, come in.
- Sorry.

317
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,003
I'm just saying,
you can talk all you like,

318
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,506
but unless we start taking direct
action, nothing's gonna change.

319
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:59,910
There's a motion to demonstrate
outside the Miss World contest.

320
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,778
Who proposed that?

321
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:04,914
Hazel Twort and Jan Williams from
the Peckham Rye women's group.

322
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:07,217
There's a meeting about it at
the women's liberation workshop.

323
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:09,885
What is the point in wasting
our time on a beauty pageant

324
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:12,055
when there are serious
injustices to worry about?

325
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,691
Sexual objectification
is serious.

326
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,127
Yeah, that competition is one big,
fat celebration of oppression.

327
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:20,897
What gets me is they sell it
as family entertainment.

328
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,865
My daughter was watching
a television report...

329
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:25,134
You've got a television?

330
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:26,970
Yes.

331
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,940
Haven't you?

332
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,008
The media is a mouthpiece
for the establishment,

333
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:36,011
which this commune doesn't
collude with on any level.

334
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:38,215
So, no, we don't have
a television.

335
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:45,888
But, erm...
if you won't talk to the media,

336
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,024
then how are you gonna
get your message out?

337
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:00,804
Well, come on, then.
Sarah, come with me.

338
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:11,280
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

339
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:23,059
Do you like 'em?
They're good, aren't they?

340
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,161
Is this what you do?

341
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,897
Well, not for money,
if that's what you mean.

342
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:29,865
How do you live, then?

343
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:32,301
I do some cleaning.
Jo paints scenery.

344
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:35,639
We share money
like we share everything else.

345
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:39,241
We keep it in a drawer in the kitchen.
Don't nick it, will you?

346
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:42,045
Jo went to art college.
She's very creative.

347
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:44,047
I've seen
some of her work.

348
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:46,582
I went to art college
too, actually.

349
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:49,184
Come on, then.
You write the message.

350
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:51,153
We'll make sure
everyone sees it.

351
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:49,945
You're an elusive man,
Mr Morley.

352
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:52,215
Peter Hain,
Anti-Apartheid Movement.

353
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:54,351
Never get involved
in anything political, son.

354
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,152
We're a family
entertainment show.

355
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:01,924
Well, taking only
white candidates

356
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:05,961
from a predominantly black country
every yer is political, Mr Morley.

357
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:09,264
In fact, I'd say it's an unequivocal
endorsement of a racist regime.

358
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:12,935
80% of South Africa's population
are black or coloured,

359
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,837
and they have no right,
none.

360
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:16,373
Excuse me.

361
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:20,376
They tell me 27 million people
watch your show in the UK alone.

362
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,313
Jesus, man. That's an endorsement
that packs quite a punch.

363
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:26,415
You get the South African cricket
team banned, and now it's my turn?

364
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:29,252
Boycott the South African
candidate or we picket the show.

365
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:32,155
Trust me, your sponsors won't thank
you for that kind of publicity.

366
00:25:32,255 --> 00:25:33,890
What if I was to tell you

367
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,093
we've decided to take a white
and a coloured girl this year?

368
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:38,961
You're joking, aren't you?

369
00:25:39,061 --> 00:25:41,764
I thought that'd take
the wind out of your sails.

370
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:45,000
- See him out, will you?
- You heard the man. This way.

371
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,875
Get on the South African office. Tell them
to find a decent-looking black girl.

372
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:54,778
Get her on the same flight
as the white girl ASAP.

373
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:57,747
South African office, please.

374
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:01,216
I think you'll find I'm a man not
much given to joking, Mr Hain.

375
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:04,688
Eric, I need a word.

376
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:12,227
Some group calling themselves
the Women's Liberation Movement.

377
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:16,700
Apparently they are going
to overthrow the patriarchy.

378
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,969
- Overthrow the what?
- The patriarchy.

379
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:22,204
Male establishment.

380
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:25,307
Men like you, Eric.

381
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:28,177
I'm getting calls from journalists.
They want to know our response.

382
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:30,246
Bloody women's liberation.

383
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,919
I told you,
by the time I found out,

384
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,954
she had already committed me to the
show, it was too late to pull out.

385
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,390
Hmm.

386
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,093
Did the naughty little intern
twist your arm?

387
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:45,228
Dol, I'm giving a show.

388
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,763
That's it.
In, out, end of story.

389
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:49,732
It wasn't how
the story ended last time.

390
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,901
You wanna stay home?
Is that what you're saying?

391
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,105
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- No, I wouldn't.

392
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:56,438
I...

393
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:58,741
Listen, I wouldn't
like that one bit.

394
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,378
Come on.

395
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:06,182
We can go to London,
have some fun.

396
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:10,886
Lord, you've got a sweet tongue
when you know you're in the wrong.

397
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:14,257
- I don't know what you want.
- An apology.

398
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:16,526
"Never again."
That's what you said.

399
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,327
"Miss World, never again."

400
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,964
- Ten years ago.
- It was still a promise.

401
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,134
Oh, my wife,

402
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:26,435
- because you are so good...
- Bob, don't.

403
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:29,773
...please forgive me

404
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,807
for the sins
that I have committed.

405
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:34,144
- Stop it, I said.
- And by your good grace,

406
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:36,178
I will not sin again.

407
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,286
Everything locked down, sir.

408
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:46,990
Lifts disabled. Second and third
floor sealed like Fort Knox.

409
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:57,099
Right, so we've had all kinds
of fun and games in the past

410
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,201
with amorous Romeos,
but this year,

411
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:03,438
our problem's a bunch of
anti-establishment mischief-makers.

412
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:06,542
So, chaperones, stick to
your contestants like glue.

413
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,046
Anything untoward,
Mrs Morley needs to know about it.

414
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:11,480
Any time, day or night.

415
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,315
First coach arriving.

416
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:16,051
You boys on security,
I'm not employing you

417
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,054
to stand around
looking like James Bond.

418
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:20,557
Eyes and ears open
the whole time, please.

419
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:22,291
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

420
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:24,394
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir!

421
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,429
Philippines.

422
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,365
Yugoslavia.

423
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:30,833
Hi.

424
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,134
Australia.

425
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:34,436
Ceylon.

426
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:37,207
Japan.

427
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,242
Hong Kong.

428
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:42,978
Grenada.

429
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,882
Mexico.

430
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,512
Darling, look over here.

431
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:49,426
That's it.

432
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:51,520
Spain.

433
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:52,989
Ecuador.

434
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:54,256
Portugal.

435
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,892
Israel.

436
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:58,927
Jennifer Hosten.

437
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:09,972
Roger, we cannot have
a situation

438
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:11,908
where we have more contestants
than chaperones.

439
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,442
- Could somebody have gone to the toilet?
- It's possible.

440
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,544
- Could you check? Don't go in there, but check.
- I can do.

441
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:17,946
Oh, my! What a reception!

442
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:22,584
- Which country are you from?
- Grenada.

443
00:29:23,352 --> 00:29:24,653
Oh, my.

444
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:30,193
Oh, my!

445
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,230
English, Mandarin, Cantonese.

446
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,334
First time away from home?

447
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,139
First time
away from home.

448
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,941
First time on a plane.

449
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:48,278
First time being so cold.

450
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:55,084
I'm the first black South African
to take part in Miss World.

451
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:57,220
I'm the first
Miss Grenada, too.

452
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:06,461
It must be...
very different.

453
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:10,966
Yes.

454
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,567
Very different.

455
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:13,835
Africa South?

456
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:16,939
I'm your chaperone.
I'm going to be looking after you.

457
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,309
No need to look so worried.
We're going to take very good care of you.

458
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,046
Everyone has to have
a chaperone.

459
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:25,315
A chaperone?
Why do I need a chaperone?

460
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:27,082
It's a Mecca requirement,
Miss Sweden,

461
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:30,086
as stipulated
by the contract you signed.

462
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:33,155
Mrs McKenzie is trained
to the highest standards.

463
00:30:33,256 --> 00:30:35,325
Come along now,
Miss Sweden.

464
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:38,293
- Up to measurements.
- I can walk, thank you.

465
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:40,128
I'll take your coat.

466
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:46,002
- No sticking out.
- I'm not.

467
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:47,136
Thirty five...

468
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,038
- Country?
- South Africa.

469
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:50,239
Thirty-three.

470
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,473
Twenty-seven.

471
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,643
- Country?
- Grenada.

472
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:54,711
Thirty-two.

473
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:00,716
- Country?
- Sweden.

474
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,418
Thirty-three.

475
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:05,587
Twenty-six.

476
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:09,358
Thirty-two.

477
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:12,695
Just a statutory
padding check, dear.

478
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:15,731
Next one, please.

479
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,034
- Country?
- United Kingdom.

480
00:31:18,134 --> 00:31:19,736
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-five.

481
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,770
- Thirty-three.
- Twenty-six.

482
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:23,773
- Twenty-six.
- Thirty-one.

483
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,517
You know, maybe things
are different in Sweden,

484
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:37,787
but you should try starting out
in Nowhere, Illinois.

485
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:42,258
I'm telling you, if I hadn't have won
a beauty pageant and kept on winning,

486
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:44,460
my life would have amounted
to jack shit.

487
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,697
The girl who wins this thing
is gonna take home $6,000,

488
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,267
maybe even earn 30 more.

489
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:54,370
Just accept that
the female of the species...

490
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,739
- Country?
- Grenada.

491
00:31:56,838 --> 00:32:00,409
...and the smart girl just has to
work out how to wiggle around them.

492
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:04,480
If being smart
is all it takes,

493
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:08,283
then how come no black girl
has ever won this competition?

494
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,553
Maybe sometimes
wiggling isn't enough.

495
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:17,759
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
imply that you couldn't win.

496
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:25,067
Nice big smiles. Teeth.

497
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,104
Nice tight bottoms.

498
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,442
So, ladies,
a big Mecca welcome to you all.

499
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,276
We're delighted to
have you with us.

500
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:37,480
Remember, you're the most
beautiful girls in the world.

501
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:39,448
- All right? Bring them in.
- Teeth.

502
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,467
- Look over here, love.
- Hello, London!

503
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:59,868
- Miss Sweden.
- Miss Sweden. Show us your legs.

504
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:01,737
- Miss Sweden.
- Go on, show us those blue eyes.

505
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:04,240
- Miss France!
- Miss Sweden, over here, love.

506
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:08,510
- Give us a smile, girl.
- Miss Sweden.

507
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,247
Give us a wink, love.
Over here.

508
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:14,783
Are you nervous or excited about
being the bookies' favourite?

509
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,452
Nervous?
Not particularly.

510
00:33:17,553 --> 00:33:19,222
- Miss UK.
- That's it, lovely.

511
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:20,423
Hello.

512
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:23,425
- Blow us a kiss.
- Yes, thank you. Clear a path, gents.

513
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:27,663
There we are.

514
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:29,831
How about an arm
around each other, girls?

515
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,270
So which one are you, love?

516
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:37,506
Well, I'm Miss South Africa,
and she's Miss...

517
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,346
I think you're Miss South Africa
and I'm Miss Africa South, aren't I?

518
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:46,314
Anti-apartheid
spokesmen are saying

519
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,283
South Africa should be banned
from the competition.

520
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:49,652
Where do you both stand
on that?

521
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:52,187
Back home, you wouldn't be
allowed in the same bus...

522
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:54,690
That's quite enough.
You know the rules.

523
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,858
Let's leave politics
to the politicians.

524
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,428
- It's a perfectly...
- Thank you.

525
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:02,331
For Pete's sake!
Show us your legs, Julia.

526
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:05,867
Oi, oi, oi, oi! She's the organising
director, you disrespectful little toad.

527
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:07,503
- It's a perfectly valid...
- Get him out.

528
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:10,472
- It's a valid question.
- Come on. Come on.

529
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:22,552
"Anti-apartheid campaigners
have described the decision

530
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:26,222
to include both a white and
black South African contestant

531
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:29,791
as a spineless attempt to
whitewash a monstrous regime."

532
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:32,928
Oh, that rag!
It's only fit for chips.

533
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:34,797
It's the same in all of them.

534
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:40,268
Which judges do we have so far?

535
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,338
Oh, Joan Collins,
Glen Campbell,

536
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:45,507
the executive from the BBC.

537
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:48,443
And... Oh, God,
that folksy Danish singer.

538
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:50,212
- What's her name?
- Nina.

539
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:57,386
You know, sometimes I think for
Eric it will forever be the 1950s.

540
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:01,724
Well...

541
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:06,796
I'm afraid we must
either adapt or die.

542
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,365
Right.

543
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:12,434
Anyone who thinks
this isn't a good idea?

544
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,869
- No.
- Anyone against?

545
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:17,439
What about trying to find some other
women's groups from out of town?

546
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:19,976
Definitely. The more the merrier.

547
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,844
Hazel Twort
from Peckham Rye.

548
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:25,748
We'd like to know which group
released this communiqué to the press.

549
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:28,250
I don't think it
came from our group.

550
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:34,289
Er... Jo Robinson,
Grosvenor Avenue.

551
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:36,724
We...

552
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,661
Well, we thought we'd get the message
out in advance, put us on the map.

553
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,430
We agreed
at the last meeting

554
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,566
to make the action at Miss
World a surprise happening.

555
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,635
You people
from Grosvenor Avenue,

556
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:48,671
you can't go around
making unilateral decisions.

557
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,375
We've a problem
with compliance.

558
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,849
Well, now the BBC want a spokesman to
represent our position on television.

559
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,985
Peckham Rye doesn't
have a spokesman.

560
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:04,987
And we don't engage
with the media, so...

561
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:11,360
Well, Sally Alexander, from the
Association of Student Leafleters.

562
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,628
She'll do it.

563
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:23,372
Right,
shall we get out of here?

564
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,309
- What the hell are you playing at?
- What?

565
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,077
- You wrote it.
- You printed it.

566
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:29,879
Well, no one else
is gonna do it.

567
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:31,980
You're the one who thinks
the media matters.

568
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:34,517
Doesn't mean that you can
volunteer me to go on television.

569
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:36,952
Don't be
so bloody spineless.

570
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:39,488
It was your idea.
Stand by it.

571
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:57,706
Well, I'm afraid after all
these exciting pastimes,

572
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:00,375
judging a beauty contest
may seem rather tame.

573
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:02,744
- Absolutely not.
- Mrs Morley?

574
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,547
Forgive my interruption.

575
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:08,951
Sir Eric Gairy,
the Prime Minister of Grenada.

576
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,119
Delighted to meet you,
Mr Prime Minister.

577
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,954
Gentlemen.

578
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:15,391
Please.

579
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:17,992
Since this is the first year

580
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:20,028
my country has taken part
in the competition,

581
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:22,498
I thought it rude
not to introduce myself.

582
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:25,467
And I must confess
to some curiosity,

583
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:28,003
seeing so charming a woman
in the Commonwealth Club.

584
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:30,740
There's no great mystery,
I can assure you.

585
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,908
I have the very pleasant task

586
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:35,577
of briefing
our three new judges.

587
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:37,980
The Ambassador of Indonesia,

588
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,148
His Excellency,
the High Commissioner of Malawi,

589
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:43,651
and His Royal Highness,
the Maharaja of Baroda.

590
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:48,123
You'll prove your critics wrong,
Mrs Morley.

591
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,126
Miss World does move
with the times.

592
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,161
- It does indeed.
- And just think,

593
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,530
if you were also to
appoint me as a judge,

594
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,934
you'd have representatives from
Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

595
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:04,572
What could be more progressive?

596
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,076
Indeed.

597
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:11,980
This way, please.

598
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:28,931
Take a seat here, please.
Thanks.

599
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,666
Lord Bly, Marjorie Jones.
Sally Alexander.

600
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,141
Do you think
you might be able to wangle

601
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,976
a couple of seats
for Miss World this year?

602
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:43,813
- Of course.
- I've taken a liking to Miss Sweden.

603
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:46,782
- Hello, Lord Bly.
- Robin.

604
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:48,083
Ladies.

605
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:51,219
Looking rather lovely,
if I may say.

606
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,889
We'll be going live
in ten seconds.

607
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,929
Well, my dear, you're certainly
kicking up a stink about something.

608
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,864
I simply don't understand
the problem.

609
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:05,233
Our objection isn't to the
women involved in Miss World.

610
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,669
So what exactly
is your objection?

611
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:09,538
Our objection
is not to the women.

612
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:11,239
You've already said that.
Answer the question.

613
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,510
Our objection is to the system
which accords value

614
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,246
solely on the basis of a culturally
imposed physical standard.

615
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,983
I don't even understand
what that means.

616
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,786
Maybe I'm just too pretty.

617
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:28,824
Beautiful girls have been
admired since time immemorial.

618
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:31,159
Women are not objects.
We are not ornaments.

619
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,162
We are not here for
the pleasure of others.

620
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:36,198
Sally's every bit
as pretty as her.

621
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:38,800
...saying they
should be outlawed?

622
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,672
What possible harm can there be
in a pretty girl displaying her charms?

623
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:47,842
A woman like Marjorie is not forced
to take part in these competitions.

624
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:49,678
She enters of her own free will.

625
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,980
Exactly. I think
you women's libbers

626
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:54,550
are just a bunch of killjoys

627
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,853
who wanna deny the public
a bit of innocent fun.

628
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,523
We are not attacking Marjorie
or any other contestant.

629
00:40:01,623 --> 00:40:06,094
We are protesting because this
competition symbolises our exploitation.

630
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,631
Why should Marjorie have to
earn her place in the world

631
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,199
by looking
a particular way?

632
00:40:10,298 --> 00:40:12,902
Why should I?
Why should any woman?

633
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,036
You don't. He doesn't.

634
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:17,840
Why should we?

635
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:21,744
Has she got a point?

636
00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:24,713
I don't deny
her sincerity,

637
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:28,651
but to demand that
Miss World be banned?

638
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:32,221
I mean, it's over-emotional,
puritanical nonsense.

639
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:35,791
The only other forum
in which participants

640
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,992
are weighed, measured
and publicly examined

641
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:41,896
before being assigned their
value is a cattle market.

642
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:45,099
A cattle market? Well,
that's an unappealing analogy.

643
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:09,023
- And we're off air.
- Very good. Thank you very much, everyone.

644
00:41:09,123 --> 00:41:10,959
- That went very well.
- Thank you, Robin.

645
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:14,730
Lord Bly and Miss Jones,
of course.

646
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,798
You did very well indeed.

647
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:18,333
It was extremely clear.

648
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,269
I really enjoyed my time
in the pageant.

649
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:22,371
I don't know what
she's talking about.

650
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:24,306
I'm sure everyone did
and enjoyed watching it.

651
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,108
Baffling.

652
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:32,847
This rehearsal is your
chance to get it right.

653
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:35,951
Because if you fall flat on your
face down this hole or that hole

654
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,886
on the night, the world
and his wife will be watching.

655
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:41,657
- Isn't that right, Clive?
- That is correct.

656
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:44,893
What I need you all to do now is
to make a line all along here,

657
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:48,163
all along the hall,
from A to Z.

658
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:51,634
Alphabetical order, please.
Come on, hurry, hurry.

659
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,036
Not on the stage, darling, please.
Get her off the stage, Clive.

660
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:56,971
- A, B, C. Alphabetical order.
- Around the edge of the stage.

661
00:41:57,072 --> 00:41:59,807
Come on, we've got a live show
in three days' time.

662
00:41:59,907 --> 00:42:01,275
- Herd 'em! Herd 'em!
- Keep moving.

663
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:04,046
- Herd them up. Herd them, Clive.
- Keep moving.

664
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,382
- I'm Grenada.
- G.

665
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:08,317
Clive,
have a look at Japan.

666
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,185
- Right, Japan, find the right space.
- Lovely. Straight line.

667
00:42:11,286 --> 00:42:12,721
Af...

668
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,190
Yugoslavia,
what are you doing up here?

669
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,159
That's A. Where does Y go?

670
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:19,360
Right at the back.
Let's get you down here.

671
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,132
Look at her go.
There we go.

672
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:27,702
F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P,
Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X...

673
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:29,771
Yugoslavia.
Thank you very much.

674
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:31,806
And through the portal.

675
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:34,843
Through the portal,
and smiling all the time.

676
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:37,379
Brazil!
Brazil, eyes on me, please.

677
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:39,447
Stop.
Or there will be accidents.

678
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:41,750
This is a treacherous stage.

679
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:43,751
Smile to camera 1.

680
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:45,119
Lovely smile.

681
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:47,689
The whole world is watching.

682
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:49,925
And walking.

683
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,126
And walking and walking,

684
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:53,828
and mind the step.

685
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:56,465
Keep smiling,
looking up, looking up.

686
00:42:56,565 --> 00:42:59,268
There we are.
And we stop here.

687
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,070
And we turn to camera two.

688
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,173
Where's camera two, Clive?

689
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:08,309
Where's camera two?
I'm telling her to turn to camera two.

690
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:12,047
There's no camera. Clive? I mean, come on.
It's not bloody rocket science.

691
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:15,784
Camera two. Where is it?
Can someone please find camera two?

692
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,784
- I'll stand in for...
- Chop, chop.

693
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,254
- She can smile at me.
- Clive's gonna stand in.

694
00:43:19,353 --> 00:43:20,655
Clive is camera two,
everyone.

695
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:24,793
Clive's standing in. Don't do that, Clive.
Don't do the hands thing.

696
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,429
Just stand there.
Don't do anything a camera wouldn't do.

697
00:43:27,528 --> 00:43:30,498
Maybe hold a two up so the
girls know it's a two, okay?

698
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,768
There we are.
So that's camera two.

699
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:34,235
Clive is camera two.

700
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:37,171
Give Clive a smile.
Keep smiling anywhere you like.

701
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:39,173
And back and back and back.

702
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:41,042
Mind the step. Good girl.
Good girl.

703
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:42,510
This is camera three.

704
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,813
This is camera three's
big derriere shot.

705
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,115
I'm going to get
some fresh air.

706
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:49,418
Oh, I'm afraid
you can't do that without me.

707
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:51,220
Miss Sweden?

708
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,123
My name is
Maj Christel Johansson.

709
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:55,990
Miss Johansson, please.

710
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,326
Just give me two minutes
while I get my bag.

711
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,195
This way. Step, step, step.

712
00:44:01,996 --> 00:44:03,965
Maj, it's Jennifer.

713
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:12,940
- You all right?
- Come on in.

714
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,917
You're so serene.

715
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:26,420
I mean, how do you put up
with this bullshit?

716
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:30,425
You are a very lucky person if you
think this is being treated badly.

717
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:36,164
After all,
you're the favourite to win.

718
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:40,168
I don't want to be the favourite
if this is what it gets me.

719
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:42,537
There's no point
swimming against the tide.

720
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:44,972
One just has to rise with it.

721
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:51,112
What do you do when you're
not being ordered around

722
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:53,182
by a funny Englishman
with strange hair?

723
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:57,385
I'm an air hostess.

724
00:44:57,485 --> 00:45:00,087
But my ambition
is to work in broadcasting.

725
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:02,857
For real?

726
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:06,228
Or just for them to say,
"Miss Grenada's ambition is..."

727
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:07,496
For real.

728
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:11,866
You'd be a good broadcaster.

729
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:13,836
You speak so nicely.

730
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,505
I was properly raised.

731
00:45:18,373 --> 00:45:21,175
My father's a lawyer
and my mother's a teacher.

732
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:26,315
"Elocution and deportment
matter, Jennifer."

733
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:32,920
I work as a model.

734
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,489
But I'd like to study.

735
00:45:36,456 --> 00:45:39,393
I thought with the prize money,
I could maybe come to England and...

736
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:43,264
But it's all just
people pushing you around

737
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:45,933
and flash bulbs in your face
the whole time.

738
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:50,272
Not so many flashbulbs
for me.

739
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:52,206
Like I said,
it's all bullshit.

740
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,545
I mean,
doesn't it make you angry?

741
00:45:58,045 --> 00:45:59,280
You know...

742
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:05,420
I think maybe...
it makes me more determined.

743
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,493
- Congratulations.
- Bloody hell, Clive.

744
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:15,429
Don't take it so seriously.
Just leave the crown.

745
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,332
Do you want me to adjust
the little clamp?

746
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:18,933
I'll do the clamp. Just...

747
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,422
Big smile on the face.

748
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:42,556
Gold crown on the head.

749
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:46,094
Walking down the catwalk,
minding the step, of course.

750
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:49,063
It's a bloody dream come true.

751
00:46:49,164 --> 00:46:52,601
Who would have believed it,
little me, Miss World?

752
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:54,536
And taking it all in.

753
00:46:54,635 --> 00:46:58,139
Un, deux, troi.

754
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:03,077
Uno, due... Crying if you like.
You will cry.

755
00:47:03,177 --> 00:47:05,713
Yes, yes, yes, I am she.

756
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:07,949
I am Miss World.

757
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,652
I am the one,
the beautiful one.

758
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:13,721
I am free. I am she.

759
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:16,258
Miss Miss World.

760
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:18,493
I like that uniform
of yours.

761
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:20,461
They should cut them
like that in the military.

762
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:23,431
We could dazzle the enemy
into submission.

763
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:25,467
Absolutely.

764
00:47:27,168 --> 00:47:29,338
You are funny, Mr Hope.

765
00:47:29,438 --> 00:47:31,974
No, I'm serious.
This man knows what I'm talking about.

766
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:33,575
Look at him. Him too.

767
00:47:33,675 --> 00:47:35,711
You know,
it's the funniest thing, Archie.

768
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:40,615
The last time
Bob guested on this show,

769
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:42,550
oh, it must ben
years ago now,

770
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:46,588
he brought the winning girl
home with him.

771
00:47:47,922 --> 00:47:52,427
Got it into his head he was going
to make a movie star out of her.

772
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:58,133
It turned out she didn't have
the least aptitude for it.

773
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:04,772
She's still in California,
as a matter of fact.

774
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:09,044
Though what she lives off,
Lord alone knows.

775
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:14,615
I suppose she found herself
a sugar daddy somewhere.

776
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,721
I'm sure she was grateful
for the break.

777
00:48:20,822 --> 00:48:22,457
I know I am.

778
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,059
How's my script coming,
Archie?

779
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,431
We were thinking we could make something
of the fact your folks were British,

780
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,400
you know, as an opener.

781
00:48:33,568 --> 00:48:35,670
"Of course,
I was born here in London.

782
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:38,139
You can probably tell
from the accent."

783
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:46,114
Idea is,
I'm supposed to be funny.

784
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:49,418
Let's try and keep it
that way, huh?

785
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:52,286
So, topics for your
dissertations.

786
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,489
How are you getting on?

787
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:57,192
No. No, sorry.

788
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:00,295
The Industrial Revolution
in Scotland.

789
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,065
Good choice.

790
00:49:03,164 --> 00:49:04,298
Sally?

791
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:06,134
I was thinking about
looking at it

792
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,369
from the point of view
of women workers.

793
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:11,072
Mm, it's a bit niche.

794
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:13,574
You might want to rethink.

795
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:16,211
Or at least refocus.

796
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:20,182
Er... sorry?
Re... Refocus how?

797
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:24,452
Er, perhaps broaden
the scope a little.

798
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:28,389
You know, I saw you on TV.

799
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:32,293
- Sally was on TV? Oh!
- Yeah.

800
00:49:32,393 --> 00:49:35,663
Interesting stuff, but don't let
it draw you into a cul-de-sac,

801
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,166
academically speaking.

802
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:42,304
Your subject needs to have
a genuine relevance.

803
00:49:42,403 --> 00:49:47,409
Best to steer clear
of more... minority interests.

804
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:51,712
Lawrence...

805
00:49:53,414 --> 00:49:55,784
you need to register
your topic by next week.

806
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:19,673
Right, that's loaded up.
All needs to go inside.

807
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,382
- Hiya.
- Sorry I'm late.

808
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:29,351
You haven't missed anything.

809
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:32,387
We've just been smoking and
watching, like in a heist film.

810
00:50:34,722 --> 00:50:37,592
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

811
00:50:39,226 --> 00:50:41,896
Well, there's obviously
something wrong.

812
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:43,764
Why don't you just say?

813
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:49,571
Turns out my seat at the table
is actually a high chair.

814
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,472
What,
and you're surprised?

815
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:08,789
- That's Eric Morley.
- Who?

816
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:10,592
Mr Miss World.

817
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,893
Is this gonna come forward?

818
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:14,795
The man who invented this
competition. That's his wife.

819
00:51:16,797 --> 00:51:20,302
On the night, this area will be
shut down, cordoned off, nice and secure.

820
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:24,306
We're making sure we keep
on top of every situation.

821
00:51:26,574 --> 00:51:29,244
We'd infiltrate
the theatre.

822
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:32,347
- I don't get what she's talking about.
- An unrehearsed happening.

823
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:34,883
- What does that mean?
- A planned invasion.

824
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:37,552
What do you mean, infiltrate?
Do you mean go inside?

825
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:40,255
Why not? That's where
the cameras will be.

826
00:51:40,355 --> 00:51:41,990
It's probably against the law,
for a start.

827
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,326
They're turning oppression
into a spectacle.

828
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:46,260
Let's make
a spectacle of our own.

829
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,895
We'd still demonstrate
outside?

830
00:51:47,996 --> 00:51:50,264
Of course. We'd just have
an action inside as well.

831
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:52,433
Who'd be prepared to go inside?

832
00:51:57,338 --> 00:52:00,375
Hold on. How do we actually
get in without being caught?

833
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:05,380
We'd buy tickets.

834
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,248
Unless that's too organised.

835
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:10,485
And you lot would...
you'd have to blend in.

836
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:22,364
Communal clothes.

837
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:26,001
- Whoo!
- Ow, wow!

838
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,271
- Oh, I love them.
- No. You look like a bag lady.

839
00:52:29,371 --> 00:52:31,573
What? I look like you.
It's what you're wearing.

840
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:34,942
This is your skirt.

841
00:52:35,043 --> 00:52:37,311
I think we're gonna win.

842
00:52:37,411 --> 00:52:38,879
I think we look great.

843
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,581
Look, just...
could you...

844
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:43,617
- She's getting serious.
- God, I can't breathe.

845
00:52:43,717 --> 00:52:44,786
Shoes.

846
00:52:45,985 --> 00:52:47,855
Oh, hello.

847
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,394
Ladylike.

848
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:57,831
I look
exactly like my mother.

849
00:52:57,931 --> 00:53:00,734
I look like
my mother's sofa.

850
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:03,905
I look like the kind of woman
I never, ever want to be.

851
00:53:04,005 --> 00:53:05,640
Perfect.

852
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:25,626
- What next?
- How about:

853
00:53:25,726 --> 00:53:28,797
"I'm not beautiful,
I'm not ugly, I'm angry"?

854
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:30,465
Yeah!

855
00:53:30,565 --> 00:53:31,800
Yay!

856
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,369
- Arriba!
- Thank you.

857
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,079
We're not beautiful!
We're not ugly!

858
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:49,116
We're angry!

859
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:06,067
I can go lower if you like.

860
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:22,684
This is so nice.

861
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:23,718
I know.

862
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:26,788
Sometimes I can't believe
it's really happening.

863
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:31,860
I'm a machinist
in a shoe factory.

864
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,429
And when the boss came to say
that I was going to London,

865
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:38,700
everyone on the shop floor
was cheering.

866
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:42,403
Standing up and cheering.

867
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:45,974
Now I'm here.

868
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:53,180
Will it be hard,
going back?

869
00:54:56,617 --> 00:54:58,887
I can't talk about that.

870
00:54:58,987 --> 00:55:01,755
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

871
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:07,996
The authorities warned me.

872
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,934
They said
if I talk about home...

873
00:55:14,568 --> 00:55:16,137
...they won't let me back.

874
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:20,108
I won't get to see
my parents again.

875
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:24,746
- What?
- Before I got on the plane,

876
00:55:24,846 --> 00:55:26,981
they showed me
all these photographs

877
00:55:27,081 --> 00:55:30,084
of people I'm supposed
to have nothing to do with.

878
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:32,120
What kind of people?

879
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:35,956
Certain journalists.
A man called Peter Hain.

880
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,858
Political people.

881
00:55:42,862 --> 00:55:44,531
Home is home.

882
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:47,735
I want to see
my parents again.

883
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:53,007
Sorry.

884
00:55:55,909 --> 00:56:00,114
Maybe home will be different
if you're Miss World.

885
00:56:04,985 --> 00:56:08,690
We're not going
to be Miss World.

886
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:11,893
Girls,
you wanna dance a salsa?

887
00:56:11,992 --> 00:56:14,496
Pearl, Jennifer,
we're gonna dance the salsa.

888
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:15,963
Come on. Come and dance.

889
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,132
All together.

890
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:22,537
And one step forward,
one step back.

891
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:48,929
Uh... uh.

892
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,101
A little Cupid bow lip.

893
00:56:54,635 --> 00:56:55,637
Perfect.

894
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:57,704
Now, what do you think?

895
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:01,174
Oh, my.

896
00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:03,677
Glamorous lady.

897
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:07,048
Let's get your hair back.

898
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:10,684
Sorry. Sorry, I know,
I'm really late.

899
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,657
- What are you still doing up?
- Look at my face.

900
00:57:16,757 --> 00:57:18,960
She didn't want to go to bed
until she'd seen you.

901
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:21,695
Mum, you've put lipstick
on her.

902
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:24,731
- Granny says you're very naughty.
- I'm really sorry.

903
00:57:24,831 --> 00:57:27,335
What if I hadn't been here?
What if I'd had plans?

904
00:57:27,434 --> 00:57:31,172
Mum, I really appreciate everything you do.
I am so sorry.

905
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:35,143
All this whining and complaining
about the patriarchy.

906
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:38,179
Other girls are perfectly
happy as they are.

907
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:40,847
Well, I'm not a girl.
I'm a woman.

908
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:44,117
For heaven's sake, Sally.
Look at yourself.

909
00:57:44,217 --> 00:57:46,086
Divorced,
living in chaos,

910
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:48,755
and spending every spare hour
you've got campaigning.

911
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,960
What normal woman
would choose to live like you?

912
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:54,895
Abi, could you go and put your pyjamas
on, please, and wash that off your face?

913
00:57:54,996 --> 00:57:57,065
I'll be in in a minute.
Thank you.

914
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:00,968
And while you're off
with your fanatics,

915
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:04,038
Gareth and I are looking
after your daughter.

916
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:05,973
Seems to me
liberation just means

917
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:08,710
getting someone else
to do your job for you.

918
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:11,378
So it's all right one half of
the world has all the power,

919
00:58:11,478 --> 00:58:14,081
- and the other half just has to lump it?
- Don't be so melodramatic.

920
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:16,149
Don't be so blind.

921
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,385
You couldn't even get a bank
account without Dad's permission.

922
00:58:18,485 --> 00:58:20,355
The doctor wouldn't give you
birth control.

923
00:58:20,454 --> 00:58:23,324
That was one bank manager
and one doctor.

924
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:26,059
Just because you swallowed it
doesn't mean I have to.

925
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,763
Do you know what really
makes me laugh about all this?

926
00:58:29,864 --> 00:58:34,068
You fighting for women's rights when
you always took your father's side.

927
00:58:34,168 --> 00:58:37,704
"When I grow up,
I want to be like Daddy."

928
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:39,406
That's because
he did things.

929
00:58:39,507 --> 00:58:42,710
He smoked cigarettes and went
in taxis and had adventures.

930
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:46,279
- I wanted to have adventures.
- I'm sorry that you found me so dull.

931
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,317
I didn't find you dull.
You were just trapped.

932
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:53,286
You were trapped in a restrictive,
poky little domestic world,

933
00:58:53,387 --> 00:58:55,657
with no aspiration
and no opportunity.

934
00:58:55,757 --> 00:58:57,858
Of course I didn't
want to be you.

935
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:00,360
Nobody should have to be you.
That's the point.

936
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:09,436
And what would have happened
to you and your sisters

937
00:59:09,536 --> 00:59:12,706
if I'd thought like you,
if I'd done what you're doing?

938
00:59:12,806 --> 00:59:16,276
Neglected my poky little
domestic world,

939
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:19,212
neglected my marriage,
neglected my children?

940
00:59:24,251 --> 00:59:27,789
You think you can have the same
freedoms as a man, but you can't.

941
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:30,458
You can't.

942
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:49,496
- Yeah?
- Mr Morley?

943
01:01:49,597 --> 01:01:51,465
We've got
a situation, sir.

944
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:54,534
Anarchists have attacked one
of the vans outside the venue.

945
01:01:54,635 --> 01:01:56,938
- What's that?
- Anarchists.

946
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:01,442
Mr Morley? Sir?

947
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:04,311
Well, if the anarchists wanna have a
pop, they can join the bloody queue.

948
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:06,246
But they'll have to
get through me first.

949
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:11,052
Anarchists?

950
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:16,190
- She's sleeping.
- Sal. Sal.

951
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:18,558
- What?
- Something's happened.

952
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,530
There's been a bomb
outside the theatre.

953
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:26,099
So...

954
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,369
there's gonna be more security,
more police.

955
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:35,476
I'm so sorry.

956
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:37,545
About what?

957
01:02:37,644 --> 01:02:40,981
Well, that you're gonna
have to call it off.

958
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:44,652
Well, no.

959
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:48,221
No. Erm... Well,
we'll just be more careful.

960
01:02:49,422 --> 01:02:50,590
Careful?

961
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,628
It was a bomb.

962
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,930
Yes, I understand that.

963
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,301
If anything kicks off,
the authorities aren't gonna muck about.

964
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,003
What if you get arrested?

965
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:05,438
The university
will just chuck you out.

966
01:03:06,306 --> 01:03:08,675
- What about Abi?
- It's not your decision.

967
01:03:08,775 --> 01:03:10,911
No, but you know
bloody well I'm right.

968
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:51,018
Yeah, coming.

969
01:03:54,021 --> 01:03:57,358
Oh. Blimey, you're early.
Come in.

970
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,095
- Do you want a brew? I just put the kettle on.
- Jo, I...

971
01:04:01,195 --> 01:04:03,998
They're ramping up security at the theatre.
Somebody planted a...

972
01:04:04,097 --> 01:04:07,500
Bomb, yeah, we heard.
It was The Angry Brigade.

973
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:11,137
Well, it's not gonna change
anything for us, though, is it?

974
01:04:11,237 --> 01:04:13,540
We're not gonna let
their actions scupper ours.

975
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:22,349
Oh, I see.

976
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:27,021
What, has it got
a bit too risky now, has it?

977
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:29,256
A bit too much like
the real thing?

978
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:31,559
I... I came to warn you.

979
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,494
But seeing as
you already know.

980
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:42,003
Don't worry.
Go and bugger off home.

981
01:04:42,103 --> 01:04:44,238
Leave it to us to make sure your
daughter doesn't have to grow up

982
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,706
in the same shitty world
we did.

983
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:48,208
But just remember, right,
you get the world you deserve,

984
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:51,278
and if you don't fight,
you deserve the world you fucking get.

985
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:10,231
- It wasn't in the venue itself.
- No, Julia.

986
01:05:10,331 --> 01:05:13,666
I don't need any hand-holding, damn it.
I just...

987
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:17,471
Hell, I just wanna know you people
aren't gonna screw this thing up again.

988
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:21,107
Where's Eric in all this?
Where's your husband?

989
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,045
- Actually, I thought...
- I read there were protests planned.

990
01:05:24,144 --> 01:05:27,047
Were you gonna mention that,
or did you figure they'd be more fun

991
01:05:27,148 --> 01:05:28,749
if they came as a surprise?

992
01:05:31,184 --> 01:05:34,188
We're not beautiful!
We're not ugly!

993
01:05:34,288 --> 01:05:36,389
We're angry!

994
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:39,692
We're not beautiful!
We're not ugly!

995
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:42,396
We're angry!

996
01:05:42,496 --> 01:05:45,298
We're not beautiful!
We're not ugly!

997
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:48,301
There we go, Mandy.
I'm gonna give you your medicine.

998
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:54,809
There we go, Mr Teddy.
Do you feel better now?

999
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:59,079
Now I'm gonna
bandage you up.

1000
01:06:10,523 --> 01:06:14,761
Does your arm hurt a little bit?
It's a very long bandage.

1001
01:06:47,226 --> 01:06:49,329
I just want you to be safe.

1002
01:06:50,429 --> 01:06:51,698
- I know.
- Sal...

1003
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:53,166
I know.

1004
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,480
Eric Morley
is king of the cattle market!

1005
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:12,286
Beauty contests
degrade women!

1006
01:07:15,288 --> 01:07:18,259
We're not beautiful!
We're not ugly!

1007
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:19,559
Equality for women!

1008
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:25,231
Down to apartheid!

1009
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,903
Shame on you! Shame on you!

1010
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,604
Jobs for women as people!

1011
01:07:30,704 --> 01:07:32,873
We're not beautiful!
We're not ugly!

1012
01:07:32,972 --> 01:07:34,875
- Shame on you!
- We want equality!

1013
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:39,179
We want equality now!
We want equality now!

1014
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:42,917
Judge the judges,
not the women!

1015
01:07:48,021 --> 01:07:50,758
You're being exploited!

1016
01:07:52,592 --> 01:07:55,762
You're being exploited!

1017
01:07:55,862 --> 01:07:59,432
End this shameful
cattle market!

1018
01:08:05,704 --> 01:08:09,275
So this is the eye
of the revolution, huh?

1019
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,612
My God.

1020
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:13,980
Up close,
it sure is revolting.

1021
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:16,417
We want liberation!

1022
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,396
Over here, miss.

1023
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:32,432
- Open your bag, please.
- They're checking bags.

1024
01:08:33,432 --> 01:08:34,868
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1025
01:08:34,967 --> 01:08:36,604
Everything all right?

1026
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:38,639
Everything running
like clockwork, sir.

1027
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:40,940
- Hello there.
- Thank you.

1028
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:43,482
Miss? Miss? I need to
check your bag, please.

1029
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:45,512
Here's my bag.

1030
01:08:45,612 --> 01:08:48,949
Before anyone sees.
You need this one as well, okay?

1031
01:08:49,048 --> 01:08:50,850
Miss?

1032
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:52,786
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

1033
01:08:55,788 --> 01:08:57,625
Quick, give me my ticket.

1034
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:00,594
- No.
- What?

1035
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:03,931
Why should I?
You already let us down once.

1036
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,532
Well, I c...

1037
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:07,500
I told the usher
that you've got it.

1038
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,836
So, tell him you lost it
and then sod off.

1039
01:09:09,936 --> 01:09:11,704
We can't risk you
ballsing this up.

1040
01:09:11,805 --> 01:09:14,775
You are the one ballsing this up.
He's coming, and if he gets here,

1041
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,710
he's gonna search you,
he's gonna search me.

1042
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:21,815
We're so sorry.

1043
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,754
- Thank you. Have a good evening.
- Thank you very much.

1044
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:30,291
- Idiot.
- Individualist.

1045
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,962
Almost 30
years after the coronation,

1046
01:09:36,063 --> 01:09:39,667
the eyes of the world are
once more focused on London

1047
01:09:39,766 --> 01:09:42,302
and the dream of a crown.

1048
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:48,308
Fifty of the most beautiful
girls from across the globe

1049
01:09:48,408 --> 01:09:52,078
are arriving here tonight,
knowing that one of them will go home

1050
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:54,782
as Miss World 1970.

1051
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:56,983
North, south,
east, west,

1052
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,752
who's the girl
we love the best?

1053
01:09:59,853 --> 01:10:01,922
Whatever the outcome,
one thing is certain:

1054
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:06,559
One of these beauties is going to
become the luckiest girl in the world.

1055
01:10:11,564 --> 01:10:13,733
I think I'm supposed
to be Britannia.

1056
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:16,470
I wonder if Britannia's
a goddess. Or maybe

1057
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:19,672
she's just a symbol,
like the British bulldog.

1058
01:10:19,773 --> 01:10:22,476
At least they didn't dress me up
as Churchill.

1059
01:10:29,748 --> 01:10:33,886
Maybe if I just have it over the
eye, like Veronica Lake.

1060
01:10:36,155 --> 01:10:37,957
Oh, why?

1061
01:10:38,057 --> 01:10:39,760
I think it looks cute.

1062
01:10:41,728 --> 01:10:43,663
Hear that?

1063
01:10:43,764 --> 01:10:46,132
Someone always wants
to rain on your parade.

1064
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:47,900
What are you meant to be?

1065
01:10:49,702 --> 01:10:51,070
A nutmeg princess.

1066
01:10:51,171 --> 01:10:54,007
Oh. I thought you were a tree.

1067
01:10:56,475 --> 01:11:00,580
Bob Hope is coming!

1068
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,583
This way, Mr Hope.
Can I just say what an honour it is...

1069
01:11:03,684 --> 01:11:05,753
Hello, ladies. How are you?

1070
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:07,421
Hi.

1071
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,689
What is this,
the waiting room?

1072
01:11:09,789 --> 01:11:12,760
- Mr Hope.
- How are you, girls? How are you?

1073
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:15,461
- USA.
- Yes.

1074
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,603
Okay, everyone.

1075
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:25,072
Standing by to go live.

1076
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:26,539
In ten...

1077
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,108
nine...

1078
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:33,113
eight, seven...

1079
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:35,682
six,

1080
01:11:35,782 --> 01:11:36,984
five...

1081
01:11:47,025 --> 01:11:48,996
Good evening,
or good morning,

1082
01:11:49,095 --> 01:11:51,864
depending on which part of the
planet you are tuning in from,

1083
01:11:51,965 --> 01:11:55,802
and welcome to
Miss World 1970.

1084
01:12:05,677 --> 01:12:07,648
That's it. Hurry, hurry.
Come on.

1085
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:10,183
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

1086
01:12:12,018 --> 01:12:14,755
This parade of
international female perfection

1087
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:18,524
is even more of a male pulse
racer than ever before.

1088
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:22,128
Astronauts can go to the moon and
fetch back prime lumps of rock,

1089
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:24,498
but they won't find
anything to equal

1090
01:12:24,597 --> 01:12:26,899
these treasures
of good old Earth.

1091
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,904
And there's no need to look any further
than here tonight for heavenly forms.

1092
01:12:31,003 --> 01:12:34,608
Who from this stunning line-up
will be named

1093
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:36,676
Miss Magnificent?

1094
01:12:42,748 --> 01:12:45,551
It may not be rocket science,
but it's certainly going to be

1095
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:48,087
a difficult decision
for our judges.

1096
01:12:48,188 --> 01:12:50,190
And for all of you
watching at home.

1097
01:12:56,061 --> 01:12:59,867
Holland. Japan!
Japan, stop pushing. Japan!

1098
01:12:59,966 --> 01:13:03,135
- Where's... Come on, Mexico! ¡Arriba!
- Ssh, ssh!

1099
01:13:05,805 --> 01:13:07,974
I think we know
the audience's favourite.

1100
01:13:08,074 --> 01:13:10,277
Listen to that applause.

1101
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,716
- Off, off, off.
- Tonight, Planet Earth

1102
01:13:16,817 --> 01:13:19,286
has just one thing
on its mind:

1103
01:13:19,386 --> 01:13:24,258
girls, girls, girls,
girls, girls.

1104
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,927
Bloody Yugoslavia!

1105
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,762
- Come on. Yugoslavia, please.
- Catch up.

1106
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:31,899
Please, darling.
We haven't got time for this.

1107
01:13:38,604 --> 01:13:42,275
As we were enjoying the national
costume parade, the judges...

1108
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,011
First-round selection.

1109
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:45,546
...selection
for the final 15.

1110
01:13:45,645 --> 01:13:48,849
USA, Australia,
Ceylon, Ecuador...

1111
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,920
Ecuador?

1112
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,222
Ecuador?
Where's Ecuador?

1113
01:13:55,322 --> 01:13:56,757
Try Malta.

1114
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,697
We'll be seeing the girls
in evening gowns,

1115
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:07,300
and then it's a quick change
into swimwear.

1116
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,237
So any ladies planning to lock
their husbands in the cellar

1117
01:14:10,337 --> 01:14:13,307
before the bathing suits make an
appearance, hold off just a little longer.

1118
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:18,679
- I can't believe it.
- Just turn it around.

1119
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:26,820
- We made it!
- Ssh, ssh!

1120
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,724
We started the
evening with more than 50 girls

1121
01:14:30,823 --> 01:14:32,291
hoping to become Miss World.

1122
01:14:32,391 --> 01:14:34,126
We now have 15.

1123
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:43,604
And, ladies and gentlemen,
if your favourite isn't among them,

1124
01:14:43,703 --> 01:14:46,139
time to get a new favourite.

1125
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,843
First, number one,
Miss Africa South, Pearl Jansen.

1126
01:15:08,427 --> 01:15:10,396
Pah!

1127
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:13,967
This is
your five-minute call, Mr Hope.

1128
01:15:14,067 --> 01:15:15,902
We're about to go to swimwear.

1129
01:15:16,002 --> 01:15:18,972
My favourite
destination.

1130
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:22,643
Sandra is a hazel-eyed blonde
and works as a model.

1131
01:15:22,743 --> 01:15:27,180
Her measurements are
36-22-36.

1132
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:30,751
Oh, good.
An English speaker.

1133
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,385
You do speak English,
don't you?

1134
01:15:32,485 --> 01:15:34,354
I certainly hope so.

1135
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:38,024
Well, I'm sure the audience will
agree you do it very charmingly.

1136
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:42,261
Next, number 21,
Miss Grenada, Jennifer Hosten.

1137
01:15:42,362 --> 01:15:43,997
Go on, Jennifer!

1138
01:15:44,096 --> 01:15:48,001
Miss Grenada is 22
and works as an air hostess.

1139
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:51,137
She has brown eyes
and black hair,

1140
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:56,443
and her measurements are
34-25-36.

1141
01:15:56,542 --> 01:15:59,011
I'm sure it's a wonderful life
being an air hostess,

1142
01:15:59,112 --> 01:16:02,082
but do you have
any other ambitions?

1143
01:16:02,181 --> 01:16:06,452
Actually, I've always wanted
to work in broadcasting.

1144
01:16:06,552 --> 01:16:08,255
Sounds as if
you're after my job.

1145
01:16:08,354 --> 01:16:10,389
Perhaps you should be
interviewing me.

1146
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:12,759
- I'd love to.
- On second thoughts,

1147
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:16,730
you look like the sort of person
who might get my secrets out of me.

1148
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:20,367
So before I give away too much, perhaps
it's time for you to join the others.

1149
01:16:20,466 --> 01:16:23,969
- Quite a girl, wouldn't you say?
- Our final 15 contestants.

1150
01:16:25,572 --> 01:16:27,841
- ¡Arriba!
- Come on, girls.

1151
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,341
Feeding tune.

1152
01:16:29,442 --> 01:16:31,778
That's it. Line up here
so they can see you.

1153
01:16:31,877 --> 01:16:35,014
That's it.
I think we're all here.

1154
01:16:35,114 --> 01:16:37,184
And a lovely line-up
it is too.

1155
01:16:37,283 --> 01:16:40,019
As you all know,
there are two sides to every question,

1156
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:42,354
and this is your chance
to see both of them.

1157
01:16:42,454 --> 01:16:44,291
Girls, if you could
please turn.

1158
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:00,873
Wait till
the girls are off stage.

1159
01:17:24,997 --> 01:17:27,334
Lovely though that view is,
please turn back.

1160
01:17:29,969 --> 01:17:32,838
And now, ladies, if you don't
mind, it's time to lead off.

1161
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:47,521
We've seen a lot of hope
in this auditorium here tonight.

1162
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,523
And we're about
to see some more,

1163
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:52,391
because while the judges
select their final seven,

1164
01:17:52,492 --> 01:17:55,128
here is the man
you've all been waiting for.

1165
01:17:55,228 --> 01:17:57,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Bob Hope.

1166
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,191
Thank you.

1167
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,027
Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

1168
01:18:27,127 --> 01:18:30,330
It is so nice to be here.

1169
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:33,900
I don't know about you, but I've had
about enough of these women libbers

1170
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,203
claiming that this is nothing
more than a cattle market.

1171
01:18:37,304 --> 01:18:40,472
Talk about milking a grievance.

1172
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:42,342
Oh, moo!

1173
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:46,011
But, really,
as far as I'm concerned,

1174
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:47,913
it goes in one ear
and out the other.

1175
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:52,219
The real reason that I'm here
is we take Miss World

1176
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:56,022
down to our Christmas show
in Vietnam every single year.

1177
01:18:56,122 --> 01:19:00,427
It's a great morale booster.
And at my age, I need it.

1178
01:19:02,194 --> 01:19:03,996
I do love the girls
we have here tonight.

1179
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:06,198
Beautiful girls here.
All so lovely.

1180
01:19:06,298 --> 01:19:08,167
I love these ladies,
in fact.

1181
01:19:08,268 --> 01:19:10,302
I don't want you to think
I'm some kind of brute

1182
01:19:10,403 --> 01:19:13,506
that doesn't consider the
feelings of women, of course.

1183
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:16,175
I consider feeling women
all the time.

1184
01:19:18,078 --> 01:19:19,246
Fuck this.

1185
01:19:19,345 --> 01:19:21,180
No, but I would say
that about two...

1186
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,416
Shame on you, Bob Hope!

1187
01:19:31,157 --> 01:19:32,958
Shame on you!

1188
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,261
Ladies and...

1189
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:47,172
- Shame on you!
- Ssh.

1190
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:51,944
- Shame on you!
- Shame on you!

1191
01:19:52,045 --> 01:19:53,380
Shame on you!

1192
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:56,548
- This is out of control.
- Stay where you are.

1193
01:19:57,682 --> 01:19:59,653
Please... Ladies, please.

1194
01:20:02,087 --> 01:20:03,389
Yeah!

1195
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:10,563
Hey, you! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1196
01:20:10,662 --> 01:20:12,631
Get out of it.

1197
01:20:12,731 --> 01:20:15,167
Stop that! Stop it! Stop!

1198
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:21,474
Shame on you!

1199
01:20:25,011 --> 01:20:27,113
Where's Neville?
Neville?

1200
01:20:27,212 --> 01:20:29,481
Where's Neville?
Where's Neville?

1201
01:20:29,582 --> 01:20:31,384
Liberation for women!

1202
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:35,654
I'm on my bloody own here,
Roger! Answer!

1203
01:20:45,698 --> 01:20:47,100
Neville!

1204
01:20:51,537 --> 01:20:53,039
Get those away!

1205
01:20:55,507 --> 01:20:59,412
Neville! Running around
like a bloody headless chicken!

1206
01:20:59,511 --> 01:21:02,581
Tell them to pull the plug!
We can't broadcast this shambles!

1207
01:21:02,681 --> 01:21:05,318
Right away, Mr Morley.

1208
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:07,386
Come on. Come.

1209
01:21:11,256 --> 01:21:12,524
I'm so sorry, Michael.

1210
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:37,550
Get off! That hurts me!
That hurts me!

1211
01:21:37,649 --> 01:21:39,018
Let her go!

1212
01:21:43,122 --> 01:21:44,657
Get her out of here!

1213
01:22:07,212 --> 01:22:09,416
Make an announcement.
We're going off air.

1214
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,623
We do apologise,
ladies and gentlemen.

1215
01:22:16,722 --> 01:22:20,126
Proceedings here have been
temporarily interrupted.

1216
01:22:20,225 --> 01:22:22,628
But we'll be back with you
very shortly.

1217
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,184
Fascist pig,
doing Mecca's dirty work.

1218
01:22:44,283 --> 01:22:45,717
Have you got a thought
of your own?

1219
01:22:45,818 --> 01:22:48,488
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1220
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:51,190
Do you think your mum would be proud
of you, the way you're treating women?

1221
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:54,752
Get off! It's our bodies,
our right to protest!

1222
01:22:58,463 --> 01:23:00,100
Oh, the mess.

1223
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:16,782
Ladies and gentlemen,

1224
01:23:16,882 --> 01:23:20,853
I am pleased to announce that
everything is now under control...

1225
01:23:20,953 --> 01:23:22,855
It's still on!
It's still on.

1226
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:25,125
...and normal service
will resume.

1227
01:23:27,426 --> 01:23:32,498
Please give a warm hand
to a very brave man.

1228
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:34,801
That's you, Mr Hope.

1229
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,402
Very brave man.

1230
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,913
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just wanna say

1231
01:23:47,012 --> 01:23:51,184
that any type of person
that would try to destroy

1232
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:53,619
such a joyous occasion
as this one,

1233
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,856
upset all of these young ladies
back here, well,

1234
01:23:56,956 --> 01:24:00,226
as far as I'm concerned,
they just gotta be sick in the head.

1235
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:10,703
And the finalists tonight are, in
alphabetical order, ladies and gentlemen:

1236
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:15,474
Miss Africa South,
Pearl Jansen.

1237
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:23,650
Also joining her on the stage,
Miss Brazil, Sônia Yara Guerra.

1238
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:29,221
Number three, Miss Grenada,
Jennifer Hosten.

1239
01:24:30,421 --> 01:24:32,724
Miss Israel, Irith Lavi.

1240
01:24:34,525 --> 01:24:36,695
Miss South Africa
will be with us tonight,

1241
01:24:36,796 --> 01:24:38,565
Jillian Elizabeth Jessup.

1242
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:44,203
Miss Sweden,
Marjorie Christel Johansson.

1243
01:24:46,572 --> 01:24:49,442
And finally,
you'll be very happy to know,

1244
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,277
from the United Kingdom here,

1245
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:53,780
Yvonne Anne Ormes
will be with us.

1246
01:24:58,951 --> 01:25:00,520
Oh, shoot.

1247
01:25:01,787 --> 01:25:03,890
If your nerves
are suffering...

1248
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:05,625
I know mine are...

1249
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:07,927
spare a thought
for our seven lovely finalists,

1250
01:25:08,027 --> 01:25:12,497
waiting now with the eyes
of the world upon them.

1251
01:25:18,703 --> 01:25:23,609
As is customary, we shall reveal
the results in reverse order.

1252
01:25:25,877 --> 01:25:28,614
In third place,
Miss Israel, Irith Lavi.

1253
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,453
In second place...

1254
01:25:33,552 --> 01:25:36,021
Miss Africa South,
Pearl Jansen.

1255
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,737
Miss World 1970...

1256
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:56,676
is Miss Grenada.

1257
01:26:02,948 --> 01:26:04,884
Congratulations.

1258
01:26:06,018 --> 01:26:07,587
Congratulations.

1259
01:26:38,015 --> 01:26:40,319
- Jennifer!
- Whoo!

1260
01:26:54,832 --> 01:26:57,569
And if anyone's got any bright
ideas about what I should say

1261
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:01,039
to the BBC's director general when he
calls, then feel free to share them!

1262
01:27:04,176 --> 01:27:08,481
If you girls think this is the way
forward, then God help us all!

1263
01:27:08,581 --> 01:27:10,449
Excuse me!

1264
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:19,892
I'm really sorry.
I really need to use the ladies'.

1265
01:27:36,641 --> 01:27:38,877
Sorry, I...

1266
01:27:38,978 --> 01:27:41,047
Oh. Er...

1267
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,149
You won.

1268
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:52,792
I thought if I could get a moment
alone, it might just sink in.

1269
01:27:54,659 --> 01:27:55,795
Wow.

1270
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,565
Congratulations.

1271
01:28:04,136 --> 01:28:06,172
I don't think
you mean that.

1272
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,411
It's not you
we're angry at.

1273
01:28:12,511 --> 01:28:13,746
It really isn't.

1274
01:28:14,746 --> 01:28:16,114
I saw you.

1275
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,819
You were on the television.

1276
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,989
You know,

1277
01:28:23,088 --> 01:28:26,893
there will be little girls
watching tonight

1278
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:30,763
who'll see themselves
differently because I won.

1279
01:28:33,532 --> 01:28:36,135
Who might just start to believe
that you don't have to be white

1280
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:38,203
to have a place
in the world.

1281
01:28:40,972 --> 01:28:43,475
I'm glad.

1282
01:28:43,576 --> 01:28:46,813
I... I really hope
that the world opens up

1283
01:28:46,912 --> 01:28:48,480
for them and for you.

1284
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:54,753
But making us compete with each
other over the way we look...

1285
01:28:57,154 --> 01:29:00,460
doesn't that make the world
narrower for all of us in the end?

1286
01:29:06,131 --> 01:29:07,867
What's your name?

1287
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,235
Sally.

1288
01:29:11,869 --> 01:29:13,805
Well, Sally...

1289
01:29:15,573 --> 01:29:17,643
all I can say is,

1290
01:29:17,743 --> 01:29:20,613
I look forward to having
your choices in life.

1291
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:23,582
Come on. You've had long enough.

1292
01:29:23,682 --> 01:29:26,886
I'm really sorry
if you were offended in any...

1293
01:29:26,985 --> 01:29:29,154
Time to go. Come on.
Move, move!

1294
01:29:29,255 --> 01:29:31,090
Please, be careful!

1295
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:32,190
Move!

1296
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:33,860
Don't hurt her!

1297
01:29:40,765 --> 01:29:44,636
I only came down
cos I heard it on the radio.

1298
01:29:44,737 --> 01:29:46,939
I left the baby
with a neighbour.

1299
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:22,073
Christ,
you saw what happened.

1300
01:30:22,173 --> 01:30:24,911
The whole world
saw what happened. It...

1301
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:33,719
If you're looking for someone to kiss
it better, try calling Miss World 1961.

1302
01:30:34,853 --> 01:30:36,889
3:00 pm California time.

1303
01:30:36,988 --> 01:30:41,192
- She should be up and about by now.
- Not now, Dol.

1304
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,728
Just...

1305
01:30:44,395 --> 01:30:47,065
I don't...
I don't know what I did wrong.

1306
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,945
Is anyone dead? Hmm?

1307
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,649
Did we lose a war?

1308
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:06,652
No.

1309
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:09,288
Well, then.

1310
01:31:11,155 --> 01:31:14,260
Tonight may be
the start of something, Bob,

1311
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:17,262
but it isn't the end of
anything, certainly not you.

1312
01:31:18,863 --> 01:31:20,699
People love you.

1313
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,835
Nothing's gonna change that.

1314
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:36,247
Dol?
Dol, where you going?

1315
01:31:39,317 --> 01:31:43,122
I'm gonna find myself a quiet little
club somewhere and get a drink.

1316
01:31:44,956 --> 01:31:47,693
Maybe even sing a little.
Who knows?

1317
01:31:50,395 --> 01:31:52,365
Don't worry, Bob.
I'll be back.

1318
01:31:53,832 --> 01:31:55,334
I always come back.

1319
01:32:01,472 --> 01:32:03,676
Those crazy women, huh?

1320
01:32:36,373 --> 01:32:39,811
They kept asking about the bomb.
They think we're part of the Angry Brigade.

1321
01:32:39,912 --> 01:32:43,215
- It's just scare tactics.
- They're talking about charges: affray, assault...

1322
01:32:43,314 --> 01:32:45,083
Sally, they're just
trying to rattle us.

1323
01:32:47,196 --> 01:32:50,256
Listen, nothing's changed.

1324
01:32:50,355 --> 01:32:52,724
We were having a shit time
because of the patriarchy,

1325
01:32:52,824 --> 01:32:55,894
and we're still having a shit
time because of the patriarchy.

1326
01:32:55,994 --> 01:32:58,064
It's just a bit more obvious
in here.

1327
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:04,836
They went easy on me
cos I told them I was pregnant.

1328
01:33:07,372 --> 01:33:08,774
Are you?

1329
01:33:13,545 --> 01:33:15,381
As a matter of fact, yes.

1330
01:33:17,282 --> 01:33:18,784
Three months.

1331
01:33:21,019 --> 01:33:22,488
Are you all right?

1332
01:33:26,457 --> 01:33:27,926
Are you?

1333
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,133
When I was trying
to get away,

1334
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,302
this copper,
he just threw himself at me.

1335
01:33:38,435 --> 01:33:41,206
And I, er, hit the ground
really hard.

1336
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:45,478
Are you in pain?

1337
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:48,047
- I really don't know.
- Any bleeding?

1338
01:33:48,146 --> 01:33:50,315
I've got bruised knees.

1339
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:53,252
In about six months,
you'll be dreaming of bruised knees.

1340
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:58,423
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1341
01:33:59,957 --> 01:34:02,427
Who's the father?

1342
01:34:04,162 --> 01:34:06,431
Sally, you're hilarious.

1343
01:34:06,532 --> 01:34:10,502
Even in a prison cell, you're the
most bourgeois person I've ever met.

1344
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:52,177
Every front page
in the world.

1345
01:34:53,612 --> 01:34:55,547
Clever girls.

1346
01:35:04,322 --> 01:35:06,292
- Here she is.
- Come on.

1347
01:35:06,391 --> 01:35:08,560
Oh, she looks exhausted,
poor girl.

1348
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:10,296
Hello, Jo.

1349
01:35:10,395 --> 01:35:12,363
- You all right?
- Here she is.

1350
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:19,872
You okay?

1351
01:35:21,605 --> 01:35:22,875
Mum.

1352
01:35:24,175 --> 01:35:25,978
Is there going to be
a court case?

1353
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:32,518
Oh, well. We'll have to see about
getting you a nice, smart suit.

1354
01:35:36,255 --> 01:35:38,891
It's all right,
you know. I...

1355
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:41,926
I never listened
to my mother either.

Always slowly walking.

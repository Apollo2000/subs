1
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,823
Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play,

2
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,674
guess who else
gets to come down here and play?

3
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,109
Who?

4
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,616
Your sister.

5
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,248
Your sister.

6
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,672
What?

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,776
Well, things sure have
a way of working out smoothly.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Am I right, guys?

9
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,758
What?

10
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:03,683
We are from the planet duplo,
and we are here to destroy you.

11
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,479
Oh, man!

12
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,356
You're going to have to get past us.

13
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,233
Specifically me.
Oh, it's on!

14
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,939
Yar!

15
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,231
Wait, guys.
There's no need to fight anymore.

16
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,825
I got this.

17
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,864
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.

18
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,655
Here we go.

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,997
Hello,
visitors from another planet.

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,458
You are just as special

21
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,748
as we are.

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,004
See? Friends.

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,513
Ooh!

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,557
Yes.

25
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,017
What do you know? It worked.

26
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,598
Even though we're different,

27
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,888
I guess if we open our hearts
everything can be

28
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,113
More!

29
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,233
More!
More!

30
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,952
More! More! More!

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Oh, no!

32
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,822
Attack!

33
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,561
Run!

34
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,478
We wanna play with you, kitties.

35
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,942
Everything is awesome

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,774
Fire the laser cannons!

37
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,191
I eat lasers!

38
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,369
That's impossible!

39
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,949
La, la, la, la, la, la

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,405
La, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,287
You missed me!

42
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,875
No, I did not!

43
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,787
They're so adorably destructive!

44
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,525
Hey, guys. Listen up.

45
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,165
Everyone, get along!

46
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,050
done! Fixed it! I'm going golfing.

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,337
President Business,
you have to stay and help us!

48
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,492
I'm sure you guys
can sort it out amongst yourselves.

49
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,156
You're great at that stuff.
Bye. Gotta go.

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,913
don't worry, Lucy!

51
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,179
Everything can still be awesome!

52
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,942
It wasn't awesome.

53
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,157
We fought them off,

54
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,693
but they kept returning.

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,111
Let's dance!

56
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,641
Every time we rebuilt,

57
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,499
they kept coming after whatever
bright and shiny thing

58
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,895
caught their eye,

59
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,458
and always accompanied
by catchy pop music.

60
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,838
A league of brave heroes

61
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,751
volunteered to chase them
to wherever they came from.

62
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,632
My man!

63
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,763
Where's Batman?

64
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,048
He's off having a separate
standalone adventure.

65
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,508
You almost forgot me, guys.

66
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,721
Oh, did we?

67
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,681
I'm literally a lantern.
How did you miss me?

68
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,855
That's my whoops.

69
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,513
Fear not, citizens, I shall shed

70
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,732
Guys, can you just reopen the
Guys, just reopen the

71
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,542
You're not gonna?

72
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,574
I don't care, it's just feelings.
Stuff 'em down.

73
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,987
We may never know

74
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,911
if they even made it to the aliens
or were lost

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,821
in the dreaded Stairgate.

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,095
A lifetime has passed
since then. We grew up.

77
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,804
Abandoned anything cute,
shiny, poppy, or young.

78
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,058
And from the wreckage,
we built a grittier,

79
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,723
cooler, more mature society.

80
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,860
We call it Apocalypseburg.

81
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,272
And it is a heckish place to live.

82
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,573
We don't serve decaf!

83
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,993
Show weakness
and you'll be eaten alive.

84
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,540
This new life has toughened
and hardened us all.

85
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,871
Two coffees, please!

86
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,379
One black, one with just
a touch of cream and 25 sugars.

87
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,209
Well, toughened most of us.

88
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,253
Good morning, Apocalypseburg!

89
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,930
Oh! Almost ran me over.
Classic!

90
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,640
Good morning! Hello, cyborgs.

91
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,680
I wake up in the morning

92
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,432
I say Sean Connery!
daniel Craig!

93
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,646
I say Roger Moore!

94
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,270
You're crazy! Pierce Brosnan!

95
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,188
George Lazenby.
Who?

96
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,573
Everything is awesome

97
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,742
daniel Craig for life!

98
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,234
Hey! Surfer dave!

99
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,285
It's Chainsaw dave now!

100
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,156
Morning, Scribble Cop!

101
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,743
We're living out a dream

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,378
Morning, Sewer Babies!

103
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,043
Awesome

104
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,296
Everything is awesome

105
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,056
This song never gets old.

106
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,046
Me organs!
Oh, sorry!

107
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,270
Oh, good morning, Sherry.

108
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,518
Scarfield. deathface, MetalScratch.

109
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,899
Razor, Laserbeam,

110
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,479
Fingernail, ToxinToes

111
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,939
Jeff.

112
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,980
Hey, Batman!
How was your last adventure?

113
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,859
Good, really good.
Saved the world. Again.

114
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,989
Learned the value of friendship.

115
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,537
I loved. I lost,
and I'm good with it

116
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,347
And it's totally on brand for me
to be a loner with a broken heart.

117
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,788
It's what the fans want.

118
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,047
So, yeah, no, I'm good with it.
Just me and Alfred.

119
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,674
Not a terse laugh.

120
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,927
And, um, what about you?

121
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,255
Awesome!

122
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:35,764
Everything is awesome

123
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,484
Once I was a rebel,
fighting for a righteous cause.

124
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,528
Now, I only fight to survive.

125
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,486
Everything was awesome.

126
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,405
Now everything is bleak.

127
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,695
Hey, Lucy!
Oh! Hi.

128
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,196
I brought you coffee!

129
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,373
Coffee!

130
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,163
The bitter liquid that provides
the only semblance of pleasure

131
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,918
left in these dark times.

132
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,704
Oh, my goshness!
did I interrupt you brooding just now?

133
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,378
Ah, this brooding sesh
is not really going anywhere.

134
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,091
Man, I wish I could brood like you.

135
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,239
Look, all you gotta do
is just stare off into the distance

136
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,597
and then narrate whatever grim thoughts
come into your mind.

137
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,678
What if one day there was no coffee?

138
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,688
More like, "War hardens the heart."

139
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,564
"War hardens our hearts"

140
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,475
Okay, I'm thinking, it's more like,
"War"

141
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,860
"War!"
Hang on.

142
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,779
"War." No. "War."
"War!"

143
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,907
"War!"
"War."

144
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,569
"War." I can't do this!

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm too happy to see you.

146
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,055
What's the scariest thing
you can think of?

147
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,557
Oh, come to think of it,
I actually had a nightmare last night.

148
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,421
Nightmares are super broody.
What was it about?

149
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,603
All right, um, so it started
with this dolphin in a top hat.

150
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,627
Uh-huh.

151
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,395
And the dolphin says in a weird voice

152
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,005
It's 5:15 p.m.

153
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,974
Oh, I forgot to mention
his chest was a clock.

154
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,717
Okay, I'm thinkin' darker, broodier,
less fish.

155
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,087
Oh, and Batman was there,
and he was covered in glitter.

156
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,492
There was a talking ice cream cone.

157
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,007
This isn't really the broodiest.

158
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,052
And then, these scary black holes
open up in the ground.

159
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,520
They started to suck everybody
I've ever cared about out of my life!

160
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,563
And Gandalf was there.
And he shouted

161
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,862
It's Armamageddon!

162
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,990
Emmet!

163
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,116
No!

164
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,276
And you disappeared into the void,

165
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,445
never to be seen again.

166
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,405
Not bad brooding!

167
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,706
Oh! Thanks!

168
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,395
That was definitely just a dream, right?

169
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,911
Not some vision of the future?

170
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,210
No, no, no.
This is my vision of the future.

171
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,625
A little lower, to the left.

172
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,169
Ta-da!

173
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,847
A house?

174
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,242
Come on! Let me give you the tour.

175
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,599
Very first one on the cul-de-sac.

176
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,807
This is the living room,
where you can live it up.

177
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,056
TV room, dining room,

178
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,225
Planty's room,
kitty cat room

179
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,402
Of course, the kitchen,

180
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,779
complete with breakfast nook,
lunchtime nook, and fireman pole.

181
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,565
Which leads to water slide

182
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,241
Trampoline room

183
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,696
Monkey-barring all the way up to

184
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,614
Toaster room!

185
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,625
So you can have toast or waffles
at any time!

186
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,086
Oh!

187
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,499
And out back,
a double-decker porch swing,

188
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,627
so we can always hang together!

189
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,092
What do you think?

190
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,843
Uh Wow. Um

191
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,177
It's sweet.

192
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,138
It is. It's just, uh

193
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,680
It's going to attract aliens
and get destroyed.

194
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,469
But maybe it won't.

195
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,933
I just thought
we could rebuild the future.

196
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,973
Make everything awesome again.

197
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,400
Emmet

198
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,777
You gotta stop pretending
everything is awesome.

199
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,899
It isn't.

200
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,980
Every morning,
you walk through town,

201
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,783
singing that terrible, annoying,
manufactured pop song!

202
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,792
That song
really seems to upset you.

203
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,245
No, it doesn't.
Oh, my mistake.

204
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,203
That song was fine
when we were younger,

205
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,119
but we also have to grow up sometime.

206
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,166
Can you do that for me?

207
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,465
Well, yeah. I can try.

208
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,846
But it's easy for you.
You were always a dark, goth rebel.

209
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,389
Yes, of course I was.

210
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,011
Let's change the subject.
Okay.

211
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,140
We have to be hardened and battle-ready.
Both of us.

212
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,770
Yeah. No, I get it.

213
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,398
And that's why I've cultivated
a totally hard-edged side

214
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,559
that's super tough and Look, look!

215
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,107
A shooting star. Make a wish!

216
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,698
Oh, no!

217
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,506
What?
Can't think of anything to wish for?

218
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,296
I always just wish for more wishes,
'cause you can never have enough.

219
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,329
Emmet.
What is it?

220
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,871
Oh.

221
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,747
Something new.

222
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,919
Unikitty!

223
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,089
Recon mission.

224
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,044
Accessing inner

225
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,583
rage!

226
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,339
Let's move out!

227
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,100
Hey!

228
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,358
Scan. Scan.

229
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,089
Beep, bop, boop.

230
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,570
Scan. Scan.

231
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,526
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

232
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,528
We've never seen
anything like this.

233
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,530
They're evolving.

234
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,867
What is it up to?

235
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,575
I don't know,
but that beat is pretty fresh.

236
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,508
Uh-oh.

237
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,677
Take it down!

238
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,058
Oh!
Huh?

239
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,971
Hello!

240
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,730
Run!

241
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,908
Super-aggro turbo engines!

242
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,143
Super-safe tail light and blinker.

243
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,999
Heat-seeking missiles!
Windshield wipers!

244
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,413
Spiky blaster cannon!

245
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,369
Snazzy racing stripes.

246
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,289
Let's go!

247
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,381
I told you that house
would attract aliens!

248
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,216
I can fix it. I'll get us out of here.

249
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,270
Look out!

250
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,505
Hey! I think my dentist
used to work in this office.

251
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,272
Focus!

252
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,859
It's like it knows our every move!

253
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,485
Weird, right?

254
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,659
Emmet!
What?

255
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,283
Look out!
No, no, no!

256
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,469
Ultrakatty, flare!

257
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,227
I can't believe another year has passed.

258
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,724
Wrong flare!

259
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,561
Should old acquaintance

260
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,233
Alfred, battle cars.

261
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,857
Send out the battle cars.

262
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,657
Look on our custom vehicles
and despair!

263
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,370
Custom vehicles!
Custom vehicles! Custom vehicles!

264
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,752
We're alive!
We're alive!

265
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,719
You don't have to keep
whipping me, deborah.

266
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,724
Welcome to Shark Week!

267
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,483
Gotcha!
Okay, time to panic.

268
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,490
Time to panic! Time to panic!

269
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,949
Time to panic!

270
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,319
Open the door!
Let us in!

271
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,492
Coming. Coming.

272
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,578
Shoes off, please.

273
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,375
I said, shoes off!

274
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,586
Get us home as fast as you can!
Go! Go!

275
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,085
I need angry thoughts, angry thoughts!

276
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,334
Uh, pollution, poverty,
people who put raisins in stuff.

277
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,842
It was perfectly fine without raisins!

278
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,646
Love you!

279
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:18,890
I love you more!

280
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,467
Okay, that's adorable.

281
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,187
Hurry! The door is slowly closing.

282
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,480
Good thing the door is closing
so slowly and dramatically.

283
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,695
Whoa.
Whee!

284
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,989
Hello!
Hooray!

285
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,127
Eat it and weep.

286
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,382
Eat more and weep more!

287
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,141
Keep eating and weeping.

288
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,355
Weep, eat, weep, weep,
eat, eat, weep, weep!

289
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,816
Eat freedom!

290
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,324
You're welcome.

291
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,339
What in the heck?

292
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,859
Oh, the pain!

293
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,361
It's getting so cold.

294
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,371
Help me.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,536
I'm General Mayhem.

296
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,794
Intergalactic Naval Commander
of the Systar System.

297
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,708
Open the gate.

298
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,956
No way!

299
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,175
That gate is never, ever, ever, ever

300
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,630
Emmet, what're you doing?

301
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,430
Hooray!

302
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,385
See? That wasn't so bad.
Nothing got in.

303
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,141
Something got in.

304
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,935
Bring me your fiercest leader.

305
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,105
Yeah, that's me. This guy.
Coming through.

306
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,398
I'm the leader, obvs.

307
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,226
You? I don't think so.

308
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,315
How many movies
have they made about you?

309
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,591
Because there are nine about me,

310
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,823
and like three others
in various stages of development.

311
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,452
If ye be considered a leader
then why aren't we?

312
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,349
Yeah. I'm a princess.
What about me? I'm a space commander.

313
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,081
I'm literally
the captain of a pirate ship!

314
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,330
My helmet is very blue!
Wait a minute.

315
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,382
When everyone became the Special,
didn't we all become leaders?

316
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,882
No offense, I sense
no leadership qualities from you.

317
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,392
My readout confirms you to be soft,

318
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,095
fragile, and a less than
worthy opponent.

319
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,021
Hey! You watch what you say about Emmet.

320
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,266
He saved the universe a few years back.

321
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,563
This guy was a fierce warrior?

322
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,403
Okay, well, technically
I did the warrior stuff, but

323
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,024
So, you fought and masterbuilt,
and kicked butt,

324
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,279
and then the hapless male
was the leader?

325
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,080
Um, well, you know,
he was a symbol for

326
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,537
That we all have ideas and

327
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,914
But you did all the work.
Whoa Hey!

328
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,336
Emmet is the sweetest,
most optimistic guy you could ever meet.

329
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,675
And I know those qualities
are not useful anymore,

330
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,521
and that Emmet isn't changing
with the times,

331
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,275
and lacks a killer instinct,
and in general, just isn't tough enough.

332
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,343
Not tough enough?

333
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,643
Yeah. But this guy is the Special.
Well, at least he was.

334
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,054
Silence.

335
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,433
I don't have room in my ship
to take everyone.

336
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,314
I can fit maybe five.

337
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,400
Take?
I'll explain with a memorable jingle.

338
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,071
Your greatest leaders
Are cordially invited

339
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:05,328
To a matrimonial ceremony
Tonight at 5:15

340
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,584
5:15?

341
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,666
Well, if you say 5:00,
people show up at 5:15 anyway.

342
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,924
And if you say 6:00, people start
expecting dinner, it's a whole thing.

343
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,468
It's 5:15 p.m.

344
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,804
It's Armamageddon!

345
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,430
Emmet!

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,807
No!

347
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,009
Armamageddon is real.

348
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,844
I got this.

349
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,274
You are so handsome.

350
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,943
And you are very perceptive.

351
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,546
By Jove!

352
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,298
Lucy!

353
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,011
I RSVP "no"!

354
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,306
You must RSVP "yes"!

355
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:09,597
I'll save you
with my triple-decker couch!

356
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,934
You know, maybe let us handle it.

357
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,481
Whoa!

358
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,612
You biscuit-eatin'
space lubber!

359
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,318
don't need a body.
I'll fight you with me bare Uh-oh.

360
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,037
Spaceship!

361
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,203
Oh, yeah? This couch is a convertible.

362
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,160
Oh, Emmet!

363
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,459
You're couchin' for an ouchin'.

364
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,462
Oh, Emmet!

365
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,795
Thanks for playing.

366
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,056
Oh, no. No, no, no!

367
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,430
No, no, no!

368
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,727
Lucy!

369
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,353
Emmet!

370
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,310
No!

371
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,266
So long, Jerksburgers.

372
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,842
He's gonna come upstairs

373
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,886
No! I'm not gonna come
to your dance party right now.

374
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,401
I'm in the middle of a storyline

375
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,282
with time travel
Please?

376
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,058
and mind-blowing plot twists.
Stuff you wouldn't understand.

377
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,789
These guys are coming with me.

378
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,579
No, no, wait. No, no, no.

379
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,993
Stop!

380
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,540
Uh, Lucy? What?

381
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,250
Emmet, what have you done?

382
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,422
Wait.

383
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,921
You guys don't think
this is all my fault?

384
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,131
Maybe not entirely your fault.

385
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,553
It's totally your fault.

386
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,644
You got that right,
WNBA legend Sheryl Swoopes.

387
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,811
Listen, everyone,
Lucy and the others were kidnapped

388
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,060
in some sort of plan
to start Armamageddon.

389
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,653
Armamageddon? Where we're banished
for an eternity into the Bin of Storajj?

390
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,772
That's just a legend.
No, it's real!

391
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,177
And it's gonna happen to all of us
unless we rescue them.

392
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,193
Jinkies! Who's gonna lead the mission?

393
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,407
You wouldn't even make it
past the Stairgate,

394
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,493
let alone survive the Systar System.

395
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,160
That's a suicide mission.

396
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,127
Wyldstyle said you're
not tough enough to do this.

397
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,504
You haven't changed with the times.

398
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,918
You're stuck in the past
a quarter score ago.

399
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,753
We've all grown up except for you.

400
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,260
Yeah, dude, you're a total Hufflepuff.

401
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,074
That's right, he is!
But I'm not

402
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,215
You remember what happened
with the Justice League.

403
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,427
Now with Batman gone
and Marvel not returning our calls,

404
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,971
there are no real heroes left.

405
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,438
Only original Aquaman

406
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,351
and unlicensed knock-off, Larry Poppins.

407
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,438
Well, I say a spoonful of salt
helps the medicine go down.

408
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,855
Anyone? No?

409
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,051
Oh, Larry!

410
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,303
Yeah, what he said is right!

411
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,568
Oh, come on, everyone!

412
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,572
We've done this before.
We all took on Lord Business,

413
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,615
and we changed the world.

414
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,876
We are all special now.

415
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,662
There's nothing we can't do!

416
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,212
We need to go up to that alien planet,

417
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,836
and show those aliens
what we're made of.

418
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,381
Who's comin' with me?

419
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,787
I'll show them all
how tough I am.

420
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,638
Hang on to your fronds, Planty.

421
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,264
We're going to save Lucy

422
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,103
And all of the other people
who were captured.

423
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,689
Spaceship. Spaceship. Spaceship.

424
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,817
Spaceship. Spaceship. Spaceship.

425
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,787
So, this fits five, you say?

426
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,433
Oh, look at all these spaceship buttons.

427
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,811
What does this one do? Oh, what does
this one? What about this one?

428
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,999
That would be the power switch.

429
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,463
Ooh, what is that?

430
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,882
Behold, the Systar System.

431
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,754
Whoa!

432
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,883
No "whoas." do not give her
the satisfaction of whoa-ing this.

433
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,763
Ooh!
That's even worse!

434
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Ah!
Stop it!

435
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,531
Wait, that's Batman's job!

436
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,141
Your feet be in me face!

437
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,952
Please be quiet.

438
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,284
I'm trying to make a majestic landing.

439
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:46,128
Welcome to the Systar System

440
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,611
Nailed it.

441
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,092
The queen awaits.

442
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,799
To the Systar System

443
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,881
Uh, am I the only one
creeped out by this?

444
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,055
Uh No.

445
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,851
What?

446
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,310
Ice cream cone!

447
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:10,606
Presenting Her Majesty
Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi,

448
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,276
Empress of the Systar System.

449
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,131
Susan, would you get our guests
something refreshing to drink?

450
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

451
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,512
Thank you, Susan.

452
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,967
Welcome, guests, to the Systar System.

453
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,553
Uh, help me out, guys. What is this?
A talking horse?

454
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,058
Sorry about my appearance.

455
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,061
I was in a meeting with
the animal planet of Anthropomorphia,

456
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,733
so I look like a horse.

457
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,028
Thank you.

458
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,397
I'm Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi.

459
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,863
I can change my form to something else,
if this makes you uncomfortable.

460
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,279
Hey, guys.

461
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,338
No, go back.
The horse was much more palatable.

462
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,334
Whoever you are,
let us go and stop attacking us!

463
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,994
You started it.

464
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,440
You started it!
What do you want with us?

465
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,923
Trust me, my plans are totally sinister.

466
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,170
Sincere.
Sincere.

467
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,092
I just wanna help you guys.

468
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,346
All I need is your participation
in a matrimonial ceremony.

469
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
No way.

470
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,104
Trust me, it'll be totally terrifying.

471
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,939
Terrific. That's what I meant.

472
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,520
Why are we supposed to trust you?

473
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,107
I'll tell you
using a universal language.

474
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,612
Is it math?

475
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,156
The language that unites
all the planets in our system.

476
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,367
Oh, no. Are we in a musical?

477
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,697
Yep, get ready.

478
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,160
Hello, friends
My name is Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

479
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,448
Don't worry

480
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,955
I'm totally not
One of those evil queens

481
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,079
You've read about in fairy tales
Or seen in the movies

482
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:53,508
And there's no reason at all
To be suspicious of me

483
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,085
Not evil, not evil, no

484
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,341
I'm the least evil person I know

485
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,176
I won't lie,
it's actually very suspicious

486
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,410
that you're leading with this.

487
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,677
I'm so not a villain
I have zero evil plans

488
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,564
No ulterior motives
Just wanna help where I can

489
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,230
I wanna shower you with gifts
'Cause I'm selfless and sweet

490
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,443
So, there's no reason at all
To be suspicious of

491
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,195
Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

492
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,658
The least evil queen in history

493
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,911
And if you do not believe me

494
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,415
I totally won't imprison your family

495
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,371
'Cause that'd be evil

496
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,291
And that's so not me

497
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,612
I'm not evil, not evil, no

498
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,127
I'm the least evil person I know

499
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,338
Really? Because I'm getting
super-evil vibes here.

500
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,426
Benny, do you like spaceships?
'Cause I think they are great

501
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,386
How'd you know that?
Loving spaceships

502
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,437
Is my one defining trait

503
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,390
Well, now, my good friend
You can build

504
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,975
The spaceship of your dreams

505
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,063
On your very own planet
With your own spaceship-building team

506
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,523
Come on, do not fall for this.

507
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,407
Wyldstyle, haven't you heard?

508
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:05,618
There's no reason at all
To be suspicious of her

509
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,247
Yeah, I know she keeps saying that,
but she's clearly an evil queen.

510
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,661
Yar, well, I'm not buying it.

511
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,957
MetalBeard, a pirate without a ship
That's so cruel

512
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,468
It's like a spider without a web
Or a queen without a fool

513
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,595
Hey!

514
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,254
Even her metaphors are suspicious.

515
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,888
I've got a surprise for you

516
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,142
A planet that's really a pirate ship
And the population, your crew

517
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,094
Her story checks out.
She's cool. Not evil.

518
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,850
What about me?
Unikitty,

519
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,543
what's the most glitter you can imagine?

520
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,567
A lot!

521
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,711
Times that by infinity
Whoo-hoo!

522
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,146
And, Batman

523
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,320
don't even try it, lady.
I don't need anything.

524
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,446
Oh, I know,
That's why I'm going to give you

525
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,819
Half of everything

526
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,271
Uh, like "everything" everything?

527
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,408
"Everything" everything

528
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,990
She's rad. This chick gets me.

529
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,661
Here are some other adjectives
People use to describe me

530
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,327
Un-duplicitous, un-malicious
Un-conniving, un-nasty

531
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,741
You're clearly just adding "un"
to words that describe you.

532
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:55,918
Who, me?

533
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,050
I'm Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

534
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,221
The most least evil person
You'll ever meet

535
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,641
And if you make eye contact with me

536
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,102
I totally won't have you
Executed immediately

537
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,971
'Cause that'd be evil

538
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,691
Evil
Evil

539
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:22,116
And that's so not me

540
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,614
Sorry, we're not swayed
by a little song-and-dance number.

541
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,790
Oh, I liked the tune.
Especially the spaceship part.

542
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,868
And also, no other parts,
just the spaceship part.

543
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,248
Artist to artist,
I could tell it was from the heart.

544
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,209
I knew I would like you.

545
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,874
Game recognize game.

546
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,339
He'll do perfectly for the ceremony.

547
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,465
I am perfect.

548
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,968
What is this
matrimonial ceremony, buster?

549
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,348
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

550
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,055
I built a Space Temple
right in the center of our universe.

551
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,309
And at 5:15, all the stars will align,

552
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,023
and we'll hold a wedding
between me and the Man of Bats.

553
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,608
The rest of y'all

554
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,005
are gonna be in the wedding party.

555
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,486
And once we say, "I do"

556
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,193
Then you'll get all those gifts
I promised y'all.

557
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,536
You're lying.
It's gonna summon Armamageddon,

558
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,456
and we're gonna get tossed
into the Bin of Storajj forever.

559
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,685
Whoa. No, no, no. No, no, no.

560
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,167
Back up a quick sec.
did you say "wedding"?

561
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,332
Man, you agreed to half of everything.

562
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,547
No, no, no. No to the no.

563
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,337
I thought you were the leader.

564
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,428
Uh, yeah, I mean,
I am obviously leader guy.

565
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,514
But I'm not

566
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,472
doesn't mean that I'm ready to settle

567
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:33,182
I'm not gonna be the guy
who's gonna make that kind of a leap

568
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:37,016
None of us will be part of
your wedding ceremony, ever.

569
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,935
Y'all are so dusty, tough, and grouchy.

570
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,445
Take them to
get changed for the ceremony.

571
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,449
And this one needs to get changed
most of all.

572
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,996
Whoa!

573
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,171
It's the portal to dimensions unknown.

574
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,708
The Stairgate.

575
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,677
I'll just push through the Stairgate.

576
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,425
Seems simple enough.

577
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,103
Glassteroids!

578
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,320
I can do this.
Torpedoes deploy!

579
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,285
Huh. I can do

580
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,699
I can't do this.

581
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,502
This is the end!

582
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,307
Who was that?

583
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,386
Where did he go?
Hey!

584
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,392
You mind if I save your life?

585
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,227
Not at all.
Rad.

586
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,342
And that's how you break on through
to the other side

587
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,267
Of the Stairgate.

588
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,932
Who are you?

589
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,390
Whoa!

590
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,564
The name's Rex,
Rex dangervest.

591
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,903
Galaxy-defending
archeologist, cowboy,

592
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,648
raptor trainer, who likes
building furniture, busting heads,

593
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,735
and having chiseled features,
previously hidden under baby fat.

594
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,987
Whoa! Enemy ship!

595
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,204
That's a negative.

596
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,452
That bad boy is my ship.

597
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,327
Built her myself out of spare pieces.

598
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,293
Let me show ya around.

599
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,091
Hey, you broke my ship.

600
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:13,463
Listen, kid, you can build anything,
but there ain't nothing you can't break.

601
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,344
I don't get it.

602
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,009
How about a tour?

603
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,975
Behold, the Rexcelsior.

604
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,518
Whoa-ho-ho!

605
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,973
Are those dinosaurs?

606
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,238
Whoa!

607
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,995
Tell me,
what's a scrapabout like you

608
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,040
doing trying to
go through the Stairgate?

609
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,584
Aliens from the Systar System
kidnapped my friends.

610
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,289
I'm going to get them back.

611
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,590
You don't wanna go anywhere
near the Systar System, trust me.

612
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,340
It's ruled by an alien queen, and she'll
try to brainwash your friends,

613
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,174
so she can use 'em in
a matrimonial ceremony to bring forth

614
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,304
Armamageddon?
Bingo.

615
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,057
You've been to the Systar System?
You can help me.

616
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,888
Forget it, kid.

617
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,806
That place is too terrible.

618
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,523
But I don't like to talk about my
backstory, so don't even ask.

619
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,028
Oh. Okay.
There I was,

620
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,360
on a galactic mission.

621
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,942
Ended up being
more than I'd bargained for.

622
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,995
I landed in the desolate plains

623
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,585
of the dust planet Undar
of the Dryar System.

624
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,914
The winds were ferocious.

625
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,251
The isolation, intense.

626
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,132
I waited for my friends.

627
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,927
Seemed to last forever.

628
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,022
That's when I learned

629
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,738
There was no one I could trust but me.

630
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,945
I'm so sorry, Rex.

631
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,908
don't be.
My time alone was an awakening.

632
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,660
I learned how the universe really works.

633
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,036
Yeah, I know how you feel.

634
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,245
Ha! You couldn't possibly know
how it feels.

635
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,499
Yeah, I do.

636
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,457
Like you can't ever go back
to the person you used to be.

637
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,125
Even though it was so much simpler.

638
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,466
You have to find your own way.

639
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,301
But you just don't know how.

640
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,590
Hold up a second.

641
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,259
You have been there.
Yeah.

642
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,678
What's your last name, Emmet?

643
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:26,930
Brickowski.

644
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,397
No way.

645
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,226
The visionary
double-decker-couch-building hero

646
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,356
who took it to Lord Business
and had the guts

647
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,649
to face The Man Upstairs?

648
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,239
That Emmet Brickowski?

649
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,608
Yeah.

650
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,743
dude! Big fan!

651
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,740
Wait, you are a fan of me?

652
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,326
Heck yeah. You're the reason
I started wearing vests.

653
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,866
do you like mine?
Yes, I do!

654
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,005
Also started wearing chaps,
which are essentially leg-vests.

655
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,547
Wow. You're so much more cool
and grown-up than me.

656
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,670
You could teach me!

657
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,673
Rex, help me rescue my friends,
stop Armamageddon,

658
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,137
and teach me to be like you.

659
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,934
Someone Lucy will be proud of.

660
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,355
And I'll be the brother you never had.

661
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,295
Unless you do have a brother.
I don't really know you that well.

662
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,690
All right, kid, you listen.

663
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,824
You go soft,
you're playing their game.

664
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,487
You're gonna have to grow up
and grow up fast.

665
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,030
Are you ready to do that?

666
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,039
Yes, I am.

667
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,950
I can't hear you.

668
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,994
Really? I was speaking at normal volume.

669
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,899
Sorry, man.
I'm just a little hard of hearing

670
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,212
from listening to my mixtapes super loud
with no regard for my future hearing,

671
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,671
because I live in the now.

672
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,757
Raptors, re-coordinate.

673
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,387
Really?
Set a course for the Systar System.

674
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,219
Rex, I promise you won't regret it.

675
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,889
Kid, I invented the phrase "no regrets."

676
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,684
I do have one regret
of not trademarking it.

677
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:55,903
Space cannons.

678
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,521
Hyper-light-speed combustor.

679
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,803
Super-rad ejector button.

680
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,346
Whoa. Isn't there a better place
to put that?

681
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,486
Raptors, power up.

682
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,723
Crank the warp drive up to 11.

683
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,907
Times two.

684
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,125
Yeah!

685
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,924
To the Systar System.

686
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,703
That queen
is never gonna break us.

687
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,719
She just wants to throw a party.

688
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,430
It's clearly a cover
for some catastrophic event.

689
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,814
Yeah. Marriage, am I right?

690
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,849
No one's tying down this Batman forever.

691
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,442
Ooh, reference!

692
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,404
No. The moment you say, "I do,"
it'll unlock some

693
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,025
What are you looking at?
What are you hiding?

694
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,321
What are you hiding?

695
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,654
You're the one with
the reflective mask.

696
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,281
Well, I asked you first.
Well, I asked you second.

697
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,017
Real mature.

698
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,454
So, where are we going?

699
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,498
Planet Sparkles.

700
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,872
Sparkles.

701
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,717
There, you will get changed
in more ways than one.

702
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,377
Hello!

703
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,007
What was that?

704
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,306
I said, "Hello!"

705
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,633
Well, we've been talking for a while.

706
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,491
I'm not sure
why you're saying hello now

707
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,555
But fine. Hello to you.

708
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,199
Stick together. I've got a plan.

709
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,452
Greetings, Bricksburgians.

710
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,076
Welcome to
the Palace of Infinite Reflection.

711
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,166
A self-reeducation celebrity center.

712
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,660
Namaste.

713
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,204
Ooh! Sounds spiritual.

714
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,580
It is so spiritual.

715
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,708
Sounds like a trap.
This guy's a vampire.

716
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,301
Attractive non-threatening teen vampire.

717
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,053
I like to talk about feelings,

718
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,839
and how we're in love,
but can't be together.

719
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,178
Isn't that beautiful?

720
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,434
I'll answer that. It's very beautiful.

721
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,766
The heart wants what it wants.

722
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,728
I also dJ on the side
and wear women's jeans.

723
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,143
Wow!

724
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:04,693
Guys, we have to stay tough and gritty.
do not let them soften you up

725
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,826
Oh, yeah. I love getting barnacles
scrubbed off me bilge pump.

726
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,361
Really? Right into it.

727
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,640
Oh, oh! It tickles.

728
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,451
Whee!

729
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,577
Oh, yeah, I carry my tortured past
in my chiseled glutes.

730
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,082
Even you?

731
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,497
What? I mean, I'm not gonna turn down
a free massage.

732
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,631
She needs extra treatment.

733
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,883
No!
Yes.

734
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,781
First, you'll get a hot gem massage.

735
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,297
Then an exfoliating flower beatdown.

736
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,466
Popsicle face mask and peel.

737
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,892
Room-temperature stone contusion.
Hey!

738
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,473
Vegetable observation

739
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,087
And be cleansed with a glitter scrub

740
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,605
and sparkle rinse.
Ah!

741
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,061
Next

742
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,351
Your hair!
It's

743
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,900
It's beautiful.
Wait, what?

744
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,484
Oh, no, no, no, no.

745
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,302
What? Wow!

746
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,113
Guys, this is not what you think.

747
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,286
It's so adorable and cute!

748
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,448
Are you covering up some un-dark past?

749
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,535
No. It's not who I am.
It's just hair.

750
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,915
Look, if I pop it off,
am I Bruce Willis now?

751
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,750
I don't think so.

752
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,883
Well, well, well.
I thought ye were tough.

753
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,918
Looks like the peg's on the other leg.

754
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,632
I didn't
Is she secretly cutesy?

755
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,763
Look, they did this, okay? Not me!

756
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,684
I mean, what? I sat
in the mirror years ago in shame

757
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,226
and took a permanent marker,

758
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,850
and hair by hair just,
you know, recolored it?

759
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,058
I mean, what kind of crazy person
would do that? Ugh!

760
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,361
Pardon my language,
but she's a real grumpledumpuss.

761
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,398
Take her for some music therapy.

762
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,529
Then she'll be willing
to join our ceremony.

763
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,502
Lucy, where are you?

764
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,758
I'm so sorry.

765
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,549
You're not gonna find her
whispering into a window.

766
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
It's time to take action.

767
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,204
Which planet do you wanna try first?

768
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,056
Um What do you think?

769
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,343
A tough guy doesn't ask where to go.

770
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,352
Just pick any of 'em
and act like you're sure.

771
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,263
That's called leadership.

772
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,898
Okay. That one.

773
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,524
Now you're getting it!

774
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,613
Yeah! Now I feel it!

775
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,944
I am feeling it and I like it!

776
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,735
Everyone, suit up!

777
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,416
Only the toughest
are gonna get out of there alive.

778
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,352
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

779
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,170
Yes, you are.

780
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,520
It's 4:30.
The ticking clock is ticking.

781
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,351
Let's go find your friends.

782
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,694
Just a couple of tough guys
being tough.

783
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,858
Planned that.

784
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,164
We'll find some answers this way.

785
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,580
Where's Cobra?

786
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,086
Rocky! Quaid!

787
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,255
Ripley!

788
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,081
Connor!

789
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,458
The other one!

790
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,130
Nobody move.

791
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,053
I'm tracking unusual activity

792
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,051
on my unusual activity tracker.

793
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,224
Not sure what to make of it.

794
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,349
Huh?

795
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,626
Emmet, don't look 'em in the eyes.

796
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,311
They'll get in your head.

797
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,366
We gotta get out of here!

798
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,900
Go, go, go!

799
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,151
Going, going, going!

800
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,960
We're surrounded!

801
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,904
don't you let them take advantage
of that big, beautiful heart of yours.

802
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,632
Bust through, Emmet.

803
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,255
You can do it!

804
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:02,927
Hey, I did it!

805
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,346
Nice work!
Yeah, but they're still coming!

806
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,973
No biggie. Watch this.

807
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,355
Whoa!

808
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,079
Whoa!

809
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,616
Not bad back there, kid.

810
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,828
You know, you and I are more alike
than you might realize.

811
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,498
Really? I mean, really cool.
Whatever. I don't care.

812
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,857
But how did you do that punch thing?

813
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,168
You gotta break things down
to build 'em back up.

814
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,715
Rex!

815
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,422
Life's impermanent.
Always changing.

816
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,132
You can't hang on to the past.

817
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,263
Otherwise we might as well
all be Kragled.

818
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,636
So deep.

819
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,717
Oh, yeah, thanks.
I've been meditating a lot.

820
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,682
So, it makes sense.

821
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,142
Emmet, listen,
if we're gonna rescue your friends,

822
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,648
you're gonna need to be a

823
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,983
Master Breaker.

824
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,936
You would teach it to me?
How do you do it?

825
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,613
Well, you have to connect to
some pretty grown-up feelings.

826
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,241
Abandonment. Regret. Anger at

827
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,327
A lamppost?

828
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,533
Yeah, lampposts are the worst because

829
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,623
Um

830
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,208
Oh.

831
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,553
Hi!
Hello!

832
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,553
Good morning!

833
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,172
What is this place?

834
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,054
Emmet, welcome to heck.

835
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,016
Extry! Extry!

836
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,022
Superman?
Oh, hey, Emmet.

837
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,982
Superman, what are you doing?

838
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,400
Oh, just mowing my lawn.

839
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,176
Want everything to be perfect
for the wedding ceremony.

840
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,040
Where is it? Where's Lucy?
Where's our friends?

841
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,409
At the Space Temple, you goof.

842
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,473
Wait. Two questions.
One, where's the Space Temple?

843
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,238
Two, why are you here?

844
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,052
What are you talking about?
It's great here.

845
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,703
I never wanna leave.

846
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,665
By the way, "S" stands for "Silly" now.
I'm Sillyman.

847
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,121
Why didn't you come back for us?

848
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,379
Ah, we're just all having so much
fun here and we're all friends.

849
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,862
I know. What's up, GL?

850
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,093
I see you, boy.

851
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,425
Hey! Oh, here comes Lex
with the smoothies.

852
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,636
Who wants a mango-berry blast
with a reusable straw?

853
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,009
Lex Luthor?

854
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,553
You're friends with your sworn enemy,
Lex Luthor?

855
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,432
Guys, General Zod
just made homemade guac.

856
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,437
He's a Zod-send.

857
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,936
I'm glittery!

858
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,352
Why are you all acting different?

859
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,109
We all listened to the music,
and it really changed our attitude.

860
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,949
You have to listen to the music.

861
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:30,332
Listen to the music
and let your mind go.

862
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,951
Let's sing him the song.
That is a great idea, Lexy.

863
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,495
I have an excellent singing voice.

864
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,914
I'm a soprano

865
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,171
Oh, we have fun together.

866
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,592
I wanna find my friends.

867
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,758
I don't wanna listen to a song.

868
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,182
Just listen to the music
and let your mind go.

869
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,312
Hey! Whoa. Back off. Huh?

870
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,684
Ow!

871
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,190
Subject her to catchy pop music.

872
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,192
That will change her tune.

873
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,950
I'll start with one
that's sure to get stuck in her head.

874
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,868
This song's gonna
Get stuck inside your

875
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,584
You gotta be kiddin' me.

876
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,785
This song's gonna get stuck
Inside your head

877
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,996
This song's gonna
Get stuck inside your

878
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,505
Not surround sound!

879
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:22,130
This song's gonna get stuck
Inside your head

880
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,803
It's so catchy, catchy

881
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,338
It's such a catchy song

882
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,973
It'll make you happy, happy

883
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,763
Don't try to fight it, sing along

884
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,095
Unikitty!
Ah!

885
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:36,978
This song's gonna get stuck
Inside your head

886
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,108
This song's gonna
Get stuck inside you

887
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,173
Run, but you can't hide, I'll find you
Sun so bright

888
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,859
Unikitty, let's get out of here!

889
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:43,985
Wyldstyle!

890
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,903
It's fun! Sing along!

891
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,528
Glitter is like stars on your body!

892
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,031
My leg is a piano!

893
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,492
This song is stuck in my head,
and my head loves it.

894
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,411
Join the party!
No! Guys!

895
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,630
Boom!

896
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,859
What's wrong with you?
You're not acting like yourselves.

897
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,251
This is the most disturbing thing
I've ever seen!

898
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,734
This song's gonna
Get stuck inside your

899
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,718
Run!

900
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,390
don't listen to the music, Emmet,

901
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,555
if you want your noodle
to stay al dente!

902
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,681
Emmet?

903
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,390
My body is worming.

904
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,473
I didn't know I knew how to do this!

905
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,307
Get yourself together.

906
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:20,984
We'll be safe inside of

907
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,488
Hey, guys!

908
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,695
They're everywhere!

909
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,036
Connor? Ripley? The other one?

910
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,993
don't be a grumpledumpuss!

911
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,750
don't you see?
They are trying to change us.

912
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,294
don't worry,
this song has, like, zero effect on me.

913
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,797
You're dancing.
Uh, don't look at me.

914
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,128
Rex! Help me!

915
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,805
Think hard thoughts, Emmet.
Think hard thoughts

916
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,434
Or the rhythm is gonna get ya!

917
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:58,268
Shoulder, stay still! Stop it!

918
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,392
No! No! No! No! No! No!

919
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,358
Yes!

920
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,449
Bruce?
Willis. Yeah.

921
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,405
I spend a lot of time in air ducts.

922
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,701
I definitely don't live up here.

923
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,369
I have a home.

924
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,208
Just scooch on by.
Ooh.

925
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,760
Ugh!

926
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,384
This song's gonna
Get stuck inside your

927
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,972
It's a dead end!

928
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:43,733
My CPd, convenient plot device,
shows there's a planet right below us.

929
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,019
It's our only way out of here.

930
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,529
I'll hold 'em back.
You bust us out.

931
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,776
I don't know how to do that!

932
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,573
Emmet, I know you can do this.

933
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,025
What makes you mad?

934
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,035
A lamppost?
Come on!

935
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,992
They took Lucy and the others.

936
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,452
And how does that
make you feel?

937
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,075
Not good.
More honest.

938
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,288
Super not good!

939
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:02,953
You're getting close now, brother!

940
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,964
Crack that pain bone open
and suck out the marrow!

941
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,920
What do you feel?

942
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:12,134
I feel very afraid of losing
Lucy forever and it being my fault,

943
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,923
because I wasn't able to change!

944
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,711
Ouch!

945
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,313
Whoa!

946
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,515
I did it!

947
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,979
Nice job, kid.

948
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,153
How is there outer space
under this sidewalk?

949
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,447
I told you, nothing in this place
makes sense.

950
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,028
Yeah!

951
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,329
When are we gonna stop falling?

952
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,784
Now.

953
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,785
Uh, Rex, do you hear a rumbling?

954
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,041
Planet duplo!

955
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,514
This is really bad.

956
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,269
Buses are now leaving
for the matrimonial ceremony.

957
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,437
Find her.

958
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,186
I must deliver the Man of Bats
to the queen.

959
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,608
I'm not going anywhere.

960
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,694
All right, I stand corrected.
I am going somewhere.

961
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,276
Hmm. More confetti!

962
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,408
More glitter! More frosting! Mmm!

963
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,411
Oh, I love
the chocolate fondue fountain.

964
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,876
Life is so fragile.

965
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,690
Call from General Mayhem.

966
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,296
Okay. Everybody, take five.

967
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,798
Banana, peel out.

968
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,925
Hey! You bringin' the Man of Bats
to the Space Temple?

969
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,325
I am on my way.

970
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,762
I just wanna say, I am not okay with

971
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,725
But the one they call Wyldstyle escaped.

972
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,981
don't worry. She'll come to us.

973
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,399
And we'll be ready for her.

974
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,820
Sorry. Banana keeps slipping on his peel
on the way out.

975
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,236
You gonna bruise yo' butt.

976
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,612
All right, you guys.

977
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,405
The queen says
we gotta get these bricks sorted

978
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,967
and up to the Space Temple
before the ceremony starts.

979
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,098
Let's go! Go! Go!

980
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,181
Rex! I think I know what to do.

981
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,387
What's your plan?

982
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,473
We're gonna have to hang, bro.

983
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,775
I catch you.
Grab and go, amigo!

984
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,738
Whoa!

985
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,611
Well done.

986
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:44,657
The student has become
the teaching assistant.

987
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,833
Thanks.

988
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,209
I hope this leads to our friends.

989
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,675
Let's all go to the lobby

990
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,139
Yep, I hope
this leads to our friends.

991
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,395
I'm having a great time!

992
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,938
Me, too!

993
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,733
Yippie!

994
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,060
See, Wyldstyle, it's fun here!

995
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,019
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

996
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,383
Where's Wyldstyle?

997
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,167
Where is Wyldstyle?
Where be Batman, too?

998
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,804
What? I can't hear what you're saying.

999
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,156
I'm too busy partying!

1000
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,998
Good thing
Wyldstyle's not here!

1001
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,791
She would hate this!

1002
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:35,957
Scan. Scan.

1003
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,633
Scan. Scan.

1004
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:47,845
Emmet?

1005
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,767
Scan. Scan.

1006
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:54,897
Get down!

1007
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:57,820
Emmet!

1008
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,488
Lucy! What're you doing here?

1009
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,866
I'm here to save you!
I'm here to save you!

1010
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,402
We're saving each other!

1011
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,908
Wow. You made it all the way here.

1012
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,663
I can't believe it!

1013
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,242
You better believe it, sister.

1014
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,543
Whoa. Who is this guy?

1015
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,148
So, you can see him?

1016
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,482
I was so worried
he was just a projection

1017
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,123
of what my ego needs deep down,
but, no, he's real. Cool!

1018
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,125
I'm Rex dangervest.

1019
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,303
Social media influencer!
First baseman!

1020
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,054
Man of the soil! Script doctor!

1021
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,050
And my middle name's Machete Ninjastar,
so I know tough.

1022
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,927
And Emmet is one tough cookie.

1023
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,848
He's a cookie so tough and hard,
you can't even chew it,

1024
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,150
'cause it turns out it's not a cookie,
it's a chainsaw.

1025
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,237
Huh, really?
Yeah. I grew up.

1026
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:40,564
Just like you wanted.

1027
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,734
Yeah. No, that's great.

1028
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,660
Mmm I thought you'd be more excited.

1029
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,037
Me, too.

1030
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,782
But it's good,
because that's what we need.

1031
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,333
They've got all our friends.

1032
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,460
Your nightmare, Armamageddon's coming.

1033
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,212
We have to stop it or we're all doomed.

1034
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,873
And it's all going down

1035
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,341
right there at the
The Space Temple.

1036
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,721
And the clock from my dream.

1037
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,218
It's all coming true.

1038
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,393
The Man of Bats.
Welcome.

1039
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,433
Hey, girl, hey.

1040
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,684
I've detected a deep emptiness in him.

1041
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,318
According to my calculations,
he's lonely.

1042
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,946
Among other things.

1043
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,284
I know how he feels.

1044
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,405
I mean, what a weirdo.
I totally don't relate to that.

1045
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,158
The time for Armamageddon nears.

1046
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,743
We must find a weakness.

1047
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,128
If he doesn't say "I do," we
Relax, girl.

1048
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,788
I got this.

1049
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:41,194
I'll just leave you two alone.

1050
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,677
Okay, let's address
the elephant in the room.

1051
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,174
Listen, lady, don't try any mind games.

1052
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,061
Batman is a permanent Bat-chelor.

1053
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,729
Can you imagine if having a family
with someone I loved

1054
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,689
healed some of my darkest trauma?

1055
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:01,899
Barf.

1056
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,189
There is no way I'm marrying you.

1057
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,569
Well, of course not.

1058
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,530
Oh. Uh Yeah, but you said that

1059
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,905
I wanted to marry you?

1060
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,695
No, no, no, honey.

1061
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,535
I was just saying that
to make the person

1062
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,413
I actually wanna marryjealous.

1063
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,915
Good. So, I guess we're done here or

1064
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,997
Marry Batman.

1065
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,211
That's a good one. You funny.

1066
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,917
Yeah. And, um

1067
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,678
Out of curiosity,
why wouldn't you wanna marry me?

1068
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,174
Just, you know, again,
purely for curiosity sake.

1069
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,051
Oh, I don't go for guys like you.

1070
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,206
What do you mean, guys like me?

1071
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,347
Oh, great. More singing.
Right on time.

1072
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,519
Listen, Bruce.

1073
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,437
Who's Bruce?
It's nothin' personal.

1074
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,647
It's just

1075
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,436
I've dated men like you before

1076
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,822
And you're just not my type
My type

1077
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,529
Never around during the day
Only come out at night

1078
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,489
That's late
Emotionally wounded

1079
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,995
Dark and brooding all the time
Boo-hoo.

1080
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,407
Hanging around with clowns

1081
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,495
I don't need that in my life

1082
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,334
I ain't Selina Kyle

1083
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,124
I ain't no Vicki Vale

1084
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,871
I was never into you

1085
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,044
Even when you were Christian Bale

1086
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,667
I'm more of a Keaton guy myself.

1087
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,627
Ooh, I loved him as Beetlejuice.

1088
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:12,349
I'm just not into Gotham City guys

1089
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,579
Oh, yeah, we're flawed,
but that's what makes us so relatable.

1090
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:19,143
I'm just not into guys who can't fly

1091
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,349
I can fly.

1092
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,108
The Batwing can fly.

1093
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,439
Rich boys with gadgets
Are not my type

1094
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,899
What is your type?

1095
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,404
Kryptonian men are my kryptonite

1096
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,613
Gross!

1097
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,287
I'm just not into Gotham City guys

1098
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,291
So what? You dig Superman.
I don't care. But, like, listen up.

1099
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,410
You're clearlyjust confused

1100
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,328
Gotham dudes are the best

1101
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,247
We have deep, manly voices

1102
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,256
And insanely ripped pecs

1103
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,883
We're Affleck-level hot

1104
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,919
And we're Oprah-level rich

1105
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,089
With George Clooney-level charm

1106
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,514
And Val Kilmer lips

1107
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,468
We worked for our powers
'Cause we're self-made men

1108
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,435
We didn'tjust get them from the sun

1109
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,935
Like an entitled alien

1110
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,359
Go on one date with me
and you'll change your mind.

1111
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,731
Unsubscribe.

1112
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,740
I'm just not into Gotham City guys

1113
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,362
Give me a chance!

1114
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,781
No, thank you. Hard pass.

1115
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:19,287
I'm just not into guys
Who don't wear tights

1116
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,210
I used to wear tights.
Ask Adam West!

1117
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,375
I'm looking for a husband
Someone to share my crown

1118
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,384
And Gotham men are playboys
Who would never settle down

1119
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:33,004
Unlike other superheroes
Who are strong and not afraid

1120
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,177
Of commitment and relationships

1121
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,675
I won't name any names

1122
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,768
Oh, hey, Batman!

1123
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,765
But I'll give you a hint

1124
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,187
He's made of steel

1125
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,349
And wears a red cape

1126
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,731
Wait!

1127
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,365
Please marry me.

1128
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,443
Are you sure
this is what you really want?

1129
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,993
Yes. Marry me.

1130
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,576
And then you'll see,
I am the best at everything,

1131
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,287
including commitment.

1132
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,459
So, you wanna do this
in, like, 15 minutes?

1133
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,002
Make it a quarter of an hour.

1134
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:06,792
Where are we?

1135
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,753
Look out!

1136
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,724
Emmet, you got this, bro.

1137
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,766
Quick! Let's build, uh, a toaster!

1138
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,264
A toaster?
Just trust me.

1139
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,445
Wow! That was cool.

1140
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,026
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah?

1141
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,361
It was. It was cool.

1142
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:38,244
What fresh nightmare
are they constructing here?

1143
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,248
It's a wedding cake of doom!

1144
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,669
disgusting!

1145
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,501
How is a wedding ceremony
going to summon Armamageddon?

1146
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,757
I don't know,
but we're not gonna wait to find out.

1147
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,926
We can stop the ceremony
if we find a weakness

1148
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,552
in the temple and blow it up.

1149
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,648
I scanned the layout as we entered

1150
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,768
using my Implausitron,
one of my impossibly cool gadgets.

1151
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:09,901
This temple's clearly built as a beacon
for the end of days.

1152
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,653
Emmet, you're a construction worker.
What do you think?

1153
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,065
Great question, Rex.
I'll take it from here.

1154
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,653
Unique construction style.

1155
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,410
Seems to be built around
this entertainment center in the middle.

1156
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,655
Looks like a magical relic

1157
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,741
that plays music
as a protective defense shield.

1158
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,622
Okay, I've got a plan. We split up.

1159
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:31,665
Rex retrieves the Rexcelsior
and gets in Rextraction position.

1160
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,211
Ha! Not a fan of puns? Okay.

1161
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,130
Lucy unplugs this entertainment center,

1162
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,049
which should deactivate
the defense shield

1163
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:41,262
Then I'll do the Master Breaker punch
here, at the top of the temple,

1164
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,102
which will start a chain reaction,
causing the whole place to blow.

1165
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,813
Then Rex swoops in,
grabs us and our friends,

1166
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,690
and we all go home.

1167
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,605
Wow. That's a really impressive plan.

1168
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,946
Thank you. Now grab a headset.
I don't wanna lose you again.

1169
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,478
Whoa! Lucy, what's with your hair?

1170
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,535
Oh, it's nothing.
It was just a spa thing.

1171
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,742
don't worry about it.
It's not my real hair.

1172
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,368
My real hair's naturally black.

1173
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,625
She's lyin'.

1174
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,105
She wouldn't lie to me about something
as important as her hair color.

1175
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,540
I'm not.
She would

1176
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,546
if she was brainwashed.

1177
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:16,718
And you can't wash a brain without
washing the hair on top of that brain.

1178
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:17,839
It's basic science.

1179
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,879
Lucy, you're not

1180
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,057
No.

1181
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,590
Are you?

1182
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,558
I'm not! I'm not brainwashed!

1183
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,170
What about the rest of our friends?

1184
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,895
Oh, they're brainwashed. But I'm not.

1185
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,349
You sure we can trust her?

1186
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,601
Emmet?

1187
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,190
It's me.

1188
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,481
Emmet?

1189
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,234
I can always trust you.

1190
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,933
Now, you disconnect the shield,
and I'll blow up the temple.

1191
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,289
And I'll get my ship.

1192
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,076
We've got no time to lose, because

1193
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,745
It's 5:00 p.m.

1194
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,795
"The union
of Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

1195
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,002
and Bruce Margolis Batman."

1196
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,179
I will say it is nice
that you have a vegan option,

1197
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,798
but we're gonna have to reprint
these all in black.

1198
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,221
Bam!
I like it.

1199
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,645
And instead of releasing doves,
how about bats?

1200
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,264
Ta-da!

1201
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,640
Sweet! I got an idea.

1202
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,731
What if, instead of throwing a bouquet,
if I throw a batarang,

1203
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:19,989
and whoever's chest it lodges in
is the next to get married?

1204
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,156
Love it, babe.

1205
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,530
I did not expect this to be so much fun.

1206
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,613
Who would've thought
that this incorrigible gadabout

1207
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,947
would ever tie the knot?

1208
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,243
People change.
I change, like, every five seconds.

1209
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,336
Like this, boom.

1210
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,748
Oh. Uh-huh.

1211
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,831
I mean, this morning I was all alone.

1212
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,171
Living in a giant palace
with only a fussy British servant,

1213
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,259
and no one
who could really relate to me.

1214
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,133
I can really relate to that.

1215
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,465
But along the way, it got real.

1216
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,011
So, so real.

1217
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,010
Look at us, two different worlds.

1218
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,930
Two people who just need someone
who understands us

1219
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,001
To find real happiness.
To find real happiness.

1220
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,391
Whoa! Jinx.
Jinx!

1221
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,608
Jinx.
Jinx!

1222
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:59,403
And final jinx. Oh, you're so jinxed,
both of you, aren't you?

1223
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,822
So, let's stop this forever.

1224
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,524
Have you been here the whole time?

1225
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,319
Yeah. And I'm sad about it.

1226
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,555
So, then the centaur says,

1227
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,185
"That's not the half I'm talking about."

1228
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,087
Okay, target detected. I'm closing in.

1229
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,026
10-4, good buddy.
10-4 you, good buddy.

1230
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,444
You're the good buddy, buddy.

1231
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,321
Is that Bruce Willis?
Hey, guys.

1232
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,257
Good one, Bruce Willis!

1233
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,743
Get to the bridal suite
without getting brainwashed.

1234
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,178
Think hard thoughts.

1235
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,927
Brood. Brood. Brood!

1236
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,345
Brood!

1237
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,480
did you just say "brood"?

1238
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,057
No, "bride"! I need to see the bride.

1239
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,984
I'm sorry, no entry allowed.
Who are you?

1240
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,688
Who, me?

1241
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,234
I'm your worst nightmare.

1242
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,783
You're me when I'm late to school,

1243
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,444
and I forgot my homework
and my pants are made of pudding?

1244
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,321
No, I don't

1245
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,001
Mayhem!
Is everything in order for the ceremony?

1246
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:03,585
Yes, I will operate everything here
from this home entertainment center.

1247
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,632
There it is.

1248
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,722
You so get me.

1249
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,464
No. You so get me.

1250
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,174
No, no, no. You so get me.

1251
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,596
They brainwashed Batman.

1252
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,302
Wow, they're good, because he is dense.

1253
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,333
Let's both say the first word
that pops in our heads

1254
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,438
and see if it's the same.

1255
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,148
Okay.
One, two, three.

1256
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,318
Party!
Batman!

1257
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,567
Oh, that's crazy,
'cause Batman is all for partying.

1258
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,007
So, that's basically the same word.
Totally.

1259
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,397
Totally.

1260
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:25,616
Totally.
Totally.

1261
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,532
Final totally. And end it.

1262
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,180
We've gotta get upstairs.
The show's starting.

1263
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,945
Mayhem, do the boopity-bop-bop.

1264
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,566
Boopity-bop-bop.

1265
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,952
Bring down the house, my queen.

1266
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,542
This house is about to get tore up.

1267
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,967
We've been expecting you.

1268
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,892
Then expect the unexpected!

1269
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,473
did you expect this?

1270
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,516
Yes.

1271
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,066
Well, I expected your
expecting our expecting.

1272
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,319
And I expected your expecting
of my expecting your

1273
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,195
Wait, now I'm lost.

1274
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,203
Yay! Whee!

1275
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,952
I feel dizzy.

1276
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,765
Citizens of the 11 planets
of the Systar System!

1277
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,765
I ask you to put your hands together

1278
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,687
and apart, and together again

1279
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,019
in a repeated fashion.

1280
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,927
Broody Judy,
this is Stubble Trouble.

1281
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,613
What's your status?

1282
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,319
Hello? Lucy?

1283
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,162
She's not answering.

1284
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,698
Uh-oh.
Is that bad?

1285
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,491
An "uh-oh"? Never good.

1286
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:02,036
I thought she might've been more
brainwashed than she was letting on.

1287
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:05,456
No. No, not Lucy.
She is the toughest there is.

1288
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,049
Unless that song got stuck in her head.

1289
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,256
Lucy. Lucy?

1290
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,838
Come on, Lucy, where are you?

1291
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:16,426
Allow me to introduce

1292
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,768
The wedding party.

1293
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,224
Supporting the bride are Marie Curie

1294
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,019
Chocolate Bar

1295
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,394
The Tin Man

1296
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,568
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

1297
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,940
Bearing the rings, Banana.

1298
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,151
Okay, okay. You can do this.

1299
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,691
don't mess this

1300
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,902
I messed it up! I messed it up!

1301
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,736
No!

1302
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,350
I'm slipping! don't look at me!

1303
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,366
No!

1304
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,954
This is my nightmare!

1305
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,994
I had a dream about this!
don't look at me!

1306
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,878
And on the groom's side, MetalBeard

1307
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,922
Arr!

1308
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,553
Unikitty
Hi!

1309
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,362
And that spaceman, Benny.

1310
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:55,598
Spaceship!

1311
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,182
Oh, no, my friends.

1312
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,634
I barely recognize them.

1313
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,638
don't worry about your friends.
don't worry about Lucy.

1314
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,307
Focus on what you need to do.

1315
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:07,227
Visualize your success.

1316
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,652
He did it!

1317
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,990
He's so tough!

1318
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,201
We were so wrong about him.

1319
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,327
Way to go, Emmet.

1320
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,619
You've changed, perfectly.

1321
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,879
Your future is bright.

1322
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,004
Right now,
we gotta deal with the present.

1323
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,929
Wow! My own Rex Vest?

1324
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,344
Thanks for helping me change
for the tougher.

1325
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,634
don't thank me, thank yourself.

1326
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,972
Catch you on the flip. Hey-yo!

1327
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,434
Uh-oh.

1328
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,645
Ugh! I left my lasso in there!

1329
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:54,778
And now presenting
Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

1330
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,193
Hey!

1331
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,690
And also Batman.

1332
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,080
Commitment!

1333
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,126
You look beautiful.

1334
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,586
You look stunning.

1335
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,292
You are so right.

1336
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,463
I know this is a strange thing to say
to the person I'm about to marry,

1337
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,973
but I actually think I really like you.

1338
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,101
Samesies.

1339
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,722
Totally. Totally.
Totally.

1340
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,976
And bring it to a merciful end.
Can we start now?

1341
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,306
Supes!

1342
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,392
I'm getting hitched. Feeling jelly?

1343
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,897
Not at all!

1344
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,899
Oh, it's burning you up inside.

1345
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,902
You don't understand
who the queen is

1346
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,984
and what we're trying to do.

1347
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,365
She's trying to attack us, obviously.

1348
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,992
You attacked us!

1349
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,374
No, you started it.

1350
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,751
No, you started it.

1351
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,213
Well, now I'm gonna end it.

1352
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,303
Hello!
No!

1353
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,605
Help me. Please.

1354
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,506
Okay, I'm not falling for it. No. Uh-uh.

1355
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:17,652
No way.

1356
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,790
Nope. Mmm-mmm. Nope. Stop.

1357
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,332
Uh-uh. No. Ugh!

1358
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,294
No, I will not care about

1359
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,023
You do care.

1360
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,773
I knew there was some sweetness
under that darkness.

1361
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,154
What are you talking about?
You're the bad guys, okay?

1362
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,774
Maybe in your world.
But here, we don't see it that way.

1363
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,533
Okay, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

1364
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,531
Your whole costume and mask

1365
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,664
and all the stomping around
acting like you're the boss of us

1366
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,349
Because it's the only way you'll listen!

1367
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,909
I tried to wear a mask and talk tough,

1368
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,644
a language I thought you'd understand,
and it totally did not work.

1369
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,757
All we wanna do is
unite our worlds in peace.

1370
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,320
Why didn't you guys just tell us that?

1371
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,380
We tried.

1372
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,053
The queen sang a whole song
about how not evil she was.

1373
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,763
That was the truth?

1374
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,716
You guys are terrible communicators.

1375
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,517
I know.

1376
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,604
Come with me.

1377
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,930
For years, we've tried to join you,
to play with you.

1378
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,607
But you've always pushed us away.

1379
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:38,608
Now all of our fighting has brought us
to the brink of Armamageddon.

1380
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,069
But this wedding can change all that.

1381
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,193
Bring us together and stop Armamageddon.

1382
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,278
It'll make everything awesome again.

1383
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:50,161
But everything isn't awesome,
it's, it's, uh

1384
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,209
And now,

1385
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,331
the queen will change
into her original form.

1386
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,178
See? Friends.

1387
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,687
Ooh!

1388
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:17,143
The queen was from Emmet.

1389
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,728
Those bricks inspired our world.

1390
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,109
We exist because of you.

1391
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,657
You started it.

1392
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,484
We started it?

1393
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,324
You started everything.

1394
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,114
We look up to you. Always have.

1395
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:32,626
Wyldstyle!

1396
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:33,914
Where have you been?

1397
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,106
Oh, you guys aren't brainwashed?

1398
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,792
Brainwashed? No!

1399
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,423
We're just happy.
It's so much more fun here.

1400
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,877
There are so many more spaceships
on this adventure!

1401
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,928
And yet not nearly enough.

1402
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,057
Wait, if you guys are good,
then who's the bad guy?

1403
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,391
Stubble Trouble,
this is Alpha Wolf-Bro dog.

1404
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,726
I'm almost in Rextraction position.

1405
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,103
What's the color on the ground?

1406
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,601
Fuchsia.

1407
01:09:58,695 --> 01:09:59,695
Rex, I see Lucy.

1408
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,854
But she isn't taking down the shields.

1409
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,281
You don't need Lucy.
You don't need anyone.

1410
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,363
If you focus,
you can make a punch so powerful,

1411
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,870
you'll take it down, shields and all.

1412
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,284
You've got the power inside you.

1413
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,788
I can do this. I can do this.

1414
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,995
I can't not do this.

1415
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,293
So glad you aren't gonna destroy
this ceremony.

1416
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,750
If anything bad were to happen,
we'd all be doomed.

1417
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,214
But luckily, there's nothing
to worry about now.

1418
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,261
Oh, no.

1419
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,682
Emmet.

1420
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,308
Emmet!
Lucy, what are you doing?

1421
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,189
did you draw stubble dots on your face?

1422
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,936
What? No.

1423
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,189
Listen to me.
I was wrong about the queen.

1424
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,565
No. No, no, no.

1425
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,985
Rex was right about you.
No, you can't do this.

1426
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,848
You're just stopping me
because you're brainwashed.

1427
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:51,953
I'm not brainwashed!

1428
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,851
That's exactly what a brainwashed person
would say.

1429
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,286
Ahoy, Emmet.

1430
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:56,499
What happened to you?

1431
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,036
A betoughening, it seems.

1432
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,773
do you, Queen Watevra,

1433
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,798
take Batman to be your
special best partner?

1434
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,049
I do.

1435
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,173
Hurry up, kid,
we're running outta time.

1436
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,262
Guys, get out of my way.

1437
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:14,219
If you want to do harm to yon wedding,
you will have to get by we first.

1438
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:17,013
I'm sorry,
but this is for your own good.

1439
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,152
Emmet! Come back!

1440
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:27,991
don't do this.

1441
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,942
Don't listen to her!

1442
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,113
Almost there

1443
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,321
Oh, come on! No!
Not all the way down!

1444
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:35,743
Stop, Ems.

1445
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,874
You don't know what you're doing!

1446
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:39,710
This isn't the real you.

1447
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,245
This is the real me.

1448
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,837
The truth is, this is my real hair.

1449
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,669
I used to sing and dance
and have colorful hair.

1450
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,554
And I even loved
"Everything Is Awesome."

1451
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,093
No, no. You would've told me.

1452
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,259
You hate that music. It isn't you.

1453
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,553
Yes, I darkened my hair with marker,

1454
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,389
'cause I wanted people to think
I was cool and grown up.

1455
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,687
And then I tried to change you
into someone tough, too.

1456
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,820
And I was wrong.
I like you the way you were.

1457
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,694
Sweet, innocent, kind.

1458
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,035
The real Lucy would never say that.

1459
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,081
do you, Batman,

1460
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,916
take Queen Watevra

1461
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,022
to be your special best partner?

1462
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,787
I do, uh

1463
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,998
Emmet!

1464
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,237
What's happening?
What did I just do?

1465
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,236
Lucy!

1466
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,902
Come with me.
I got you, brother.

1467
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,197
Wait!

1468
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,535
Emmet.

1469
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:00,950
Lucy!

1470
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,131
What's happening?

1471
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,635
Where am I? What

1472
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,769
You shouldn't take my stuff!

1473
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,645
You crushed
my space laser cake thingy!

1474
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,817
Emmet?

1475
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,534
Rex, why are we leaving?

1476
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,785
We gotta save my friends.

1477
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,115
do we? They didn't come to save us
when we were all alone.

1478
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,035
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

1479
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,971
Look a little closer.
We're not so different.

1480
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,130
What, you and I?

1481
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,789
We and us.
Huh?

1482
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,083
Emmet, I'm you.

1483
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,341
But I'm me.

1484
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:56,468
I'm you from the future,
all grown up.

1485
01:13:56,557 --> 01:14:00,426
Wait, if you're me,
why do we sound so different?

1486
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,997
Why do we sound so different?

1487
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,813
It's a mind-blower, I know.

1488
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,816
That's why I was so cagey
in telling you my backstory.

1489
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,212
Actually, you kept bringing it up.

1490
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,694
There I was, you.

1491
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:14,489
In that little house-ship,
trying to make it through the Stairgate.

1492
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,993
This is the end!

1493
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:23,574
There was no handsome,
older version of myself to save me.

1494
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:24,668
Where's Emmet?

1495
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,355
Honey,
I'm on my way out the door,

1496
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,619
but the kids are fighting. Bye!

1497
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,793
Guys! Please,
find a way to play together,

1498
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,070
or I'm gonna have to ask you
to put it all into storage.

1499
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,529
But, Mom
No buts.

1500
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,510
This is the last time.

1501
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,839
Help! Anyone?

1502
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,841
Hello?

1503
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,769
No one heard me.
No one came for me.

1504
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,221
I was left behind. Forgotten.

1505
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:49,191
While the rest of my so-called friends
danced and sang

1506
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,693
at the hands of a monster.

1507
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:58,324
What could I have done
to avoid such a fate?

1508
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,153
We also have
to grow up sometime.

1509
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,289
Wyldstyle said you're
not tough enough to do this.

1510
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,950
This guy was a fierce warrior?

1511
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,620
Yeah, dude,
you're a total Hufflepuff.

1512
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:15,547
I was alone with nothing

1513
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:16,964
but anger.

1514
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,926
But anger was the key to my freedom.

1515
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,942
It was time for me to take a stand.

1516
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:37,780
I was real.

1517
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,368
I was no longer the naive Emmet
I used to be.

1518
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:47,454
I got myself a new vest,
a new head of hair,

1519
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,289
and a petulant attitude
towards everything that's lame.

1520
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,088
I gave myself a makeover
and became Rex.

1521
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,591
Radical EmmetXtreme.

1522
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:01,384
I was all grown up,
but I still wasn't free.

1523
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,476
I knew the only way to move past it

1524
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,270
was to make sure
it never happened in the first place.

1525
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,681
It's a dance party!

1526
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:15,978
And then I saw a way to undo
all the unbearable pain I'd experienced

1527
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,689
in one convoluted move

1528
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,357
Called time travel.

1529
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,530
Sorry, doc,
gonna need your deLorean.

1530
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:26,034
And, Bill, Ted, your phone booth.

1531
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,115
doctor Who's TARdlS.
H.G. Wells' bicycle thing.

1532
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,311
Whatever Skynet's been using.

1533
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,997
And this hot tub.

1534
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,828
I built a time-traveling spaceship

1535
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,042
and blasted into the past.

1536
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,897
I picked up a crew.

1537
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,646
Then I traveled
to the moment right before

1538
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:50,600
I was thrown into the cold,
dark truth of the world.

1539
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,938
And I found the one person
I wanted to protect.

1540
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,070
Whoa!
Me.

1541
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,748
I was following everything you said,
except for

1542
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,911
Everything after the part
where you said, "I'm you."

1543
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,537
Literally the first thing I said.

1544
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,012
This time travel stuff's
always kinda confusing.

1545
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,382
It's best just to go with it.

1546
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,293
You tricked me into hurting my friends?

1547
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,054
I didn't trick you.
I taught you to harden your heart,

1548
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,840
just like you asked me to.

1549
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,596
What did you make me do?

1550
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,679
What exactly is Armamageddon?

1551
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,836
You stole my guys.

1552
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:36,860
This is your fault.

1553
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,063
What's going on up here?

1554
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,604
She took my guys
and she ruined them.

1555
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,258
All right, all right!

1556
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,987
Armamageddon.

1557
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,660
Our-mama-gets-in?

1558
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,617
Okay. Really?

1559
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,747
Guys.

1560
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,622
I know I said it was the last time,
the last time,

1561
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,453
and the time before that.

1562
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,792
But this is the last

1563
01:17:58,883 --> 01:17:59,919
Last time.

1564
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,588
I need

1565
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,885
I stepped on a brick.

1566
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,533
I'm just

1567
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:10,847
I'm doing breathing,
so that it takes the pain away.

1568
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,015
I need

1569
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,265
Close to childbirth.

1570
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,316
Very close in pain level to childbirth.

1571
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,066
You guys know the consequences.

1572
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:25,282
I need you guys
to put all the bricks into storage.

1573
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:26,945
The Bin of Storajj.

1574
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,264
No, no, no, Mom, please.
Please, please. One more chance.

1575
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,075
Finn, I want you to go downstairs

1576
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:34,283
and put away your
dystopian wasteland thing.

1577
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,661
It's Apocalypseburg.
I don't care what it's called.

1578
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,916
Bianca, I need you to clean up here.

1579
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,588
Mom, it's not fair.

1580
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,235
Look,
I'm not the bad guy in this story.

1581
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,653
I'm just an amusing side character.

1582
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,071
And you're the one who took my guys.
How is it my fault?

1583
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,257
Hon, I could really
use your help up here.

1584
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:51,058
Kids, do the thing
Uh, what your mother said.

1585
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,552
You heard your
father's super helpful contribution.

1586
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:57,855
You ruined everything.

1587
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,896
I just wanted you to play with me.

1588
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:11,654
Emmet, what have you done?

1589
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,039
What have we done?

1590
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:16,620
It's called growing up.

1591
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,001
Isn't that what you wanted?

1592
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,999
No. I wanna save my friends.

1593
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,165
You don't have friends.
They're just pieces of plastic.

1594
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:25,528
You still want to go back to
the Matrix when you know the truth?

1595
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,552
What's the Matrix?

1596
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,009
It's a movie only cool, older,
mature dudes like us have seen.

1597
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,632
It's time to put away childish things.

1598
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,810
No.

1599
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,307
My friends may not be real to you,
but they're real to me.

1600
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:37,888
And they're my family.

1601
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,189
I won't give up on 'em.

1602
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:46,818
I am so disappointed in myself.

1603
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,026
I guess you're gonna have to become me
the hard way.

1604
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,943
Ain't something a couple of years

1605
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,455
in Undar of the dryar System won't fix.

1606
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:56,827
No. No, Rex.

1607
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,208
Or me, or you

1608
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,624
Please, no! No!

1609
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,497
One love.

1610
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,144
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

1611
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,481
It can't be this hopeless, can it?

1612
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,352
It can.

1613
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:45,000
It's Armamageddon!

1614
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,370
Look out, Chainsaw dave!

1615
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,966
It's Purgatory dave now! Whoa.

1616
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,265
I had theater tickets tonight! No!

1617
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,100
No! I was finally valued!

1618
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,643
Cannonball!

1619
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,687
Not gonna slip this time!
Not gonna slip this time!

1620
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,773
I did it! No!

1621
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,530
No! My queen!

1622
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,994
No, no, no!

1623
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:20,203
No! My queen!
No! don't leave me!

1624
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,330
My queen!

1625
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,583
No, no! But

1626
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,668
Stop it! I said stop!

1627
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,058
Can you please, please help us?

1628
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:22,977
War hardens the heart.

1629
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,949
Wait. What? No!

1630
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,701
This isn't the end! It can't be.

1631
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:41,349
This isn't one of those things
with a downer cliffhanger ending.

1632
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:43,748
Uh-uh. No, no.
This needs to have a happy ending.

1633
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,749
Seems like a downer to me.

1634
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,957
And so it ends for Batman,
the way it began.

1635
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,212
In darkness.

1636
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,693
Hey, uh, Supes.

1637
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,255
You're, uh, pressed against me.
It's no rush or anything.

1638
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,883
No! No, no, no!
It's only over if we give up.

1639
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:58,713
Well, it's over and we're giving up.

1640
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,687
We can get out of here
if we all rally together.

1641
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,183
No. It's too late.

1642
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,813
Nothing left to do except sing
a mature, sad song as we fade to black.

1643
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,975
Everything's not awesome

1644
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:12,151
Wait, what?
Wyldstyle was right.

1645
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,819
Everything's not cool

1646
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,614
I am so depressed

1647
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,779
Everything's not awesome

1648
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,488
Preach, brother.

1649
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:24,706
I think I finally get Radiohead

1650
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,537
Bro, you should check out Elliott Smith.

1651
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,918
What's the point?
There's no hope

1652
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,371
Awesomeness was a pipe dream

1653
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,789
Guys! Come on!

1654
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,299
My spirits be at the bottom
of the sea

1655
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:38,507
Love's not real
I just wanna eat carbs

1656
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,172
Pass the ice cream

1657
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,259
I'm not a thing you can just use
to fill emotional voids with.

1658
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,891
Stop! Everyone, okay, just listen.

1659
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,181
Everything's not awesome

1660
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,354
Uh, yeah, we know.
That's why we're singing about it.

1661
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,436
But that doesn't mean
That it's hopeless and bleak

1662
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:56,104
How so?

1663
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,485
Everything's not awesome

1664
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,943
But in my heart I believe

1665
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,112
I believe

1666
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,869
We can make things better

1667
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:10,168
If we stick together

1668
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,336
If we stick together

1669
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:17,168
Side by side, you and I
Can build it together

1670
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,173
Yeah, build it together

1671
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,175
Build it together

1672
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,597
Together forever

1673
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,015
All together now

1674
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:29,062
This song's gonna get
Stuck inside your

1675
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,519
Lucy! I'm over here!

1676
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,522
This song's gonna get
Stuck inside your

1677
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:40,649
This song's gonna get
Stuck inside your

1678
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,405
Heart

1679
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,806
I'm over here!

1680
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,269
Lucy?

1681
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,727
Nope.

1682
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:15,521
I tried to break your spirits,

1683
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,814
but now I'm gonna have to break you.

1684
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,104
No! No!
Chi-cha!

1685
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,690
This is gonna be easy.
You're weak.

1686
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:23,826
No.

1687
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,909
You're the one who's weak.

1688
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,246
Huh?

1689
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:39,628
I'll never grow up to be like you.

1690
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:43,340
It's easy to harden your heart.

1691
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,339
But to open it

1692
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,137
That's the toughest thing you can do.

1693
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,478
I'm gonna grow up.

1694
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,641
But I won't stop caring
about the people in my life.

1695
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,860
They may see the world differently,
but that's not bad.

1696
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,230
I think it's inspiring.

1697
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,667
It can be
whatever you want it to be.

1698
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:22,129
Because everything's

1699
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:23,759
Not awesome.

1700
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:31,556
But we can make it a little more awesome
if we remember

1701
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,513
We're not alone in this world.

1702
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,066
We're in it together.

1703
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,448
What's going on?

1704
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,752
I'm back, everybody!

1705
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,084
My queen!

1706
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,007
My queen!

1707
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,880
Watevs, I thought I lost you!

1708
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:11,182
Babe, I thought I lost you!

1709
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:13,601
All right, everyone.
You wanna get our worlds back?

1710
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:17,305
Then we've gotta save Emmet
and stop Rex dangervest.

1711
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:18,890
Everything's not awesome

1712
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:23,026
Things can't be awesome
All of the time

1713
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,523
It's an unrealistic expectation

1714
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:30,326
But that doesn't mean
We shouldn't try

1715
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,488
To make everything awesome

1716
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,621
In a less idealistic kind of way

1717
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,163
We should maybe aim for not bad

1718
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:43,877
'Cause not bad right now
Would be real great

1719
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,054
I'm driving the spaceship
I'm back in command

1720
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,488
I'm turning the switch, and I'm

1721
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,240
Calm down.
don't touch me when I'm spaceshipping!

1722
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,097
I like your "Stop Rex" plan, Lucy.

1723
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,805
One small question, who's Rex?

1724
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,060
This is gonna sound crazy,

1725
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:59,184
but I think he's a version of Emmet from
the future that I wanted him to be,

1726
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,881
but he turned out to be a real jerk.

1727
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,526
That's a really cute speech, Emmet,

1728
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,903
but actions speak louder than words.

1729
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,864
Yes, they do.

1730
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,959
My friends are coming to rescue me
and you can't stop them.

1731
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,379
Raptors, to the Rex-Wing fighters.

1732
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:27,209
don't let them near the dryar System.
Copy? Over.

1733
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:29,798
Uh-oh.

1734
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,056
Now, Unikitty!

1735
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:35,516
Glitter hairball missiles, go!

1736
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:46,769
Spaceships!

1737
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,859
Spaceship!

1738
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:54,110
Fire the sprinkle cannon!
You lollygagging lizards!

1739
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,914
No! I'm not gonna lose you again!

1740
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,625
I'm saving you.

1741
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,168
I'm sacrificing myself for you!

1742
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,871
I'm sacrificing myself.

1743
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,006
I am.
I am.

1744
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,460
I am!
I am!

1745
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,874
You know what?
I actually like this now.

1746
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:11,881
This isn't even happening.

1747
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,633
It's all just the expression

1748
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:17,718
of the death of imagination
in the subconscious of an adolescent!

1749
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:21,475
Ow! I don't even understand
what you're saying!

1750
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,685
don't worry. You don't have to.

1751
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,438
We're surrounded!

1752
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,965
We can't go any further!

1753
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:29,989
I'm not giving up!

1754
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,595
You won't make it! No!

1755
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,243
Guess your so-called friends
didn't save you after all.

1756
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,793
Oh, yeah?

1757
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,925
Huh?
Who you calling "so-called"?

1758
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,807
Lucy! You saved me!

1759
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,813
You came back for him.

1760
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:09,735
Well, you're too late.

1761
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:13,740
I'm just gonna keep going back in time
until I get this thing right.

1762
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,575
Heart attack!

1763
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:25,827
Goodbye!

1764
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:37,964
It's over, Rex.

1765
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,931
Emmet's never going to be you.

1766
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:44,387
But you can be like him.

1767
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:47,106
You don't have to be the bad guy.

1768
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:48,228
You can join us.

1769
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,311
I can't.

1770
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:53,195
What do you mean?

1771
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,447
She came back for you.

1772
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:59,326
You're never going to turn out like me,
which means

1773
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:02,746
I'm never going to exist.

1774
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:03,955
Wait. Wait, no.

1775
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,750
Look! I knew it!
Look, I'm Back To The Futuring!

1776
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,920
Totally called it.

1777
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,249
What's Back To The Futuring?

1778
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:12,169
It's a classic movie
older kids get to watch.

1779
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:14,584
And now it's happening to me.

1780
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:17,511
Come on! Take our hand,
while you still have a hand to take!

1781
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:20,923
That ain't how it works, kid.

1782
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,178
Rex

1783
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:23,686
It's okay.

1784
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,261
I'm proud of ya.

1785
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:27,805
And you're gonna grow up
to be better than me.

1786
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:32,442
But kind of thanks to me,
so I'm also great.

1787
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:37,027
And, Lucy,
thanks for coming back for us.

1788
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:40,159
Besides, this is a pretty righteous way
to go out!

1789
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,328
No regrets!

1790
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,256
Except, again,
not trademarking "no regrets."

1791
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:44,780
That was a mistake. One love.

1792
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,874
Just to be clear, that really happened.
You could see him, right?

1793
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,459
Uh-huh. Time to go?
Yeah.

1794
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:55,962
Hey, um

1795
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:58,677
I'm really sorry I tried to change you.

1796
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,992
Oh, I'm sorry I blew up
the wedding and almost banished everyone

1797
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,224
to an eternity of lifelessness
in a cosmic storage bin.

1798
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:04,393
It's fine.

1799
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,330
Can we be
special best friends still?

1800
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,390
Fo' eva.

1801
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,942
Hey! Hey!

1802
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,078
Pony's at the dance party.
"What kind of dance party is this?"

1803
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,951
In there! do not!

1804
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,907
Oh! We're going down!

1805
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,200
It's eating the queen!

1806
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:31,179
Honey, where are my pants?

1807
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:33,881
Take off!

1808
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:51,556
Good morning, Syspocalypstar.

1809
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:56,735
Good morning, sparkle babies!

1810
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:58,567
Hello!

1811
01:32:58,698 --> 01:32:59,905
Let's switch helmets.

1812
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:02,858
This makes
my voice sound awesome.

1813
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,362
Scarfield, deathface, MetalScratch

1814
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:07,992
Ripley, Connor, the other one.

1815
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,785
Wait a minute. Where's Jeff?

1816
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,208
Meow.

1817
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,873
Guys, hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
Terrible news!

1818
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:21,461
I missed a gimme putt
for birdie on seven.

1819
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:25,597
Anyway, you fix everything
that was going on? All the crazy stuff?

1820
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,099
Spaceship!

1821
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,509
Hot! Hot! Hot! Uh-oh.

1822
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,858
Yay!
Yeah!

1823
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,644
I've got a surprise for you.

1824
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,532
Our house!

1825
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:50,451
Planty!

1826
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,449
An original album
of "Everything Is Awesome"?

1827
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:55,582
Wait a minute. Is that

1828
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:15,056
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1829
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,522
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1830
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:24,031
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1831
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,993
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1832
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:29,913
It's the credits!

1833
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,406
Yeah, that's the best part

1834
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:32,618
When the movie ends

1835
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:33,872
And the reading starts!

1836
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,146
You can keep your adventure

1837
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,170
And all that action

1838
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,315
'Cause the credits of the film
Are the main attraction

1839
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,456
And don't even
Think about tryin' to leave

1840
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:41,735
Or you might miss a name

1841
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:42,795
Like Pam or Steve!

1842
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:45,009
Both incredible names
So let's stay in our seats

1843
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:47,679
And read a credible list
Of their incredible feats!

1844
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:49,118
'Cause we're all like a team

1845
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,258
Let's go.

1846
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:52,593
Livin' inside a dream

1847
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,387
You and me doin' our thing
And we'll fly

1848
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,105
Ooh

1849
01:34:57,358 --> 01:35:01,318
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1850
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:04,772
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1851
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,115
Woo-hoo!

1852
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:10,486
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1853
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,831
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1854
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:14,953
Woo-hoo!

1855
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:19,454
We gotta bring both sides together
Like champagne and leather

1856
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:23,628
Like birds of a feather
We'll fly

1857
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,677
Like rain on a sunny day

1858
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:29,005
Like a million dollars
That you're givin' away

1859
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:33,805
Like a stray dog on the freeway
We'll fly

1860
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:36,137
'Cause we're all like a team

1861
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,439
Livin' inside a dream

1862
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:40,140
You and me doin' our thing

1863
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:41,559
And we'll fly

1864
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,147
Ooh

1865
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,193
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1866
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,738
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1867
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,156
Woo-hoo!

1868
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:56,415
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1869
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:59,998
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1870
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,378
Woo-hoo!

1871
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:02,708
And we're back

1872
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,026
And still loving the credits

1873
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,945
Can't wait to see the one
About the person who edits

1874
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,382
And even better than that
Is who edits the credits

1875
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:10,658
I bet I'll never forget it
'Cause once I read it, then I read it

1876
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:13,015
I go to the theater
About 90 minutes late

1877
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,246
Skip the whole dang movie
'Cause the credits are great

1878
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,762
Now, if you're gonna be featured
On a movie song

1879
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:20,939
The credits is the part
That you wanna be on!

1880
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,226
Yeah,
I like to watch the credits.

1881
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,651
Super cool

1882
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:28,902
I can't believe
They got Chris Cunnington

1883
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:33,953
To be the stereoscopic supervisor

1884
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:37,706
Timothy Smith
Is my favorite producer

1885
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:42,037
I just came to see this movie
For the associate producing.

1886
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,126
Yes!

1887
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:47,966
Super cool!

1888
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:51,220
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1889
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:52,422
Yeah!

1890
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,599
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1891
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:56,843
Woo-hoo!

1892
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,311
Oh, snap
It's time for the actors

1893
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:01,559
The ones who elicit
All the joy and the laughter

1894
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,690
In the voiceover studio,
slaving away

1895
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,977
They had to work
Almost four whole hours a day

1896
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:07,193
It's a nightmare

1897
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:08,549
There's so much strain on the brain

1898
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:10,690
And their only compensation
Is the money and fame

1899
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,150
Without the human element
It's just zeroes and ones

1900
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,656
That's why when we pay 'em the money
We pay 'em tons

1901
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,408
And we're still in the song

1902
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,740
How long are these credits?
'Cause they seem long

1903
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,950
Which is great

1904
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:22,580
'Cause we la-la-la-la-love 'em

1905
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,982
I wanna wrap my arms around
And ha-ha-ha-ha-hug 'em

1906
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,006
If they were a person
I would marry the credits

1907
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:29,253
And on our honeymoon
We would play tennis in Venice

1908
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,822
I'll grow old with the credits
And share a code to our debits

1909
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,325
And then move outside of Paris
And raise a farm full of ferrets

1910
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:37,558
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1911
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:38,643
Super cool!

1912
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,721
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1913
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,142
Woo-hoo!

1914
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:47,105
Unbelievable, super cool
Outrageous and amazing

1915
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:48,278
Super cool!

1916
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:51,071
Phenomenal, fantastic
So incredible

1917
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,401
Woo-hoo!

1918
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:55,283
Everything is super cool right now

1919
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:56,986
Hey, hey

1920
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:59,746
Everything is awesome here right now

1921
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,407
Hey, hey

1922
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:06,454
Everything is super cool right now
Hey, hey, everything

1923
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:10,040
Everything is awesome here right now
Hey, hey

1924
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:11,375
Yeah!

1925
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:15,463
Everything is super cool right now
Hey, hey

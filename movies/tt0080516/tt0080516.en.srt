2
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,943
- You're very strong.
- OK, push!

3
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,402
This is the last holiday I'm ever
going on with you.

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,612
Where'd you get all those muscles?

5
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,529
- Come on.
- More, more, more!

6
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,198
- Don't quit now.
- How much further?

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,163
It's only a couple million more miles.

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,622
A couple of what?

9
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,163
Couple million more miles!

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,299
Now, right up here we're gonna stop.
Keep pushing. Don't quit.

11
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,754
Mexico next time.

12
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,090
- Hawaii's better.
- Yeah!

13
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,964
Whoa-ho!

14
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,179
Hold it, hold it. That's good.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,482
Phew!

16
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,734
Now what are you going to do?

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,815
- I'm gonna try to get us some...
- Help?

18
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,526
Help.

19
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,203
Come on. Let's have a snowball fight.

20
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,455
Oh, no! No!

21
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,329
Daddy! Daddy! Come on! Help me, Daddy!

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,791
Ow!

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,727
Yes, do you have the number for
Emergency Road Service?

24
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,623
Thank you, Stan.

25
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,009
If you want a hand with anything,
just give me a shout, Mr Russell.

26
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,511
I will, thanks.

27
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,175
Mr Russell?

28
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,312
Daddy!

29
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,064
Catch!

30
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,531
Mr Russell, I...

31
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,126
You know that this piece is going
to Seattle too, Estancia?

32
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,544
Yes, sir.

33
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,931
Good.

34
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,106
<i>At first, right after it happened,
I was in shock.</i>

35
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,492
I just functioned automatically.
I didn't feel anything.

36
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,946
And one day, it hit me...

37
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,707
Joanna and Kathy are gone.

38
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,211
I just kept walking around the apartment
saying it over and over,

39
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,496
"They're gone, they're gone."

40
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,005
I guess I was about half crazy.

41
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,259
But that's over four months ago and...

42
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,341
what I've got to do now is start
making demands of myself.

43
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,176
Well, your first class is next Monday.

44
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,841
I'll set up a meeting for you tomorrow
with some of the faculty.

45
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,180
You'll remember a lot of them.

46
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,719
11.00 OK for you?

47
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,310
That's fine, Robert, thanks.
Thanks for everything you've done.

48
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,193
Come on. Everyone's very excited
about you being here.

49
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,820
A well-known alumnus and distinguished
composer like yourself.

50
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,777
Says who?

51
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,159
Distinguished or not, we're glad you came.

52
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,117
- Give it to me! Come on! Give it to me!
- No!

53
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,248
OK, kids, keep it down.

54
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,750
Go into the kitchen,
get yourself some cookies.

55
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,880
By the way, how long are you planning
to stay in that hotel?

56
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,791
There's plenty of room for you here,
you know.

57
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,879
No, thanks, Eva.

58
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,512
I think I'm going to find a house to rent.
I've got some things coming out.

59
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,515
What I need is a place I can lock myself
in and pound away at the piano all night.

60
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,549
A place I can work.

61
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,266
I have a friend who works for
the Historical Preservation Society.

62
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,352
They have some old houses
that I'm sure they rent.

63
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,108
We'll see what we can come up with
for you.

64
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,563
Good.

65
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,174
- Mr Russell?
- Yes.

66
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,925
Hello, I'm Claire Norman.

67
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,132
Why don't you hop in and we'll drive up?

68
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,637
Fine.

69
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,007
When was the house last occupied?

70
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,673
Let's see. About 12 years ago.

71
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,514
It's been with the Historical Society
for the past 12 years.

72
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,272
There we go.

73
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,649
Wow!

74
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,950
There were plans at one time to turn it
into some kind of a museum.

75
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,662
But I don't know.
I guess a house was meant to be lived in.

76
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,415
Why hasn't it been lived in?

77
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,628
Well, I've only been with the Society
for a year now.

78
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,589
The impression I get is that they haven't
tried very hard with this place.

79
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,255
Of course, it does need a lot of work.

80
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,673
Yeah.

81
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,470
There's some pieces here
that are just stored.

82
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,229
You'd have your pick of them.

83
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,935
You know, whatever you'd like.

84
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,602
Kitchen's in here.

85
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,988
What does it take to maintain
a house of this size?

86
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,902
Oh, we have a man who looks after
all these places. Mr Tuttle.

87
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,030
And...

88
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,457
This is the music room.

89
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,879
This is really why I thought of you
and this house.

90
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,167
The piano was left here
when the Society took over.

91
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,336
Just too much trouble to move, really.

92
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,345
It must be in very bad shape.

93
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,926
What are the terms?

94
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,919
Sorry to disturb your composing.

95
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,207
That's all right, Mr Tuttle.
This has already been composed.

96
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,093
There's a man at the front, wants to
deliver a water storage tank.

97
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,173
Says you called him.

98
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,383
Oh, OK.

99
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,032
Have you managed to do any writing?

100
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,245
Yes. I'm still working on the second
movement. Same old problem.

101
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:35,252
Well, maybe the lectures will help,
get some new ideas going.

102
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,223
It's my understanding...

103
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,397
...that there are...

104
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,855
...23 students registered...

105
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,660
...for this series of lectures
on advanced musical form.

106
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,869
Now, we all know that
it's not raining outside.

107
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,458
And unless there's a fire

108
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,540
in some other part of the building
we don't know about,

109
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,207
there's an awful lot of people
here with nothing better to do.

110
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,634
However...

111
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,298
we'll know more after the second lecture.

112
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,221
I'm sure there are many of you...

113
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,182
who may recognise this.

114
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,971
Well, it sounds a little bit better with
an orchestra than it does with a piano.

115
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,474
No, you made it sound fine.
That was a great class.

116
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,135
John's secret is that he's a natural ham.

117
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,770
Don't go too far. Excuse me.

118
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,771
If you can't find your way back...

119
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,227
I'll send out a search party.

120
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,985
Hi!

121
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,074
I'd like you to meet my mother.

122
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,988
- How do you do, Mrs Norman?
- How do you do?

123
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,125
This is John Russell.
You remember the Chessman house?

124
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,039
Oh! Oh, yes.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr Russell.

125
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,923
How are you liking the place?

126
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,957
Fine.

127
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,423
It's so large.

128
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,461
Yes.

129
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,303
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

130
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,765
I'd like to introduce
Senator Joseph Carmichael...

131
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,306
My God!
He's going to make another speech.

132
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,352
What you're hearing is a lifelong
Republican commenting on a Democrat.

133
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,316
I see!

134
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,027
You know how I hate making speeches.

135
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,118
But sometimes,
on a very special occasion...

136
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,576
like raising money for our magnificent
symphony orchestra...

137
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,241
And weren't they fantastic tonight?

138
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,582
Damn right.

139
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,418
I was just going to get a drink.

140
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,923
I think I'll join you.

141
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,425
I'll be right back, Mother.

142
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,004
Thank you.

143
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,928
Thank you.

144
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,594
Actually, he's on our board
of directors

145
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,808
at the Historical Preservation
Society.

146
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,349
In fact, he's become our number one
philanthropist.

147
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,185
So, you're getting settled in then?

148
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,944
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

149
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,448
There's some things at the Society office
that belong to your house.

150
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,984
I'll see if I can dig them up for you.

151
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,278
I'm glad you took the house.

152
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,079
Mr Tuttle?

153
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,382
Mr Tuttle?

154
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,840
Yes, Mr Russell?

155
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,088
You frightened me.

156
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,224
Is anyone else here?

157
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,887
- Mrs Rissean cleaning today?
- No, sir, just me.

158
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,520
Thank you.

159
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,864
That's lovely.

160
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,157
The music.

161
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,417
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

162
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,454
Has the quality of a lullaby.

163
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,417
Yes, it is in a sort.

164
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,379
Well, here we are, as promised.

165
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:05,762
These are some assorted prints that
used to hang in the house somewhere.

166
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,842
Ah!

167
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,757
And this...

168
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,553
is an old restored photograph taken
at the front of the house.

169
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,892
- Isn't that remarkable?
- Beautiful.

170
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,861
I tried to call you first, but Information
isn't giving your number out yet.

171
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,319
That's a beautiful old piece.

172
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,949
Did you refinish it?

173
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,701
I didn't, no.

174
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,032
Oh!

175
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,950
Um, that was Kathy's, my daughter's.

176
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,969
Well, I guess I'd better be off.

177
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,925
I hope you like the prints.

178
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,464
Thank you.

179
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,809
You going riding?

180
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,390
Yes.

181
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,896
Do you ride?

182
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,059
John...

183
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,398
What's the matter?

184
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,565
I was just thinking about
my daughter, Kathy.

185
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,782
How much she loved horses.

186
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,040
<i>Mummy!</i>

187
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,168
Mummy!

188
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,572
An air lock somewhere.

189
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,911
It was too loud, too rhythmic.

190
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,546
Well, it's starting, at least.

191
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,255
Why would it happen two mornings in a row?

192
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,966
Precisely at 6.00?

193
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,303
Why does it go on for about half a minute
and then stop dead?

194
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,467
It doesn't make sense.

195
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,471
A furnace is like anything else,
Mr Russell.

196
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,480
It's got habits.

197
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,983
It's an old house.

198
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,190
It makes noises.

199
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,760
Well, very good.

200
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,718
We're still not together on the off beats.

201
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:40,511
And, darling, you're retarding a little
too much on the last four bars.

202
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,100
Otherwise, it was splendid.

203
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,059
- Good night.
- Good night. See you tomorrow.

204
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,802
What I'm driving at is...

205
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,059
Has anything like this happened
in the house before?

206
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,938
If so, to whom, when,
and what did they do about it?

207
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,984
Since I've been with the Society,
the house has been empty.

208
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,567
John, you're working very hard.

209
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,823
You've been through a terrible
emotional strain.

210
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,699
- Isn't it possible...?
- Hallucinating.

211
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,610
- Is that what you're going to say?
- Excuse me.

212
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,994
Minnie?

213
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,452
Claire, there's a call for you -
your mother.

214
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,207
- Should I tell her you're busy?
- I'll be right there.

215
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,335
Excuse me, John, just for a minute.

216
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,005
You know there's some question about
your lease, Mr Russell.

217
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,265
What do you mean?

218
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,014
That house shouldn't have been rented.

219
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,272
Miss Norman rushed those papers
through our attorney's office.

220
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,434
She did not use proper channels.

221
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,728
Why should anyone object?

222
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,731
That house is not fit to live in.

223
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,531
No one's been able to live in it.

224
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,244
It doesn't want people.

225
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,417
Then there has been trouble
in the house before?

226
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,877
Claire, listen, it's note for note.

227
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,414
Same tempo, even the same key.

228
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,332
What do you think?

229
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,092
I don't know.

230
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,129
It's a startling coincidence.

231
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,225
But that melody must have been
very popular at one time

232
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,226
or it wouldn't be on the music box.

233
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,979
I agree, but I swear I'd never heard it...

234
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,936
before I played it and recorded it
that day you came over.

235
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,068
No, there's something...

236
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,728
Something.

237
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,193
It's happened before here.
I'm not the first.

238
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,405
I went over the files very carefully,

239
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,786
all the way back to 1920.

240
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,538
Nothing out of the ordinary.

241
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,199
Miss Huxley.

242
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,743
Minnie's a highly eccentric old woman

243
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,787
- but she'd never...
- No.

244
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,707
She said the house didn't want people.
She's mistaken.

245
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,844
Whatever it is is trying
desperately to communicate.

246
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,596
The bangings, the water taps,
the broken window panes.

247
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,303
All the glass fell outward.
It had to be done from the inside.

248
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,971
Everything that's happened has been
designed to get me into that attic room.

249
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,061
I want to see it.

250
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,956
Look at that book on the desk there.

251
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:31,599
"CSB. January 4, 1909."

252
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,394
It's a little child's writing.

253
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,189
1909. Who could've lived here then?

254
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,776
That's where I found the music box,
on the mantel.

255
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,324
Look at this wheelchair.

256
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,915
Oh, my God!

257
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,623
It's so small.

258
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,000
What was this room?

259
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:45,460
<i>Former residents William Sarachino
and family. Architect.</i>

260
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,297
<i>Bought the place in 1965. Sold it in 1967.</i>

261
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:53,555
Purchased for the Society for Historical
Preservation November 1967,

262
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,684
through a generous grant from the
Carmichael Foundation. That's the senator?

263
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,141
- Yeah.
- Great philanthropist.

264
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,350
Now, where is the rest of this file?

265
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,265
Previous occupants...

266
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,317
No previous occupants listed.

267
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,854
There's nothing here before 1920.

268
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,368
Minnie, we're looking for the Chessman
house file, pre-1920.

269
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,528
Do you know where it is?

270
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,412
What is it you want to know?

271
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,165
We're trying to find out who lived in
the house in 1909.

272
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,338
A man named Barnard. A doctor.

273
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,839
Did he have any children, do you know?

274
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,048
I believe a son and a daughter.

275
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,213
There was some kind of family tragedy,
I think.

276
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,349
He sold the house in 1909.

277
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,931
1909? I'll set it up for you.

278
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,720
Fine, OK.

279
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,808
It's all ready to go.
The scanner's on the right.

280
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,146
Thank you so much.

281
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,693
Let's have a look here.

282
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,243
February 9th. These are want ads.

283
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,371
Financial page...

284
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,907
Real estate. More want ads.

285
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,505
Wait, wait, wait.

286
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,347
"Cora Barnard, seven-year-old daughter of
Dr Walter Barnard,

287
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,350
"prominent Seattle physician, was struck
and seriously injured

288
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,852

a passing coal cart

289
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,513

290
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,602
"She was hastened to
St Margaret's Hospital,

291
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,392
"where her condition remains grave."

292
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,527
So forth and so on.

293
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,985
Cora Barnard. CSB.

294
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,032
There!

295
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,796
"Cora Stuart Barnard, daughter of...

296
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,379
"succumbed in St Margaret's Hospital

297
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,135

298
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,045

299
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:02,264
"Miss Barnard will be interred in the
family plot in Brookfield Cemetery."

300
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,022
There's the doctor.

301
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,523
And his wife.

302
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,734
There's the brother, Lloyd.

303
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,203
This little girl, Cora...

304
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,998
...was killed in the street.

305
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,336
It was an accident
almost the same as Kathy.

306
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,592
What is it in that house, Claire?

307
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,096
What is it doing?
Why is it trying to reach me?

308
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,511
- John...
- Is it because of my daughter?

309
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,895
I can't go through all this again.

310
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,857
John, you must get out of that house.

311
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,755
<i>I believe everything you're saying,
Mr Russell.</i>

312
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,386
<i>The noises, the lights, the teleportation
of objects, all very familiar.</i>

313
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,421
<i>Fascinating stuff.</i>

314
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,511
- But the point is...
- Yeah?

315
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,017
What do I do now? I mean...

316
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:34,226
Ah! I tell you, off the record.

317
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:40,565
We have coming here many mediums
and spiritualists and so.

318
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,229
And we test them.

319
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,446
Now, 99% are the frauds.

320
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,532
But the 1%...

321
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,910
...astonishing!

322
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:56,077
- Hm! A medium.
- Mm-hm.

323
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,645
Hello.

324
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,654
- Mr Russell?
- Yes.

325
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,985
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

326
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,990
- My wife, Leah.
- Come in, please.

327
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,867
- Thank you.
- It's just to your left.

328
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,869
Could we have these lights off, please?

329
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,708
Thank you.

330
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,428
I thought I'd record what happens.

331
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,437
- Is that all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.

332
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,689
That's fine.
Mr Russell, would you sit there, please?

333
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,695
- Yes, of course.
- And I'll sit here.

334
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,072
Thank you.

335
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,414
You've suffered a cruel loss,
John Russell.

336
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,330
You've lost a wife and child.

337
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,045
The presence in this house is reaching
out to you through that loss.

338
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,886
The presence is very strong here.

339
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,812
It is a child's presence.

340
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,277
A child who is not at peace.

341
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,111
Who cannot rest.

342
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,293
The presence... is with us.

343
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,415
We sense that you are with us.

344
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,010
Will you talk to us?

345
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,765
Will you communicate with us?

346
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,141
Will you come through to us?

347
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:10,066
Will you speak to us?

348
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,570
We are here to help you.

349
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,834
What is your name?

350
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,797
Will you speak to us?

351
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,797
Yes.

352
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,719
What is your name?

353
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,765
Are you the child Cora?

354
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,358
Are you the child killed by the coal cart?

355
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,149
No.

356
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,571
What is your name?

357
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,039
Joseph.

358
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,297
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

359
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,543
How did you die?

360
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:23,932
Is there someone here you wish
to communicate with?

361
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,060
John.

362
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,899
Help. Help. Help.

363
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,578
Help. John. Help.

364
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,161
Help.

365
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,420
Mr Russell, will you sit over here now,
please?

366
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,480
Will you speak to John?

367
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:17,443
Will you tell us why you are not at rest?

368
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,702
Speak to John.

369
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,079
John is with us.

370
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,299
What do you want of John?

371
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,172
Why do you feel no peace?

372
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,067
Why do you remain in this house, Joseph?

373
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,813
What is in this house?

374
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,404
Speak to John.

375
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,530
John is with us.

376
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,790
How did you die?

377
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,745
Did you die in this house?

378
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,213
Why do you remain in this house?

379
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,550
Joseph, how did you die?

380
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,642
Joseph, did you die in this house?

381

I'm sorry, I...

445
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,847
I shouldn't have called you.
It's just that I needed someone.

446
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,768
I know, I know.

447
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,648
I wrote some words on a paper.

448
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:44,404
I wrote "Sacred Heart".

449
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,837
There used to be a county orphanage...

450
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,668
named Sacred Heart.

451
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,092
It was closed down years ago.

452
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,424
Orphanage?

453
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,678
Yes.

454
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,226
Their child, Joseph Carmichael.

455
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,228
He was murdered in this house
in the attic.

456
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,405
And buried.

457
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:24,281
- And then an orphan...
- Stop it, John!

458
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,911
Just for one minute, please!

459
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,549
Miss Huxley's on the phone, Senator.

460
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,553
It's the third time she's called this
morning. She says it's important.

461
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,088
All right, I'll take it.

462
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,859
Hello, Minnie. How are you?

463
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,191
I'm fine.

464
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,482
They've been going through the files.

465
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,902
Let me have that name again.

466
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,947
John...

467
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,500
...Russell.

468
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,037
I'm very glad to be of help, as you know.

469
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,257
Goodbye.

470
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:49,297
This is the senator's campaign bio
of 1960.

471
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,217
I got it from the main library,
had them Xerox it for me.

472
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,476
You found something?

473
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,854
It's some kind of a rough retrospective
that somebody drew up

474
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,686
when they were thinking about
turning the house into a museum.

475
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:04,525
Richard Carmichael and family occupied
the house 1899 to 1906.

476
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,781
Richard was the senator's father.

477
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:11,035
His mother died when he was born in 1900.

478
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,071
It's all in there.

479
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,456
Look at the part about his illness.

480
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,957
Um...

481
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,119
"Joe Carmichael, their son, at age three

482
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,083
"was struck down with a form of
atrophic arthritis..."

483
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,794
A little further down.

484
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:27,335
"It was decided to send little Joe to
the famed Nordbach Sanatorium

for special therapy.

486

01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,314
See how it might have been done?

489
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,151
Richard's son, a sick child,

490
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,108
was murdered by his father
and buried secretly.

491
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,277
Then the substitute, a six-year-old
orphan, was put in his place,

492
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,036
shipped right overseas right away,

493
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,412
with the father attending.

494
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,244
It all worked for them.

495
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,329
Even the war worked.

496
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,164
It kept him in Switzerland till 1918.

497
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,545
He came back here, he was 18 years old.

498
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,207
Who was going to know that he wasn't
the real son?

499
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,842
If he wasn't crippled any more,
it was because he was cured.

500
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,128
John...

501
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,595
Do you think he knows about the murder
and about the replacement?

502
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,725
I don't know.

503
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,729
How could any father do such a thing?

504
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,557
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer.

505
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:28,105
She was the daughter of HT Spencer,
who founded the Spencer Carmichael empire.

506
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:32,070
He died in 1905. He was a zillionaire.

507
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,654
His will!

508
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,865
His will might be very interesting.

509
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,201
There must be a copy of it
in the hall of records.

510
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,411
I'm also going to try to find out
if there was a ranch,

511
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,453
a Spencer or a Carmichael ranch
somewhere.

512
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,589
Yeah, a ranch with a well.

513
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,922
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle

514
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:57,432
which is open to the part of the city
where the Carmichael ranch was located.

515
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,514
- Right here.
- What does that little mark there mean?

516
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:05,274
According to the legend, here, that was
the location of a well on that property.

517
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,399
I see.

518
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:10,905
And in the 1914 atlas which is opened here
to the same area,

519
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:14,989
there's been one large lot
that's apparently been sold off,

520
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,572
but the property is very much the same

521
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,487
and the location of the well
is still given.

522
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,781
Right. Exactly.

523
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,701
The 1928 atlas was quite a change.

524
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,165
There's further subdivision
of the property.

525
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:29,628
The symbol for the well has disappeared
and a house has been built here.

526
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,688
The ranch is listed in the will.

527
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,439
It's part of the inheritance of
little Joseph Carmichael,

528
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,898
all of five years old at the time.

529
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,983
He got just about everything.

530
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,898
What about the father, Richard?

531
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,316
Bypassed.

532
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,907
Except as his son's guardian,
and therefore trustee of the estate.

533
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,368
Well, old man Spencer's daughter
was dead

534
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,534
and, obviously, he wasn't too fond of
his son-in-law.

535
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,122
Yes, but wait.

536
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,504
Richard doesn't get any money

537
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:54,588
but he still controls his son,
and his son is worth a fortune.

538
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,252
Unless...

539
01:06:56,304 --> 01:07:00,924
Unless, for some reason, the boy dies
before attaining the age of 21.

540
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,592
In that case, the entire estate
goes to charity.

541
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,519
That would have shut Richard out
completely

542
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:11,355
and there he was with a son who was weak,
sickly, bedridden, couldn't even walk.

543
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:16,071
He must have decided not to take
a chance on the boy.

544
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,949
The money was just too tempting.

545
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,130
What are you going to tell her?

546
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,390
About the well under the house
and the body.

547
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,391
And the medal with the name on it?

548
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,098
No. Nothing about Carmichael.

549
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,896
She'll think you're crazy.

550
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,557
You'll tell her I'm not.

551
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,225
Hmm!

552
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,111
Good evening, Mrs Grey. I'm John Russell.
This is Miss Norman.

553
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:15,749
Mr Russell, I wouldn't have listened
to your story for two minutes.

554
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,465
I wouldn't have let you in here, but for
something you said on the phone earlier.

555
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:25,349
You said that this séance affair of yours
happened three nights ago.

556
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,759
- Right?
- That's right.

557
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,014
Well, three nights ago, on Monday night...

558
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,645
...Linda, my daughter, woke up screaming

559
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,188
just after midnight.

560
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,277
She'd had a nightmare.

561
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:44,785
When I went in to her, she was hysterical,
she was sobbing.

562
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,287
I'd never seen her like that before.

563
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,699
Oh, I mean, she'd had nightmares before,
but not...

564
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,164
She said she'd seen a boy.

565
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,834
Very small, very thin.

566
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,878
Almost gnome-like.

567
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:06,264
And he was trying to come up
through the floor.

568
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,389
And he kept staring at her.

569
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,764
Here, in the middle.

570
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:19,190
She hasn't been in this room since,
won't come near it. She sleeps with me.

571
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,605
What we want is...

572
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,901
What you want, Mr Russell,
is to tear this room apart.

573
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:31,240
Well, I have your phone number,
Mr Russell. I'll have to think about it.

574
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,397
Linda!

575
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,700
What the hell's going on? Linda!

576
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,465
They're still digging.

577
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:55,931
But they found the well.

578
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,514
OK.

579
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,776
Did you find anything?

580
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:08,940
No, nothing yet.
This is Tony, Mrs Grey's son. Miss Norman.

581
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,529
- Hello.
- Hi.

582
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,431
Give me that flashlight, will you?

583
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,473
Sure.

584
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,563
I think I found something.

585
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,562
What is it?

586
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,080
It's a hand.

587
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,415
What?

588
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,248
It's a hand.

589
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,505
I'll call the police.

590
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,218
There's nothing more?

591
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:22,847
Doesn't look like it.

592
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,141
You think there might be
something else down there?

593
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,478
No.

594
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,942
Assistant coroner said those bones had
been down there maybe 50 years.

595
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,107
Do you have some idea who that child was?

596
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,151
No, not really.

597
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:37,034
What's "not really" mean?

598
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,863
No.

599
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,708
I'm going to want statements
from everybody.

600
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,746
Mrs Grey, do you have some other place
you could stay for tonight?

601
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,914
- Yes, it's all been arranged.
- Good.

602
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,261
I think you should have told them.

603
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:06,273
It's gotta be there. Without that medal,
there's no evidence, there's nothing.

604
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:07,899
You have the tape.

605
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:12,109
Tapes can be altered. They know that.
Did you see the expression on his face?

606
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,864
It was obvious you were holding
something back.

607
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,650
I'll say.

608
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:20,491
Look, it's very late. Let me go get some
rest, and I'll talk to you in the morning.

609
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,576
- Fine. Drive carefully.
- You too.

610
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,173
What's the matter?

611
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:33,351
"St Paul's Church, September 8, 1900.

612
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,607
"Joseph Patrick Carmichael."

613
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,643
It was there.

614
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,527
It was there.

615
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,237
You have to show it to the police.

616
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,324
It's the only piece of solid evidence
we've got.

617
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,534
They didn't see me dig it up,
they couldn't find it.

618
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,199
Why should they believe it was there?

619
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,368
You can't just ignore them.

620
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,381
The police aren't going to trouble
themselves with a 70-year-old case.

621
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:02,293
- Still, it's an unsolved murder.
- Nah.

622
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,712
Whatever's to be done has to be
done by me.

623
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,676
I've got to get to Carmichael.

624
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:11,264
- He won't see you now.
- He'll see me.

625
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,770
Senator!

626
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,527
- Hey, hold it right there! Hold up.
- Mr Carmichael!

627
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,780
- Senator...
- Wait a minute, now.

628
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,281
Get the hell out of my way.

629
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:28,945
Senator, I'm John Russell.
I'm living in your house.

630
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,578
Senator, look.

631
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:32,990
I want to show him that.
I want to talk to him.

632
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,750
Let me go! Senator!

633
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,662
Look at this medal. It's a baptism medal.

634
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,421
It's got your name on it.

635
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:41,798
- You got him?
- We got him.

636
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,174
It was buried with a body.

637
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,387
A little boy.

638
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,923
Senator! The police know about it.

639
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:01,022
Who was that? Some kind of crackpot?

640
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,694
I've no idea.

641
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,106
Never mind. Come on.

642
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,529
Dale...

643
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:19,203
I want you to radio back to police
headquarters, Captain DeWitt.

644
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,794
Ask him to call me in Spokane
at this number.

645
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,548
Yes, sir.

646
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:15,266
You goddamn son of a bitch.

647
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,056
What is it you want?

648
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,897
What do you want from me?

649
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,564
I've done everything I can do!

650
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,531
There's nothing more to do.

651
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,195
Mr Russell?

652
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:14,859
Yes?

653
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:16,778
My name is DeWitt, Captain DeWitt.

654
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,071
Oh, yes.

655
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,785
I'd like to talk to you if I may.

656
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,574
All right. Come in.

657
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,254
Quite a house.

658
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,793
Yes.

659
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:37,678
You're a musician, a composer,
is that right, Mr Russell?

660
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:38,967
Yes.

661
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,103
You're teaching a course at the faculty
of music out of the university?

662
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,638
That's right.

663
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,942
Is this where you held your séance?

664
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:51,570
What was it you wanted to talk
to me about?

665
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:58,029
You were out at Boeing Airfield
this morning, Mr Russell.

666
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:03,451
They tell me you caused quite a scene,
screaming, yelling, acting like a lunatic.

667
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:08,497
Sergeant Durban tells me you were
up to some strange things last night too.

668
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,792
Seems you dug up some bones
under a lady's house

669
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,134
that some ghostly voice told you
were there, is that correct?

670
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:21,097
Only Sergeant Durban said you told him
you had no idea who those bones were,

671
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:22,761
no idea at all.

672
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:24,645
Now, it seems...

673
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:27,683
It seems a little odd, then,
don't you think,

674
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,477
that you'd go charging across
that airfield this morning

675
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,067
making crazy accusations against
Senator Carmichael?

676
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,196
I made no accusations.

677
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:37,450
Senator Carmichael, who has served
this state for 36 years...

678
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,781
- I didn't accuse him of any...
- and is not about to give in

679
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,571
to any dirty little blackmail scheme.

680
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,955
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.

681
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,413
What are you talking about?

682
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:53,250
I understand you lost your wife
and daughter a little while ago.

683
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,043
Maybe it shook you up.

684
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,631
Maybe too much.

685
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,387
Maybe you need help.

686
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:01,925
I'd like you to leave now.

687
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,684
We can see that you get it.

688
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:06,307
Do you understand what I'm saying?

689
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:07,346
Out, now.

690
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,935
Listen to me, Russell.

691
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:15,647
You've got something of the senator's.
He wants it back.

692
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:19,363
It's a little gold medal,
a family heirloom. He lost it.

693
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,320
He thinks you've got it.

694
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,081
I don't know what you're talking about.

695
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:35,542
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,
but I am so damn mad.

696
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:37,551
This morn...

697
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,464
This is Captain DeWitt.
He's with the police.

698
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,803
You're... Miss Norman?

699
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,055
Yes.

700
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,898
I take it now, or I come back in an hour
with a warrant and a crew

701
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,479
and we tear this place apart.

702
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:56,238
Tear this place apart?
What's going on here?

703
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,772
I'll be here.

704
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,242
Suit yourself.

705
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,248
Well, what was that all about?

706
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:10,160
Senator Carmichael thinks
he's being blackmailed.

707
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,712
They've cancelled your lease.

708
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,299
They've forced me to resign
from the society.

709
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:24,057
No explanation, no reason, nothing,
just "get out".

710
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,684
I have an appointment with the head
of the board of directors.

711
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,141
I'll see what I can find out.

712
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,226
I'll call you and let you know.

713
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:00,945
Yes?

714
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,151
Yes, Claire?

715
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,068
I was driving by, and I recognised
the car.

716
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,610
I don't know how it happened.

717
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,952
I don't know how it could have happened.
There are no other cars. There's nothing.

718
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,787
And it's upside down in the middle
of the road.

719
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,873
It's that man, that policeman who was
just at your house.

720
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,663
DeWitt. He's dead.

721
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,628
Carmichael. Any messages?

722
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,757
Oh, yes. Captain DeWitt. What'd he say?

723
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,178
What?

724
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:15,557
Yeah.

725
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,271
Oh, my God!

726
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,608
What?

727
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:26,443
Who?

728
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:29,279
Russell.

729
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,325
All right.

730
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,667
Let me have that number.

731
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,094
John Russell.

732
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,103
The senator's expecting you.

733
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,454
- Still busy?
- Yes.

734
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,010
Where are you going?

735
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,472
- I'll be back in a little while, Mum.
- Claire!

736
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,240
All right. Just what the hell do you want?

737
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,071
You must have some idea.

738
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,657
Otherwise I wouldn't have got
past the door.

739
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:57,992
Well, I'm a busy man. Make it fast.

740
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,545
The house on Chessman Park.

741
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:08,045
Your family lived there until 1906.

742
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:14,305
It's had a history of...
strange happenings.

743
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,434
There's something in that house,
a manifestation.

744
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,771
This afternoon, Captain DeWitt came
to see me,

745
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,478
presumably on your behalf...

746
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:30,188
...so you must have known what's happened,
at least as much as DeWitt could tell you.

747
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:36,532
The disturbances, the séance,
the bones found in the well.

748
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,790
I tried to talk to you at the airport.

749
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:43,872
I showed you this.

750
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,249
DeWitt said you'd lost it.

751
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,341
I found it in the grave...

752
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:58,015
...where the child is buried.

753
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:06,103
There's no logical explanation for
what I'm going to say to you now.

754
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:09,727
The boy was badly crippled.

755
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:15,316
I believe he was killed
in an attic room of that house.

756
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,612
I...

757
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,328
I saw what happened.

758
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,414
And I believe it was Richard Carmichael,
your father...

759
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,801
...who murdered the boy,
his natural son.

760
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,677
Joseph Carmichael.

761
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:41,680
Then there was a substitution
from the Sacred Heart Orphanage.

762
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:44,391
The boy was taken to Europe,

763
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:49,150
cured miraculously
and returned to inherit an empire.

764
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,104
That changeling was you.

765
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:10,046
So... that's your story.

766
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,714
Whatever you want to call it.

767
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,466
How much?

768
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:20,757
My God!

769
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:24,428
All right, how much do you want for
this farce that you've concocted?

770
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,391
This isn't blackmail.

771
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,147
I've been dealing with vermin
like you for years.

772
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:34,153
You wait your chance, then you come
in with a story so patently incredible...

773
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,563
Truth terrifies you, doesn't it?

774
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,277
It's the truth.

775
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,237
- It won't be buried.
- Get out.

776
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:41,197
None of this belongs to you.

777
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,784
Get out of here with your filthy lies.

778
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,323
I should have gone to that dead child.

779
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,662
You suspected something was wrong
all your life.

780
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,077
You're not Joseph Carmichael.

781
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:53,339
You're the beneficiary of the cruellest
kind of murder. Murder for profit.

782
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,124
No!

783
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:59,128
My father was not a murderer.

784
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:03,261
Nobody in this world can say that.

785
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,762
My father was a great man.

786
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,931
He was a loving man.

787
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:16,688
And for you to come in here
and accuse him of...

788
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,572
How can you?

789
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:27,364
Damn you!

790
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:34,372
I will not allow you to slander
his good name.

791
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:47,177
These documents are on file with the city.

792
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,354
This is a tape of the séance.

793
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:54,812
There's no copy.

794
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,983
Take it. I've done what I had to do.

795
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,363
I'm sorry.

796
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,495
Russell...

797
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:15,872
If I find that you've breathed
one word of this...

798
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:19,759
one word to anyone...

799
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:22,546
you'll wish you'd never come
into this world.

800
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,111
What was all that shouting about?

801
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,367
Nothing.

802
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,453
Get out.

803
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:53,993
Leave me alone.

804
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:40,881
John?

805
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,171
I tried to call...

806
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,426
John?

807
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:56,434
<i>This isn't like me.</i>

808
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:59,316
John, where are you?

809
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,499
John, what are you doing?

810
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:19,953
John?

811
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:00,661
John?

812
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,372
Please.

813
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,040
I don't want to come up there.

814
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,584
<i>Claire?</i>

815
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:08,965
John?

816
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,813
John?

817
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,814
I called you. I called you.

818
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:04,600
I thought you were here.

819
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,244
I thought you were here.

820
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,655
I kept calling you and calling you.

821
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,075
It's OK. Just calm down.

822
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:22,663
I want you to wait in the car for me.

823
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,829
No, you're not going back in there!

824
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,668
No, please, please, don't!

825
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:29,083
Claire, Claire. Get ahold of yourself.

826
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:31,502
Go on. I'll be right back. Don't worry.

827
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:37,808
Joseph, no!

828
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:16,567
<i>Father!</i>

829
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,614
<i>My medal!</i>

830
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:26,249
<i>My medal!</i>

831
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,462
<i>Father, Father!</i>

832
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:34,550
<i>Father! My medal!</i>

833
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:38,213
<i>My medal!</i>

834
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:39,638
<i>My medal!</i>

835
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:32,184
John!

836
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,237
John!

837
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:06,850
<i>Father! Father!</i>

838
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,436
<i>Father...</i>

839
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:14,895
<i>Father, don't!</i>

840
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,395
<i>Help!</i>

841
01:41:19,305 --> 01:42:19,346

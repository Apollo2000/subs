2
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,975
Lock on to him, R2.

3
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,517
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-

4
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,853
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

5
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:17,473
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

6
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,697
- Oddball, do you copy?
- <i>Copy, Red Leader.</i>

7
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:30,070
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

8
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:32,079
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

9
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,117
Set S-foils in attack position.

10
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,050
This is where the fun begins.

11
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:52,177
Let them pass between us.

12
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,076
They're all over me.

13
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,206
- <i>Get them off my-</i>
- I'm gonna go help them out.

14
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,702
<i>No. They are doing their job</i>
<i>so we can do ours.</i>

15
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,593
Missiles. Pull up.

16
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,226
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

17
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,064
All right, R4. No, no.
Nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,413
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,257
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,761
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,524
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- <i>I see them.</i>

22
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:27,770
Buzz droids.

23
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:37,414
R4, be careful. You have a-

24
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,457
Oh, dear.

25
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:46,423
They're shutting down
all the controls.

26
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,673
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

27
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:50,961
<i>The mission.</i>
<i>Get to the command ship.</i>

28
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,504
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

29
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,686
In the name of-

30
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:06,975
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

31
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:16,162
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

32
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,332
They're all over me. Anakin!

33
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,048
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

34
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,504
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

35
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:34,797
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

36
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:46,646
Get him, R2.

37
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,071
Watch out.

38
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:57,027
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.

39
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:06,542
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

40
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,756
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

41
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:14,926
Have you noticed
the shields are still up?

42
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:16,431
Sorry, Master.

43
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,683
I have a bad feeling about this.

44
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,414
There they are. Get them.

45
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:57,218
R2, locate the chancellor.

46
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:08,275
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there-

47
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,437
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

48
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,480
I sense Count Dooku.

49
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:16,236
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

50
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,902
Spring the trap.

51
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,827
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

52
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,832
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

53
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,634
What's the situation, Captain?

54
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,684
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

55
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:51,101
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

56
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,313
Destroyers.

57
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,376
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

58
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,376
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

59
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,839
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

60
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,429
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

61
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,853
There's more than
one way out of here.

62
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,815
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

63
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,776
R2, activate elevator 31174.

64
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,816
- <i>Come in, R2.</i>
- What that?

65
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,825
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

66
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:46,369
<i>R2, activate</i>
<i>the elevator number 31174.</i>

67
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,209
Get back to work. That nothin'.

68
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,253
<i>Activate the elevator 31174.</i>

69
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:54,381
R2-

70
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,970
Always on the move.

71
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:06,053
<i>R2, switch on the comlink.</i>
<i>R2, can you hear me?</i>

72
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,228
<i>R2?</i>

73
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:12,548
R2! R2!

74
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,074
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

75
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,408
Hands up, Jedi.

76
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,695
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

77
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:30,780
<i>R2, do you hear me?</i>
<i>R2, we need to be going up, not down.</i>

78
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:36,918
Hey, you!

79
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,757
That's better.

80
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:47,429
You stupid little astro droid.

81
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,238
Oh, it's you.

82
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,158
My eyes! My eyes!

83
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:07,618
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been-

84
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,739
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

85
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,783
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

86
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,329
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

87
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:52,916
Count Dooku.

88
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:01,503
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

89
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:13,679
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

90
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,849
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

91
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:20,817
Your swords, please.

92
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:24,396
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

93
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,738
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

94
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:39,662
I've been looking forward to this.

95
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:42,964
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

96
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,543
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

97
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:07,657
Get-

98
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:36,936
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

99
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:41,018
You have hate.
You have anger.

100
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,727
But you don't use them.

101
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:05,788
Good, Anakin. Good.

102
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,255
Kill him.

103
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:12,305
Kill him now.

104
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:19,854
I shouldn't.

105
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:23,812
Do it.

106
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,789
You did well, Anakin.

107
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,080
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

108
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,292
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

109
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:48,293
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

110
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:53,512
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

111
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,762
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

112
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,516
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

113
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,898
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

114
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,279
Anakin, there's no time.

115
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,735
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

116
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:21,747
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

117
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,915
His fate will be the same as ours.

118
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,166
Prepare for attack!

119
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,380
All batteries, fire! Fire!

120
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,350
Elevator's not working.

121
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,735
R2, activate elevator 3224.

122
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:15,718
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

123
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:37,113
Magnetize! Magnetize!

124
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,993
Fire the emergency booster engines.

125
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,923
We're levelling out, sir.

126
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,850
Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.

127
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:14,559
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

128
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:16,855
- What is that?
- Oops.

129
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:18,948
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

130
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:20,274
Too late. Jump!

131
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:38,252
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

132
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:40,463
R2, get down here.

133
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,848
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

134
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,559
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

135
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,017
Activate ray shields.

136
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,270
Ray shields.

137
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:01,278
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

138
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,739
Apparently not.

139
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:07,914
- I say patience.
- Patience?

140
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:11,284
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

141
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,125
and then he'll release
the ray shields.

142
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:23,547
See? No problem.

143
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,471
Don't move.

144
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:32,730
Do you have a plan B?

145
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,007
Ah, yes.

146
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,943
The negotiator.

147
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:48,289
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

148
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,578
Excuse me.

149
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:53,409
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

150
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,213
And-

151
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,831
Anakin Skywalker.

152
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:04,674
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

153
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:11,099
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

154
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,018
Jedi scum.

155
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,602
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

156
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:28,032
Your lightsabres will make
a fine addition to my collection.

157
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:31,829
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

158
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:32,959
R2.

159
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:39,340
Crush them!

160
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,799
Make them suffer!

161
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,509
Come. Now!

162
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,801
Stay at your stations!

163
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,358
Get him! Get him!

164
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,131
Run!

165
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:25,676
Don't bother with them.

166
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:28,093
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,028
You lose, General Kenobi.

168
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,925
Get out of here! Run!

169
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,565
Time to abandon ship.

170
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:32,199
All the escape pods
have been launched.

171
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,366
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?

172
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:38,204
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

173
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:42,167
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

174
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:43,460
Strap yourselves in.

175
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:48,094
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

176
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:06,986
We lost something.

177
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:09,570
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

178
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,825
Now we're really picking up speed.

179
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,299
Eight plus 60.

180
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:30,710
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

181
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,010
Steady.

182
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,443
Easy, R2.

183
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:54,661
5000.

184
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,322
Fire ships on the left and the right.

185
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,161
- We'll take you in.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

186
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:06,335
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

187
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,787
Another happy landing.

188
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:11,064
Coming, Master?

189
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:15,614
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

190
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:18,151
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

191
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:22,119
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

192
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:25,369
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

193
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:27,924
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

194
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,914
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

195
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,501
All because of your training.

196
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:36,134
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

197
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:39,632
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

198
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:43,468
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

199
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:44,885
Ninth time.

200
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:49,818
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

201
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,690
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

202
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,697
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

203
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,492
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

204
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:09,125
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

205
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:13,549
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

206
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:15,550
And I assure you...

207
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:19,378
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

208
00:25:19,515 --> 00:25:23,560
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

209
00:25:25,062 --> 00:25:26,936
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

210
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:30,018
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

211
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,274
Thank you, Senator Organa.

212
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:35,942
It couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

213
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,573
Now there I agree with you.

214
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:41,406
In fact, I could do with
a tune-up myself.

215
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:45,749
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

216
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,283
I will do everything
I can in the senate.

217
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:52,122
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

218
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:08,936
I've missed you, Padmé.

219
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,352
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

220
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:15,359
I'm all right.

221
00:26:16,572 --> 00:26:19,110
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

222
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,029
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

223
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:25,495
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

224
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:28,244
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

225
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:31,827
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

226
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:34,204
Anakin, don't say things like that.

227
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:46,640
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

228
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,892
What's going on?

229
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:53,140
Something wonderful has happened.

230
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:58,402
Ani, I'm pregnant.

231
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,870
That's wonderful.

232
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,753
What are we gonna do?

233
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,633
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

234
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,221
This is a happy moment.

235
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:28,514
The happiest moment of my life.

236
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:37,496
Yes, Lord Sidious?

237
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,504
<i>General Grievous...</i>

238
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:44,709
<i>I suggest you move</i>
<i>the separatist leaders to Mustafar.</i>

239
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:47,882
It will be done, my lord.

240
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:53,055
<i>The end of the war is near, General.</i>

241
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:56,772
But the loss of Count Dooku-

242
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:01,027
<i>His death was a necessary loss.</i>

243
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:05,439
<i>Soon I will have a new apprentice-</i>

244
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:10,817
<i>one far younger</i>
<i>and more powerful.</i>

245
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:40,858
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

246
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:44,318
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

247
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:46,320
where we can be safe.

248
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,864
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

249
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:57,876
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

250
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:05,750
You are so... beautiful.

251
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:09,426
It's only because I'm so in love.

252
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:14,181
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

253
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,227
So love has blinded you?

254
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:22,731
That's not exactly what I meant.

255
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,359
But it's probably true.

256
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:38,074
Anakin, help me!

257
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,639
What's bothering you?

258
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:47,063
Nothing.

259
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:51,361
I remember when
I gave this to you.

260
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:55,652
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

261
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:01,702
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

262
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:06,914
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

263
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:08,048
And?

264
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,712
And it was about you.

265
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,588
Tell me.

266
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:21,893
It was only a dream.

267
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,776
You die in childbirth.

268
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,701
And the baby?

269
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,116
I don't know.

270
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:47,828
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

271
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:51,588
This baby will change our lives.

272
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,505
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

273
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:58,099
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

274
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:00,050
I know. I know.

275
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,436
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

276
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,475
We don't need his help.

277
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:12,815
Our baby is a blessing.

278
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:30,505
Premonitions?

279
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:32,090
Premonitions.

280
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,423
These visions you have-

281
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:40,139
They're of pain, suffering.

282
00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:43,635
Death.

283
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:48,480
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

284
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:51,985
Someone.

285
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:53,985
Close to you?

286
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:56,197
Yes.

287
00:33:57,533 --> 00:34:01,365
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

288
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,789
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

289
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:10,535
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

290
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:14,589
Death is a natural part of life.

291
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:19,379
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

292
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:22,763
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

293
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:25,976
Attachment leads to jealousy.

294
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:29,519
The shadow of greed that is.

295
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,855
What must I do, Master Yoda?

296
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,604
Train yourself to let go...

297
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:39,154
of everything you fear to lose.

298
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:52,415
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

299
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:56,128
I'm sorry. I was held up.

300
00:34:56,258 --> 00:35:00,126
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

301
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:05,423
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

302
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,433
What's wrong, then?

303
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:13,730
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

304
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,189
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

305
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:20,730
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

306
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:24,782
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

307
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,329
Be careful of what?

308
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:31,079
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

309
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,368
He would not say.

310
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,039
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

311
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:39,381
All of this is unusual.

312
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,835
And it's making me feel uneasy.

313
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:58,818
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

314
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:01,062
Of course.

315
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:04,115
I need your help, son.

316
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:07,278
What do you mean?

317
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,954
I'm depending on you.

318
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,575
For what? I don't understand.

319
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:18,297
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

320
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:24,763
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

321
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:25,889
Me?

322
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:28,391
A master?

323
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,642
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

324
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:36,648
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

325
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:40,275
I think they will.
They need you.

326
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:43,070
More than you know.

327
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:58,246
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

328
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:01,796
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

329
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,552
I understand.

330
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:07,004
You are on this council...

331
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:09,713
but we do not grant you
the rank of master.

332
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,810
What?

333
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:20,312
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

334
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:21,986
It's unfair.

335
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,193
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

336
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:30,829
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

337
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,541
Forgive me, Master.

338
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:42,163
<i>We have surveyed</i>
<i>all systems in the Republic...</i>

339
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:46,000
<i>but have found no sign</i>
<i>of General Grievous.</i>

340
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:48,888
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

341
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:52,099
The outlying systems you must sweep.

342
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:54,432
We do not have
many ships to spare.

343
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:56,720
<i>What about the droid attack</i>
<i>on the Wookiees?</i>

344
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:00,520
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

345
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:04,067
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

346
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,406
Go I will.

347
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,617
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

348
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:12,322
It's settled then.

349
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:17,449
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

350
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,624
May the Force be with us all.

351
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:24,502
What kind of nonsense is this?

352
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,006
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

353
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:29,888
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

354
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:32,849
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honour.

355
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,929
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

356
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:40,473
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

357
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:44,356
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

358
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:47,856
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

359
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,197
But it's what you wanted.

360
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:53,611
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

361
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:55,620
That has nothing to do with this.

362
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:58,665
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

363
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:01,118
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

364
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:02,879
And?

365
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,006
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

366
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:08,297
What situation?

367
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,719
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

368
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:19,178
They want to know what he's up to.

369
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:25,727
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

370
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:29,323
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

371
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:34,284
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

372
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:36,819
This assignment
is not to be on record.

373
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:40,874
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

374
00:39:41,002 --> 00:39:44,002
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

375
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,206
That is why you must help us.

376
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,792
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

377
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:53,592
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

378
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:55,680
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

379
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:58,975
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

380
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:03,272
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

381
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:07,269
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

382
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:11,353
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

383
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:15,575
The council is asking you.

384
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:26,493
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

385
00:40:27,423 --> 00:40:30,590
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

386
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:33,007
I don't think the boy can handle it.

387
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:35,046
I don't trust him.

388
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:38,968
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

389
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:43,392
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

390
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,348
So the prophecy says.

391
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:51,359
A prophecy that misread
could have been.

392
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,072
He will not let me down.

393
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:57,110
He never has.

394
00:40:57,244 --> 00:41:00,245
I hope right you are.

395
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:28,149
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

396
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:32,104
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

397
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,156
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

398
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:39,158
What do you mean?

399
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:44,454
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

400
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:48,166
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

401
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:52,504
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

402
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,428
This war represents a failure to listen.

403
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:59,547
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

404
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:02,932
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

405
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,598
Don't ask me to do that.

406
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:10,808
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

407
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:13,733
- What is it?
- Nothing.

408
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:18,904
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

409
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,163
Hold me.

410
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:25,531
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

411
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:29,378
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

412
00:42:30,588 --> 00:42:34,004
No politics, no plotting, no war.

413
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:15,925
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

414
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,007
Come closer. I have good news.

415
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,594
Our clone intelligence units...

416
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:24,759
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

417
00:43:24,892 --> 00:43:27,465
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

418
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:28,766
At last.

419
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:33,356
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

420
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:36,818
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

421
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:39,318
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

422
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:42,782
You're the best choice, by far.

423
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,288
Sit down.

424
00:43:47,415 --> 00:43:48,613
Leave us.

425
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,641
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

426
00:44:09,437 --> 00:44:12,770
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

427
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,809
I'm not sure I understand.

428
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:19,608
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

429
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:23,108
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

430
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:26,403
They're planning to betray me.

431
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:29,493
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.

432
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,617
Search your feelings.

433
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:37,375
You know, don't you?

434
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:43,676
I know they don't trust you.

435
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:47,090
Or the senate.
Or the Republic.

436
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:49,798
Or democracy, for that matter.

437
00:44:50,603 --> 00:44:54,932
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

438
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:56,066
Why?

439
00:44:58,736 --> 00:45:02,983
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

440
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:08,870
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?

441
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:17,919
I don't know what to say.

442
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:21,498
Remember back
to your early teachings.

443
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:26,002
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

444
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:30,765
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

445
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:33,016
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

446
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:38,306
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

447
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:43,113
including their quest
for greater power.

448
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:47,658
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

449
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:50,537
They think inwards-
only about themselves.

450
00:45:51,747 --> 00:45:53,989
And the Jedi don't?

451
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:58,659
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

452
00:46:08,848 --> 00:46:13,806
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

453
00:46:18,941 --> 00:46:22,986
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

454
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,404
It's a Sith legend.

455
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:31,531
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...

456
00:46:31,662 --> 00:46:34,533
so powerful and so wise...

457
00:46:34,665 --> 00:46:39,493
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

458
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:42,795
to create... life.

459
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:47,503
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

460
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:52,097
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

461
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:54,684
from dying.

462
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:02,765
He could actually...
save people from death?

463
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:08,149
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

464
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:12,494
some consider to be unnatural.

465
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:15,453
What happened to him?

466
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,622
He became so powerful...

467
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:21,995
the only thing he was afraid of was...

468
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:25,087
losing his power.

469
00:47:25,216 --> 00:47:27,339
Which eventually, of course, he did.

470
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:33,713
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

471
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:37,138
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

472
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:42,099
It's ironic.

473
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,356
He could save others from death...

474
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:47,562
but not himself.

475
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:54,280
Is it possible to learn this power?

476
00:47:58,124 --> 00:48:00,247
Not from a Jedi.

477
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:19,016
<i>All Red units, over here!</i>

478
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:33,195
<i>Palpatine thinks General Grievous</i>
<i>is on Utapau?</i>

479
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:35,908
<i>A partial message was intercepted...</i>

480
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:38,492
<i>in a diplomatic packet</i>
<i>from the chairman of Utapau.</i>

481
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,159
<i>Act on this we must.</i>

482
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,003
<i>The capture of General Grievous</i>
<i>will end this war.</i>

483
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,920
<i>Quickly and decisively</i>
<i>we should proceed.</i>

484
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:57,057
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

485
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,471
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

486
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,560
not the chancellor.

487
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:07,599
<i>A master is needed,</i>
<i>with more experience.</i>

488
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:11,104
<i>I concur.</i>
<i>Master Kenobi should go.</i>

489
00:49:12,323 --> 00:49:13,734
<i>I agree.</i>

490
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:14,881
<i>Aye.</i>

491
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,101
Aye.

492
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,695
<i>Very well. Council adjourned.</i>

493
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:29,298
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

494
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:34,878
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

495
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:48,966
Charge!

496
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,076
<i>Head for cover!</i>

497
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:24,388
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

498
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,355
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

499
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:28,596
Master.

500
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:35,865
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

501
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,738
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

502
00:50:40,494 --> 00:50:42,820
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

503
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:49,867
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

504
00:50:50,004 --> 00:50:52,577
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

505
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,791
I have taught you
everything I know.

506
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:58,674
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

507
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:01,464
But be patient, Anakin.

508
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,516
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

509
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:16,152
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

510
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,151
Goodbye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

511
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:46,307
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

512
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:48,060
On the far side.

513
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:50,476
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

514
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:54,022
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

515
00:51:55,444 --> 00:52:00,569
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

516
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,760
Save your energy.

517
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:30,077
I can't.

518
00:52:30,354 --> 00:52:32,098
Don't give up, Padmé.

519
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:47,452
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

520
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,203
He came by this morning.

521
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,499
What did he want?

522
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:55,537
He's worried about you.

523
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,290
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

524
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,839
I feel lost.

525
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:09,135
Lost? What do you mean?

526
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,434
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

527
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:16,931
They trust you with their lives.

528
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:20,153
Something's happening.

529
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:23,480
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

530
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:27,777
I want more.

531
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:30,912
And I know I shouldn't.

532
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,999
You expect too much of yourself.

533
00:53:39,006 --> 00:53:42,173
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

534
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:44,210
From my nightmares.

535
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:46,254
Is that what's bothering you?

536
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:49,215
I won't lose you, Padmé.

537
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:52,135
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

538
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:54,677
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

539
00:54:38,649 --> 00:54:41,021
Greetings, young Jedi.

540
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,568
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

541
00:54:44,697 --> 00:54:46,606
Unfortunately, the war.

542
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:51,275
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

543
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:54,579
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

544
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:59,618
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

545
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:11,888
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

546
00:55:12,016 --> 00:55:14,886
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

547
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:19,811
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

548
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,348
Tell your people to take shelter.

549
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,439
If you have warriors, now is the time.

550
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,585
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

551
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:46,627
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

552
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:34,175
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

553
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:42,016
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

554
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,819
It is a volcanic planet.

555
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:55,235
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

556
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:59,328
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

557
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:03,869
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

558
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:09,920
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

559
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:16,050
Your ship is waiting.

560
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:35,194
Hello there.

561
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,578
General Kenobi.

562
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:45,079
You are a bold one.

563
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:48,588
Kill him.

564
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:05,849
Back away.

565
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:10,560
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

566
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,153
Your move.

567
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,696
You fool.

568
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:20,613
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

569
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:29,625
Attack, Kenobi.

570
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:48,287
Army or not...

571
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:53,494
you must realize
you are doomed.

572
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,588
I don't think so.

573
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,768
<i>Cover that corner.</i>

574
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,864
<i>Master Windu, may I interrupt?</i>

575
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,745
<i>General Kenobi has made contact</i>
<i>with General Grievous...</i>

576
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,113
<i>and we have begun our attack.</i>

577
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,956
Thank you, Commander.

578
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:15,163
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

579
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,538
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

580
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:19,132
Yes, Master.

581
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,054
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

582
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,433
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

583
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,353
<i>If he does not give up</i>
<i>his emergency powers...</i>

584
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,356
<i>after the destruction of Grievous...</i>

585
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,691
<i>then he should be</i>
<i>removed from office.</i>

586
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,688
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

587
01:01:43,824 --> 01:01:45,698
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

588
01:01:45,826 --> 01:01:50,287
<i>To a dark place this line</i>
<i>of thought will carry us.</i>

589
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:55,246
<i>Great care we must take.</i>

590
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,551
Chancellor.

591
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,836
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

592
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:09,594
He has engaged General Grievous.

593
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:13,059
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

594
01:02:14,683 --> 01:02:16,640
I should be there with him.

595
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:19,094
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

596
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,269
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

597
01:02:22,608 --> 01:02:26,688
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

598
01:02:28,405 --> 01:02:30,363
I wish I knew.

599
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,191
More and more I get
the feeling that...

600
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:36,534
I'm being excluded
from the council.

601
01:02:43,546 --> 01:02:47,460
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

602
01:02:49,718 --> 01:02:52,126
They don't trust you, Anakin.

603
01:02:52,888 --> 01:02:54,881
They see your future.

604
01:02:55,015 --> 01:02:58,883
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

605
01:03:00,062 --> 01:03:05,104
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

606
01:03:07,152 --> 01:03:11,281
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

607
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:14,155
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

608
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:18,239
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

609
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,993
Even the nature of the dark side.

610
01:03:24,003 --> 01:03:26,328
You know the dark side?

611
01:03:28,966 --> 01:03:32,252
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

612
01:03:32,386 --> 01:03:34,758
one must study all its aspects...

613
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:38,008
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

614
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:41,887
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

615
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:45,686
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.

616
01:03:46,442 --> 01:03:48,434
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

617
01:03:49,486 --> 01:03:54,647
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

618
01:03:55,409 --> 01:03:58,030
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

619
01:03:58,162 --> 01:04:01,780
and you will be able to
save your wife...

620
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:03,955
from certain death.

621
01:04:05,085 --> 01:04:06,959
What did you say?

622
01:04:07,087 --> 01:04:10,706
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

623
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:14,584
You're the Sith lord.

624
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,552
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

625
01:04:19,558 --> 01:04:23,223
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

626
01:04:25,397 --> 01:04:28,813
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

627
01:04:28,943 --> 01:04:31,481
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

628
01:04:31,612 --> 01:04:33,984
A life of significance...

629
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:35,573
of conscience.

630
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:44,868
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

631
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,332
I know you would.

632
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:52,246
I can feel your anger.

633
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:55,052
It gives you focus...

634
01:04:55,177 --> 01:04:57,502
makes you stronger.

635
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:06,136
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

636
01:05:06,272 --> 01:05:07,896
Of course. You should.

637
01:05:08,023 --> 01:05:11,024
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

638
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:13,643
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

639
01:05:14,822 --> 01:05:17,194
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

640
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:20,943
Know the power of the dark side.

641
01:05:21,078 --> 01:05:23,830
Power to save Padmé.

642
01:07:32,376 --> 01:07:33,539
So uncivilized.

643
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:43,044
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.

644
01:07:43,178 --> 01:07:46,962
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

645
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:48,973
We're on our way to make sure...

646
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:51,399
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

647
01:07:51,499 --> 01:07:55,097
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

648
01:07:55,232 --> 01:07:57,355
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

649
01:07:58,819 --> 01:08:00,361
A Sith lord?

650
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:03,323
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

651
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:06,450
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

652
01:08:07,494 --> 01:08:09,617
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

653
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:12,534
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

654
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:16,207
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

655
01:08:16,337 --> 01:08:19,788
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

656
01:08:19,924 --> 01:08:22,331
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

657
01:08:22,468 --> 01:08:24,710
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

658
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:27,763
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

659
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,642
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

660
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:32,891
There is much fear
that clouds your judgement.

661
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,977
- I must go, Master.
- No.

662
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:41,141
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

663
01:08:41,278 --> 01:08:43,816
But for now, remain here.

664
01:08:45,032 --> 01:08:47,819
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

665
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,365
Yes, Master.

666
01:09:21,485 --> 01:09:23,727
<i>You do know, don't you...</i>

667
01:09:23,863 --> 01:09:26,188
<i>if the Jedi destroy</i> me...

668
01:09:26,323 --> 01:09:30,273
<i>any chance of saving her</i>
<i>will be lost.</i>

669
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:03,621
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

670
01:11:04,588 --> 01:11:06,996
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

671
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:10,715
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

672
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:12,754
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

673
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:15,462
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

674
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:17,508
The senate will decide your fate.

675
01:11:17,643 --> 01:11:21,475
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

676
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:29,144
It's treason then.

677
01:13:08,128 --> 01:13:11,663
You are under arrest, my lord.

678
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,094
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

679
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:19,344
The Jedi are taking over.

680
01:13:19,473 --> 01:13:21,929
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

681
01:13:22,059 --> 01:13:24,265
You have lost.

682
01:13:28,148 --> 01:13:30,058
You will die!

683
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,694
He's a traitor!

684
01:13:34,822 --> 01:13:36,980
He is the traitor!

685
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,324
I have the power
to save the one you love.

686
01:13:45,332 --> 01:13:47,242
You must choose.

687
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:50,909
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

688
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:54,627
Don't let him kill me.

689
01:13:57,761 --> 01:14:00,466
I can't hold it any longer.

690
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:03,883
I can't. I'm weak.

691
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:05,975
I'm too weak.

692
01:14:07,646 --> 01:14:10,102
Help me. Help me!

693
01:14:14,612 --> 01:14:16,770
I can't hold on any longer.

694
01:14:16,906 --> 01:14:20,488
I am going to end this
once and for all.

695
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:22,076
You can't.

696
01:14:22,203 --> 01:14:24,160
He must stand trial.

697
01:14:25,206 --> 01:14:27,613
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

698
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,956
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

699
01:14:30,085 --> 01:14:32,327
I'm too weak.

700
01:14:32,463 --> 01:14:36,046
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

701
01:14:36,175 --> 01:14:37,669
He must live.

702
01:14:40,804 --> 01:14:43,342
- Please don't.
- I need him.

703
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:45,471
Please don't!

704
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,100
Power!

705
01:15:01,075 --> 01:15:04,275
Unlimited power!

706
01:15:16,882 --> 01:15:18,922
What have I done?

707
01:15:27,226 --> 01:15:31,140
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

708
01:15:32,356 --> 01:15:35,061
Become my apprentice.

709
01:15:35,192 --> 01:15:40,613
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

710
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:46,238
I will do whatever you ask.

711
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:49,455
Good.

712
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:55,158
Just help me save Padmé's life.

713
01:15:57,131 --> 01:15:59,503
I can't live without her.

714
01:16:02,678 --> 01:16:08,052
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

715
01:16:08,184 --> 01:16:11,137
but if we work together...

716
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:15,268
I know we can discover the secret.

717
01:16:16,734 --> 01:16:18,726
I pledge myself...

718
01:16:20,446 --> 01:16:22,320
to your teachings.

719
01:16:23,574 --> 01:16:24,574
Good.

720
01:16:26,493 --> 01:16:27,493
Good.

721
01:16:36,545 --> 01:16:40,958
The Force is strong with you.

722
01:16:41,091 --> 01:16:46,631
A powerful Sith you will become.

723
01:16:46,764 --> 01:16:51,011
Henceforth you shall be known as...

724
01:16:51,143 --> 01:16:54,143
Darth... Vader.

725
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:02,986
Thank you, my master.

726
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,199
Rise.

727
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:25,260
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

728
01:17:26,845 --> 01:17:31,591
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

729
01:17:32,935 --> 01:17:35,640
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

730
01:17:35,771 --> 01:17:39,685
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

731
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:41,943
I agree.

732
01:17:42,653 --> 01:17:46,520
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

733
01:17:46,657 --> 01:17:49,326
Every single Jedi...

734
01:17:49,451 --> 01:17:52,702
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

735
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,365
is now an enemy of the Republic.

736
01:17:57,418 --> 01:17:59,375
I understand, Master.

737
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,080
We must move quickly.

738
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:04,123
The Jedi are relentless.

739
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:10,047
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

740
01:18:11,765 --> 01:18:15,549
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

741
01:18:16,645 --> 01:18:19,682
We will catch them off-balance.

742
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:23,766
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

743
01:18:23,903 --> 01:18:27,272
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

744
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:32,735
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

745
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:34,862
to save Padmé.

746
01:18:35,998 --> 01:18:39,830
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

747
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,045
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

748
01:18:44,965 --> 01:18:48,215
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

749
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:51,013
go to the Mustafar system.

750
01:18:51,138 --> 01:18:54,388
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

751
01:18:54,517 --> 01:18:57,932
and the other
separatist leaders.

752
01:18:58,062 --> 01:19:03,934
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

753
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:06,394
And...

754
01:19:07,029 --> 01:19:11,629
we shall have... peace.

755
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:57,201
Sergeant, over here!

756
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:00,156
Hurry! All of them!

757
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,834
<i>All Red units, let's move it!</i>

758
01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:06,836
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

759
01:20:20,728 --> 01:20:22,720
Commander, contact your troops.

760
01:20:22,855 --> 01:20:24,764
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

761
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:26,772
Very good, sir.

762
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:29,024
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

763
01:20:29,862 --> 01:20:33,397
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

764
01:20:33,532 --> 01:20:34,695
Yes, sir.

765
01:20:41,498 --> 01:20:42,957
<i>Commander Cody...</i>

766
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:46,953
the time has come.

767
01:20:47,087 --> 01:20:50,487
Execute order 66.

768
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:54,002
Yes, my lord.

769
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,218
Blast him!

770
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:27,585
Come on!

771
01:22:18,012 --> 01:22:21,297
<i>Execute order 66.</i>

772
01:22:22,308 --> 01:22:23,932
It will be done, my lord.

773
01:23:06,769 --> 01:23:08,726
It will be done, my lord.

774
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:47,971
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

775
01:23:48,102 --> 01:23:50,059
What are we going to do?

776
01:24:00,573 --> 01:24:04,701
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

777
01:24:04,827 --> 01:24:07,911
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

778
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:40,187
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

779
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:42,894
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

780
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:46,237
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

781
01:24:47,995 --> 01:24:49,952
And so it is.

782
01:24:54,084 --> 01:24:55,543
Get him!

783
01:25:13,103 --> 01:25:14,977
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

784
01:25:41,882 --> 01:25:44,800
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

785
01:25:44,927 --> 01:25:46,386
Yes, sir.

786
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,394
Goodbye, Tarfful.

787
01:25:56,522 --> 01:25:58,479
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

788
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:03,191
Miss you I will.

789
01:26:40,232 --> 01:26:42,557
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

790
01:26:42,693 --> 01:26:44,982
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

791
01:26:50,743 --> 01:26:52,652
Did you find Kenobi?

792
01:26:52,786 --> 01:26:54,696
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

793
01:26:55,748 --> 01:26:58,073
Start loading your men on the ships.

794
01:26:58,209 --> 01:26:59,667
Move it.

795
01:27:32,993 --> 01:27:34,986
Emergency code 913.

796
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,994
I have no contact
on any frequency.

797
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,161
<i>Master Kenobi.</i>

798
01:27:41,293 --> 01:27:43,250
- Repeat.
- <i>Master Kenobi.</i>

799
01:27:43,379 --> 01:27:47,293
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

800
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,174
<i>We have just rescued</i>
<i>Master Yoda.</i>

801
01:27:50,302 --> 01:27:52,378
<i>It appears this ambush</i>
<i>has happened everywhere.</i>

802
01:27:52,513 --> 01:27:54,636
<i>We're sending you our coordinates.</i>

803
01:28:02,398 --> 01:28:04,271
Hush! Not so loud.

804
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,401
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

805
01:28:07,528 --> 01:28:09,900
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

806
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:11,904
I came to see if
you and the baby are safe.

807
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,657
What's happening?

808
01:28:14,535 --> 01:28:16,611
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

809
01:28:17,371 --> 01:28:19,245
I can't believe that.

810
01:28:19,373 --> 01:28:22,908
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

811
01:28:25,713 --> 01:28:27,504
What are you gonna do?

812
01:28:36,223 --> 01:28:38,382
I will not betray the Republic.

813
01:28:40,394 --> 01:28:42,303
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

814
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,185
and with the senate
and with you.

815
01:28:46,984 --> 01:28:50,187
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

816
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:53,022
Many Jedi have been killed.

817
01:28:53,157 --> 01:28:55,992
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

818
01:28:57,077 --> 01:28:59,403
Anakin, I'm afraid.

819
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:04,456
Have faith, my love.

820
01:29:04,585 --> 01:29:06,874
Everything will soon be set right.

821
01:29:07,671 --> 01:29:10,756
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

822
01:29:10,883 --> 01:29:13,718
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

823
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:18,302
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

824
01:29:18,432 --> 01:29:20,804
Things will be different.
I promise.

825
01:29:26,649 --> 01:29:28,606
Please, wait for me.

826
01:29:32,696 --> 01:29:35,401
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

827
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,569
Take care, my little friend.

828
01:29:43,874 --> 01:29:47,539
Oh, my lady,
is there anything I might do?

829
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:50,208
No, thank you, 3PO.

830
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:54,999
I feel so helpless.

831
01:30:18,576 --> 01:30:21,197
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

832
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:23,866
Heard from no one have we.

833
01:30:24,748 --> 01:30:27,833
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

834
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,834
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

835
01:30:29,962 --> 01:30:32,370
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

836
01:30:32,506 --> 01:30:35,460
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

837
01:30:36,343 --> 01:30:39,593
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

838
01:30:39,722 --> 01:30:43,138
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

839
01:30:43,267 --> 01:30:46,766
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

840
01:30:47,938 --> 01:30:51,687
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

841
01:30:51,817 --> 01:30:54,522
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

842
01:30:55,654 --> 01:30:57,196
I agree.

843
01:30:57,323 --> 01:31:00,905
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

844
01:31:21,889 --> 01:31:25,305
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

845
01:31:25,434 --> 01:31:28,186
<i>You have done well, Viceroy.</i>

846
01:31:28,312 --> 01:31:34,101
<i>When my new apprentice</i>
<i>Darth Vader arrives...</i>

847
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:37,734
<i>he will take care of you.</i>

848
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:52,525
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

849
01:31:52,628 --> 01:31:54,537
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

850
01:31:56,298 --> 01:32:00,960
<i>Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor</i>
<i>requests your presence...</i>

851
01:32:01,095 --> 01:32:03,052
<i>at a special session of Congress.</i>

852
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,715
- I will be there.
- <i>He'll be expecting you.</i>

853
01:32:09,728 --> 01:32:12,979
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

854
01:32:13,107 --> 01:32:16,191
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

855
01:32:16,318 --> 01:32:18,228
without keeping
the senate intact.

856
01:32:19,071 --> 01:32:22,357
If a special session
of Congress there is...

857
01:32:22,491 --> 01:32:25,777
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

858
01:33:04,283 --> 01:33:06,240
R2, stay with the ship.

859
01:33:31,685 --> 01:33:34,686
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

860
01:34:06,554 --> 01:34:11,050
And the Jedi rebellion
has been foiled.

861
01:34:11,183 --> 01:34:12,214
What's happened?

862
01:34:12,351 --> 01:34:16,847
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

863
01:34:16,981 --> 01:34:22,437
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

864
01:34:38,252 --> 01:34:40,707
Not even the younglings survived.

865
01:34:41,839 --> 01:34:47,177
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

866
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,842
By a lightsabre he was.

867
01:34:57,730 --> 01:34:58,730
Who?

868
01:34:59,398 --> 01:35:01,272
Who could have done this?

869
01:35:11,994 --> 01:35:15,161
The attempt on my life...

870
01:35:15,289 --> 01:35:20,165
has left me scarred and deformed.

871
01:35:21,128 --> 01:35:23,999
But I assure you.

872
01:35:24,131 --> 01:35:28,840
My resolve has never been stronger!

873
01:35:33,057 --> 01:35:34,057
Stop!

874
01:35:47,238 --> 01:35:52,861
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

875
01:35:52,993 --> 01:35:56,861
the Republic will be reorganized...

876
01:35:56,997 --> 01:36:02,454
into the first Galactic Empire!

877
01:36:03,379 --> 01:36:09,215
For a safe and secure society.

878
01:36:18,644 --> 01:36:20,684
So this is how liberty dies.

879
01:36:21,438 --> 01:36:24,143
With thunderous applause.

880
01:36:26,569 --> 01:36:28,727
The war is over.

881
01:36:28,863 --> 01:36:32,991
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

882
01:36:41,125 --> 01:36:45,787
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

883
01:36:45,921 --> 01:36:48,329
For the clones...

884
01:36:48,465 --> 01:36:52,546
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

885
01:37:04,899 --> 01:37:06,357
Wait. Master.

886
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:10,227
There is something I must know.

887
01:37:16,368 --> 01:37:20,781
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

888
01:37:20,915 --> 01:37:23,453
I must know the truth, Master.

889
01:37:31,258 --> 01:37:33,167
It can't be.

890
01:37:33,302 --> 01:37:35,176
It can't be.

891
01:37:35,304 --> 01:37:39,349
<i>You have done well,</i>
<i>my new apprentice.</i>

892
01:37:39,475 --> 01:37:42,476
<i>Now, Lord Vader...</i>

893
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:46,102
<i>go and bring peace to the Empire.</i>

894
01:37:46,232 --> 01:37:48,390
I can't watch any more.

895
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:53,065
Destroy the Sith we must.

896
01:37:54,865 --> 01:37:56,941
Send me to kill the emperor.

897
01:37:57,076 --> 01:37:59,318
I will not kill Anakin.

898
01:37:59,453 --> 01:38:04,162
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

899
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:07,541
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

900
01:38:08,295 --> 01:38:13,337
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

901
01:38:13,467 --> 01:38:16,836
The boy you trained, gone he is.

902
01:38:16,971 --> 01:38:19,841
Consumed by Darth Vader.

903
01:38:19,974 --> 01:38:22,975
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

904
01:38:23,102 --> 01:38:25,308
I don't know where to look.

905
01:38:26,647 --> 01:38:30,312
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

906
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,862
When was the last time
you saw him?

907
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:46,950
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

908
01:38:50,129 --> 01:38:53,462
Padmé, I need your help.

909
01:38:54,174 --> 01:38:56,796
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

910
01:38:57,595 --> 01:38:59,053
From himself.

911
01:39:03,517 --> 01:39:05,889
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

912
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:09,471
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

913
01:39:12,276 --> 01:39:17,271
I have seen
a security hologram... of him...

914
01:39:18,908 --> 01:39:20,616
killing younglings.

915
01:39:20,743 --> 01:39:23,779
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

916
01:39:24,538 --> 01:39:26,827
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

917
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:31,457
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

918
01:39:33,297 --> 01:39:36,002
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

919
01:39:36,133 --> 01:39:40,213
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

920
01:39:46,435 --> 01:39:48,392
I don't believe you.

921
01:39:49,813 --> 01:39:51,272
I can't.

922
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,732
I must find him.

923
01:40:03,869 --> 01:40:06,194
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

924
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:12,372
He has become
a very great threat.

925
01:40:15,005 --> 01:40:16,464
I can't.

926
01:40:30,187 --> 01:40:32,096
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

927
01:40:36,527 --> 01:40:38,484
I'm so sorry.

928
01:41:24,617 --> 01:41:26,740
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

929
01:41:26,869 --> 01:41:28,826
The fighting's over.
And this is personal.

930
01:41:28,954 --> 01:41:31,326
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

931
01:41:31,457 --> 01:41:35,075
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

932
01:41:35,211 --> 01:41:37,583
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

933
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,299
Oh, dear.

934
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:56,888
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

935
01:42:25,261 --> 01:42:28,676
<i>The separatists have been</i>
<i>taken care of, my master.</i>

936
01:42:28,806 --> 01:42:31,676
It is finished then.

937
01:42:33,102 --> 01:42:38,891
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

938
01:42:39,692 --> 01:42:43,903
<i>Send a message to the ships</i>
<i>of the Trade Federation.</i>

939
01:42:44,738 --> 01:42:49,199
<i>All droid units</i>
<i>must shut down immediately.</i>

940
01:42:50,077 --> 01:42:52,034
Very good, my lord.

941
01:43:51,305 --> 01:43:53,381
I saw your ship.

942
01:43:56,227 --> 01:43:59,227
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

943
01:44:00,689 --> 01:44:03,524
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

944
01:44:03,651 --> 01:44:05,193
What things?

945
01:44:05,903 --> 01:44:08,820
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

946
01:44:08,948 --> 01:44:13,574
That you... killed younglings.

947
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,790
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

948
01:44:17,915 --> 01:44:19,789
He cares about us.

949
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:21,501
Us?

950
01:44:21,794 --> 01:44:23,253
He knows.

951
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:26,504
He wants to help you.

952
01:44:30,344 --> 01:44:33,594
Anakin, all I want is your love.

953
01:44:33,722 --> 01:44:36,048
Love won't save you, Padmé.

954
01:44:36,183 --> 01:44:39,386
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

955
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,892
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

956
01:44:42,022 --> 01:44:44,727
I won't lose you
the way I lost my mother.

957
01:44:44,859 --> 01:44:49,070
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

958
01:44:49,196 --> 01:44:51,983
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

959
01:44:53,325 --> 01:44:55,282
Come away with me.

960
01:44:56,036 --> 01:44:58,029
Help me raise our child.

961
01:44:58,163 --> 01:45:00,951
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

962
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:04,997
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away any more.

963
01:45:05,838 --> 01:45:08,329
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

964
01:45:09,383 --> 01:45:11,292
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

965
01:45:11,427 --> 01:45:13,503
I can overthrow him.

966
01:45:15,598 --> 01:45:18,634
And together,
you and I can rule the galaxy...

967
01:45:18,767 --> 01:45:21,175
make things the way
we want them to be.

968
01:45:27,526 --> 01:45:29,519
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

969
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:34,315
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

970
01:45:36,535 --> 01:45:39,370
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

971
01:45:40,247 --> 01:45:43,663
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

972
01:45:45,377 --> 01:45:47,370
I don't know you any more.

973
01:45:51,091 --> 01:45:53,049
You're breaking my heart.

974
01:45:53,761 --> 01:45:56,715
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

975
01:45:57,723 --> 01:45:59,597
Because of Obi-Wan?

976
01:46:00,392 --> 01:46:02,468
Because of what you've done.

977
01:46:02,603 --> 01:46:04,512
What you plan to do.

978
01:46:05,773 --> 01:46:08,394
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

979
01:46:08,526 --> 01:46:11,443
- I love you.
- Liar!

980
01:46:16,283 --> 01:46:20,032
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

981
01:46:21,497 --> 01:46:23,074
Let her go, Anakin.

982
01:46:26,293 --> 01:46:28,452
Let her go.

983
01:46:38,472 --> 01:46:40,465
You turned her against me!

984
01:46:42,101 --> 01:46:44,259
You have done that yourself.

985
01:46:49,024 --> 01:46:51,183
You will not
take her from me!

986
01:46:51,318 --> 01:46:55,150
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

987
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:03,447
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

988
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:08,207
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

989
01:47:08,335 --> 01:47:10,209
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

990
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:12,828
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

991
01:47:13,966 --> 01:47:16,338
I do not fear
the dark side as you do.

992
01:47:18,178 --> 01:47:20,088
I have brought peace...

993
01:47:20,222 --> 01:47:24,968
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

994
01:47:25,978 --> 01:47:28,101
Your new empire?

995
01:47:28,939 --> 01:47:30,979
Don't make me kill you.

996
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:36,856
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

997
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:39,697
If you're not with me...

998
01:47:40,618 --> 01:47:42,491
then you're my enemy.

999
01:47:44,538 --> 01:47:46,994
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1000
01:47:49,543 --> 01:47:51,417
I will do what I must.

1001
01:47:52,129 --> 01:47:54,501
You will try.

1002
01:48:26,288 --> 01:48:30,286
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1003
01:48:30,417 --> 01:48:34,878
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1004
01:48:35,005 --> 01:48:37,405
Master Yoda.

1005
01:48:37,716 --> 01:48:39,376
You survived.

1006
01:48:40,261 --> 01:48:41,636
Surprised?

1007
01:48:42,346 --> 01:48:46,925
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1008
01:48:47,059 --> 01:48:49,099
Now you will experience...

1009
01:48:49,228 --> 01:48:53,689
the full power of the dark side.

1010
01:49:35,649 --> 01:49:41,320
I have waited a long time
for this moment...

1011
01:49:41,447 --> 01:49:46,047
my little green friend.

1012
01:49:56,837 --> 01:50:00,289
At last the Jedi are no more.

1013
01:50:00,424 --> 01:50:04,636
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1014
01:50:09,975 --> 01:50:12,301
At an end your rule is.

1015
01:50:14,188 --> 01:50:16,643
And not short enough it was.

1016
01:50:21,403 --> 01:50:23,610
If so powerful you are...

1017
01:50:24,865 --> 01:50:26,324
why leave?

1018
01:50:27,284 --> 01:50:29,822
You will not stop me.

1019
01:50:29,954 --> 01:50:34,532
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1020
01:50:34,667 --> 01:50:38,996
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1021
01:50:40,339 --> 01:50:44,384
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1022
01:55:12,027 --> 01:55:14,732
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1023
01:55:14,864 --> 01:55:17,651
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1024
01:55:17,783 --> 01:55:20,108
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1025
01:55:20,244 --> 01:55:23,862
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1026
01:55:23,998 --> 01:55:26,239
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1027
01:55:27,334 --> 01:55:31,414
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate take-off.

1028
01:55:31,547 --> 01:55:36,624
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1029
01:56:45,454 --> 01:56:48,621
Into exile I must go.

1030
01:56:49,333 --> 01:56:51,409
Failed I have.

1031
01:58:30,851 --> 01:58:32,760
I have failed you, Anakin.

1032
01:58:32,895 --> 01:58:34,769
I have failed you.

1033
01:58:34,897 --> 01:58:37,767
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1034
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:40,687
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1035
01:58:40,819 --> 01:58:43,441
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1036
01:58:43,572 --> 01:58:45,150
Then you are lost!

1037
01:58:57,044 --> 01:58:59,535
This is the end for you, my master.

1038
01:59:24,071 --> 01:59:27,191
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1039
01:59:29,869 --> 01:59:32,538
You underestimate my power.

1040
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:35,038
Don't try it.

1041
01:59:57,938 --> 01:59:59,895
You were the chosen one!

1042
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:04,567
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1043
02:00:07,239 --> 02:00:11,023
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1044
02:00:22,713 --> 02:00:24,913
I hate you!

1045
02:00:32,473 --> 02:00:34,762
You were my brother, Anakin.

1046
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:39,136
I loved you.

1047
02:01:20,187 --> 02:01:23,105
Master Kenobi.
We have Miss Padmé on board.

1048
02:01:23,232 --> 02:01:25,308
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1049
02:01:25,442 --> 02:01:28,278
We should leave this dreadful place.

1050
02:01:43,836 --> 02:01:45,793
Is Anakin all right?

1051
02:02:54,615 --> 02:02:56,572
Your Majesty, this way.

1052
02:02:57,535 --> 02:02:59,408
There he is.

1053
02:02:59,537 --> 02:03:01,695
He's still alive.

1054
02:03:04,708 --> 02:03:06,915
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1055
02:03:07,044 --> 02:03:09,001
Yes, sir. Right away.

1056
02:03:44,999 --> 02:03:46,908
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1057
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:54,998
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1058
02:04:11,859 --> 02:04:14,266
We'll take her to
the medical centre. Quickly.

1059
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:46,806
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1060
02:04:46,936 --> 02:04:50,139
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1061
02:04:51,524 --> 02:04:54,228
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1062
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:56,399
She has lost the will to live.

1063
02:04:56,529 --> 02:04:59,648
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1064
02:04:59,782 --> 02:05:01,182
Babies?

1065
02:05:01,492 --> 02:05:03,366
She's carrying twins.

1066
02:05:45,536 --> 02:05:46,536
Luke.

1067
02:05:55,212 --> 02:05:56,671
Oh, Luke.

1068
02:06:19,153 --> 02:06:21,478
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1069
02:07:10,955 --> 02:07:12,828
There's good in him.

1070
02:07:15,543 --> 02:07:16,918
I know.

1071
02:07:17,628 --> 02:07:21,211
I know there's... still-

1072
02:07:56,458 --> 02:07:57,917
Lord Vader.

1073
02:07:59,253 --> 02:08:01,376
Can you hear me?

1074
02:08:04,425 --> 02:08:05,883
Yes, Master.

1075
02:08:09,013 --> 02:08:10,886
Where is Padmé?

1076
02:08:12,725 --> 02:08:14,598
Is she safe?

1077
02:08:15,728 --> 02:08:17,720
Is she all right?

1078
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:23,983
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1079
02:08:25,029 --> 02:08:27,899
I? I couldn't have.

1080
02:08:28,032 --> 02:08:31,033
She was alive. I felt it!

1081
02:09:04,985 --> 02:09:08,604
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1082
02:09:10,407 --> 02:09:13,942
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1083
02:09:16,497 --> 02:09:18,620
Split up they should be.

1084
02:09:19,333 --> 02:09:21,242
My wife and I will take the girl.

1085
02:09:22,836 --> 02:09:25,707
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1086
02:09:25,839 --> 02:09:28,081
She will be loved with us.

1087
02:09:29,009 --> 02:09:30,966
And what of the boy?

1088
02:09:31,929 --> 02:09:35,428
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1089
02:09:37,268 --> 02:09:39,675
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1090
02:09:45,150 --> 02:09:48,816
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1091
02:09:50,656 --> 02:09:54,239
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1092
02:09:55,786 --> 02:10:00,993
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1093
02:10:02,334 --> 02:10:03,615
Training?

1094
02:10:03,752 --> 02:10:08,331
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1095
02:10:10,384 --> 02:10:13,468
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1096
02:10:13,596 --> 02:10:16,003
Your old master.

1097
02:10:16,724 --> 02:10:18,182
Qui-Gon?

1098
02:10:20,728 --> 02:10:23,978
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1099
02:10:25,482 --> 02:10:27,605
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1100
02:10:27,735 --> 02:10:29,608
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1101
02:10:29,737 --> 02:10:31,610
Treat them well.
Clean them up.

1102
02:10:31,739 --> 02:10:33,612
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1103
02:10:33,741 --> 02:10:34,741
What?

1104
02:10:35,305 --> 02:11:35,874

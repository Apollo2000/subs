1
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:27,874
Hi.

2
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,109
Hey. Hey.

3
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:30,177
How you doin'?

4
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,778
I'm Doreen.

5
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:34,080
I'm Dee.

6
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,783
They call me Diamonds.

7
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,188
I'm Doreen.

8
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:15,088
Tully?

9
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:16,556
Doreen?

10
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,226
That is me.

11
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,864
Well, come on, get in.
Don't be scared.

12
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:39,513
You're a lot shorter than
I thought you were gonna be.

13
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,617
So?

14
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,054
Was your daddy short?

15
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,258
He looked tall to me.

16
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,894
Hitler was short.

17
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:56,263
Hitler was short?

18
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:58,098
It's a good thing
I am not datin' Hitler.

19
00:03:58,131 --> 00:03:59,966
That would not work out.

20
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,769
Well, you ain't
datin' me neither.

21
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:06,006
Anyway, expectations
lead to sufferin'.

22
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,774
Did Hitler say that?

23
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:10,610
Nope. Buddha.

24
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:11,778
If I'm not mistaken,

25
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:15,282
it is forbidden
to quote Buddha.

26
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:16,950
Ignorance is forbidden.

27
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,986
Can't be
an Aryan by being a fool.

28
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,855
Did Buddha
say that to you?

29
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,590
No, I did.

30
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,195
Smarty-pants, huh?

31
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,297
That's what you are?

32
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,966
You're a smarty-pants?

33
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:34,301
Is that a smile?

34
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,604
Oh, he's cute
when he smiles, folks.

35
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,108
Say bye-bye.

36
00:04:58,224 --> 00:04:59,693
You all right?

37
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,863
Fifteen years.

38
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:07,701
Yeah, it's a long time.

39
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:14,341
But good news
is you are out today.

40
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,977
And today
is a nice day to be free.

41
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,048
Nice day.

42
00:05:24,017 --> 00:05:26,386
You know,
you should quit smokin'.

43
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,055
That stuff will kill ya.

44
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,724
Yup.

45
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:32,359
I just don't light it.
I hold on to it.

46
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:33,660
It helps me.

47
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:34,895
You could try that.

48
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,366
Where's the gun?

49
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,336
Gun is gonna be
underneath your seat there.

50
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,239
I went through hell tryin'
to get a hold of that thing.

51
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:47,908
Hold it down a little bit?

52
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,078
All right,
let's get to parole.

53
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,714
Then we'll make
the drop-off for Sobecki.

54
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,016
What time you
gotta be there again?

55
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,384
7:30.

56
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,652
7:30.

57
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,722
Yeah, we'll get
there in time.

58
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,391
I'll get you there.
I have to.

59
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,893
Why?

60
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,098
Got to pick up
my little boy afterwards.

61
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,237
My little baby.

62
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:01,948
Shit.

63
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,850
Shit.

64
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:06,420
Tully?

65
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,788
Tully?

66
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:09,823
Tully.

67
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,224
Tully, Tully.

68
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:13,059
We got a cop behind us.

69
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:16,996
Fucking...

70
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,098
No worries.

71
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,098
It's a fucking nigger cop.

72
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:19,466
I hate fucking cops.

73
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,768
I didn't do anything.

74
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,336
Your fucking
taillights workin'?

75
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,336
No, everything's fine.

76
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,904
Then that guy...

77
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,904
I didn't do anything.

78
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:28,308
What?

79
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:28,308
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

80
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,876
Goddamn.

81
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,876
You just let me
do all the talking.

82
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,177
Do not fucking
take that gun out.

83
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,879
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

84
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,027
They gettin' out?

85
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,301
Good evenin', officer.

86
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,238
License and registration,
please.

87
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,140
Absolutely.
Absolutely, yeah.

88
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:02,442
Your name, sir?

89
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,811
This is Deputy Rivers.

90
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:06,446
I'm in the middle--

91
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:06,446
Get on your
fucking knees, nigger.

92
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,447
Tully!

93
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:15,421
Just fucking go!

94
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,190
What did you do?

95
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,190
Just fucking drive.

96
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,292
What did you do?
What did you do?

97
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:22,295
Did you just
kill a fucking cop?

98
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:22,295
Just go! Let's go!

99
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,997
Did you fucking kill--

100
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,997
Just fucking drive.

101
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,132
A fucking cop?

102
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,193
Shit.

103
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:54,861
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

104
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,262
Yeah, but where?

105
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,264
Come on,
let's go, come on.

106
00:08:58,297 --> 00:08:59,232
Come on.

107
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,085
Come on.

108
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:06,633
Check the car.

109
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,068
Check the car.

110
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:13,874
Shit.

111
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,579
Shit.
Come on, come on.

112
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:24,050
Shh.
Shh, shh.

113
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:36,362
Sonny, wake up.

114
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,231
What?

115
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,231
Wake up.

116
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,999
What?

117
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,168
Sounds like someone's
in the house.

118
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,168
Okay.

119
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:44,203
Give me a minute.

120
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:48,474
I hear him
comin' up the stairs.

121
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,376
Wake your ass up...

122
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,079
Oh, God, oh.

123
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,081
Oh.

124
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,081
Sonny, who is it?

125
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,250
Who's out there?

126
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,285
Yo.

127
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:02,221
Hey, who the--

128
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:04,524
Hey, who-who
the hell are you?

129
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,592
Sonny, who is it?

130
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,592
Who the hell are you?

131
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,428
Sonny, what's happening?

132
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,428
Walking into a man's house,

133
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,196
all times of the night,

134
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,196
Sonny, who are
you yellin' at?

135
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,999
swingin' a-a-a damn pistol

136
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,701
every which way and everywhere.

137
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,701
What's goin'--

138
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,703
I will blow
your fuckin' head off, nigger.

139
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:20,974
Sonny!

140
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,713
How many
are in the house?

141
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,748
I said how many
in the fuckin' house, nigger.

142
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:34,421
Two.

143
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:38,257
Round 'em up.

144
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,559
And you?

145
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:43,029
Old man,
get your fuckin' pants on.

146
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:48,401
Let's go!
Come on!

147
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,570
Jesus Christ, come on!

148
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:52,372
I'm goin',
I'm goin', I'm goin'.

149
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:01,681
Get-Get in there.

150
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:01,681
Mom!

151
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,217
Do what he says, honey.
We don't want no trouble.

152
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:19,265
Where's the baby?

153
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:20,733
Where's the fuckin' baby?

154
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:22,335
There's no baby here.

155
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,773
Not my babies, no.

156
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:28,041
Mama!

157
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,675
Mom.

158
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,511
No.

159
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,379
Ah, shit. Look-y here.

160
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,547
Children in a brother's house.

161
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,748
Now there's a surprise.

162
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,250
I thought you said two.

163
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:38,484
Adults.

164
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:41,187
Two adults.

165
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:41,187
Yeah, shut up.

166
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,522
It's gonna be okay.

167
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,223
You think
you're smarter than me?

168
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:46,125
Huh?

169
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,194
You think you're
smarter than me, old man?

170
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:52,765
Shh.

171
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,034
Get in there.

172
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,042
Stay with me.

173
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,337
Anthony.

174
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,405
Wake up.

175
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,178
Get up.

176
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:42,582
Just open the door.

177
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,651
Get your fuckin'--
Get in there, boy!

178
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,420
Huh?
You want some?

179
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,421
No.

180
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,421
Huh?

181
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,422
Get back.

182
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,157
That's right.

183
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,859
Where are the phones?

184
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:54,727
There's one in the bedroom.
There's two downstairs.

185
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,762
One in the living room,
one in the kitchen and that it.

186
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,331
Cars, vehicles?

187
00:13:58,364 --> 00:13:59,799
Huh?

188
00:13:58,364 --> 00:13:59,799
Come on,
take what you want.

189
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,400
We ain't gonna
try and stop you.

190
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,735
How the fuck
do you know what I want?

191
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,604
You presumptuous bitch.

192
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,640
The Firebird's got
a blown gasket.
Somehow it runs.

193
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:08,875
Yeah, what else, nigger?

194
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,244
Old station wagon's
almost out of gas.

195
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,379
Firebird got gas?

196
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,379
Yeah.

197
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,915
Huh?

198
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,915
No, no, I said it has
a blown gasket but it runs.

199
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,884
It's got gas, yeah.

200
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,653
Guns, weapon?
Huh?

201
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,722
No guns... here.

202
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,590
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

203
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,893
A blue lip
out here in the country?

204
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,261
Shit.

205
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:29,529
I'm an ex-con.

206
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:31,564
I have no
intention of going back.

207
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:32,798
An ex-con?

208
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,502
What the fuck
do you know about time, man?

209
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,404
I know about time.

210
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:40,173
Do you hear that?

211
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:43,276
The neighbors will be sure
to hear that, if it goes off.

212
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:45,811
Yeah? Let me tell
you somethin', mister.

213
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,482
This fires, you won't be worryin'
about no fuckin' neighbors.

214
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:50,850
Who's that man?

215
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,654
The Boogeyman.

216
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,322
You're not the Boogeyman.

217
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,924
Hush up!

218
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,659
Yeah, that's right, son.

219
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,427
I ain't the boogeyman.

220
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,963
You are.

221
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,798
Boo!

222
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,798
Come on,
leave the baby alone.

223
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,700
He's just a child.

224
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,700
Shut the fuck up.

225
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,435
Yo, stop pointin'
that shit at my mom.

226
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,435
No, no, no.

227
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:10,736
No!

228
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:10,736
Relax!

229
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,439
Fuck you!

230
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,439
Listen up.

231
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,908
There are more of us.
Lots more.

232
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:17,810
I'm just the unlucky fucker
that got sent up here to deal

233
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,712
with you niggers.

234
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,447
But let me tell you, the shit's
hittin' the fan tonight.

235
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,982
It's a fuckin' race war.

236
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,350
Armageddon.

237
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,219
Death to Jews
and Niggers, you get it?

238
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,927
Fuck.

239
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,262
What the fuck
happened in there?

240
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:37,897
How many people?

241
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,299
I don't know,
family of five, six.

242
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:41,300
I took care of it.

243
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,902
Six people?

244
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,902
We got keys.

245
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:45,504
I got eight hours,
so let's fucking go.

246
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:45,504
Whoa, whoa!

247
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,441
Wait a second. We can't just take the keys
and drive a car out there.

248
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,810
What if-What if-What if
they call the cops on us?

249
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,678
Yank the fucking
phones, fuck it.

250
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,814
How about they just go right
on to the neighbor's house?

251
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:56,015
Fine, we'll take
one of them with us.

252
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,683
I don't think
we got a choice, huh?

253
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,285
We'll take a chance.

254
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:02,021
We do not have
that kind of chance right now.

255
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:03,789
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

256
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:06,392
Do you hear all these
fucking cops everywhere?

257
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:10,997
Yo, I say we jump him.

258
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,531
Smash his fucking brains.

259
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,300
What?
And get us all killed?

260
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,868
You heard that man.

261
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:18,337
He's on some
white supremacist bullshit.

262
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,906
Like, sworn to hate.
He's not gonna listen to no shit we say.

263
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,441
That's why
we let him leave.

264
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:23,843
His business
is none of my business.

265
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:25,245
We can't just
fuckin' sit here.

266
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:28,814
The word is patience.

267
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:31,517
Sounds like fear.

268
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,019
You're gonna take him?
You ain't shit.

269
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:37,490
Fuck you!

270
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,891
No. Stop!

271
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,891
You ain't shit.

272
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:40,326
You're not
gonna treat my son

273
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,628
the way you treat yours.
Now, you stop it.

274
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:43,696
Come on.

275
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,299
For once,
Mr. Walker is right.

276
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:48,034
We just let him leave.

277
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,969
And God-willing,
then we call the police.

278
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:51,404
No, no, no.
No police.

279
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,039
No, I have
nothing for the police.

280
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,341
I can't have
no police here.

281
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:56,809
What are you
talking about?

282
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,477
You can't
put your pants on.

283
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,812
Let alone
pull 'em off.

284
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:00,813
What are
you gonna do?

285
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:02,448
Goddamn it.

286
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,949
Mama.

287
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,949
Handle it.

288
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,484
I said that's enough.

289
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,484
No, it's not enough.

290
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:06,652
I'm just
gettin' started.

291
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,354
Mama.

292
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,354
No.

293
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:11,424
We get out of here,
God-willing. I'm walkin'.

294
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:12,825
Then walk.

295
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:12,825
I had enough
of this shit.

296
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:13,826
You walk,
you run, do whatever.

297
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,628
You ain't no prize.

298
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,063
You ain't
no prize, either.

299
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,063
You ain't no prize left.

300
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,934
Okay.

301
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,005
Okay.

302
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,005
So, what then?

303
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:27,773
If you're so goddamn smart?

304
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,075
I don't know.
I gotta calm down.

305
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,075
Huh? Huh?

306
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:30,776
I gotta think.

307
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,511
I gotta think about it.
We need to think about it.

308
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,779
'Cause takin'
that car is a stupid idea.

309
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:35,414
That is a stupid idea.

310
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,682
We can't argue with ourselves,

311
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:37,883
we can't
fight him by ourself,

312
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,485
we can't
beat ourselves up.

313
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,753
Yeah, but I'm not
trustin' that dude

314
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:42,355
to come back up
here and just wait.

315
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:43,422
Patience.

316
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:44,724
Understand
that, Anthony?

317
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,492
Just a little
patience, okay?

318
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,760
You saw him
when he talked about

319
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,528
when I talked
about when I did time,

320
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,063
that I wasn't
gonna do no time,

321
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,798
so I had no gun.
You saw the way he'd look?

322
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,066
He understood that.

323
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:55,601
He thought
he could belittle me.

324
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,869
He thought
he could take me down.

325
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:59,038
Because I had said that.

326
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,873
And I looked him
right in the eye. He's pointin' a gun at it.

327
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:02,575
I know what time is.

328
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,677
I know what this dude is.
I've seen these cats before.

329
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,979
He knows that us

330
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,115
alive, that's
what keeps him goin'.

331
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,483
He has
no place to go.

332
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:11,617
Where does
he have to go?

333
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,618
He's right here.

334
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,153
He's trapped in here.

335
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:16,021
He's even more trapped
then we are trapped in.

336
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,591
Now you
understand that?

337
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:19,658
Okay.

338
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,761
Remember.

339
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,129
They need us.

340
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:24,597
Would you
just fuckin' think?

341
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,699
I'm trying
to fuckin' think.

342
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:30,936
Not helping.
You know what, fuck you.
I'm gonna call. I'm callin'.

343
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:32,938
Who the fuck you're callin'?

344
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:32,938
I'm callin'-callin'
Sobecki's guy.

345
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:35,040
He gave me this
number and he said
call them if I ever get--

346
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,442
Which fucking guy?

347
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,710
Sobecki's guy.

348
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,678
Do you need
any more information?

349
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,181
What are you, like,
questioning Sobecki all of the sudden?

350
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:44,450
You done lost
your fucking mind.

351
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,526
My God.

352
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,762
How the fuck
did I get myself into this mess?

353
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,832
Hi!

354
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,467
Hey.
How are you doin'?

355
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,069
Sobecki gave me
this number, and...

356
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,905
I don't-- We don't
really know each other,

357
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,474
but I thought-- He told me,
he told me to call this number

358
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:11,777
if I ran into
any kind of trouble, and this whole thing,

359
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,746
we got this mess,
and now we got cops after us.

360
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,683
And just,
I feel like we need, mmm...

361
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:21,120
maybe we need somebody
to come get us or something.

362
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,458
License and registration,
please.

363
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,160
Get on your
fucking knees, nigger.

364
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,710
Feels good, huh?

365
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,190
I need more,
'cause I don't know.

366
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,559
You don't know--
Okay, no, it's no big deal.

367
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,228
I'll just...
Okay, thank you so much.

368
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:03,996
Really,
it's really good talk--

369
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:05,064
Talk.

370
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,638
I told you Sobecki
was gonna come through.

371
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,073
What did he say?

372
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:16,976
Eddie is gonna call
with a plan to rescue us.

373
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,245
Doreen, the fucking
place is crawling with cops.

374
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:22,882
Eddie also
said we gotta...

375
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:22,882
What?

376
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:23,949
We gotta kill them.

377
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:25,284
Kill who?

378
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,019
Whoever's
in the house.

379
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:28,854
Jesus fucking
Christ, Doreen.

380
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,890
Those were his exact words?
Kill them?

381
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,091
Yes,
that's what he said.

382
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,759
He said...

383
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,261
He said you gotta
take care of them,

384
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:37,296
but I know what he was
talkin' about.

385
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:39,632
For Christ's sake,
he was on the phone.
What is he supposed to say?

386
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:41,567
Kill everybody
while he's on the phone?

387
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,102
Maybe fucking take care
of them means take care
of them.

388
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,970
You ever think of that?

389
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,739
Discipline and action,
that's what Sobecki would say.

390
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:49,041
Discipline?
You really know a lot about that.

391
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:50,109
Like,
what are you gonna do?

392
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:51,544
You gonna
kill a baby?

393
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:53,145
What, are you gonna
fight me right now?

394
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:54,947
We are in this together.

395
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,715
Are you gonna
disobey Sobecki?

396
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,751
That wasn't Sobecki.

397
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,751
That was Sobecki's man.

398
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:00,986
And for me,
that's good enough.

399
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,955
What are you gonna do? You're gonna spray
the whole goddamn neighborhood

400
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:04,623
and walk out of here?

401
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:04,623
Do you think

402
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:06,859
for one second
that I want to kill anybody?

403
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,928
'Cause believe me, I do not.

404
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:11,196
I do not, but you know what?
I'm not gettin' caught.

405
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,731
Why'd you got
to go and kill that cop?

406
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:14,066
We were doing so--

407
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:15,801
Jesus Christ,
you think I had a choice?

408
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,202
Maybe if you brought
some fucking money,

409
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,304
we wouldn't be
in this fucking situation.

410
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,773
Goddamn.

411
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:23,175
Anthony. Anthony.

412
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:23,175
Let him come up here.

413
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,611
Anthony, you need
to calm your little ass down.

414
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,611
I'm not gonna wait for him.

415
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:27,279
Shh.

416
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:27,279
Come on, boy,
these people got guns.

417
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,781
Tell him
I'll fuck him up.

418
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:30,182
Anthony, shut the fuck up.

419
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:31,750
What the fuck?

420
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,118
What do you do to them?
Where are they?

421
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,320
They're
in the fuckin' closet.

422
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:35,621
Get me
the fuck out of here.

423
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:36,589
Get--

424
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,259
Okay.

425
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,727
Hey, hey.

426
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,762
What the hell
is goin' on here?

427
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:44,763
Shut the fuck up.

428
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,098
It's-It's over now.

429
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:47,700
He was just scared,
that's all.

430
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,034
He's tryin'
to make me kill someone?

431
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,637
No, no, no.
We'll do what you say.

432
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:57,676
There's a baby
and a little boy in here.

433
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:58,744
Oh, shit.

434
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,279
Out, now.

435
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:01,947
Come on.

436
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,182
All on the bed.

437
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,355
Sit down.

438
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:12,358
Get your ass

439
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:13,693
in the corner.

440
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,903
Nice to meet all y'all.

441
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,680
That's-That's
a cute baby.

442
00:22:34,713 --> 00:22:35,748
How old's that baby?

443
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:38,250
Seven months.

444
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,318
Tomorrow.

445
00:22:39,351 --> 00:22:40,953
You the father?

446
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,688
No.

447
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:45,290
Then how the fuck do you fit
into this little menagerie?

448
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,659
She's my sister.

449
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:52,264
Where's papa?

450
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:53,699
Oh, fuck.

451
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,100
It's not you,
old man, is it?

452
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,402
No.

453
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:58,771
Oh, shit, I see.

454
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:00,806
Hump and run,
black man's dream.

455
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,408
White man's burden.

456
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:04,443
Don't get any ideas
about suckin' up to these

457
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,045
fucking bitches,
'cause they're all the same.

458
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:08,013
Yeah.

459
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:08,013
Watch 'em.

460
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,915
And you, little missy.

461
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:11,283
You're gonna
come with me.

462
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,285
Where?

463
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,285
None of your
goddamn business where.

464
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:15,254
Get your fuckin' ass over here.

465
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,156
I don't want to.

466
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,156
We're just
gonna look around, is all.

467
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,191
If any harm comes to her...

468
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,191
You'd do what?

469
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:20,760
Shit your pants, old man?

470
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:26,231
What you gonna do?

471
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:27,433
Let's go, now.

472
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:28,967
Come on,
leave the niglet behind.

473
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,703
Mommy, no!

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,703
Jesus Christ.

475
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:32,771
You either come
with me, or I take the baby.

476
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,740
Mr. Walker,
please do something.

477
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,740
Jesus Christ.

478
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,443
Stop it!

479
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,214
Hey, hey.

480
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:43,449
You don't have to...

481
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:44,750
Everybody
just keep calm.

482
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:46,085
Just keep calm, okay?

483
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:47,352
Shut up.

484
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:47,352
Anthony.

485
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,721
Just keep calm.

486
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,721
Sit down, Anthony.

487
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:50,022
Sit down.

488
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:50,022
Come on.

489
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,090
Please.

490
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,090
Come on.

491
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:55,394
All right.

492
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,062
We're good, right?
We're good.

493
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:58,230
They're just
gonna go outside for a minute

494
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,199
and we'll hang tight.

495
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,467
Okay.

496
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,802
You know,
if it weren't for me,

497
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,038
y'all would be
dead right now.

498
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,441
Dead.
You know that, right?
'Cause I said to him, I said

499
00:24:09,474 --> 00:24:12,812
you can't be
just killin' people 'cause
of their color of their skin.

500
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,985
You scared?

501
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:21,186
It's okay.

502
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,421
I'm scared.

503
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,323
I'm freakin'
out right now.

504
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,492
I'm freakin' out,
look at my hand.

505
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:46,178
Oops.

506
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:47,513
Ah, shit,
look at that.

507
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:49,481
Ah, shit.
Ah, shit.

508
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:49,481
Ah.

509
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,916
Quick, quick, quick.
You want to hold it?

510
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,151
No.

511
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,151
You don't want to hold it?

512
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,218
No, no.

513
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,218
Come on, hold it.

514
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,087
Make a mess.

515
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,087
I can't.

516
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,890
I bet you sucked
a few of these, all right.

517
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:00,526
Look at those lips.

518
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,928
They're just made
for suckin'.

519
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,265
I should kill you.

520
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,936
I should, but I'm gonna
make you a deal instead.

521
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,171
You love
your kids, right?

522
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:13,906
Yes.

523
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:13,906
Yes?

524
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,874
Yes.

525
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,874
You want to see
them again tomorrow, right?

526
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,310
Yes. Yes!

527
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,310
And the day after?

528
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,479
Good.
Then you're gonna
tell me what he's thinkin' what,

529
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:23,882
plannin' what,
sayin' what, comprende?

530
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:25,217
Is that a yes?

531
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,286
Yes, yes, yes.

532
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,087
Okay.

533
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,023
And if I should happen
to overhear something

534
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:33,192
that you
didn't report to me,

535
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:35,561
that would be
a fucking shame, right?

536
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:36,995
Yes.

537
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:36,995
Yeah.

538
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:38,564
A downright
fucking tragedy.

539
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,585
[sighs]

540
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,327
Um...

541
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,327
Nah, I'm good.

542
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,494
I don't
want to see it.

543
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:14,200
Tell me about
the truck you saw.

544
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,135
Blue, green.

545
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:18,370
Maybe brown.

546
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:19,371
No se.

547
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:20,539
Bullshit, no se.

548
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:22,140
It's the truth, I swear.

549
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:23,342
What about the woman?

550
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,944
White, maybe Black?

551
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,279
White or maybe Black.

552
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:28,614
Sarge, I got here
as fast as I could.

553
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:29,615
Sarge!

554
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:31,216
I got something.

555
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:33,919
The truck was
registered to a Doreen Lesser.

556
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:37,890
Rivers called this
in before he went down.

557
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:41,660
Pelican Bay says she's
an Aryan Brotherhood groupie.

558
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:45,597
Now, she picked up an inmate
this morning.

559
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,001
Garrett Tully. Number three
in the Aryan Brotherhood.

560
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:52,671
He finished
out 15 years today.

561
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:54,640
Of course.

562
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:56,608
We're dealin'
with a psychopath.

563
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,611
Luis.

564
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,611
A cop-killin' psychopath.

565
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:01,981
El senor.

566
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,284
If you saw anything,
okay?

567
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:07,486
We got a cop
down over there,

568
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,987
I need you to tell me.

569
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,356
Sir, I told you
everything that I saw.

570
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,492
I-I'm sorry.

571
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:15,327
Okay.

572
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,029
All right, thank you.

573
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:18,697
Listen, man.

574
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,699
We need the make and the
model of that car. All right?

575
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:23,269
Yeah.

576
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:23,269
We're gonna find
this racist bastard.

577
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:36,181
You good?

578
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:37,983
Yeah.

579
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,489
They've been comin' back
and forth.

580
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:46,325
Shit.

581
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:47,660
Trouble with the law.

582
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,196
It's none
of your goddamn business.

583
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:54,299
Now, don't--
Now, don't tell me.

584
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,268
Wasn't a question,
just a statement.

585
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,372
None of my business
what you've done.

586
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:04,142
No lie there.

587
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:07,379
Not interested.

588
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:08,480
Mm.

589
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:12,084
Made my share of troubles.

590
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:17,456
What kind of trouble?

591
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,525
Mm.

592
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,094
Real trouble.

593
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:26,331
Ah.

594
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:27,700
All I'm saying is...

595
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:31,603
I don't like the law...

596
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,007
and you don't
like the law.

597
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:42,214
You want out of here,

598
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:44,049
and we want
you out of here.

599
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:48,620
Sounds like we have
something in common.

600
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:59,564
You got a match?

601
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:02,134
You got a match, light?

602
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,602
Come on.

603
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:05,170
Don't tell me there
isn't a single fucking match

604
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:09,241
in this entire house.

605
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:10,542
Back here,
you got one?

606
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:13,745
Yeah, I got one.

607
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:16,248
Come on,
man, let's have it.

608
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:17,249
In my room.

609
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,051
Where?

610
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,053
I don't know,
in the drawer somewhere.
I don't smoke.

611
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,387
The fuck you don't.

612
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,122
Show me.

613
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:25,424
Yes.

614
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:25,424
I'm gonna show
it to you, anyway.

615
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:26,425
Get--

616
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,393
Patience.

617
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:31,263
Patience.

618
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:32,331
Slowly, boy.

619
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,403
Go on.

620
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:39,772
Where's that
fuckin' lighter?

621
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,079
You've ever
done time, boy?

622
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,482
No.

623
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,818
Come on, it's a rite of passage
for you brothers, right?

624
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:54,853
No respect
without time.

625
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,721
Not in my book.

626
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,558
Or, your daddy ever done time?
I bet you he's done time.

627
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:04,629
My daddy's dead.

628
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:05,697
Your daddy's dead.

629
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,499
Whee.
How did he die?

630
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:10,069
Fucking gang-banging, holdin'
up the liquor store, or what?

631
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:14,673
Desert Storm.
He was a soldier.

632
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:22,814
I know what
you're thinkin', boy.

633
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:24,149
The old man's weak,

634
00:30:24,182 --> 00:30:25,250
the women
can't do nothin',

635
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:26,518
so it's up to you, right?

636
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,792
It's crossed my mind.

637
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:35,594
Uncross it, motherfucker.

638
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,529
Ain't no use dyin'
before you see the big house.

639
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:39,698
It just wouldn't seem proper.
You know what I mean?

640
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,625
Let's go, boy.

641
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,646
You look like a farmer.
Are you a farmer?

642
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,216
No.
Scrap metal now.

643
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:35,487
I still fix cars, blinds,
you name it.

644
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,322
That sounds boring.
And what do you do?

645
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:40,959
Home care
for the elderly.

646
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:43,595
I could never do it.

647
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,364
What about you?
I bet you ain't got no job, right?

648
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:47,632
I got one.

649
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:49,434
Deliver pizza
on Fridays, sometimes.

650
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,503
Sometimes.
Shit, it must be
nice being black.

651
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,405
All that spare time.

652
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,273
Where the fuck are we at?

653
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:56,942
Anthony, no.

654
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:58,310
Not necessary, now.

655
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,212
He's got a knife.

656
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:01,813
Let me go, my God.

657
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:03,715
Get the fuck off of me.

658
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:05,617
I'm taking her
and my family with me.

659
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,718
Anthony.

660
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:07,853
I'll slice her neck, I will.

661
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:11,389
Cut away.

662
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:13,592
What the fuck, Tully?

663
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:13,592
Hey!

664
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:14,693
No.

665
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,228
Tully, it's me.

666
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:17,229
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

667
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,396
Slice, dice,

668
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:19,397
chop whatever the fuck.

669
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:19,397
Tully.

670
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,599
A-Anthony.

671
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:21,866
Put it down, boy.
P-Put it down.

672
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,702
You're gonna cut her?

673
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,003
Go on.
I got nothin' invested in her.

674
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,003
Tully.

675
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:26,004
Hey, hey.
You're gonna--

676
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,239
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

677
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,441
Get your hand off me.

678
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,441
Hey.

679
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,843
If he puts it down,

680
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,011
you promise
not to kill him?

681
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:34,713
If-If he

682
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:35,880
gives it up...

683
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:35,880
Stop touching me.

684
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,416
You promise
not to kill him?

685
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,318
Y-Y-Your word?

686
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:41,319
Y-Y-Your word?

687
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:42,787
Your word?

688
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,389
You got
my fucking word, nigger.

689
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,389
Your word, okay.

690
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,957
No trouble, okay.

691
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,392
All right, all right?

692
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,261
Tell him that.

693
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:50,729
Tell him!

694
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,430
No trouble.

695
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,430
Okay, yeah.

696
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:54,799
Yeah, your word.
Give him your word.

697
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:56,301
My word.

698
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,269
All right.

699
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,705
That's right.

700
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:02,674
This is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

701
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,643
He violated me.
Tully, he violated me.

702
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:05,977
He had
his hands all over me.

703
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,545
He didn't touch her.
He didn't touch her.

704
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:08,546
He did!

705
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:09,547
Yes, he did!

706
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:12,017
Anthony!

707
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,518
Anthony, baby?

708
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:15,020
Anthony.

709
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:16,588
Anthony, no!

710
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:17,856
Your word.

711
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:19,424
Oh, my God!

712
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,425
Anthony.

713
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,426
Oh!

714
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:22,894
Your word!

715
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,797
He ain't
fuckin' dead, is he?

716
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,965
Come on.

717
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:31,970
Fuck.

718
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:32,971
Okay.

719
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:34,673
Okay.

720
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:34,673
All right.

721
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:36,374
He is not fucking dead.

722
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,442
That isn't
the fucking problem.

723
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:38,843
You almost
got me killed.

724
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:40,979
Nobody fucking talks
to me that way, you understand.

725
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,814
Least of all you.

726
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:44,683
Shit.

727
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,624
Fuck you.

728
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,059
Fuck me.

729
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:57,529
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

730
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:02,400
Anthony got shot.

731
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,069
Is he okay?

732
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:05,737
Is he okay?

733
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:05,737
Just rest, my baby.

734
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,472
Tell me.

735
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:08,707
What?

736
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:13,678
What?
Is he okay?

737
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:17,916
You gave your brother up,
you little bitch.

738
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:20,785
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

739
00:34:20,818 --> 00:34:23,355
My God, I got two babies.

740
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:25,523
And I told you
not to have them.

741
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:27,425
This is not--

742
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:27,425
But you had them
anyway, didn't you?

743
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,960
You had them, anyway.

744
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,960
...my fault!

745
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:29,994
None of it.

746
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,730
I'm tired of you

747
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:34,766
blaming me for everything,
and this is not my fault.

748
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:36,401
You don't do that.

749
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,370
You don't give
your brother up, baby.

750
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:39,738
Mom--

751
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:39,738
You don't, ever.

752
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:41,573
...Mother.

753
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:41,573
Give your brother up.

754
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,741
Ever!

755
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,741
What was I

756
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:44,376
supposed to do?

757
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:44,376
Ever, ever.

758
00:34:58,823 --> 00:34:59,991
What you doin'?

759
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:03,161
Unzip your pants.

760
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:04,129
What?

761
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,500
I said,
unzip your pants.

762
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:19,177
It's okay.

763
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,179
I'm just gonna
do what I do best.

764
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,148
Yeah.

765
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:25,550
You deserve this.

766
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,885
You're fine now.

767
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,060
You like this?

768
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,896
Doreen?

769
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,896
You like this?

770
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:41,566
What do I got to do

771
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,802
to get you hard?
I have to talk a little bit?

772
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:45,637
Huh?
I can talk.

773
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:49,674
Baby, what's it take
to get you hard?

774
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:52,110
You just tell me,
I'll do it for you.

775
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:54,179
All right,
Doreen-Doreen stop, all right?

776
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:55,547
Okay, look.

777
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,948
That's enough.

778
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,119
It's like a fucking record.
What's wrong with you?

779
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:06,658
White men are the nuts
and bolts of society.

780
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:08,927
And their warriors
must be as strong

781
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,662
and pure
as their philosophy.

782
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:13,198
What the fuck
does that mean?

783
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:15,133
It means you
sacrifice your petty needs

784
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,202
and desires for something
more important than yourself.

785
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:19,070
Something bigger,
you understand?

786
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:21,072
What, did you say that?

787
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:22,641
No, Sobecki did.

788
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,679
Sobecki said that.

789
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,782
Of course he did.

790
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:39,491
Well, I guess that means
prison done turned you gay.

791
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:43,495
Fuck!

792
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:44,662
Don't you ever fucking

793
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:45,997
call me gay,
you understand me,

794
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,599
you fucking bitch,
don't you ever!

795
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,234
Get the fuck off of me.

796
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:51,936
Don't you fucking touch...
Get off of me.

797
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:55,540
Don't you ever
fucking talk to me
or grab me like that again.

798
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:57,675
You hear me?

799
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,244
Don't fucking
touch me again.

800
00:36:59,277 --> 00:37:01,246
Fucking touch me.

801
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:02,914
Fucking touch me.

802
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:08,720
Fuck.

803
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:11,055
Fucking touch me.

804
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,857
Let's just drive, okay?

805
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,759
Let's just fucking drive.

806
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,759
Don't tell me what to do.

807
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:22,767
Everybody told
you not to have them.

808
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,570
Tully. Tully.

809
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:26,738
Listen to me.

810
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:28,206
We need to do
what Sobecki said.

811
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,108
And just slit their throat.

812
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,876
Just slit their throat.

813
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,876
What the fuck
are you talking about?

814
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,177
Use your brain.

815
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,177
Listen to me,
listen to me.

816
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,879
You gotta be
a man right now for me.

817
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:36,114
You have got
to do something.

818
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:38,082
Be a fucking Aryan.

819
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:39,584
Use your fucking brain.

820
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:41,286
They're more
valuable to us alive.

821
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:43,288
To who?

822
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:46,324
Jesus Christ, you don't think
we work with their kind on the inside?

823
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:48,293
This is--

824
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:48,293
Business
is fucking business.

825
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:50,828
We are
on the outside right now.

826
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:54,799
We are on the outside. And on the outside,
you do them before they do you.

827
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:57,135
That is the fucking business.

828
00:37:57,168 --> 00:38:00,805
Fucking... If you're so fucking game,
why don't you start with the baby in the crib?

829
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:01,906
You are not getting it.

830
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,241
You-You need to do this.

831
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:04,609
You have got to do this.

832
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:05,977
And the baby?
Why shoot the baby?

833
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,111
The baby
can't fucking even talk.

834
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,111
Fine.

835
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,846
Fuck it,
the little boy then.

836
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,282
He's seen
our faces, start with him.

837
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,282
Shh!

838
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,256
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

839
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:20,625
Fine. I will.

840
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:25,830
Oh, fu--

841
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:34,339
How he's doin'?

842
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:35,807
He's gonna be okay?

843
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:42,213
I just--
I wanna apologize.

844
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:43,281
Um...

845
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:45,683
I'm real sorry.

846
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:47,752
About what I said.

847
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:48,886
Because, um...

848
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,254
sometimes you
just get into

849
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,190
this kind of dilemma,
and things come out,

850
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:53,891
you don't really--
you don't-don't really know,

851
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:56,227
and I really--
I want to apologize for that.

852
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,396
We-We all--
We all need to stick together.

853
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:00,398
Because he...

854
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:04,836
He's real unpredictable,
you know what I mean?
I'm scared.

855
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:07,939
I'm freezing, I'm hungry,
I just want to go home.

856
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:10,908
I'm hungry too, Mommy.

857
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:10,908
I know, baby.

858
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:12,043
You're hungry?

859
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,380
I'm hungry.

860
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:17,749
You want to go
get some food with me?

861
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:19,684
No.

862
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:21,052
You just
said you were hungry.

863
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:22,754
I'm hungry, too.
It's okay.

864
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:24,255
You want to go

865
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:26,257
in the kitchen with me
and help me find some food,

866
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,060
something to make, like,
a peanut butter and jelly with.

867
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,060
No.

868
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:30,995
It'll be fun.
You and me, we're gonna
go make peanut butter--

869
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:32,764
No.
He ain't goin' with you.

870
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:32,764
He ain't goin'.

871
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:34,365
The boy
stays with his mother.

872
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:34,365
Go to hell.

873
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:35,700
The boy stays with his mother.

874
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:35,700
Shut the fu--

875
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,902
Hey, shut the fuck up!

876
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:40,138
I am this close
to killin' all of you.

877
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:40,138
The boy stays with his mother.

878
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:41,406
The boy goes.
That's it, it's final.

879
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:42,774
Go!

880
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:42,774
...stays with--

881
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:44,075
Jesus fucking Christ.

882
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:46,077
You all listen
to me, you understand?

883
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,246
Let's just--

884
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,246
Goddamn, I'd never
thought I'd miss solitary.

885
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:49,280
Shut the fuck up.

886
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:50,348
You, go.

887
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:51,316
Now.

888
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:56,054
He's coming.
Come on.

889
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:01,726
He's bleeding to death.

890
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,261
Shit.

891
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:05,730
We got to get
him to a hospital.

892
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:05,730
I don't give a shit.

893
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:07,132
Let him bleed.

894
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,101
What?

895
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:17,709
We need to get him
to a hospital.

896
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:18,976
Bitch,
shut the fuck up.

897
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:21,446
You think
I don't know that?

898
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,048
You think
I don't know?

899
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:58,149
Your mama said
your name was Jam.

900
00:40:58,182 --> 00:40:59,417
Right?
What's that short for?

901
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,752
Jam?

902
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:04,255
Jamar.

903
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:06,991
Jamar.

904
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:10,295
Jamar.

905
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:19,137
It's, like, peanut butter
and jam, right?

906
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,477
I have...

907
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,946
a little boy.

908
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:30,381
About your age.

909
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,452
They-They took him

910
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:37,054
away from me, though.
That's the--

911
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:39,124
W-who took him
away from you?

912
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,961
The-The-The government.

913
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:45,229
The social workers

914
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:46,498
and police.

915
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:51,269
Are you
going to kill us?

916
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:55,006
No, baby.

917
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,808
No, that's crazy talk.

918
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,212
What do you
know about death, anyway?

919
00:42:01,245 --> 00:42:04,515
I know whoever dies,
they go to heaven.

920
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,356
I don't know about that.

921
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:19,864
What do you
think heaven is like?

922
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:22,500
I don't know.

923
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,536
But it
is supposed to be cool.

924
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,559
Who's that?

925
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:23,361
Shh.

926
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:26,097
Is that the police?

927
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,065
Shh.

928
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,674
Mama, that's the police!

929
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:39,110
Help.

930
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:41,679
Help. Help.

931
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:43,347
Uh-Uh-Uh.

932
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,216
They're just
makin' sandwiches, is all.

933
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:47,985
Can't you just
go and leave us alone?

934
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:49,987
Sit down.

935
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:49,987
Mama.

936
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,656
Help.

937
00:43:51,689 --> 00:43:52,957
Help.

938
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,027
Stop. Just...

939
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:04,602
Shut up!

940
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,604
I said, calm down, please.

941
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:09,440
It's all right.

942
00:44:09,473 --> 00:44:10,942
It'll end soon.

943
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,088
It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

944
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,089
See?

945
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,525
See?

946
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:48,012
Baby.

947
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:04,963
10-97.

948
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:15,533
Mr. Walker,
please do something.
My boy.

949
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:17,301
They have my boy.

950
00:46:17,334 --> 00:46:18,369
Your...

951
00:46:20,637 --> 00:46:22,206
My boy.

952
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,108
Your word.

953
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:28,212
They hurt my boy
downstairs, Mr. Walker.

954
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:31,682
I hear him cryin'.

955
00:46:31,715 --> 00:46:34,452
Mr. Walker,
please do something.

956
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:35,653
Please.

957
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:37,388
Oh, my God, Jamar.

958
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:37,388
Mommy.

959
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,290
Oh, Jamar.

960
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:44,161
Oh, Jamar,
are you hurt, baby?

961
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:45,763
Come here,
let me look at you.

962
00:46:45,796 --> 00:46:47,531
Let me look at you.

963
00:46:47,564 --> 00:46:48,800
Oh, God.

964
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:39,750
Do you all
believe in God?

965
00:47:49,927 --> 00:47:51,529
I know you do.

966
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,566
'Cause you're black.

967
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,603
All y'all love
yourselves some God.

968
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:08,479
I feel like
God is fucking with me.

969
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,184
I feel like he has

970
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:14,886
all these favorites.

971
00:48:17,654 --> 00:48:21,759
And then there's me.
[chuckles]

972
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,394
That's crazy, right?

973
00:48:25,262 --> 00:48:29,466
What-What if God,
when he talks to you,

974
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:33,571
you can't hear
because you don't
understand what he's saying?

975
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:38,342
What do you do then?

976
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:44,248
'Cause see,
I'm confused.

977
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:46,584
I'm fucking confused.

978
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,691
I'm confused as to why

979
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:55,593
your name
is Odessa because that...

980
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:56,961
[chuckling]
is a white girl's name.

981
00:48:56,994 --> 00:48:59,463
That is a fucking
white girl's name.

982
00:48:59,496 --> 00:49:01,298
'Cause I went to school
with an Odessa and that girl

983
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:03,434
was the whitest
girl you ever saw.

984
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,440
You should have
yourself a pretty black name.

985
00:49:09,473 --> 00:49:11,442
Black Moniqua
or Shaniqua or somethin'.

986
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:13,477
Those names
are so pretty.

987
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,915
It's like,
it's like name art.

988
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:19,984
Not like some
stupid name like--

989
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:22,620
Hey, Doreen.

990
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:22,620
...Becky, or take...

991
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:23,888
Doreen.

992
00:49:25,555 --> 00:49:27,358
Those fucking names are shit.

993
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:29,593
Doreen.

994
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:29,593
That gives you a pass...

995
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:31,562
We don't have time
for this, all right?

996
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:31,562
straight into white trash land.

997
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:33,397
Hey!
Go get some air.

998
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,666
Go get some fucking air.

999
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:37,768
What if
he forgets about us?

1000
00:49:43,073 --> 00:49:45,743
What if he forgets about us?

1001
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:47,411
He ain't gonna
forget about us.

1002
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,747
I'm asking you now,
go get some fucking air.

1003
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,350
Shit.

1004
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,686
Goddamn.

1005
00:50:13,737 --> 00:50:16,040
Listen.

1006
00:50:16,073 --> 00:50:17,775
Sir.

1007
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:18,976
What?

1008
00:50:22,346 --> 00:50:23,814
I have to go.

1009
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:24,782
Go where?

1010
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:28,852
To the bathroom.

1011
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,588
Fucking hold it.

1012
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:33,957
I'm an old man.

1013
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,459
Yeah, no shit.

1014
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:40,497
I don't want to soil
on myself in front of...

1015
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,565
you.

1016
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:45,403
Or my family.

1017
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:50,541
That's why I'm asking.

1018
00:50:54,444 --> 00:50:56,480
All right,
make it quick.

1019
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,439
Where's the fucking cash,
anyway?

1020
00:51:55,472 --> 00:51:56,473
What cash?

1021
00:51:56,506 --> 00:51:58,409
What do you
mean, what cash?

1022
00:51:58,442 --> 00:52:00,110
The cash Sobecki gave
to you to get me to Bakersfield.

1023
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:02,079
No, no.

1024
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:03,947
Don't try
to pull that bullshit.

1025
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:03,947
What do you mean, no, no?

1026
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,883
Sobecki did not
give me any kind of cash.

1027
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,152
You have
$200 they give you--

1028
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,152
Jesus fucking Christ.

1029
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:10,020
...when you
get out of jail.

1030
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:10,020
How the fuck do you think--

1031
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:11,488
...we're gonna get there?

1032
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:11,488
I'm not an idiot.

1033
00:52:11,521 --> 00:52:12,890
Okay?
They give you

1034
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:15,592
$200 when you get out.
I know that for sure.

1035
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,461
You think this
is my first fucking rodeo?

1036
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,168
The fuck
are you looking at?

1037
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:22,960
Give me
the fucking money!

1038
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:25,062
Okay, okay, okay.

1039
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:25,062
Give me
the fucking money, now.

1040
00:53:25,095 --> 00:53:26,630
Don't shoot,
I'm giving-I'm giving the money.

1041
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,799
Okay?
I'm giving-- here.
Um...

1042
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:30,701
Fucking idiot.

1043
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:30,701
Please don't hurt,
please don't hurt me, okay.

1044
00:53:30,734 --> 00:53:34,104
Please.

1045
00:53:30,734 --> 00:53:34,104
Please, what?
Shut the fuck up, brown boy.

1046
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:35,772
Speak English,
motherfucker.

1047
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:37,875
What the fuck are you saying?

1048
00:53:37,908 --> 00:53:39,109
Shut the fuck up.

1049
00:53:41,545 --> 00:53:42,813
You want to fucking die?

1050
00:53:45,715 --> 00:53:47,852
You ever danced with
the devil, motherfucker?

1051
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:52,556
'Cause you're dancin' now.

1052
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:01,265
I'm gonna make some coffee.

1053
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:26,957
It's windy.

1054
00:54:32,862 --> 00:54:34,198
Always is.

1055
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,067
You get used to it.

1056
00:54:38,702 --> 00:54:40,203
I never will.

1057
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:41,238
Mm.

1058
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,309
Prison does
something to a man.

1059
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:48,645
Makes him
bitter and...

1060
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:49,947
flexible.

1061
00:54:57,754 --> 00:55:00,324
When I was younger...

1062
00:55:00,357 --> 00:55:03,860
I had the courage
and the will.

1063
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:05,763
I mean, that was
never the problem.

1064
00:55:07,998 --> 00:55:09,199
But prison...

1065
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:12,336
prison gave loyalty

1066
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:14,905
to an idea.

1067
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:16,840
You know, something that
was bigger than me,

1068
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:19,043
stronger than me,
more important.

1069
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:23,013
And I-I felt blessed.

1070
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:24,114
You know?

1071
00:55:27,117 --> 00:55:30,187
For the first
time in my life,

1072
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,289
I was more
than a piece of shit.

1073
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:44,969
I ain't gonna lose that.

1074
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:51,174
Mm.

1075
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:01,752
What time is it?

1076
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:05,823
Quarter to 7:00, there abouts.

1077
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:11,695
Yep.

1078
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:15,966
I was supposed to have a meeting
with my parole officer this morning.

1079
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:17,401
I guess
I'm missing that one.

1080
00:56:18,835 --> 00:56:22,139
Yeah, been there.

1081
00:56:23,707 --> 00:56:25,909
That's...

1082
00:56:25,942 --> 00:56:27,010
Uh...

1083
00:56:27,043 --> 00:56:28,745
strong?

1084
00:56:28,778 --> 00:56:29,713
Black?

1085
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:36,253
Next thing we need
to do is go from house-to-house.

1086
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:41,291
Yeah.
Yeah, they're close.

1087
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:42,726
All right,
keep me posted.

1088
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:47,197
What happened?
They catch him?

1089
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,198
No.

1090
00:56:48,231 --> 00:56:50,200
No.

1091
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:53,136
They're hidin'
in one of those houses.

1092
00:56:53,169 --> 00:56:54,471
That's where I grew up.

1093
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:56,807
Ray, you have
to call your father.

1094
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,475
This is no longer
about the stuff that's between

1095
00:56:58,508 --> 00:56:59,943
the two of you.

1096
00:56:59,976 --> 00:57:01,412
You need
to make sure he's okay.

1097
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:04,682
All right.

1098
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:20,263
That's it.

1099
00:57:20,296 --> 00:57:21,432
That's him.

1100
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,475
Walker here.

1101
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,811
Hey, Pop, it's Raymond.

1102
00:57:34,844 --> 00:57:36,947
Uh.

1103
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,515
The reason
why I'm calling--

1104
00:57:38,548 --> 00:57:40,184
What is it, son?

1105
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:46,790
There's a deputy
that was killed last night.

1106
00:57:46,823 --> 00:57:48,225
Not too far
from where you live.

1107
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:54,464
We heard the commotion.

1108
00:57:54,497 --> 00:57:57,334
What do you mean,
you heard the commotion?

1109
00:57:57,367 --> 00:57:58,502
Um...

1110
00:57:58,535 --> 00:58:00,470
The whirring, helicopters

1111
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:02,272
and... and all that.

1112
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:04,074
Oh. Okay.

1113
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:07,210
Is everybody-everybody
okay in the house?

1114
00:58:07,243 --> 00:58:10,514
Yeah, Ray.

1115
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:13,016
You know, Dad, I'd be
more comfortable if you, uh...

1116
00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:14,217
you know, if I

1117
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,519
stop by,
just check on you.

1118
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:18,221
Ask him to coffee.

1119
00:58:18,254 --> 00:58:21,191
I was wonderin' if, uh...

1120
00:58:21,224 --> 00:58:25,362
me and you can
get a cup of coffee.

1121
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:31,468
You almost blew it.

1122
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:37,908
I did that
a long time ago.

1123
00:58:37,941 --> 00:58:39,409
You wanted me to call him.

1124
00:58:39,442 --> 00:58:40,511
What'd he say?

1125
00:58:46,182 --> 00:58:49,052
Baby, I can't be going
through this all the time.

1126
00:58:49,085 --> 00:58:51,188
Okay?

1127
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:54,991
You know? Every time I get
on the phone with him, it's like...

1128
00:58:55,024 --> 00:58:57,060
I feel like a boy.

1129
00:58:57,093 --> 00:58:59,396
I'm nobody's boy.
I'm my own man.

1130
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:06,469
Ray.

1131
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:06,469
Honey.

1132
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,071
Know what I'm saying.

1133
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:10,841
Please do not ask me
to call this man again.

1134
00:59:12,008 --> 00:59:13,410
That's all I'm saying.

1135
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:18,148
What the fuck
is taking them

1136
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:20,517
so long?

1137
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:24,120
Huh. Friends not showing?

1138
00:59:24,153 --> 00:59:25,355
They will.

1139
00:59:25,388 --> 00:59:26,990
Believe me, they will.

1140
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:32,196
Aryan Brotherhood,
that's right.

1141
00:59:36,432 --> 00:59:38,402
Never sacrifice
one of their own.

1142
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:42,172
You watch
your fuckin' mouth.

1143
00:59:49,112 --> 00:59:50,581
Sit your ass down.

1144
01:00:05,495 --> 01:00:07,964
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doin'?

1145
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:09,933
I'm just gonna
call this number right now.

1146
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:09,933
Who the fuck you callin'?

1147
01:00:09,966 --> 01:00:11,268
Do you really want
to wait any longer?

1148
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:13,336
Worth the stomach...

1149
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:13,336
Stop it.

1150
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:15,572
Shut the fuck--

1151
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:15,572
Do not fucking touch me.
Just let me do this.

1152
01:00:15,605 --> 01:00:18,108
I think we've been here long enough,
and it's fucking killing me.

1153
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:20,010
I can't do this anymore.

1154
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:24,681
Hello?

1155
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:26,349
Hi, hey.

1156
01:00:26,382 --> 01:00:28,251
Hey. Oh, my God,
thank God you answered.

1157
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:30,320
This is Doreen,
Sobecki's girl.

1158
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:30,320
Doreen?

1159
01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:33,123
Yeah. Are you guys
gonna come 'cause we're--

1160
01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:33,123
What?

1161
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:35,091
Who is this?

1162
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:35,091
It's Doreen, Sobecki's girl.

1163
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:37,294
Called you last night,
we talked and you told him...

1164
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:37,294
Who?

1165
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:39,396
You got the wrong number.

1166
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:39,396
What do you
mean, wrong number?

1167
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,431
This is, this is Doreen.
I talked to you.

1168
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:43,533
You told me last night you all were comin'
here and you were gonna--

1169
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:45,535
You got
the wrong number.

1170
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:47,137
Doreen.
This is Doreen.

1171
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:47,137
I'm hanging up now.

1172
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:49,639
And you-- Hel-Hello?

1173
01:00:49,672 --> 01:00:52,509
Hello? Fuck.

1174
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:55,946
Oh my God. Fuck me.

1175
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:55,946
Well?

1176
01:00:55,979 --> 01:00:58,214
Well? What do you
fucking think, well?

1177
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:00,583
He acted like he
didn't even fucking know me.

1178
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:00,583
What do you think he's gonna do?

1179
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:03,219
Jeopardize the whole goddamn
word for a two-bit fucking skank like you?

1180
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:04,354
That's really

1181
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:06,122
fucking nice
to say to me right now.

1182
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:08,124
What does that
make you, huh?

1183
01:01:08,157 --> 01:01:10,093
What did I ever--

1184
01:01:08,157 --> 01:01:10,093
You're still free
to take a car.

1185
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:11,695
Thank you so much.

1186
01:01:11,728 --> 01:01:13,596
Considering there's
cops everywhere.

1187
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,732
That's a great idea.

1188
01:01:15,765 --> 01:01:17,467
There's still
another way.

1189
01:01:19,669 --> 01:01:21,571
Go on.

1190
01:01:21,604 --> 01:01:25,508
They got
roads around here.

1191
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,978
Dozens of roads.

1192
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:31,748
Dirt roads connected
to private roads.

1193
01:01:31,781 --> 01:01:34,351
I know
every last one of them.

1194
01:01:34,384 --> 01:01:37,187
Better than them.

1195
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,190
I don't think that
that's gonna work for us,
Tully.

1196
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,661
I'm not
talking about you.

1197
01:01:44,694 --> 01:01:46,196
That'd be foolish.

1198
01:01:47,296 --> 01:01:49,232
I'm talking about me.

1199
01:01:49,265 --> 01:01:51,534
What, you're gonna
drive us out of here?

1200
01:01:49,265 --> 01:01:51,534
Give me a break.

1201
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,103
No, sir.

1202
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,473
I go alone.

1203
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:57,774
You're crazy.

1204
01:01:57,807 --> 01:01:59,142
I take you,

1205
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:03,246
and we hit
one roadblock,

1206
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:05,716
and they see us
turn around, it's all over.

1207
01:02:07,216 --> 01:02:10,420
But an old black man...

1208
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:15,525
drivin' a rusty automobile,

1209
01:02:15,558 --> 01:02:17,361
they don't pay it much mind.

1210
01:02:21,564 --> 01:02:24,234
Tell me you're not
really believing this bullshit.

1211
01:02:24,267 --> 01:02:26,369
And if you don't return?

1212
01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:28,772
Or you bring
back the law?

1213
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:29,773
Yeah?

1214
01:02:32,408 --> 01:02:34,177
You need
more collateral?

1215
01:02:37,146 --> 01:02:38,548
I ain't got it.

1216
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:41,718
Tully.

1217
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:44,421
Tully, please tell me
you are not buyin' into this.

1218
01:02:49,092 --> 01:02:50,727
Fuck it,
you got a better plan?

1219
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:53,530
Not yet.

1220
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,301
Here's what I'll do.

1221
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:02,172
I'll get gas.

1222
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:03,640
I'll get groceries.

1223
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:05,708
I'll empty out
my bank account.

1224
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:07,744
Not bad.

1225
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:10,480
$6,000 and some change.

1226
01:03:10,513 --> 01:03:11,815
And a map out of here.

1227
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:13,616
Listen to me.

1228
01:03:13,649 --> 01:03:17,854
Do not let this
nigger hustle us right now.

1229
01:03:17,887 --> 01:03:20,256
Baby, we got to think.

1230
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:21,791
We just lost
our only shot.

1231
01:03:21,824 --> 01:03:23,426
We gotta come up
with a better plan.

1232
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:25,161
Do you understand me?
This is not it.

1233
01:03:25,194 --> 01:03:29,199
Him sittin' there
talkin' is not it.

1234
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:30,700
Come on.

1235
01:03:30,733 --> 01:03:32,669
No, not this old man.

1236
01:03:32,702 --> 01:03:34,404
Because if he does...

1237
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,709
I will fuck everyone
in this house and he knows it.

1238
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:41,244
He ain't dumb.

1239
01:03:41,277 --> 01:03:43,379
Something goes wrong,
and you come back

1240
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:45,849
to a heap of bodies,
you understand?

1241
01:03:45,882 --> 01:03:47,217
Understood.

1242
01:03:49,152 --> 01:03:51,588
I'm not leaving, unless--

1243
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:54,224
Unless what?

1244
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:54,224
Anthony comes with me.

1245
01:03:54,257 --> 01:03:55,558
I don't fucking think so.

1246
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,327
Fuck you.
This is a stupid fucking plan.

1247
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,761
Tully, look at me right now.

1248
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,297
He is fucking
niggering you.

1249
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:04,567
You are getting
hustled by a fucking nigger.

1250
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,603
He comes,

1251
01:04:06,636 --> 01:04:08,138
or I don't go.

1252
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:11,808
No, no, no.

1253
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:14,711
There is no struggle here.

1254
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:18,148
Look at this fucking black man
telling you what to do.

1255
01:04:14,744 --> 01:04:18,148
Shut up.

1256
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:20,483
Fuck, Tully!

1257
01:04:20,516 --> 01:04:21,818
All right.

1258
01:04:22,952 --> 01:04:25,822
You're on.

1259
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:43,340
Y-You hang in there, son.

1260
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,479
Hey.

1261
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:50,881
Anthony.

1262
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,686
Hey, you gotta learn.

1263
01:04:58,387 --> 01:04:59,923
You fight
with your mind.

1264
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:03,226
Yes, sir.

1265
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:04,227
Okay?

1266
01:05:05,494 --> 01:05:07,797
Okay, son,
you did good.

1267
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:08,899
All right.

1268
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,569
I'm proud of you.

1269
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:16,706
I am.

1270
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:17,874
Okay.

1271
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:35,992
We got roadblocks
on every major

1272
01:05:36,025 --> 01:05:37,827
road out of here.
Perimeter has been set

1273
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,929
for 20 miles
in every direction.

1274
01:05:39,962 --> 01:05:42,265
There's been no reports
on any stolen cars.

1275
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:44,534
These guys
are still here.

1276
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:45,868
We need to go house-to-house,

1277
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,503
door-to-door and smoke

1278
01:05:47,536 --> 01:05:50,873
these jokers out.
I want these fuckers found.

1279
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,442
Sanchez, with me.

1280
01:05:59,949 --> 01:06:03,820
[Raymond]
After I read the report,
we'll be good.

1281
01:06:03,853 --> 01:06:05,622
We should
get on to my house.

1282
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:10,994
They gotta be
in one of these houses.

1283
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:13,329
I'm fine checking it out.

1284
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:13,329
Hmm.

1285
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:15,765
Why don't I look
around the side?

1286
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:17,467
Okay.

1287
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:17,467
You're okay?

1288
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,501
Yep.

1289
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,615
Cop.

1290
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,615
Send them away.

1291
01:06:38,654 --> 01:06:39,789
Raymond.

1292
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:41,491
It's funny,
I just saw my dad

1293
01:06:41,524 --> 01:06:43,893
driving down the road.
Did he tell you I called?

1294
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:46,562
No, he-he doesn't
tell me much.

1295
01:06:46,595 --> 01:06:47,631
Huh.

1296
01:06:49,365 --> 01:06:51,334
The reason why
I'm here is that

1297
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,036
there's been a murder.

1298
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:55,838
And, um...

1299
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:55,838
What happened?

1300
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,775
A fellow officer
has been killed.

1301
01:07:01,844 --> 01:07:03,813
Well, um...

1302
01:07:03,846 --> 01:07:05,882
It would make me feel
really comfortable,

1303
01:07:05,915 --> 01:07:10,586
if you just allow me to come
and just take a little browse.

1304
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,388
Okay, look, I'm not
gonna get in the middle

1305
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:14,023
of what's going
on between you and your dad.

1306
01:07:14,056 --> 01:07:15,925
You're not gonna
get in the middle of it.

1307
01:07:14,056 --> 01:07:15,925
Raymond.

1308
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,327
No.

1309
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,828
This is not
your house anymore.

1310
01:07:18,861 --> 01:07:20,496
It's not about
it being my house.

1311
01:07:20,529 --> 01:07:21,631
It is not
a good time.

1312
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:22,965
And you know
your dad will not like

1313
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,734
like you in here.

1314
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:28,638
Listen, I don't want
to get into any...
family feuds.

1315
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,073
You and your dad,
what's going on

1316
01:07:30,106 --> 01:07:32,442
between the two of you
has nothin' to do with me.

1317
01:07:56,899 --> 01:07:58,468
Hey.

1318
01:07:56,899 --> 01:07:58,468
Hey.

1319
01:07:58,501 --> 01:08:00,903
Everything all right?
Heard that.

1320
01:08:00,936 --> 01:08:02,539
Just family stuff.

1321
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,023
Not a fucking word.

1322
01:08:29,432 --> 01:08:31,101
Cassie, I don't hate you.

1323
01:08:33,969 --> 01:08:37,107
You know I didn't mean them
things that I said upstairs.

1324
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:57,093
Get on your fucking knees.

1325
01:08:57,126 --> 01:08:59,495
Sir, we can work this out.

1326
01:08:57,126 --> 01:08:59,495
Shut the fuck up.

1327
01:08:59,528 --> 01:09:00,797
Tully!

1328
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:09,038
Shit.

1329
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:11,841
Tully.

1330
01:09:12,942 --> 01:09:13,910
Tully.

1331
01:09:13,943 --> 01:09:15,445
Tully. Tully.

1332
01:09:15,478 --> 01:09:16,712
Tully.

1333
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:18,748
We got a cop
behind us.

1334
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,186
Fucking...
No worries.

1335
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,186
It's a fucking nigger cop.

1336
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:26,088
I hate
fucking cops.

1337
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:26,088
I didn't do anything.

1338
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:28,558
Your fucking
tail lights workin'?

1339
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:28,558
No, everything's fine.

1340
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:29,959
They're good?

1341
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:29,959
I didn't do anything.

1342
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:33,229
What?

1343
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:33,229
Jesus fucking Christ.

1344
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:34,964
Goddamn.

1345
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:34,964
You just let me
do all the talking.

1346
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:36,799
Do not fucking
take that gun out.
My God.

1347
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:38,034
Fuck.

1348
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:39,635
Fuck.

1349
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:39,635
Fucking niggers.

1350
01:09:39,668 --> 01:09:41,103
Do you think he knows
about the gas station?

1351
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:43,239
He's gonna
fuck with us.

1352
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:43,239
No, he's not.

1353
01:09:43,272 --> 01:09:45,842
No, he's not.
I'm just gonna do
all the talking, all right?

1354
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,244
I got this.
Do not fucking say a word.

1355
01:09:48,277 --> 01:09:50,880
I ain't fucking
going back, all right?

1356
01:09:48,277 --> 01:09:50,880
Don't do anything crazy.

1357
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:52,515
I'm pullin' over.
Just play it cool.

1358
01:09:52,548 --> 01:09:53,917
Let me do
the talkin'.

1359
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:16,506
[Tully, muttering]
Don't you fucking stutter.

1360
01:10:16,539 --> 01:10:21,211
Correction, this is 234.

1361
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,852
Good evening, officer.

1362
01:10:31,287 --> 01:10:32,755
License and registration,
please.

1363
01:10:32,788 --> 01:10:34,857
Absolutely. Absolutely.

1364
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,826
Was I drivin'
a little bit too slow?

1365
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:38,227
I was, wasn't I?

1366
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,930
Yeah, I figured.
It's, um...

1367
01:10:40,963 --> 01:10:44,934
My-My doctor
h-has prescribed these, um...

1368
01:10:44,967 --> 01:10:46,836
these special
glasses for me.

1369
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:49,005
Yeah, I have a, um--

1370
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:49,005
License and registration
will work, thank you.

1371
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:50,039
Mm-hmm.

1372
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,276
Okay, this is, um...

1373
01:10:53,309 --> 01:10:54,710
Besides drivin' too slow,

1374
01:10:54,743 --> 01:10:56,212
was I doin'
anything else wrong?

1375
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:58,281
I got these.

1376
01:10:58,314 --> 01:11:00,116
We're in a little
bit of a rush.

1377
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:01,851
I'm tryin' to get
him to his mom.

1378
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:03,052
She's not feelin' so good.

1379
01:11:03,085 --> 01:11:04,320
Drivin' slow
for being in a rush.

1380
01:11:04,353 --> 01:11:05,988
I know,
it's the glasses thing.

1381
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:07,790
They-- I, it's real
hard for me to see.

1382
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:09,825
It's for safety
purposes, you know.

1383
01:11:09,858 --> 01:11:11,761
Can I see
your license, please?

1384
01:11:09,858 --> 01:11:11,761
Oh, right.

1385
01:11:11,794 --> 01:11:13,729
This is,
this is my license.

1386
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:15,865
Terrible picture.
What is it with that, right?

1387
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:17,867
Licenses,
you get the worst photos.

1388
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:18,935
Thank you.

1389
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:18,935
Yup.

1390
01:11:18,968 --> 01:11:20,603
Wait here, please.

1391
01:11:18,968 --> 01:11:20,603
Sure.

1392
01:11:20,636 --> 01:11:22,539
Absolutely.
Thank you.

1393
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,243
That was real fucking smart.

1394
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:30,646
The fuck
were you doin', anyway?

1395
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:31,914
I was manipulating him.

1396
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:33,783
Trying to get him
to like, you know.

1397
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:35,851
You must have been doin'
somethin' for him to turn

1398
01:11:35,884 --> 01:11:38,287
the fucking lights on.

1399
01:11:35,884 --> 01:11:38,287
Did you hear
what you're sayin'?

1400
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,123
I'm fucking slow.

1401
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,123
Fucking clack cops, thinkin'
they got somethin' to prove.

1402
01:11:41,156 --> 01:11:42,659
Okay, just chill.

1403
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:45,928
We're all good?

1404
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:46,963
Your name, sir?

1405
01:11:48,197 --> 01:11:49,732
Tully.

1406
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:51,867
Full name?

1407
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,336
Man, I didn't
do nothin' wrong.

1408
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:55,171
Nobody said you did.

1409
01:11:55,204 --> 01:11:57,073
Then you don't
need my name.

1410
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:00,977
May I see
your identification, please?

1411
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:04,647
I know my rights.

1412
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,350
Tully, he's just,
he's just askin' for your--

1413
01:12:07,383 --> 01:12:10,186
What?
He's just pullin'
rank for no reason.

1414
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:12,288
No, he's not.
He's just--

1415
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:15,324
I need to see your driver's license
or form of identification.

1416
01:12:15,357 --> 01:12:17,727
She gave you
her license, all right?

1417
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,029
Everything's in order.
We weren't speedin' or nothin'.

1418
01:12:20,062 --> 01:12:21,864
Just back off--

1419
01:12:20,062 --> 01:12:21,864
I'm going to ask
you one more time.

1420
01:12:21,897 --> 01:12:23,232
I need to see your I.D.

1421
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:24,266
Please.

1422
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:25,735
I told you.

1423
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:29,338
I didn't
do nothin' wrong.

1424
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,708
He's just in a mood.

1425
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,708
Excuse me.

1426
01:12:33,676 --> 01:12:35,311
You need to step
out of the vehicle.

1427
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,215
No, you stay put.

1428
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,885
Step out
of the vehicle, now.

1429
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:48,057
You hear me
talking to you.

1430
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,792
Please.

1431
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,792
That's how
you want to play it?

1432
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:52,328
Sir, he's--

1433
01:12:52,361 --> 01:12:55,731
This is Deputy Rivers. I'm on--

1434
01:12:52,361 --> 01:12:55,731
Get on your fucking
knees, nigger.

1435
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:57,066
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1436
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:57,066
Get down. Back up.

1437
01:12:57,099 --> 01:12:58,134
Hey, hey, hey!

1438
01:12:57,099 --> 01:12:58,134
Get down!

1439
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:59,902
Hey.

1440
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:59,902
Get down. Get down.

1441
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:01,804
Put the gun--

1442
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:01,804
Get on your
fucking knees, now.

1443
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:03,272
Put the gun down.

1444
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:03,272
Fuck you.
Get on your knees.

1445
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:04,940
On your fucking knees.

1446
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:06,242
Okay, wait, we can
work this out.

1447
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:06,242
Get down!

1448
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,344
We can work this--

1449
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,344
Shut the fuck up.

1450
01:13:08,377 --> 01:13:10,713
Fucking cops,
you're all the same.

1451
01:13:08,377 --> 01:13:10,713
Hey, you don't need to do this.

1452
01:13:10,746 --> 01:13:13,082
You say you want to help us,
and then you stab us
in the fucking back.

1453
01:13:13,115 --> 01:13:16,185
I seen it every day.
It makes me fucking sick

1454
01:13:13,115 --> 01:13:16,185
Put the gun down.

1455
01:13:16,218 --> 01:13:17,687
We can work this out.

1456
01:13:16,218 --> 01:13:17,687
Shut the fuck up.

1457
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,688
Shut the fuck up.

1458
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:19,789
Tully, look at me.

1459
01:13:19,822 --> 01:13:21,891
Tully!

1460
01:13:19,822 --> 01:13:21,891
What?

1461
01:13:21,924 --> 01:13:23,326
Shit!

1462
01:13:25,127 --> 01:13:26,962
Tully.

1463
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,731
Fuck!

1464
01:13:28,764 --> 01:13:30,900
Stupid motherfucker!

1465
01:13:30,933 --> 01:13:33,002
Look what
you made me do.

1466
01:13:33,035 --> 01:13:35,137
Look at what
you fucking made me do.

1467
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,073
You dumb fucking nigger.

1468
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,309
What? Huh?

1469
01:13:40,342 --> 01:13:42,411
What?
Do something.

1470
01:13:42,444 --> 01:13:43,779
Tully!

1471
01:13:43,812 --> 01:13:46,449
What the fuck
are we gonna do for now?

1472
01:13:46,482 --> 01:13:47,850
Shit.

1473
01:13:51,153 --> 01:13:52,488
Huh, what?

1474
01:13:52,521 --> 01:13:54,190
Do somethin'.

1475
01:14:20,349 --> 01:14:22,918
This is real?

1476
01:14:20,349 --> 01:14:22,918
Fucking go.

1477
01:14:22,951 --> 01:14:25,921
Fuck, Tully. Tully,
what the fuck did you do?

1478
01:14:22,951 --> 01:14:25,921
Let's go.

1479
01:14:25,954 --> 01:14:28,324
What the fuck
did you just do?

1480
01:14:25,954 --> 01:14:28,324
Just fucking go.

1481
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:29,925
What did you do?

1482
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:29,925
Just fucking drive.

1483
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,927
What did you do?
What did you do?

1484
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,430
What the fuck?
Did you fucking kill him?

1485
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,430
Let's just go.

1486
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:36,799
Let's go.
Just fucking drive.

1487
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:36,799
Did you fucking kill him?

1488
01:14:36,832 --> 01:14:39,268
A fucking cop? Shit.

1489
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:40,503

01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:44,440
Don't say a fucking word.

1492
01:14:44,473 --> 01:14:48,477
Did you kill a fucking cop?
Did you just kill a fucking cop?

1493
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:50,379

01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:15,505
They can't be next.

01:15:16,872 --> 01:15:18,508
There will be no next.

1501
01:15:20,943 --> 01:15:22,311
What are we gonna do?

1502

Stay there.

1508
01:15:35,524 --> 01:15:36,592
Shut the fuck up.

01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:37,960
Come on, pick it up.

1510
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:43,532
Hello?

1511
01:15:43,565 --> 01:15:45,935
Ma'am, this is the hospital.

1512
01:15:45,968 --> 01:15:47,870
This is Odessa.

1513
01:15:50,038 --> 01:15:53,109
An-Ant--
The hospital, yeah.

Anthony, yeah.

1516
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,885
Anthony.

1517
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,888
Okay.

1518
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:10,593
[sighs]

1519
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,006
What the fuck? Where do
you think you're goin'?

1520
01:16:27,943 --> 01:16:29,512
What the fuck
is goin' on?

1521
01:16:31,914 --> 01:16:33,482
He's dying.

1522
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,886
I don't give a shit.

1523
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:41,056
I don't know
who you are,

1524
01:16:41,089 --> 01:16:43,058
and I don't know
why you came here.

1525
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:44,193
And I don't give a shit

1526
01:16:44,226 --> 01:16:46,262
whether anybody
ever cared for you

1527
01:16:46,295 --> 01:16:48,431
or whether if you
cared for anybody.

1528
01:16:53,335 --> 01:16:55,872
You ever loved
somebody, Mr. Tully?

1529
01:17:00,642 --> 01:17:03,479
I love my daughter.

1530
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:05,547
And I love my son.

1531
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,417
But you shot him.

1532
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:11,420
And as long
as I'm breathing,

1533
01:17:11,453 --> 01:17:14,023
my boy, he's not
gonna die alone.

1534
01:17:15,223 --> 01:17:17,026
Ain't gonna call no police.

1535
01:17:17,059 --> 01:17:18,561
That's not gonna happen.

1536
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:26,669
If you're
gonna kill me...

1537
01:17:28,303 --> 01:17:30,239
you could shoot me now.

1538
01:17:35,344 --> 01:17:36,979
'Cause I'm leavin'.

1539
01:18:28,463 --> 01:18:29,966
Stop the car, sir.

1540
01:18:40,242 --> 01:18:43,479
Got a lockdown on the area.
No one can go in.

1541
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:45,681
Hey, you must
know my boy.

1542
01:18:45,714 --> 01:18:47,549
Raymond Walker.

1543
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:50,252
Deputy Raymond Walker.

1544
01:18:50,285 --> 01:18:52,721
The officer, when I left,

1545
01:18:52,754 --> 01:18:54,423
said I could return.

1546
01:18:54,456 --> 01:18:56,292
M-My wife's alone.

1547
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:04,033
Being as you're a father
of an officer,

1548
01:19:04,066 --> 01:19:06,402

Much obliged.

1553
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,142
Okay, let's move that out.

1554
01:19:29,324 --> 01:19:30,692
Odessa.

1555
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,127
Raymond.

1556
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,127
Odessa, come--

1557
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,395

1558
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,395
Odessa, you're okay?

1559
01:19:33,428 --> 01:19:35,130
Raymond, Anthony.

1560
01:19:33,428 --> 01:19:35,130

1561
01:19:35,163 --> 01:19:36,698
Anthony's bleedin',

1562
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,167
What do you mean?

1563
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,167
He's been shot.

1564
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,302
Mr. Walker tried
to take him to the hospital.

1565
01:19:40,335 --> 01:19:41,603
He's been shot?

1566
01:19:40,335 --> 01:19:41,603
We gotta,
we gotta get there.

1567
01:19:41,636 --> 01:19:42,738
Yeah, okay.
Wait, wait.

1568
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:45,140
W-Who shot him?

1569
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:45,140
The-The people.

1570
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:48,744
They're White. They came into
the house in the middle of the night.

1571
01:19:48,777 --> 01:19:51,447
They're in the-- Are you saying
they're in the house?

1572
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,782
We've been there
all night, Raymond.

1573
01:19:53,815 --> 01:19:55,517
Hey, guys, listen--
listen up!

1574
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,219
She said
they are in the house!

1575
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:59,221
1010 Mountain Way.

1576
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,522
They're in the house.

1577
01:20:00,555 --> 01:20:02,391
Don't let them hurt
Cassie and the babies.

1578
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:03,492
They're
in the house, too.

1579
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:03,492
Okay.

1580
01:20:03,525 --> 01:20:04,793
Please.

1581
01:20:03,525 --> 01:20:04,793
Odessa, I-I won't.

1582
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:05,794
Okay?

1583
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:05,794
Okay.

1584
01:20:05,827 --> 01:20:07,096
Okay, okay?

1585
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:08,464
Okay.

1586
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:08,464
Oh.

1587
01:20:08,497 --> 01:20:09,698
Okay, okay.

1588
01:20:09,731 --> 01:20:11,333
Okay.
Guys, come on-- Take her!

1589
01:20:11,366 --> 01:20:12,601
Guys, take her!

1590
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:14,236
Come with me.

1591
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:14,236
Bring her to the hospital.

1592
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:15,704
Make sure she's okay.

1593
01:20:15,737 --> 01:20:17,373
Got it?

1594
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:23,378
Anything?

1595
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:24,480
Nothing.

1596
01:20:24,513 --> 01:20:26,849
I called Marcus
and I called Paul.

1597
01:20:26,882 --> 01:20:29,551
Nobody's picking up. It's just ringing
and ringing and fucking ringing.

1598
01:20:29,584 --> 01:20:32,187
These fucking assholes,
I swear to God.

1599
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:00,549
I fucking told you,

1600
01:21:00,582 --> 01:21:02,618
you should not have let him
out of this fucking house.

1601
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:04,553
Fuck.
He brought the cops.

1602
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:10,559
We're stuck. We're fucking
surrounded by cops right now.

1603
01:21:10,592 --> 01:21:12,895
Maybe if you had some fucking money,
we wouldn't be in this position.

1604
01:21:12,928 --> 01:21:14,396
There was no money.

1605
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:16,198
There was
no fucking money.

1606
01:21:16,231 --> 01:21:17,466
They told me
to pick you up

1607
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:19,234
and drop you off.
That was it.

1608
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:20,235
There was no money.

1609
01:21:20,268 --> 01:21:21,336
Fuck, fuck!

1610
01:21:21,369 --> 01:21:22,905
Pop.

1611
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:24,239
Pop, stop.

1612
01:21:24,272 --> 01:21:25,674
All that
bullshit about word.

1613
01:21:25,707 --> 01:21:27,843
Fucking word, word.

1614
01:21:25,707 --> 01:21:27,843
Fuck you, bitch.

1615
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:29,511
You just got
fucked by a nigger.

1616
01:21:29,544 --> 01:21:30,846
How's that feel? Huh?

1617
01:21:30,879 --> 01:21:32,614
You let a nigger
fuck you with his will.

1618
01:21:32,647 --> 01:21:34,449
Does that
get it up for you, now?

1619
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:35,817
Fucking piece of shit.

1620
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,653
Do you want to see
your fucking boy again?

1621
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:40,522
You want to help me.

1622
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:43,258
Fuck you.

1623
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:44,526
You don't know nothin'

1624
01:21:44,559 --> 01:21:46,728
about my little boy, or me.

1625
01:21:46,761 --> 01:21:47,796
Do you hear that?

1626
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:49,464
You can go
fuck yourself.

1627
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:52,568
Where the fuck
are you going? Doreen?

1628
01:21:52,601 --> 01:21:54,436
Let me take care
of Cassie and the babies.

1629
01:21:54,469 --> 01:21:57,806
Okay?

1630
01:21:57,839 --> 01:21:59,675
This is my house.

1631
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:00,876
Pop, I know that.

1632
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:02,844
But let me
do my job, okay?

1633
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:05,981
Doreen, get your ass back here.

1634
01:22:06,014 --> 01:22:07,216
Fuck.

1635
01:22:09,551 --> 01:22:10,619
Doreen!

1636
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,723
Pop, don't turn
your back on me.

1637
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:16,491
You can't hang up
on me right now.

1638
01:22:16,524 --> 01:22:18,327
You can't hang up on me.

1639
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,395
Just leave me
to my chores.

1640
01:22:20,428 --> 01:22:22,231
Dad, your chores is finished.

1641

01:22:29,938 --> 01:22:32,441
They ain't never finished.

1643
01:22:32,474 --> 01:22:33,709
Pop.

1644
01:22:36,444 --> 01:22:38,280

1645
01:22:38,313 --> 01:22:39,982
Get the fuck up.

1647
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:43,752
Please don't hurt us.

1648
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:51,727
You gotta get
out of here, Doreen.

1649
01:22:56,331 --> 01:22:58,033
You gotta make
one right choice.

1650
01:22:58,066 --> 01:22:59,635
Don't you

1651
01:22:59,668 --> 01:23:01,036
Keep your fucking head down.

01:23:01,069 --> 01:23:02,804
Please don't hurt--

1653

Get the fuck back there.

1654
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:04,506
Please don't--

1655
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:04,506
Fucking stay there.

1656
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:14,783
Doreen,
I need your help.

1657
01:23:17,085 --> 01:23:18,187
Doreen!

1658
01:23:22,057 --> 01:23:23,859
Hey.
Hey, Cassie.

1659
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:26,428
Hey--

1660
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:26,428
You fucked me now, old man.

1661
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:27,796
I didn't
bring them here!

1662
01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:31,800
You fucking lied to me!

1663
01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:31,800
I-I gave you my word.

1664
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,502
One unit in the back.

1665
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,502
Boss.

1666
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:34,536
Secure the corner.

1667
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:36,838
What do we got?

1668
01:23:36,871 --> 01:23:38,607
My father just went
on in the inside.

1669
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,941
Negotiator's 20 minutes out.

1670
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:41,543
We'll wait for him.

1671
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:41,543
Sir.

1672
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:42,844
No.

1673
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:42,844
Come on.
We'll wait for him.

1674
01:23:42,877 --> 01:23:44,813
Nobody's negotiating
with my family.

1675
01:23:44,846 --> 01:23:46,081
You're gonna
make the call?

1676
01:23:44,846 --> 01:23:46,081
Yes, sir.

1677
01:23:46,114 --> 01:23:48,584
You're not being--

1678
01:23:46,114 --> 01:23:48,584
Forget protocol.

1679
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:56,892
One flinch inside,
I'm calling SWAT.

1680
01:23:56,925 --> 01:23:58,661
Go ahead
and make the call.

1681
01:24:09,804 --> 01:24:11,106
I'm listening.

1682
01:24:11,139 --> 01:24:14,443
This is,
this is Mr. Tully, right?

1683
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:17,646
Listen,
listen man, l-listen.

1684
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:18,847
I can do something
for you right now.

1685
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,382
Oh, yeah, like what?

1686
01:24:20,415 --> 01:24:21,883
You walk out
of that front door,

1687
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,853
nobody gets hurt.
I can offer you
dignity and respect.

1688
01:24:24,886 --> 01:24:26,788
You got my word on that.

1689
01:24:26,821 --> 01:24:29,591
You fucking lie like
all the rest of them cops.

1690
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:30,759
Cop's word.

1691
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:31,927
No, no, no.

1692
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:42,438
Shit.

1693
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,142
I got this.

1694
01:24:53,114 --> 01:24:54,350
Shit.

1695
01:24:55,784 --> 01:24:57,119
You ask me
what I want?

1696
01:24:57,152 --> 01:24:59,154
Yes, I-I asked you
what you-- yes.

1697
01:24:59,187 --> 01:25:00,756
A phone call.

1698
01:25:00,789 --> 01:25:02,658
And if I can arrange it,
to whom?

1699
01:25:03,858 --> 01:25:07,062
Sobecki.
Paul Sobecki.

1700
01:25:07,095 --> 01:25:11,466
Paul Sobecki. Yeah, y-you got
a number for that?

1701
01:25:11,499 --> 01:25:14,603
How the fuck should I know, man?
Pelican Bay Maximum Security.

1702
01:25:14,636 --> 01:25:17,906
Yeah, l-listen I need
something in return from you.

1703
01:25:17,939 --> 01:25:19,007
Yeah, like what?

1704
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,442
Jamar and the baby.

1705
01:25:20,475 --> 01:25:22,411
Yeah, right,
get fucked.

1706
01:25:22,444 --> 01:25:24,079
Man, listen,
they're not a threat to you.

1707
01:25:24,112 --> 01:25:25,947
They're keeping me safe.

1708
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,483
Then no phone call.

1709
01:25:28,516 --> 01:25:29,852
Fuck.

1710
01:25:34,856 --> 01:25:37,192
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

1711
01:25:37,225 --> 01:25:40,962
I'll give you the boy but you get me my
fucking phone call, you understand?

1712
01:25:40,995 --> 01:25:44,733
You give me my fucking phone
call or I'll kill everyone in this fucking house.

1713
01:25:53,808 --> 01:25:55,210
Get your fuckin'
ass in here.

1714
01:25:55,243 --> 01:25:56,211
Get the boy.

1715
01:25:56,244 --> 01:25:58,447
Get the fucking boy, now!

1716
01:26:00,748 --> 01:26:02,851
Don't you
fuck with me, old man.

1717
01:26:06,087 --> 01:26:07,122
Hey.

1718
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:10,725
W-Where's Odessa?

1719
01:26:10,758 --> 01:26:12,194
She's gone.

1720
01:26:12,227 --> 01:26:14,696
I think she went
to get help.

1721
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:16,832
Come on. Come on.

1722
01:26:16,865 --> 01:26:18,133
Come on.

1723
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:20,469
You okay?

1724
01:26:20,502 --> 01:26:21,903
Don't let him hurt my son.

1725
01:26:20,502 --> 01:26:21,903
Let's fucking move.

1726
01:26:21,936 --> 01:26:23,972
All right.

1727
01:26:21,936 --> 01:26:23,972
Mr. Walker, please help us.

1728
01:26:24,005 --> 01:26:25,540
Yeah.

1729
01:26:25,573 --> 01:26:27,809
Jamar, please listen
to Mr. Walker.

1730
01:26:27,842 --> 01:26:28,977
What the fuck you doin'?
Come on.

1731
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:30,645
Please.

1732
01:26:30,678 --> 01:26:32,614
All right.

1733
01:26:30,678 --> 01:26:32,614
Let's go, come on.

1734
01:26:32,647 --> 01:26:33,615
Please.

1735
01:26:32,647 --> 01:26:33,615
Let's move.

1736
01:26:33,648 --> 01:26:34,950
What the fuck?

1737
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,852
All right.

1738
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,852
Oh, Danny.

1739
01:26:36,885 --> 01:26:38,220
I swear to God,

1740
01:26:38,253 --> 01:26:40,555
I did my best.

1741
01:26:43,758 --> 01:26:44,827
Okay.

1742
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,263
I want you to walk
down that driveway.

1743
01:26:48,296 --> 01:26:50,198
Okay?
All right.

1744
01:26:50,231 --> 01:26:51,533
Hey.

1745
01:26:53,768 --> 01:26:55,704
Never look back.

1746
01:26:55,737 --> 01:26:56,738
Yes, sir.

1747
01:26:56,771 --> 01:26:57,973
All right.

1748
01:27:00,141 --> 01:27:02,577
Mr. Walker?

1749
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,812
What?

1750
01:27:03,845 --> 01:27:05,581
You mad at me?

1751
01:27:09,183 --> 01:27:10,785
Why you say that?

1752
01:27:10,818 --> 01:27:12,621
'Cause you're always mad.

1753
01:27:12,654 --> 01:27:14,923
You never smile.

1754
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:20,529
Oh, no.
I'm not mad at you.

1755
01:27:20,562 --> 01:27:22,264
Now, you go.

1756
01:27:22,297 --> 01:27:23,865
Be strong.

1757
01:27:23,898 --> 01:27:25,567
And kind.

1758
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,768
Hey.

1759
01:27:26,801 --> 01:27:28,970
Strong, kind man.

1760
01:27:29,003 --> 01:27:30,739
Yes, sir.

1761
01:27:30,772 --> 01:27:32,874
Yeah.

1762
01:27:32,907 --> 01:27:34,042
And Jamar?

1763
01:27:34,075 --> 01:27:35,944
Yes?

1764
01:27:35,977 --> 01:27:37,612
Don't forget me.

1765
01:27:37,645 --> 01:27:39,180
Yes, sir.

1766
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:41,049
You remember me real good.

1767
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:43,318
Yes, sir.

1768
01:27:43,351 --> 01:27:44,786
All right.

1769
01:28:00,001 --> 01:28:02,070
3-2-0-1-4.

1770
01:28:10,812 --> 01:28:12,180
He kept his word.

1771
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:17,319
I'm gonna see
if I can get somebody.

1772
01:28:17,352 --> 01:28:19,888
[phone ringing]

1773
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:23,358
I gave you the boy.

1774
01:28:23,391 --> 01:28:24,859
Calm down, okay.

1775
01:28:23,391 --> 01:28:24,859
So where's
the fucking call?

1776
01:28:24,892 --> 01:28:26,928
Tully,
calm down, okay?

1777
01:28:26,961 --> 01:28:29,631
Listen, listen. Let's-Let's-Let's
make another deal.

1778
01:28:29,664 --> 01:28:31,633
Fuck you,
I already made one deal.

1779
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:32,767
Give me Cassie

1780
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,169
and the baby.

1781
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,169
Fuck you.

1782
01:28:34,202 --> 01:28:35,704
I'm not giving you shit.

1783
01:28:35,737 --> 01:28:37,005
Calm down, okay?

1784
01:28:35,737 --> 01:28:37,005
Where's Sobecki?

1785
01:28:37,038 --> 01:28:38,773
Fuck you,
I'm not calming down.

1786
01:28:38,806 --> 01:28:40,675
Where's Sobecki?

1787
01:28:38,806 --> 01:28:40,675
Give-Give me
five minutes.

1788
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,711
I'll get you your call.

1789
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,711
Five minutes.

1790
01:28:42,744 --> 01:28:44,980
If you don't get me
that fucking phone call,

1791
01:28:45,013 --> 01:28:47,282
I'm killing the old man,
you understand me.

1792
01:28:45,013 --> 01:28:47,282
You don't have to kill anyone.

1793
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:49,818
I'm killing the old man.

1794
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:49,818
You don't want, you don't want
to kill nobody.

1795
01:28:49,851 --> 01:28:52,153
Fuck you, cop.
How the fuck do you know what I want?

1796
01:28:52,186 --> 01:28:54,323
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

1797
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,029
Move, move.

1798
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:03,098
Go get your ass over there.

1799
01:29:04,899 --> 01:29:06,267
Back, back,
back, back, back.

1800
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,303
In here.
Get your fucking ass in here.

1801
01:29:08,336 --> 01:29:09,871
You fucking lied to me.

1802
01:29:09,904 --> 01:29:11,072
Doreen!

1803
01:29:11,105 --> 01:29:13,174
Doreen, get your ass
out in here.

1804
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:17,912
I'm sorry.
I just don't know.

1805
01:29:17,945 --> 01:29:21,617
Nobody really
taught me how to do this.

1806
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:29,057
Doreen!

1807
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:30,258
Don't fucking move.

1808
01:29:32,193 --> 01:29:34,062
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck, Doreen?

1809
01:29:34,095 --> 01:29:35,664
What?

1810
01:29:38,066 --> 01:29:39,734
What?

1811
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:41,236
Whose is that
fucking money?

1812
01:29:42,804 --> 01:29:44,873
What-What money?

1813
01:29:44,906 --> 01:29:47,275
Who's goddamn
money is that?

1814
01:29:47,308 --> 01:29:50,078
This my money.

1815
01:29:50,111 --> 01:29:53,982
It's my money. This is the money
for the lawyer for my baby.

1816
01:29:54,015 --> 01:29:55,984
You cannot
have this money.

1817
01:29:57,452 --> 01:30:00,255
It's my money.

1818
01:30:06,494 --> 01:30:08,664
You dumb fucking bitch.

1819
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:17,272
It's my money.

1820
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:21,943
It's my money.

1821
01:30:25,246 --> 01:30:27,015
Hello?

1822
01:30:27,048 --> 01:30:29,918
Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hel--

1823
01:30:32,353 --> 01:30:34,989
You tryin'
Jew me, Goldberg?

1824
01:30:35,022 --> 01:30:36,825
Hey, Tully, Tully.

1825
01:30:36,858 --> 01:30:37,993
Tully, you there?

1826
01:30:39,127 --> 01:30:40,328
Where's Sobecki?

1827
01:30:41,496 --> 01:30:43,131
Hey, we're connecting the call.

1828
01:30:43,164 --> 01:30:44,365
Jesus fucking Christ.

1829
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:46,702
Find him.
I ain't got all goddamn day.

1830
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,243
What the fuck
are you doin'?

1831
01:31:32,213 --> 01:31:34,983
Doreen, they will
fucking kill you, you understand?

1832
01:31:36,184 --> 01:31:37,919
They will
fucking shoot you.

1833
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:39,821
Shit.

1834
01:31:39,854 --> 01:31:42,491
Doreen, get down.
What the fuck are you doin'?

1835
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:01,510
Doreen, where
the fuck are you goin'?

1836
01:32:04,612 --> 01:32:07,916
What are you
going to tell Sobecki?

1837
01:32:07,949 --> 01:32:09,417
That you killed me?

1838
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,920
That you let a bunch
of niggers leave?

1839
01:32:11,953 --> 01:32:13,021
What about the AB?

1840
01:32:13,054 --> 01:32:14,790
The Cause?

1841
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:17,826
It's a joke.

1842
01:32:21,162 --> 01:32:22,297
I need you.

1843
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,932
It's a joke.

1844
01:32:23,965 --> 01:32:26,134
Don't you fucking
walk out on me, Doreen.

1845
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:28,870
You will fucking
die out there.

1846
01:32:28,903 --> 01:32:31,072
Help me. Help me.

1847
01:32:33,374 --> 01:32:36,311
Doreen, don't you
fucking do this.

1848
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:38,013
I have to.

1849
01:32:47,188 --> 01:32:48,923
Please don't shoot.

1850
01:32:48,956 --> 01:32:51,259
Please don't shoot,
I'm a hostage.

1851
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:54,062
What the fuck? Doreen!

1852
01:32:54,095 --> 01:32:55,997
I'm a hostage.

1853
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,932
I'm comin' out.

1854
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,932
Doreen!

1855
01:32:57,965 --> 01:32:59,267
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1856
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,402
Come down the stairs, slowly.

1857
01:33:01,435 --> 01:33:03,571
Please don't shoot, okay?
I'm a hostage.

1858
01:33:01,435 --> 01:33:03,571
Get down on your knees.

1859
01:33:03,604 --> 01:33:05,073
Please don't shoot me.

1860
01:33:03,604 --> 01:33:05,073
Get down!

1861
01:33:05,106 --> 01:33:07,175
Please don't shoot me.

1862
01:33:05,106 --> 01:33:07,175
On your knees.

1863
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,077
Don't shoot me.
I didn't do anything.

1864
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,077
Get on your knees, now.

1865
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,379
I'm a hostage.
I'm a hostage.

1866
01:33:17,919 --> 01:33:19,187
Come on, y'all.
Patch him in.

1867
01:33:22,189 --> 01:33:24,426
Is that the phone
that stinks or your hand?

1868
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:27,929
Hello? Tully.

1869
01:33:29,063 --> 01:33:30,465
Sir.

1870
01:33:30,498 --> 01:33:32,066
It's you, isn't it?

1871
01:33:32,099 --> 01:33:33,568
Yes, Paul, it's me.

1872
01:33:35,202 --> 01:33:37,305
It's a big
mistake, calling.

1873
01:33:37,338 --> 01:33:39,274
Doreen?

1874
01:33:39,307 --> 01:33:41,409
She fucking
walked out, man.

1875
01:33:41,442 --> 01:33:42,644
Straight
into their arms.

1876
01:33:42,677 --> 01:33:44,379
She's a fucking traitor.

1877
01:33:44,412 --> 01:33:46,547
She's probably
a nigger-fucker, too.

1878
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,649
Paul.

1879
01:33:47,682 --> 01:33:50,218
I did not
kill that cop.

1880
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:52,186
That motherfucker
tried to get me.

1881
01:33:52,219 --> 01:33:54,155
You know what
they're like.

1882
01:33:54,188 --> 01:33:56,457
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

1883
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:59,027
I don't know,
I don't know, just--

1884
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,362
Tell the screws
to let you go.

1885
01:34:03,531 --> 01:34:06,000
Fuck, man.
Just give me the word

1886
01:34:06,033 --> 01:34:07,568
and I will kill
every fucker in this house.

1887
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,671
That's all I ask,
just give me the word.

1888
01:34:09,704 --> 01:34:12,674
My word, with half
the FBI listening?

1889
01:34:12,707 --> 01:34:16,110
I got fucking
hostages here, Paul.

1890
01:34:16,143 --> 01:34:18,513
I've been out of jail
for 24 fucking hours,

1891
01:34:18,546 --> 01:34:19,614
I am not going back.

1892
01:34:19,647 --> 01:34:21,249
You ain't got dick!

1893
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:25,386
You ain't got dick.

1894
01:34:25,419 --> 01:34:27,088
You got a house
full of porch monkeys,

1895
01:34:27,121 --> 01:34:29,224
I got hemorrhoids,
and neither is doing us
any good.

1896
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:32,560
You listen.

1897
01:34:32,593 --> 01:34:35,296
Last time I talked, you were supposed
to take care of Bakersfield.

1898
01:34:35,329 --> 01:34:36,698
You did not do that.

1899
01:34:36,731 --> 01:34:39,434
Now...

1900
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:41,169
I got the Sureños
coming after me.

1901
01:34:41,202 --> 01:34:42,537
You think I want
to mess with those spics?

1902
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:44,038
I fucked up.

1903
01:34:44,071 --> 01:34:46,374
I don't know what to do.
Just help-help me.

1904
01:34:46,407 --> 01:34:48,209
No. No, no, no.

1905
01:34:50,745 --> 01:34:52,113
Here's my help.

1906
01:34:54,181 --> 01:34:55,717
You gotta go
south on this.

1907
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:57,452
I ain't surrenderin', Paul.

1908
01:34:57,485 --> 01:35:00,121
I ain't fuckin'
goin' back to jail.

1909
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:02,690
You are going
to do as they say.

1910
01:35:02,723 --> 01:35:04,525
I ain't
fuckin' surrenderin'.

1911
01:35:04,558 --> 01:35:06,227
I ain't surrenderin'.

1912
01:35:04,558 --> 01:35:06,227
Don't. Shh, hey.

1913
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:09,230
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

1914
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:09,230
I ain't surrenderin'.

1915
01:35:09,263 --> 01:35:11,466
Hey.

1916
01:35:11,499 --> 01:35:12,734
What's the white man do,
Tully?

1917
01:35:12,767 --> 01:35:15,503
What's a white man do,
Tully?

1918
01:35:15,536 --> 01:35:17,605
He brings
the bolts down.

1919
01:35:17,638 --> 01:35:19,507
Now, right now
the bolts for you

1920
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:22,176
are walking out of that house
with both hands over your head.

1921
01:35:22,209 --> 01:35:25,279
If I come back to jail, Paul,
what's gonna happen to me?

1922
01:35:25,312 --> 01:35:26,748
Am I gonna be safe?

1923
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:28,549
Let me hear you guarantee it.

1924
01:35:28,582 --> 01:35:31,052
I did 15 fucking
years for you, Paul.

1925
01:35:28,582 --> 01:35:31,052
Tully. Listen to me.

1926
01:35:31,085 --> 01:35:33,388
Fifteen fucking years.
Tell me I'll be safe.

1927
01:35:33,421 --> 01:35:36,157
Do you hear what
I'm sayin' to you, Paul?

1928
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:38,793
This ain't
no fuckin' Armageddon.

1929
01:35:38,826 --> 01:35:40,561
It's a business.

1930
01:35:40,594 --> 01:35:42,063
And you're out of it.

1931
01:35:42,096 --> 01:35:44,799
I need your fucking
help right now.

1932
01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:47,235
Don't leave me here, Paul.

1933
01:35:47,268 --> 01:35:49,404
All right,
they're-they're callin' me.
Tully, I gotta go.

1934
01:35:49,437 --> 01:35:51,072
Wait, Paul.

1935
01:35:51,105 --> 01:35:52,306
Paul, don't.

1936
01:35:52,339 --> 01:35:53,708
See you soon.

1937
01:35:52,339 --> 01:35:53,708
Paul.

1938
01:35:53,741 --> 01:35:56,344
Fuck. Paul.

1939
01:35:56,377 --> 01:35:59,681
Paul, I did
15 fucking years for you!

1940
01:35:56,377 --> 01:35:59,681
It's done, hang the fuck up.

1941
01:36:03,084 --> 01:36:04,786
To dawn, motherfucker.

1942
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:11,359
Fuck you.
Don't you fucking
leave me, motherfucker.

1943
01:36:11,392 --> 01:36:13,194
Fuck!

1944
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:14,796
You're a fucking dead man!

1945
01:36:14,829 --> 01:36:16,464
You're fucking dead.

1946
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,436
I'm not gonna beg

1947
01:36:21,469 --> 01:36:22,704
for my life.

1948
01:36:28,642 --> 01:36:30,779
I'm not gonna beg
for my life.

1949
01:36:37,718 --> 01:36:39,720
What is it, Tully?

1950
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:41,155
Huh?

1951
01:36:41,188 --> 01:36:42,557
My skin?

1952
01:36:44,825 --> 01:36:46,428
If it's my skin...

1953
01:36:47,862 --> 01:36:50,231
killin' us
won't save you.

1954
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:51,433
Hmm?

1955
01:36:52,867 --> 01:36:54,436
But what if it is...

1956
01:36:55,569 --> 01:36:57,539
something inside of you?

1957
01:36:58,906 --> 01:37:01,742
Something pained
deep inside of you

1958
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:03,111
that you're fighting.

1959
01:37:04,612 --> 01:37:06,347
Well, if it is,

1960
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:09,350
maybe we're fighting
the same fight.

1961
01:37:09,383 --> 01:37:11,385
We're in the same boat.

1962
01:37:11,418 --> 01:37:14,522
I lost everything
and I ain't goin' back.

1963
01:37:14,555 --> 01:37:17,659
You haven't
lost everything.

1964
01:37:19,493 --> 01:37:20,595
How?

1965
01:37:21,896 --> 01:37:24,199
You haven't
lost everything.

1966
01:37:27,568 --> 01:37:29,737
You feel afraid?

1967
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:31,305
Yeah.

1968
01:37:31,338 --> 01:37:32,674
You're afraid.

1969
01:37:34,275 --> 01:37:35,877
You're afraid
of the choice

1970
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:37,445
that you have.

1971
01:37:40,681 --> 01:37:43,551
And right now,
the choice you have

1972
01:37:43,584 --> 01:37:45,620
is to put
that gun down.

1973
01:37:47,188 --> 01:37:48,689
Right now.

1974
01:37:48,722 --> 01:37:50,658
And we walk out of here.

1975
01:37:52,893 --> 01:37:54,762
That's the choice you have.

1976
01:37:54,795 --> 01:37:56,230
This is my fucking choice.

1977
01:37:56,263 --> 01:37:57,899
And this is my choice.

1978
01:37:57,932 --> 01:38:00,401
And at the end of the day, you'll
always be a fucking nigger.

1979
01:38:00,434 --> 01:38:01,603
Yes. Nigger.

1980
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:04,906
Nigger.

1981
01:38:04,939 --> 01:38:07,241
It always
comes down to that.

1982
01:38:07,274 --> 01:38:10,378
Lazy, ignorant.

1983
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:11,913
Takes what isn't his.

1984
01:38:11,946 --> 01:38:15,349
Lazy. That nigger.

1985
01:38:15,382 --> 01:38:17,919
No.

1986
01:38:15,382 --> 01:38:17,919
Always are.

1987
01:38:17,952 --> 01:38:21,689
Always blaming
his circumstances

1988
01:38:21,722 --> 01:38:23,891
as an excuse

1989
01:38:23,924 --> 01:38:25,860
to get what he thinks

1990
01:38:25,893 --> 01:38:27,529
he deserves, that nigger.

1991
01:38:28,896 --> 01:38:31,232
Hell, that nigger

1992
01:38:31,265 --> 01:38:35,570
doesn't think
about the future,

1993
01:38:35,603 --> 01:38:37,371
tomorrow.

1994
01:38:37,404 --> 01:38:40,541
Today, he thinks
about getting his

1995
01:38:40,574 --> 01:38:45,980
sneaky, grubby, running,
grabby-- that nigger.

1996
01:38:46,013 --> 01:38:48,683
Yeah, that nigger.

1997
01:38:48,716 --> 01:38:50,351
Huh?

1998
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:53,487
There's only one
nigger in this room,

1999
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,890
in this house.

2000
01:38:55,923 --> 01:38:57,225
And that nigger is you.

2001
01:38:59,793 --> 01:39:01,629
That nigger's you.

2002
01:39:01,662 --> 01:39:04,365
That nigger's you, Tully.

2003
01:39:04,398 --> 01:39:06,401
That nigger is you.

2004
01:39:07,901 --> 01:39:11,372
The fuck.

2005
01:39:56,817 --> 01:39:58,553
Feels good, huh?

2006
01:40:02,489 --> 01:40:04,425
It's a wonderful world.

2007
01:40:45,999 --> 01:40:47,468
Come on.

2008
01:40:45,999 --> 01:40:47,468
Don't.

2009
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:49,704
Come on, man.
It's okay.

2010
01:41:30,978 --> 01:41:32,813
We're goin' in.
We gotta move now.

2011
01:41:32,846 --> 01:41:34,081
There's no choice.
SWAT, let's go.

2012
01:41:34,114 --> 01:41:36,684
We're coming out.

2013
01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:38,353
Stand down.

2014
01:41:40,821 --> 01:41:42,890
Here we are.
We're comin' out.

2015
01:41:47,961 --> 01:41:49,663
Raymond, you're here?

2016
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,166
Stand down,
my pop's comin' out.

2017
01:41:52,199 --> 01:41:54,168
Ray?

2018
01:41:54,201 --> 01:41:57,138
You there?

2019
01:41:54,201 --> 01:41:57,138
Yeah, Pop, I'm right here.

2020
01:41:57,171 --> 01:41:58,773
Tell them to back down.

2021
01:42:00,674 --> 01:42:01,743
We're coming out.

2022
01:42:02,843 --> 01:42:05,579
Okay? We...

2023
01:42:05,612 --> 01:42:07,815
are coming out.

2024
01:42:07,848 --> 01:42:09,183
Keep movin' forward.

2025
01:42:09,216 --> 01:42:10,651
Don't shoot.

2026
01:42:19,493 --> 01:42:22,063
Tully,
turn to your right.

2027
01:42:23,464 --> 01:42:24,565
Get down
on your knees.

2028
01:42:26,733 --> 01:42:29,503
Clasp your hands
behind your head.

2029
01:42:29,536 --> 01:42:31,172
Hands clasped.
Stay right there.

2030
01:44:05,098 --> 01:44:06,567
Hey.

2031
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,969
Much obliged.

2032
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,969
It's all good, Dad.

2033
01:44:09,002 --> 01:44:10,704
It's all good.

2034
01:44:10,737 --> 01:44:13,908
Mm.

2035
01:44:10,737 --> 01:44:13,908
Love you.

2036
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:15,109
Love you.

2037
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:35,129
Got a lot of work
to do around here.

2038
01:44:35,162 --> 01:44:36,664
Yeah, son?

2039
01:44:47,975 --> 01:44:52,547

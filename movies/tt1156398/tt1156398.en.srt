2
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,975
Oh, America.

3
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:31,978
I wish I could tell you
that this was still America...

4
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,982
...but I've come to realize that you
can't have a country without people.

5
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,986
And there are no people here.

6
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:49,412
No! No!

7
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,500
Go back... Fuck!

8
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:58,171
No, my friends.

9
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:02,383
This is now
the United States of Zombieland.

10
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:10,850
It's amazing how quickly things
can go from bad to total shit storm.

11
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:14,395
And why am I alive when everyone
around me has turned to meat?

12
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,398
It's because of my list of rules.

13
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:20,777
Rule number one
for surviving Zombieland: Cardio.

14
00:01:22,738 --> 00:01:23,780
Fuck!

15
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,532
When the virus struck,
for obvious reasons...

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,035
...the first ones to go
were the fatties.

17
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,957
Poor fat bastard.

18
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,712
But as the infection spread
and the chaos grew...

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,381
...it wasn't enough
to just be fast on your feet.

20
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,385
You had to get a gun
and learn how to use it.

21
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:49,055
Which leads me to my second rule:
The Double Tap.

22
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:55,228
In those moments when you're not sure
the undead are really "dead" dead...

23
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,396
...don't get all stingy
with your bullets.

24
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:00,399
I mean, one more clean shot
to the head...

25
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:06,239
...and this lady could have avoided
becoming a human Happy Meal.

26
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:09,242
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

27
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,994
Wasn't long before the zombies
began to get clever.

28
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:15,498
When you're at your most vulnerable,
somehow they could just smell it.

29
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,918
Can't a guy take a dumper in peace?

30
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,760
Don't let them catch you pants down.
Beware of bathrooms.

31
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:34,267
As zombies
began to outnumber humans...

32
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:37,353
...well, that's when you had to cut
all emotional ties.

33
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:41,107
If the girls in your neighborhood
are now fucked-up little monsters...

34
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,987
...well, maybe it's time
to stop driving carpool.

35
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:52,994
You had to focus
on your own survival...

36
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,955
...which leads to rule number four.
Pretty basic.

37
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:08,467
Fasten your seat belts.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

38
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:58,160
That guy down there is me.
I'm in Garland, Texas.

39
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:01,998
And it may look like zombies destroyed
it, but that's actually just Garland.

40
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:05,501
Two months since patient zero
took a bite of a contaminated burger...

41
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:06,961
...at a Gas N' Gulp.

42
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,424
Just two months, and I might be the
last non-cannibal freak in the country.

43
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:13,592
I may seem like
an unlikely survivor...

44
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,013
...with all my phobias
and irritable-bowel syndrome...

45
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,434
...but I had the advantage of never
having any friends or any close family.

46
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,186
I survive because I play it safe
and follow the rules.

47
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:26,939
My rules.

48
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:57,970
Shit.

49
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,651
Of course.

50
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:42,223
Motherfucker.

51
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:10,876
On the bright side, I had found
a place to go number two.

52
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:17,716
Another rule to surviving
Zombieland: Travel light.

53
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:21,053
And I don't mean just luggage.

54
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,055
I've always been kind of a loner.

55
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,224
I avoided people
like they were zombies...

56
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:27,101
...even before they were zombies.

57
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,688
Now that they are all zombies,
I kind of miss people.

58
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:34,275
So I'm on my way from
my college dorm in Austin, Texas...

59
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:38,404
...to Columbus, Ohio, where I'm
hoping my parents are still alive.

60
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,573
Even though we were never
really close...

61
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,492
...it would be nice to see
a familiar face, or any face...

62
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:47,580
...that doesn't have blood dripping from
its lips and flesh between its teeth.

63
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,419
Thank you.

64
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,513
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. I just have this list.

65
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,891
No one back there but my duffel bag.

66
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:37,856
- What's your name?
- Stop. No names.

67
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,109
Keeps us from getting too familiar.

68
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,446
You almost knocked over your alcohol
with your knife.

69
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:48,534
- That's okay, you don't have to...
- So where you headed?

70
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,870
Columbus. You?

71
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,541
Tallahassee.

72
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:03,048
No, one for me. One and done,
I always say. I said that once.

73
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,054
You know, Tallahassee and Columbus
are both east.

74
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,472
So?

75
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,934
So, Tallahassee,
you wanna stick together?

76
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:18,063
- Least for a while?
- Here's the deal, Columbus.

77
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,566
I'm not easy to get along with...

78
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,068
...and I'm sensing
you're a bit of a bitch...

79
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:27,781
...so I give this relationship
to about Texarkana.

80
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,076
Really? Yeah.
You'll take me as far as Texarkana.

81
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:34,121
You're a peppy little spit-fuck,
aren't you?

82
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,915
You might wanna buckle up
for safety.

83
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:41,420
I can tell already
you are gonna get on my nerves.

84
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,465
Even though teaming up
wasn't my style...

85
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:46,800
...I figured I'd be safer
with Tallahassee.

86
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,470
You see, he was in
the ass-kicking business, and...

87
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,472
Business is good.

88
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:56,894
It became quickly apparent, however,
that he did have one weakness.

89
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,479
What are we doing here?

90
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,939
Well, take a look.
It's a goddamn Hostess truck.

91
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:04,443
Yeah, I see that, a Hostess truck.
So what?

92
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:05,986
I could use a Twinkie.

93
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:17,122
- You coming?
- Yes. Yeah. One second.

94
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,379
- Are you fucking with me?
- No.

95
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:26,548
You should actually limber up
as well.

96
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,717
Especially if we are going down
that hill.

97
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,177
It is very important.

98
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:31,970
I don't believe in it.

99
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,641
You ever see a lion limber up
before it takes down a gazelle?

100
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,000
- Sno Balls?
- Yeah.

101
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,003
Sno Balls?

102
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:08,340
Where's the fucking Twinkies?

103
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:10,384
I like Sno Balls.

104
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:13,554
I hate coconut.
Not the taste, consistency.

105
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,848
Fresh.

106
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:21,395
Oh, this Twinkie thing,
it ain't over yet.

107
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,276
Hey, this may be a bad time...

108
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,778
...but I gotta take the Browns
to the Super Bowl.

109
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:31,447
- Really?
- Really.

110
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,081
I know, again, so soon?
What can I say?

111
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:43,625
I have a case of chronic anxiety.

112
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:52,634
Truth is, I was always kind of phobic.
I found lots of things disturbing.

113
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:56,305
Like undertow
or department store Santas.

114
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,015
Being alone with a baby.

115
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,896
But the thing I fear more than anything,
yes, even more than zombies...

116
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,107
...fucking clowns.

117
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,571
When you're afraid of everything
that's out there...

118
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:15,073
...you quit going out there...

119
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,743
...which is what happened to me
before Zombieland.

120
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:21,788
Friday night,
third straight week indoors.

121
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,790
"World of Warcraft"...

122
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,084
...leaning tower of pizza boxes...

123
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,337
...Code Red Mountain Dew.

124
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,631
Pride, nowhere.

125
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:32,508
Dignity, long gone.

126
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:35,260
Virginity, totally justifiable
to speculate on.

127
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,262
Smooth.

128
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,098
My whole life, all I'd ever wanted
was to find a girl...

129
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:43,685
...and fall in love, bring her home
to meet the folks.

130
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,772
Then again, since my folks
are paranoid shut-ins like me...

131
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,441
...maybe this girl could
bring me home to her folks.

132
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:54,029
And then I'd finally be a member
of a cool, functional family.

133
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:56,114
408.

134
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:59,284
Please, is anyone home?
Please, it's an emergency.

135
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:02,454
I don't usually unlock my door
to the sounds of panic...

136
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,540
...but my neighbor 406
is insanely hot.

137
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,124
Okay, okay.

138
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,966
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

139
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,801
Nice to meet you.

140
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:22,224
Here.

141
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,643
There you go.

142
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,733
- Mountain Dew?
- Yeah. Code Red.

143
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:35,654
And here's some Golden Grahams.
The Ziploc bag keeps them crisp.

144
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:38,657
Okay. Keep that there.

145
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,243
So tell me what happened.

146
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:47,040
He was homeless and sick.

147
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,085
And I was walking home from the bar,
talking on my phone...

148
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:54,339
...and then he just came sprinting
towards me.

149
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,634
I mean, not running, sprinting.

150
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:01,847
And I thought, you know, like, maybe
he was running from someone...

151
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:07,269
...or after someone, but last time I saw
he was still out there going crazy.

152
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:08,562
Drugs, maybe?

153
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:13,066
I didn't even tell you the worst part.

154
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,028
Yeah?

155
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,030
He tried to bite me.

156
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:25,704
- You're right, that's the worst part.
- I'm sorry. I'm just so scared.

157
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:29,875
No, no, no, you should be scared.
A homeless man just tried to eat you.

158
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:32,461
That's the right kind of scared.
That's reasonable.

159
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,423
I get scared for things that don't make
sense, like clowns with red noses...

160
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:41,136
...or the rags they use to wipe tables
when you finish eating at a restaurant.

161
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,971
Really?

162
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:46,892
Look, the point is
I am here for you, okay?

163
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,562
And as long as you are by my side,
I am not leaving this apartment.

164
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,398
Do you mind if I just close my eyes
for a minute?

165
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,233
No, of course. Of course.

166
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,986
- Thank you.
- Okay.

167
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:01,323
Set aside the feverish,
homeless cannibal...

168
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,408
...I'm living the dream.

169
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,661
I had always, my whole life...

170
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:09,456
...wanted to brush a girl's hair
over her ear.

171
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,417
- Good night.
- Good night.

172
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,309
Oh, my God.

173
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:31,103
Are you okay?

174
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,443
Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

175
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,113
What are you doing?

176
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,123
Look, stay back, 406, okay?
I don't wanna hurt you, but...

177
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,624
Shit.

178
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:07,055
Oh, my God, I'm so fucking sorry.

179
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,554
You see, you just can't trust anyone.

180
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:51,433
The first time I let a girl into my life
and she tries to eat me.

181
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:09,117
Please. Listen to me.

182
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,244
406.

183
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:13,455
If you're in there...

184
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:17,918
...you're just sick. Okay?

185
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:37,270
That was my first brush
with the plague of the 21 st century.

186
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,064
Remember mad cow disease?

187
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:42,567
Well, mad cow became mad person
became mad zombie.

188
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:46,780
It's a fast-acting virus that left you
with a swollen brain, a raging fever...

189
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:48,949
...that made you hateful, violent...

190
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,952
...and gave you a really, really bad
case of the munchies.

191
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,162
All right, you steer, I'll push.

192
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:59,918
Okay.

193
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,923
I've heard there's a place
that's untouched by this crap.

194
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:07,592
- Back east, yeah?
- Yeah. You heard the same thing?

195
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:12,305
Out west, we hear it's back east.
Back east, they hear it's out west.

196
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:15,308
It's all just nonsense.

197
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,978
You know, you're like a penguin
on the North Pole...

198
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:21,314
...who hears the South Pole
is really nice this time of year.

199
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:24,192
There are no penguins
on the North Pole.

200
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,946
You wanna feel how hard
I can punch?

201
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,366
So, what do you think?

202
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:34,035
Wait, the last time I laid some pipe?

203
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:37,789
Last time you went 20 toes,
put Percy in the playpen?

204
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:38,957
Who's Percy?

205
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,501
Wallpapered the closet,
passed the gravy.

206
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,838
- Went heels to Jesus.
- Oh, made love.

207
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:46,798
Well, just sex.

208
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,636
Three weeks ago. Yeah.

209
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:53,638
In the back
of an abandoned FedEx truck.

210
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:58,143
- Shut up.
- No, no, I was headed east.

211
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,478
She, west.

212
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,814
And we took shelter
in the back of the truck.

213
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,984
- It was full of undelivered packages.
- What was her name?

214
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:08,069
Beverly.

215
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:09,404
Beverly Hills.

216
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:10,739
You dog.

217
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:15,327
So, what about you?

218
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:18,496
Me? I...

219
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:21,249
Aye, aye, aye.

220
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:27,505
Oh, my God. It makes you sick.

221
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,508
You know, it makes you sad,
it makes you...

222
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,179
It makes you think if you can go back
to the way things were right now...

223
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:35,597
...you know, you'd be...

224
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,975
You'd be out in the backyard,
you know, trying to catch fireflies.

225
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:41,561
And instead this.

226
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:47,442
- I mean, it makes you...
- Hungry.

227
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,194
I'm worried about you.

228
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:52,364
Look, whatever you have
waiting for you in Columbus...

229
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:57,077
...I promise you it ain't prettier than
our friend here enjoying her Manwich.

230
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:07,879
Tallahassee had a sick sense
of humor when it came to zombies.

231
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,508
Zombies aren't the most lovable
creatures, but he really hated them.

232
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,761
The only thing he was more
obsessed with than killing zombies...

233
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,221
...was finding a Twinkie.

234
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:19,724
Something about a Twinkie reminded
him of a time not so long ago...

235
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:23,478
...when things were simple
and not so fucking psychotic.

236
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,898
It was like if he got a taste
of that comforting childhood treat...

237
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:31,236
...the world would become innocent,
and everything would return to normal.

238
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:33,154
What, are you prospecting?

239
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,073
Jesus Christ.

240
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,158
You are a dangerous man.

241
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:41,746
You're gonna risk our lives
for a Twinkie?

242
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:44,749
There is a box of Twinkies
in that grocery store.

243
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,751
Not just any box of Twinkies.

244
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,923
The last box of Twinkies that anyone
will enjoy in the whole universe.

245
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,926
Believe it or not,
Twinkies have an expiration date.

246
00:21:56,095 --> 00:22:02,100
Someday very soon, life's little
Twinkie gauge is gonna go empty.

247
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:05,937
Time to nut up or shut up.

248
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,108
When Tallahassee
goes Hulk on a zombie...

249
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:13,153
...he sets the standard
for notwto-bewfucked-with.

250
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,113
No fear, nothing to lose.

251
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:19,284
What can I say? It's like-w
It's like art.

252
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:38,970
You got a pretty mouth.

253
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:51,024
Don't swing, don't swing.

254
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:53,109
Swing.

255
00:22:58,115 --> 00:23:00,116
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

256
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,661
Yeah.

257
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:04,996
You're incredible.

258
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,539
- I know.
- Yeah.

259
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:10,168
Twinkie, Twinkie, Twinkie, Twinkie.

260
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:12,837
Big Hoss.

261
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:22,347
Come here, big fella.
Just gonna take a little off the top.

262
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:32,273
Wow, these fellas
really let themselves go.

263
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,526
And they're so fat.

264
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:36,903
I think we should probably
just keep going.

265
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:43,201
All I could think of was,
what are the odds?

266
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,955
Another marriageable woman
to bring home to the folks.

267
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:48,373
Come quick.

268
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,710
Someone's ear is in danger
of having hair brushed over it.

269
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:56,714
Hey.

270
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,050
I'll catch up.

271
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,931
Rule number 22:
When in doubt, know your way out.

272
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:17,152
They're sisters.
The little one's been bitten.

273
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,571
Act normal. Try not to freak her out.

274
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,489
Yeah.

275
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,493
Columbus, Wichita, Little Rock.

276
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,248
So you did all this for a Twinkie?

277
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:35,503
No, no, no, he did. I'm just kind of
like a Sancho Panza character.

278
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,799
Look, I don't think she has long.

279
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:44,137
Yeah, I know. I know, and she knows.
We're just looking for a way out.

280
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:47,974
No, no, no, no. She's just a little girl.

281
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:50,101
Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

282
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,146
Right, sorry.

283
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:57,942
Look, I know that you're really sick.

284
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,486
But your sister wants me to...

285
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:03,239
It's not her decision, okay? It's mine.

286
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:05,283
I made her promise.

287
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,954
We already said goodbye,
but we didn't have a gun.

288
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:13,750
- We don't know that there's no cure.
- You're just gutless!

289
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,127
Give him the gun.

290
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,813
Wait, wait, wait.

291
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:39,692
I'll do it.

292
00:25:57,336 --> 00:26:00,296
- I love you.
- I love you too.

293
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:11,683
You need some help?

294
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:14,560
Now that you mention it...

295
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:17,355
...we'll take your weapons,
car keys, your ammunition.

296
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:20,817
- And if you've got it, sugarless gum.
- What the fuck?

297
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:24,612
Wait, why are you guys doing this?

298
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:26,948
Better you make the mistake
of trusting us...

299
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,200
...than us make the mistake
of trusting you.

300
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:35,790
The first hot girl in 1000 miles shows
up, makes me feel like an idiot...

301
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:40,044
...steals my double-barrel and then
says I'm the one that can't be trusted.

302
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:45,717
Nice going, genius.

303
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,885
You're the one that gave her the gun.

304
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,638
Those guys were dumb.

305
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:54,600
Avoid the vanity mirror.

306
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:57,061
Relax, okay?
I just passed for a zombie.

307
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:02,984
- What I'd give for a shower...
- Do not say S-H-O-W-E-R, okay?

308
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:06,070
Let's just get where we're going.

309
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:09,073
- So do you think it's true?
- Is what true?

310
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:11,242
You know, about Pacific Playland?

311
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,413
Totally zombie-free.
Only place west of Waco.

312
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,916
Trust me.

313
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,671
He's on one of these serious
Tour de France bikes...

314
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,007
You know, with, like,
the toeholds, right?

315
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:31,179
- and he's pedaling, and the zombie's
head is, like, caught in the gear.

316
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:35,099
You know, with the hair in the chain
just, like, going around.

317
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,101
Very cool.

318
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:42,190
But zombie kill of the week?
No, sir.

319
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,277
I saw this construction worker.
I shit you not...

320
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,864
...he is on a steamroller, and a zombie
goes down in front of him.

321
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:52,617
You ever roll a tube of toothpaste up
from the bottom?

322
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:57,205
- I always roll it up from the bottom.
- Well, the zombie's head is the cap.

323
00:27:57,414 --> 00:28:00,708
Are you one of these guys that tries
to one-up everybody else's story?

324
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:05,046
No. I knew a guy way worse
at that than me.

325
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:07,298
All right, let's just try to find a car.

326
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,508
Which reminds me...

327
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:11,677
...I never had headaches like this
till your ass came onboard.

328
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:16,391
I mean, do what you want with a man,
but do not fuck with his Cadillac.

329
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:17,809
Hey, there's a nice minivan.

330
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:20,561
Oh, you know something?
That is nice.

331
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:22,063
That's a beautiful van.

332
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:27,360
Tallahassee believes you have to
blow off steam in Zombieland...

333
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:30,154
...or else you lose what's left
of your mind.

334
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:33,658
If it makes him happy and keeps him
from using that crowbar on me...

335
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:36,369
...then I say, "Hey, go ape shit."

336
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,579
I want my Caddy back!

337
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:42,542
Stupid little bitches!

338
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:52,093
Oh, I think I pulled something.

339
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:56,514
Think the two of us are smart enough
to come up with a con like that?

340
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,854
You hesitated.

341
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:09,026
Is it better to be smart or lucky?

342
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:12,488
Look at what we got here.

343
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,928
Come on.

344
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:43,019
- That's nice.
- Smell the finger?

345
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,816
Yes.

346
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:56,240
Thank God for rednecks.

347
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,910
This is a really big truck...

348
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:03,831
...and these are really big guns.

349
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,666
Take your time.

350
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,192
You know, they say,
"He who seeks revenge...

351
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,194
...should remember
to dig two graves."

352
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:37,573
Right. Two graves. One for
the big chick, one for the little chick.

353
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,158
You are scary happy.

354
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:45,540
Come on, why don't we just forget
about those girls and head home?

355
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:47,959
Oh, you want to talk about home?

356
00:30:48,835 --> 00:30:53,464
For me, home was a puppy
named Buck.

357
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,967
Cutest dog ever.

358
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,685
All those fucking zombies.

359
00:31:06,728 --> 00:31:07,812
I lost him.

360
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:14,110
And there ain't no getting him back,
so I'm looking for a new home.

361
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:19,198
Tomorrow, I may be skinny-dipping
in the Yellowstone River...

362
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:22,910
...or swinging from the chandeliers
in the Playboy Mansion...

363
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,498
...but today,
a Vortec six-fucking-liter V8...

364
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:31,419
...a box full of hollow points,
and, Lord willing, a GD Twinkie.

365
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:36,257
Gotta enjoy the little things.

366
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,761
I hate to give credit to anyone
who looks like Yosemite Sam...

367
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:42,346
...but I'm writing it down.

368
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:45,016
Rule number 32:
Enjoy the little things.

369
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:55,401
Knowing them, it's a trap.

370
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:58,946
Wait here. Drive down if I signal.

371
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:01,240
You're not gonna shoot them,
are you?

372
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:04,160
Not unless they shoot at me.

373
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:07,413
Oh, let's hope they shoot at me.

374
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,174
Looks like they hoofed it.

375
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,677
Probably headed west.

376
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,845
Just drive slow,
keep your eyes peeled.

377
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:06,764
Sure.

378
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,646
- They're in the back, aren't they?
- Just me.

379
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:17,233
I'm really sorry.
She was like a crouching tiger.

380
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:20,736
You got taken hostage
by a 12-year-old?

381
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:24,448
Girls mature faster than boys. She's
way ahead of where I was at that age.

382
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:27,785
Twelve's the new 20. Gun, please.

383
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:30,162
Like you would ever use that thing.

384
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,290
Don't kill me with my own gun!

385
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,167
All those violent video games.

386
00:33:35,335 --> 00:33:37,128
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

387
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:39,046
- Now honk your horn.
- What?

388
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:40,840
Honk it.

389
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:48,180
It's your sister, with my gun. Hello.

390
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,894
Bummer.

391
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:57,314
Now step away from the vehicle.

392
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:02,194
You get to ride shotgun.

393
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:11,245
I kind of like this girl.

394
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,665
She's not your typical hot,
stuck-up bitch.

395
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:19,795
Even before Zombieland, Wichita was
running the table on guys like us.

396
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:37,688
- What are you looking for?
- My engagement ring.

397
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:42,443
I took it off to pump my gas,
and I thought that I put it in my purse...

398
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,780
...but it must've fallen out,
and I'm late for my flight and...

399
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:50,034
Well, listen, I'll find your ring,
and I'll FedEx it to you.

400
00:34:50,535 --> 00:34:52,036
I'll give you a reward.

401
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:53,412
Don't be silly.

402
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,541
Three thousand dollars.
It's worth more than my car.

403
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,085
Just give me your number.

404
00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:03,214
Yeah. I'll find it.

405
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,758
Yeah, I'll start looking for it
right now.

406
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:08,219
Because I got nothing else to do.

407
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:10,304
I was engaged once...

408
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:12,723
...but I'm single now.

409
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,560
Bye-bye.

410
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:21,732
Hope you make your flight.

411
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:29,323
No, but I know it's
around here somewhere.

412
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:31,909
She's on a plane,
that's the beauty of it.

413
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,081
Let me call you back.

414
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:39,792
Hey, you found my ring.

415
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:43,087
Thanks. I've been looking all over
for it.

416
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,506
- Your ring?
- Well, it's my friend's, you know.

417
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:48,384
- I'm gonna send it to her.
- Do I get a reward?

418
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:53,472
Forty, 60, 80, 400.

419
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,600
That's it. That's the whole register.

420
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,479
You made someone very happy.

421
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,148
You too.

422
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:12,449
Nice.

423
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,535
How many left?

424
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,496
Let me see.

425
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,792
Enough for us to get to California.

426
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,670
Someday, I want a ring this big.

427
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:26,964
For the low price of 30 bucks, sold.

428
00:36:29,342 --> 00:36:32,344
It's amazing how far you can get
with some costume jewelry...

429
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:33,971
...and a cutthroat attitude.

430
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:38,017
I guess we're just lucky they didn't
leave us by the side of the road.

431
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,812
Thank you, Wichita.
Thanks, Little Rock.

432
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:50,487
For fuck's sake, enough! We're being
chased by ravenous freaks!

433
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,656
We don't have enough problems?

434
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:55,159
"They stole my Hummer.
We have trust issues."

435
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:57,411
We can't just fucking drive
down the road...

436
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:01,206
...playing I Spy or some shit for hours
like four normal-ass Americans?

437
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,000
Fuck me!

438
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:05,169
I know.

439
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:08,756
Let me be the mature one.

440
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:11,675
Good.

441
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:25,773
So where are you guys headed?

442
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,192
Pacific Playland.

443
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,610
The amusement park?

444
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:33,113
- Wait, outside L.A.?
- Yeah. We went there as kids.

445
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,199
That place totally blows.

446
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,954
My mind. It's so fun.

447
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:42,873
Just good entertainment
for the whole family.

448
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:47,211
Yeah, I went there as a kid too. In fact,
this probably counts as off-season.

449
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:49,880
Well, did you guys hear?
There are no zombies there.

450
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:51,423
Yeah, we heard.

451
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:56,553
You know, I may not shoot you, but
you have still royally pissed me off...

452
00:37:56,721 --> 00:38:00,391
...and I'm not going to play with you
at Pacific Playland.

453
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,895
- Don't worry, he grows on you.
- Really?

454
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:06,605
No. It gets worse.

455
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:09,233
Okay. How about
we play the quiet game?

456
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:10,901
Yeah? Starting now.

457
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:15,572
Oh, I've actually
been meaning to ask you:

458
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,992
Did you hear anything
about Columbus, Ohio?

459
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,452
- You never played the quiet game?
- Sorry.

460
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,788
No? Well, they're playing it
in Columbus.

461
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:26,083
It's a total ghost town.
It's burned to the ground.

462
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:35,968
You're Columbus.

463
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:38,929
I'm sorry.

464
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:41,682
I didn't realize it was...

465
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:45,769
I'm not sure what's more tragic:
that my family is gone...

466
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:49,815
...or the realization that I never really
had much of a family to begin with.

467
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:53,986
Either way, I can't pretend that what
I'm looking for I'll find by going home.

468
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:56,280
I have no home.

469
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:02,077
We can get you a ride.

470
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:06,540
You know,
you can go see for yourself...

471
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,126
...or settle somewhere new.

472
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:11,170
Okay.

473
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:14,798
I could tell she knew
what I was feeling.

474
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,302
We were all orphans in Zombieland.

475
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:34,818
I know this Pacific Playland thing
is nuts...

476
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:40,365
...but it's just been so long
since she got to be a kid.

477
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,368
Yeah, it's tough growing up
in Zombieland.

478
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,913
It's tough growing up.

479
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:52,711
There.

480
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:54,713
You could take that truck.

481
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:04,056
Well, I hope you find
whoever it is you're looking for.

482
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:09,436
And don't let go, once you do.

483
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:25,369
It wasn't just because
I had nowhere else to go.

484
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:29,248
It was because, in that moment,
it became clear.

485
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:33,877
Wherever this girl was,
that's where I wanted to be.

486
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:57,234
Man, we're gonna have to pull
over soon. I'm feeling cooped up.

487
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,571
"Wantum your wampum."
Yeah. That'll work.

488
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:05,409
- Okay, but what the hell are we doing?
- Just humor him. Trust me.

489
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:18,338
Hold up.

490
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:21,592
Who wants to go first?

491
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,137
I really,
really wanna impress Wichita...

492
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:27,472
...but it would be in violation
of rule 17...

493
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,350
...maybe the most important rule
of all: Don't be a hero.

494
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:35,480
- Why don't you take this one?
- Don't mind if I do.

495
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:52,206
What do you think?
Zombie kill of the week?

496
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,626
Close, but no cigar.
Kill of the week...

497
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:58,295
...goes to
Sister Cynthia Knickerbocker.

498
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:04,801
Poor flat bastard.

499
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,159
- Perfume?
- What?

500
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:31,411
Is that perfume?

501
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:33,830
It's cologne.

502
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:36,166
I'm thinking...

503
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,542
...Lancפme Magnifique.

504
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,503
Why don't you speak up a little?

505
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:42,172
I think they might have
missed it in Santa Fe.

506
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:47,844
- Oh, my God.
- All right. Okay.

507
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,390
You're thinking about
fucking Wichita.

508
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:56,103
Wish granted. She spent
the last 24 hours fucking us both.

509
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:58,730
Hey.

510
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:01,942
Good luck now, Petunia.

511
00:43:08,908 --> 00:43:10,534
Okay.

512
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:14,454
Let me begin by saying you're a
wonderful human with great potential.

513
00:43:14,622 --> 00:43:20,043
It's okay, but FYI, I beat wholesale
ass for a lot less than that.

514
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,549
- I'm sure.
- You get 45 percent power.

515
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:27,050
Thank you.

516
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:31,430
Yeah. Come on, break another one.

517
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:37,352
Nice.

518
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:41,398
Doesn't that feel good?

519
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:34,159
Tallahassee's right.
You gotta enjoy the little things...

520
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:38,622
...even if that means destroying
a whole lot of little things.

521
00:44:41,793 --> 00:44:44,127
Smells like perfume.

522
00:44:46,506 --> 00:44:49,966
- You don't know who Willie Nelson is?
- No.

523
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:52,386
Willie Nelson?

524
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:54,471
Yeah, no, I don't.

525
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:59,184
I shave every morning, but sometimes
by, like, 4:30, I'll have a thing.

526
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:02,354
It's called 5:00 shadow,
but sometimes I'll get it prematurely.

527
00:45:02,522 --> 00:45:06,483
Since it's a freeway, you can get it up
to, like, 65, but don't go more than 75.

528
00:45:06,651 --> 00:45:10,404
- You don't wanna go more than 20.
- Don't worry about a blind spot.

529
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,572
Blind spots are for other drivers.

530
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,409
It's like the first time
that I've ever driven.

531
00:45:15,576 --> 00:45:19,746
So do you never strap in
or it's just on long road trips?

532
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:24,501
It's just there's zombies everywhere.
I think the least of my worries...

533
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:26,711
- Yeah, that's true.
...is seat belts.

534
00:45:26,879 --> 00:45:28,046
Yes, but, no, she's not.

535
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:31,675
She's only famous when she's Hannah
Montana, when she's wearing the wig.

536
00:45:31,843 --> 00:45:34,219
- Right. Only wig.
- So...

537
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:40,267
It's kind of freeing.

538
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:42,352
Yeah.

539
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:48,275
For the first time in a long time,
we were having fun.

540
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:50,861
So even though it ran counter
to our strategies...

541
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:53,864
...we decided to stay together
as far as Pacific Playland.

542
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:26,229
I think sleep deprivation is the
number one health problem in America.

543
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:28,648
Well, now I think it might be
number two.

544
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:32,319
- Number two.
- That's adorable.

545
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:35,739
- I think we should find a place to crash.
- Oh, I got an idea.

546
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:39,576
We're in Hollywood,
let's sleep in style.

547
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,291
Grab a map.

548
00:46:52,298 --> 00:46:53,840
Come on.

549
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,842
Hurry! Hurry!

550
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:58,094
Good job.

551
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:06,853
Looks like anyone who's ever been
in a movie lives on this block.

552
00:47:07,063 --> 00:47:10,482
What exactly you think we're doing
in the 90210, Sally?

553
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:13,151
I pictured Tom Cruise
living somewhere nicer.

554
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:17,364
B-lister compared
to who I got in mind, folks.

555
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:20,617
We're going to the tippy-top
of the A-list.

556
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:22,619
- Who?
- You'll see.

557
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:30,627
Hey. There's a big BM.

558
00:47:32,004 --> 00:47:33,838
And it ain't Bob Marley.

559
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:43,098
This place is incredible.

560
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:59,406
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to la manחion de Murray.

561
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:02,325
- Bill Murray.
- God, no way.

562
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:05,996
This guy has a direct line
to my funny bone.

563
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:08,039
- Everything...
- Wait. Who's Bill Murray?

564
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:09,916
Hey, I've never hit a kid before.

565
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:14,004
All right? I mean,
that's like asking who Gandhi is.

566
00:48:14,714 --> 00:48:16,423
Who's Gandhi?

567
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,842
She's 12.

568
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:23,930
- No Twinkies.
- Shit, fuck!

569
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,600
See? I told you we should've gone
to Russell Crowe's.

570
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:29,394
- No one listens to me.
- Hello, inside voices. Okay?

571
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:31,229
At least until we know we're alone.

572
00:48:31,397 --> 00:48:34,357
Tallahassee, Wichita, take that way.
Little Rock, come here.

573
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,901
Why do I get stuck with her?

574
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:42,699
It doesn't seem to end.

575
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:49,789
Hey, come here.

576
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,960
He has his own movie theater?

577
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,216
Okay, I'm gonna teach you
something about Bill Murray.

578
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:04,763
A king slept right here.

579
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,099
Dibs on the bed.

580
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:13,313
Too soft for me, anyway.

581
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:23,281
Oh, this is so exciting. You're about
to learn who you gonna call.

582
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:25,742
It's Ghostbusters.

583
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:45,845
This is pretty catchy.

584
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:48,264
Come on.

585
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:50,767
Help me with the boots. Come on.

586
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:52,435
Help me with the boots.

587
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:56,439
Okay. I'll get them myself.

588
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:18,044
Shit.

589
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,009
Bill Murray, you're a zombie?

590
00:50:31,142 --> 00:50:33,476
I'm on fire!

591
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,895
You're not a zombie,
you're talking, and...

592
00:50:36,063 --> 00:50:38,898
- You're okay?
- The hell I am!

593
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:42,736
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that it was "you" you.

594
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:44,904
Are you...? What's with the get-up?

595
00:50:45,072 --> 00:50:47,824
Oh, I do it to blend in. You know.

596
00:50:47,992 --> 00:50:50,034
Zombies don't mess
with other zombies.

597
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:52,328
Buddy of mine
showed me how to do this.

598
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,832
Cornstarch. You know, some berries,
a little licorice for the ladies.

599
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,586
Suits my lifestyle, you know.
I like to get out and do stuff.

600
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:03,757
Just played nine holes on the Riviera.
Just walked on. Nobody there.

601
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:08,178
Goddamn it, Bill fucking Murray!

602
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:10,555
I had to get that out.
I don't mean to gush.

603
00:51:10,723 --> 00:51:14,768
This is so surreal. I mean,
you probably get this all the time.

604
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:17,687
Maybe not lately,
but I'm such a huge fan of yours.

605
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:19,189
I mean, I swear, you know...

606
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:22,525
...l've seen every one of your movies
a million times.

607
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:27,530
I even love your dramatic roles
and just everything.

608
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:31,534
Six people left in the world,
one of them is Bill fucking Murray!

609
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:35,371
I know that's not your middle name.
I been watching you since I was like...

610
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:39,042
Since I could masturbate.
I mean, not that they're connected.

611
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,462
"A former greenskeeper about
to become the Masters champion."

612
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:49,219
Well, that's why we do it.

613
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:52,388
I love you, Bill. I love you.

614
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,057
I thank you.

615
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:55,600
Thank you.

616
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,394
You are staring at me.
It's a hairpiece.

617
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:02,065
I'm sorry. No, it was just that you look
remarkably like Eddie Van Halen.

618
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,566
I just saw Eddie Van Halen.

619
00:52:04,235 --> 00:52:05,735
- Really?
- Yeah.

620
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:08,112
- Where? How was that?
- At the Hollywood Bowl.

621
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,614
He's a zombie.

622
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:11,783
That's a tough break.

623
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:14,619
So how about
a little West Coast hospitality?

624
00:52:14,787 --> 00:52:17,580
Can I get you something?
What would you like?

625
00:52:28,968 --> 00:52:31,177
Smooth, isn't it?

626
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:34,764
Oh, hurry.
Hurry, he's on the ceiling.

627
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:38,309
- Come get him. Avoid the chandelier.
- Light him up, Ray.

628
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:42,605
- See you on the other side, Pete.
- Oh, he's so disgusting.

629
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:45,650
- Looks like Slimer.
- Don't cross the streams!

630
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:47,861
- I don't wanna cross...
- Oh, no, he's awful.

631
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:50,488
Don't cross the streams!

632
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,452
Thirty-five feet long,
weighing approximately 600 pounds.

633
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,787
That's a big Twinkie.

634
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:00,290
Your sister is single, right?

635
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,959
There's nothing long distance
or anything?

636
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:04,919
- No.
- Oh, good, good.

637
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:08,965
And if she had, like, a type,
you know...

638
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:12,176
...if you can have a type,
what would that be, you think?

639
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:14,637
She kind of goes for, like, bad boys.

640
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:16,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

641
00:53:16,223 --> 00:53:17,807
That's cool.

642
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:19,559
What?

643
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:26,190
- So Columbus is the scared one?
- Yeah. He's like a little bunny.

644
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:28,735
I'll get him.

645
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:32,947
Watch this.

646
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:42,832
No.

647
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,043
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

648
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,045
I got him.

649
00:53:51,342 --> 00:53:54,510
Is that how you say hello
where you come from?

650
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:56,512
Oh, my God.

651
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,599
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I shot Bill Murray.

652
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:05,480
- Mr. Murray?
- I'm just Bill, I think, now.

653
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,358
- Bill?
- Yeah?

654
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:11,736
I don't think we're gonna be able
to stitch this.

655
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,531
That's still tender.

656
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:17,492
You think you might pull through?

657
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:22,205
No.

658
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:25,416
If it means anything now,
I am so sorry.

659
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:27,543
It was just instinctive.

660
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,420
It was my bad.

661
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:32,882
I was never a very good
practical joker.

662
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,551
So do you have any regrets?

663
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:40,556
Garfield, maybe.

664
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,042
I'm sorry, he just gets me.

665
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:11,421
- But it still is sad.
- Yeah.

666
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:17,093
- Okay.
- Oh, shit.

667
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:20,096
Okay. Okay.

668
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:23,599
Okay. Shit. Okay.

669
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:37,655
Sorry. One second.
It's a double-barrel. Sorry.

670
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,365
Okay.

671
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:48,291
Three, two, one.

672
00:55:49,376 --> 00:55:51,002
- You guys want some Purell?
- Yes.

673
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,295
- Please.
- Yeah.

674
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:53,671
Around the world.

675
00:55:57,843 --> 00:55:59,343
Yes.

676
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:02,847
- Oh, free parking.
- Yeah.

677
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:05,475
Which is the best thing
about Zombieland.

678
00:56:05,642 --> 00:56:08,519
No, best thing about Z-land,
no Facebook status updates.

679
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:11,564
You know, "Rob Curtis
is gearing up for Friday."

680
00:56:11,732 --> 00:56:15,860
- Who cares?
- The best thing is no more flushing.

681
00:56:16,028 --> 00:56:19,405
- Epic.
- And the worst thing about Z-land?

682
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:22,158
You mean, other than the fact
that I shot Bill Murray?

683
00:56:22,326 --> 00:56:24,494
That's easy. Losing Buck.

684
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:27,330
That's his puppy.

685
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:31,751
I'm gonna tell you, I never thought
I could love anything like Buck.

686
00:56:31,919 --> 00:56:36,005
He was just... The day he was born,
I just lost my mind.

687
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:39,175
Sorry.

688
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:43,346
We were two peas.

689
00:56:43,514 --> 00:56:49,519
He had my personality, my laugh,
my appetite.

690
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:50,853
Laugh?

691
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:54,690
That's when it hit me. I felt ashamed
that it had taken me this long-w

692
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,859
Me, with the best cardio
in the business.

693
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:59,779
- wto realize I wasn't the only one
running from something.

694
00:57:06,245 --> 00:57:10,414
Oh, there it is. There you go.

695
00:57:10,582 --> 00:57:14,168
Oh, you like the syrup. Yes.

696
00:57:15,379 --> 00:57:17,088
Okay.

697
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:27,223
We made this wallet together
out of duct tape.

698
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:34,313
Take away a man's son...

699
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:37,275
...you've truly given him
nothing left to lose.

700
00:57:47,828 --> 00:57:51,581
I haven't cried like that since Titanic.

701
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:11,434
Hi.

702
00:58:32,456 --> 00:58:33,664
A hint.

703
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:41,756
Why don't you exhale slowly,
squeeze the trigger?

704
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:16,707
Don't make me drink alone.

705
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,668
Okay.

706
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:29,512
It's a 1997 Georges?

707
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,724
I never took French.
Georges de Latour? I don't know.

708
00:59:33,892 --> 00:59:37,186
- Oh, it's a '97?
- Yeah.

709
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:39,689
- Was that a good year?
- Oh, my God.

710
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:41,399
It was great.
Are you kidding me?

711
00:59:41,566 --> 00:59:45,236
I saw my first R-rated movie
that year.

712
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:48,572
wYeah, Anaconda.
wAnaconda.

713
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:52,451
First tattoo, porpoise.

714
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,704
- Really?
- Fake.

715
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:57,039
First kiss.

716
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,041
Scotty Lynch.

717
00:59:59,626 --> 01:00:02,336
You guys used tongue?

718
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:07,049
Maybe.

719
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:09,468
You jealous of Scotty Lynch?

720
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:13,556
Yes, I am.

721
01:00:13,724 --> 01:00:18,227
Actually, I think I'm jealous
of your whole 1997.

722
01:00:18,395 --> 01:00:20,229
Let's see.

723
01:00:22,232 --> 01:00:24,567
Mine, first orthodontist.

724
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:27,820
The bastard gave me headgear.
Yeah. I got my first B.

725
01:00:27,988 --> 01:00:29,905
Oh, no.

726
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:32,616
Frightening as Anaconda.

727
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,787
In wood shop, which doesn't really
count as a class anyway.

728
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:38,581
No.

729
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:42,084
Had my first school dance.
Oh, thank you.

730
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:46,380
It was a Sadie Hawkins,
so girls' choice, you know.

731
01:00:49,593 --> 01:00:53,262
- What, and nobody picked you?
- It was girls' choice.

732
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,848
- Those bitches.
- I know.

733
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:58,934
No, I will not stand for this.
No. You know what?

734
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:05,441
On behalf of all the eighth-grade girls,
I would like to make it up to you.

735
01:01:08,195 --> 01:01:09,320
Relax.

736
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:11,822
Scotty's old news.

737
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:51,654
I don't even know your name,
but this is actually really nice.

738
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:56,242
You know, between you, me
and What About Bob?

739
01:01:57,828 --> 01:01:59,578
...you're actually kind of cute.

740
01:01:59,746 --> 01:02:00,830
You think so?

741
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,374
Yeah.

742
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,836
I mean, you got the guts of a guppy...

743
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:09,839
...but I could hit that.

744
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:15,261
Really?

745
01:02:15,762 --> 01:02:19,265
Or at least give you
the intentional walk to first.

746
01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:32,486
Hey, a little help moving the couch?

747
01:02:33,113 --> 01:02:35,030
We're making a fort.

748
01:02:40,078 --> 01:02:42,121
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's probably for the best.

749
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:44,123
- Right.
- Because...

750
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:47,710
...I like you...

751
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:50,463
...Columbus, but my sister and I...

752
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,924
...are gonna do
whatever it takes to survive, so...

753
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:07,813
I was hoping
Wichita was just playing hard to get...

754
01:03:08,023 --> 01:03:10,483
...but I realized she had
more trust issues than I...

755
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:14,403
...when I woke up the next day
and she was leaving.

756
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:20,284
You are like a giant
cock-blocking robot...

757
01:03:20,452 --> 01:03:23,621
...like, developed in a secret
fucking government lab.

758
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,581
Hey.

759
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:28,417
I can't believe I almost kissed him.
What's our rule?

760
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:31,337
- Trust no one, just you and me.
- Just you and me.

761
01:03:32,088 --> 01:03:34,340
Yeah. You and me.

762
01:03:47,938 --> 01:03:50,314
You have just survived
the zombie apocalypse...

763
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:52,483
...and drove halfway across
the country.

764
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:54,151
Where are you gonna go?

765
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,488
I'm going to Pacific Playland.

766
01:04:16,174 --> 01:04:18,717
Open sesame.

767
01:04:28,228 --> 01:04:31,188
This is the problem
with getting attached to someone.

768
01:04:31,356 --> 01:04:33,983
When they leave you,
you just feel lost.

769
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,318
Having Tallahassee around
didn't comfort me...

770
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,153
...it just made me feel more alone.

771
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:42,032
Hey. You weren't exactly
gonna score, anyway.

772
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,619
You know, you weren't storming
the trenches before I came along.

773
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:50,833
That's why I don't let people close.
You only get burned.

774
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,042
You don't say.

775
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:55,671
Mexico.

776
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,425
You know what they call Twinkies
in Mexico?

777
01:05:00,051 --> 01:05:04,263
- That's where I'm headed, amigo.
- Whatever.

778
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:00,819
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

779
01:06:00,987 --> 01:06:02,821
- This is really fun. Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

780
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:29,723
Oh, no.

781
01:06:32,936 --> 01:06:34,436
I'm going after Wichita.

782
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:38,148
Look, you ever read that book
She's Just Not That Into You?

783
01:06:38,316 --> 01:06:40,275
You can't make yourself
too available.

784
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:43,112
I don't care, all right?
I wanna be with her.

785
01:06:43,488 --> 01:06:45,739
Have fun in Mexico.

786
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:52,454
Come on. Hurry.

787
01:06:56,668 --> 01:06:57,876
Get in.

788
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,971
Come on, go.

789
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:11,807
Go, go.

790
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:28,782
On the count of three.
One, two, three.

791
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:46,216
You okay? Come on.
Hurry, get up.

792
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:47,593
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

793
01:07:53,516 --> 01:07:55,309
There.

794
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:18,248
I'm not great at farewells, so...

795
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:21,084
...that'll do, pig.

796
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:24,087
That's the worst goodbye
I've ever heard...

797
01:08:24,255 --> 01:08:26,381
...and you stole it from a movie.

798
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:31,720
Tell the ladies I said hey.

799
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:34,473
You know, their pictures
were in someone's wallet too.

800
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,917
Hop in the car, Evel Knievel.

801
01:09:02,377 --> 01:09:06,255
- Let's go ride the roller coaster.
- Thanks.

802
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:17,933
Go!

803
01:10:17,869 --> 01:10:19,369
Not as fun as I remember.

804
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:27,461
Shoot the control box.

805
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:01,203
- Columbus?
- Tallahassee?

806
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:05,958
I think they might actually
require our assistance this time.

807
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:09,878
- Buckle up.
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of you.

808
01:11:11,589 --> 01:11:14,091
Time to nut up or shut up.

809
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:20,055
Holy shit.

810
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:46,456
My mama always told me
someday I'd be good at something.

811
01:11:46,624 --> 01:11:49,084
Who'd have guessed
that would be zombie killing?

812
01:11:49,252 --> 01:11:50,252
Probably nobody.

813
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:53,422
Look.

814
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:58,844
We better start working
on our apology.

815
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:15,944
Oh, no. No.

816
01:12:23,202 --> 01:12:24,286
- Hey!
- Hey!

817
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:25,787
- Hey! Ohio!
- Over here!

818
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:27,956
- Hey! Help!
- Help!

819
01:12:28,124 --> 01:12:30,625
- Oh, my God.
- Help!

820
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:32,210
Hey!

821
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:34,296
Help!

822
01:12:34,464 --> 01:12:37,632
- Hey, they're up there. They're okay.
- What are you waiting for?

823
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,842
That's your gal.

824
01:12:40,845 --> 01:12:42,095
- Over here!
- Help!

825
01:12:44,807 --> 01:12:48,310
Come on!
Come get a piece of Tallahassee!

826
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:50,479
Anybody hungry?

827
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:55,317
Tallahassee's nice this time of year!
Come on!

828
01:12:55,485 --> 01:12:58,028
Come on, you ugly bastards!

829
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:21,009
Holy shit.

830
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:22,886
Hey!

831
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:49,538
Motherfucker!

832
01:14:21,237 --> 01:14:23,488
Shit. I'm out of shells.

833
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:28,410
Bingo.

834
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:38,295
Yeah!

835
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:40,463
Oh, yeah.

836
01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:52,142
Here we go.

837
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:25,420
Oh, shit.

838
01:17:26,672 --> 01:17:29,466
- Wichita! Little Rock!
- Hurry!

839
01:17:32,595 --> 01:17:34,679
Oh, my God.

840
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:36,973
Look at this fucking clown.

841
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,979
Of course. It had to be a clown.

842
01:17:43,147 --> 01:17:45,106
Fuck.

843
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:49,944
No, it had to be a clown,
and it had to be Wichita...

844
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:51,946
...for me to finally understand...

845
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:55,367
...that some rules
are made to be broken.

846
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:00,622
Time to nut up or shut up.

847
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:07,045
Fuck this clown.

848
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:52,757
- Thanks.
- Hey.

849
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:56,177
Get your gun. Here you go. Hi.

850
01:18:56,679 --> 01:18:57,887
Okay.

851
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:09,065
Krista.

852
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:46,144
Okay. We should probably
head out now.

853
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:52,942
Finally got to first base.

854
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:56,404
Not bad for that scrawny
little spit-fuck.

855
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:05,788
Where's Florida?

856
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,085
I have a little hunch.

857
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:16,591
Where are you, you spongy,
yellow, delicious bastards?

858
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:18,259
- Where are you?
- Yo.

859
01:20:23,265 --> 01:20:25,266
False advertising.

860
01:20:28,854 --> 01:20:30,271
Jesus Christ.

861
01:20:31,941 --> 01:20:33,775
You want a Sno Ball or something?

862
01:21:00,678 --> 01:21:02,971
Oh, God.

863
01:21:08,978 --> 01:21:11,980
Words cannot express.

864
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:13,648
It's too soon.

865
01:21:13,816 --> 01:21:17,819
Do you think you could maybe just pick
out the buckshot and eat around it?

866
01:21:17,987 --> 01:21:20,530
Okay, yeah.

867
01:21:21,407 --> 01:21:23,324
No!

868
01:21:23,492 --> 01:21:25,910
- No!
- No!

869
01:21:28,664 --> 01:21:29,872
That face?

870
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:33,376
That's me realizing that those smart
girls in that big black truck...

871
01:21:34,837 --> 01:21:37,505
...and that big guy
in that snakeskin jacket...

872
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:40,425
...they were the closest to
something I'd always wanted...

873
01:21:40,593 --> 01:21:41,884
...but never really had.

874
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:44,012
A family.

875
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:46,889
I trusted them and they trusted me.

876
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:52,895
Rule number 32:
Enjoy the little things.

877
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:56,107
Tallahassee got his Twinkie.

878
01:21:56,275 --> 01:22:00,445
And even though life would never
be simple or innocent again...

879
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:03,781
...as he savored that spongy,
yellow log of cream...

880
01:22:03,949 --> 01:22:06,659
...we had hope. We had each other.

881
01:22:08,037 --> 01:22:12,582
And without other people, well,
you might as well be a zombie.

882
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,584
- Thank you so much.
- You had us going.

883
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:16,586
Yeah.

884
01:22:18,589 --> 01:22:20,214
That was very funny.

885
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:21,883
So until next time, remember:

886
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:25,053
Cardio, seat belts, and this
has nothing to do with anything...

887
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,889
...but a little sunscreen
never hurt anybody.

888
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:34,395
I'm Columbus, Ohio, from
Zombieland, saying good night.

889
01:26:58,368 --> 01:27:03,497
In the words of the immortal
Jean-Paul Sartre...

890
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:11,547
In the... In the immortal...
How do you do it?

891
01:27:11,715 --> 01:27:13,049
Just give me a little hint.

892
01:27:13,216 --> 01:27:19,722
In the words of the immortal
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre...

893
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:22,683
...au revoir, gopher.

894
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:23,976
Okay.

895
01:27:24,305 --> 01:28:24,383

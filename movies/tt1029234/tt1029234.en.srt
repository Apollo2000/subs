2
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,124
Is it on?
- Whenever you want.

3
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:17,486
We're right in the middle of
the industrial site of Chamfors.

4
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:21,516
This is where they found the child.

5
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,359
Building 1.

6
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,484
We've got permission
to make this movie.

7
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:31,445
As a medical archive
in favor

8
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:34,041
of the pediatric ward
of the hospital.

9
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:39,201
There you go.

10
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,160
She lived there.

11
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,435
She wasn't raped,
that's for sure.

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,838
It looks more
like common abuse.

13
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:55,319
Malnutrition, dehydration,
mild hypothermia.

14
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:59,716
The hole allows the person to
do one's needs without standing up.

15
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,879
The infection of the wrists proves
she was chained.

16
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:06,037
How did she get out of here?

17
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,118
Lucie doesn't tell a thing
about what she went through.

18
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,116
What's that? Orange juice?
- Yes.

19
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:03,198
Is it for her?
- Yes.

20
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,518
You're a real mom.
- She's got no-one else.

21
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,966
Don't worry, Anna,
those gentlemen

22
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:59,319
are really nice.
- Okay.

23
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,677
Do you know why we
show you this movie?

24
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:03,962
Yes.

25
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:08,077
Why do we need you?
- Because...

26
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,319
you want to get the people

27
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:14,365
who hurt Lucie.
- Yes, Anna.

28
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,325
Lucie wants that too.
She says they have to get caught.

29
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,923
What else did she say?
You talk to her for hours...

30
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,315
She's afraid.

31
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,320
Does she tell you things?
- She's afraid.

32
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,438
What does she remember?

33
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,757
She doesn't know who it is.

34
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:33,124
Sometimes she thinks she remembers something,
sometimes she doesn't.

35
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:38,438
What do you think?
Do you think she will remember?

36
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:42,998
It was dark and she didn't see it well.
She doesn't remember.

37
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,082
Enter.

38
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,723
Lucie Jurin didn't come.

39
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:05,961
Lucie?

40
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:27,723
Anna,

41
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,605
Don't tell, aye?

42
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,920
I won't.
- It's not me,

43
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:37,642
it's not me,

44
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,366
it's not me.

45
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,475
Calm down.

46
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,999
Do you want to come?

47
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,562
Anna?

48
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,637
15 YEARS LATER

49
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,235
Give it to me!

50
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:30,802
Give it to me!

51
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,084
Stop, both of you.

52
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:37,602
Damned!

53
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:41,282
You'll see how poorly she writes.

54
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,562
Stop, I said.
- You're the worst!

55
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:49,075
Don't touch me.
By the way, it's none of your business.

56
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,642
What do you know?
You don't know what love is.

57
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,525
You don't have a boyfriend.

58
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,406
And? Are we gonna eat breakfast or not?
- Yeah, yeah.

59
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,882
You're getting on my nerves.

60
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,446
I hate you.

61
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,040
CHAMPION 100 METRES BUTTERFLY

62
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,199
And you talk about it like that?

63
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:24,762
How should I talk about it?
- Smartass...

64
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:28,158
A Sunday morning.
Did you talk about it with your mother?

65
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,558
Yes.
- And what did you say?

66
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,565
That she had problems with the pressure.

67
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,558
If she works, she ain't happy.
- Are you happy?

68
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm having fun.
- I'm having fun.

69
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,645
Done.
- Good.

70
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:45,196
Here.

71
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,598
A gift.

72
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:51,002
Damned, Gairielle.
- Gross!

73
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,000
In the main pipe?

74
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,403
There's you shower
that doesn't run like it should.

75
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,838
Gross.
- Come on. Let's eat.

76
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,356
Yeah, I'm being gross,
but now we can use the garden again.

77
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,678
Did Antoine talk
about his big projects?

78
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,044
I asked what you thought of them.

79
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:13,400
No, you wondered if she was pissed off.
- Don't start. It's none of your business.

80
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,884
It's my brother.
- Your brother's a dreamer.

81
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,001
Hey, Antoine?

82
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,079
You can't leave a school
that costs that much after 3 months.

83
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,198
Definitely not if you pay in advance.
- There you go.

84
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,440
Stop it, you!
- She's always bragging since the newspaper article.

85
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,475
Are you gonna do it every time?
- What?

86
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,725
Even for your graduation
we had to pay a private school.

87
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,077
With a lot of effort.
- I did graduate.

88
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:41,246
Thank God. Did you know
how much it cost?

89
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,604
Your money, for the trimesters.
To hear you didn't care at all.

90
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,918
Really, Antoine, isn't it hard
to be so irritating?

91
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,562
That school... it's not the same.

92
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,438
I wanted to do something I liked.

93
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,326
We didn't force you.
- No, but...

94
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:59,959
law school, it's not my thing.
- You can get anywhere with it.

95
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,119
That's not the point.
He wants to live with his girlfriend.

96
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,080
Law school, it's not my thing.
- Whatever, Antoine,

97
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:09,956
there's nothing you like.
Once you even wanted to become a baker.

98
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:13,881
That's unheard of.

99
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,721
Who's the butthole?

100
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:21,440
Be friendly, Marie Belfond.
- It's Sunday.

101
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:24,679
So? Why do you need to rest on Sunday?

102
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:26,485
Your week in the factory?

103
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,804
Stay there. Don't move!

104
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,201
Don't move!

105
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:56,040
Sit down!

106
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,280
How old are you?

107
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,280
Eighteen.

108
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:13,164
Do you know what your parents did?

109
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,598
Why did you do that to me?

110
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:55,077
Why did you do that to me?

111
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:03,439
Why?

112
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,719
It's them.
- Lucie?

113
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,923
It's them, Anna.
- Did you see them?

114
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,277
They changed, but it's definitely them.
- Are you sure?

115
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,642
I'm telling you.
- Lucie, it's been 15 years.

116
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,679
And you find them in a paper?
- I'm telling you.

117
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:56,925
We'll call the police
- Don't bother.

118
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,686
What?
- I did what I needed to do

119
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,844
What did you do?
- What I needed to do!

120
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:03,441
You had to observe them. You weren't sure.
- I'm sure.

121
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:07,316
I knew I had to come along
- Why don't you believe me?

122
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:11,635
Where are you calling from?

123
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,398
From the house.
- From theirs?

124
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,042
Yes.
- Give me the address.

125
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,281
Lucie, give me the address!

126
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:26,996
I did it...

127
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:43,716
Look,

128
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,560
I did it...

129
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,285
It's me, Lucie. It's me.
Calm down. It's me.

130
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:03,926
She's there.

131
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:14,122
She's in the house.
- I know

132
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:16,603
She hurt me more than before.

133
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:34,795
Stay here.

134
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,235
Where are you going?

135
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,557
I have to go take a look.
- She's there.

136
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,524
I have to go take a look.
- She's in the house.

137
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:44,439
Look at me, I have to go take a look.
Wait for me.

138
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:59,279
She hurt me more than before.
- I'm coming, Lucie.

139
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:04,164
What am I going to do?

140
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:06,966
I'm coming.

141
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,117
I don't have any more shells.
- You won't be needing them.

142
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:52,478
Why don't we leave?
- Come.

143
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,166
She'll come back.

144
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:55,802
Come.

145
00:23:57,087 --> 00:24:00,079
You called me from here
Everyone will know it's us.

146
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:03,197
I don't care.
- Yes.

147
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:07,359
I don't care.
- Sitting in a cell. You DO care.

148
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,162
What are we going to do?
- Don't move.

149
00:24:18,447 --> 00:24:20,199
It hurts.
- Sorry.

150
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:25,758
What are we gonna do, Anna?

151
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:08,476
Are you okay?

152
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:17,396
Are you repulsed? By what I did?

153
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:21,965
Do you smell this?

154
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:23,880
That foul stench?

155
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:27,596
I smelled that every time
she bent over my. All days.

156
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,201
Do you understand?

157
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,636
When she hit me, I smelled that.

158
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:42,403
Look.

159
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,196
It's them.

160
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,000
What are you doing?

161
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:29,683
Do you think I'm gonna get out of this?

162
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:35,282
Yes. Yes.

163
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:52,156
Please, don't make a sound.

164
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:00,526
Anna, what are you doing?

165
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:04,475
Are you okay?
- Yes.

166
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,486
I called..
- I was there.

167
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,717
I thought she came back.
- No.

168
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:11,077
Are you ready? We're leaving.

169
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,283
We're gonna clean the house
- Are we leaving?

170
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,000
Get dressed.

171
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:51,842
Lucie!

172
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,723
Open up, Anna.
- It's closed, Lucie.

173
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:24,237
Open up!

174
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,642
Quick!

175
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,645
What do you want?

176
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,125
Leave me alone.

177
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:20,601
I killed them!

178
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:24,318
Even the children!

179
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:26,762
I even killed the children!

180
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,117
Calm down! Calm down!

181
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,000
Get away from there, whore!

182
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm gonna kill you!

183
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:05,596
Sorry.

184
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:08,476
It's not my fault.

185
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:05,361
Where are you?

186
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,043
Anna, I know you're in there.
Open up!

187
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,806
I'm coming.

188
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:39,882
What's your name?

189
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:41,596
Gabrielle...

190
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:44,959
I'm coming, Lucie!

191
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,039
You have to help me, Gairielle.

192
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:49,602
Why did she do that?

193
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,004
I think she heard us.

194
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,925
It has to go fast.

195
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:35,717
An ambulance.
- I can't.

196
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,559
For my kids...

197
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,083
Come on!

198
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:42,885
Right up to the forest.
After that you're on your own, okay?

199
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,835
No! Stop!

200
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,441
Stop! Lucie!

201
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:33,799
Why did you defend her?

202
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:38,163
She didn't do anything, Lucie.
- She hurt me!

203
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:39,802
To me!

204
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,879
Do you want her to live?

205
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:13,640
You never believed me!

206
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:15,716
Stop!

207
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:20,358
You think I'm crazy.
Like the others. Like the doctors.

208
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:25,925
What did they do for me?

209
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,555
Apart from saying I'm crazy?
And you're like them?

210
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,205
It's over, Anna!

211
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:56,082
They're dead.
They won't hurt you again.

212
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:33,438
Stop!

213
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,485
No!

214
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:45,758
Why are you calling me? Aye?

215
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:49,642
I don't hear a thing from you
for two years, and then you call me.

216
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:52,037
Yes.
- I'm angry at you, Anna.

217
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:54,277
I'm not gonna fake.
- Mom.

218
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:56,563
What do you want?
Make me feel guilty?

219
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:57,876
No.

220
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:01,523
Don't you think I feel like that?
Don't you think I'm not thinking about

221
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:04,201
all the things that I've been missing out on?

222
00:44:05,127 --> 00:44:08,119
No, mom, that's not it.
- What is it then?

223
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,481
I wanted to speak you, that's all.
I wasn't thinking.

224
00:44:11,687 --> 00:44:14,679
Like that. On a day
you decide you're missing your mother.

225
00:44:15,247 --> 00:44:19,081
Are you doing fine, you got not problems?
- No.

226
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:20,566
Are you sure? Where are you?

227
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:22,355
Far away.

228
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,004
Where do you sleep? How do you make a living?

229
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,921
It's okay, mom.
- Are you still with her? Is she influencing you?

230
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:31,963
No.

231
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,561
My God! You're still with her.

232
00:44:34,727 --> 00:44:36,524
It's still the same.
- Mom...

233
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:41,079
Anna, she's worthless, she's a slut.

234
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:44,643
She's worth less than nothing.
Don't stay with her.

235
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:46,962
Anna?

236
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:48,676
Aren't you saying anything?

237
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,635
Don't move.

238
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:05,079
I can't take care of you.

239
00:51:35,649 --> 00:51:37,128
Don't be afraid..

240
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:39,081
Calm down.

241
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:03,295
Calm down.

242
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,338
Rest.

243
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:40,690
Sorry.

244
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:46,336
Sorry.

245
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:46,897
Stop!

246
00:55:48,234 --> 00:55:49,906
Who's the girl on the couch?

247
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:51,828
Who is it?

248
00:55:52,835 --> 00:55:54,234
Lucie...

249
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:57,314
Lucie who?
- Lucie Jurin.

250
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:58,710
And you?

251
00:56:00,475 --> 00:56:01,794
And?

252
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:03,270
Anna Assaoui.

253
00:56:03,836 --> 00:56:06,873
We're trying to reach the Belfonds for hours.
The phone's been busy.

254
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:09,596
The phone's off the hook.
- That should not be happening.

255
00:56:10,396 --> 00:56:12,513
Can you tell me what's happening here?

256
00:56:15,277 --> 00:56:17,029
What are you doing here?

257
00:58:43,572 --> 00:58:46,803
Lucie Jurin escaped 15 years ago,
isn't it?

258
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:49,767
Isn't it?

259
00:58:51,213 --> 00:58:52,407
Yes.

260
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:56,288
It was a time
in which we were less organised.

261
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:59,849
Gabrielle shouldn't have let
it happen. The girl found her.

262
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:03,969
After 15 years.
That's shows a lot of persistence.

263
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:07,171
But in the end
Lucie is a victim.

264
00:59:07,894 --> 00:59:09,691
Like all the others.

265
00:59:10,855 --> 00:59:14,609
It's easy to create
a victim. Very easy.

266
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:20,007
Lock someone up in a dark place.
He starts to suffer.

267
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:22,646
Feed that suffering.

268
00:59:22,936 --> 00:59:25,814
Methodically, systematic.

269
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:28,690
And cold. And keep it going.

270
00:59:29,576 --> 00:59:33,411
The subjects goes through
different stages.

271
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,371
After a while the trauma,

272
00:59:37,217 --> 00:59:39,811
that little crack
that happens so easily,

273
00:59:40,097 --> 00:59:43,408
make it see things that aren't there.

274
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:46,727
What did poor Lucie see?

275
00:59:48,778 --> 00:59:50,258
Didn't she see things?

276
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:52,971
Not even monsters?

277
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:56,369
Things that wanted to hurt her?

278
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:00,008
A dead girl.

279
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,139
There you go.

280
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,774
A dead girl.

281
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:09,410
The girl you found. Sarah Dutreuil.
She saw insects. Cockroaches, everywhere.

282
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,091
They we're crawling over her. She had rather
chopped off her arm then to go through that.

283
01:00:13,381 --> 01:00:16,134
People don't want to suffer anymore.

284
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:19,658
The world has come to a point

285
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,658
that there are only victims left.

286
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,778
Martyrs are rare.

287
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,859
A martyr, that's something else...

288
01:00:31,343 --> 01:00:33,413
A martyrs is
an exceptional being.

289
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:36,740
It survives suffering,
the lacking of everything.

290
01:00:37,023 --> 01:00:39,491
We burden it with
all the evil of the world,

291
01:00:39,663 --> 01:00:43,418
and he transcends himself.

292
01:00:43,584 --> 01:00:47,293
Do you understand that?
He changes shapes..

293
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,658
Longsheng, 1912.

294
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,217
That women doesn't believe in God.

295
01:00:57,385 --> 01:01:00,458
She tried to steal a chicken.
And she pays a high price.

296
01:01:00,826 --> 01:01:04,535
On the moment the picture was taken,
she's still alive. Look at her eyes.

297
01:01:07,786 --> 01:01:09,664
Jouans-Lussac, 1945.

298
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:12,261
That woman is a grocer.
She slept with a German.

299
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:14,941
Back then the French were sensitive.
She had to pay.

300
01:01:15,707 --> 01:01:18,665
She's still alive. Look at her eyes.

301
01:01:19,988 --> 01:01:23,458
Central Hospital of Birmingham, 1960.

302
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:26,708
The atheistic housekeeper
without a story

303
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:29,747
was terminally ill
and the morphine had no effect anymore.

304
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:31,748
Look at her eyes.

305
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:35,261
This one was beaten up by her husband.
Jealousy...

306
01:01:35,549 --> 01:01:37,699
This one just spent 9 hours
in the wreckage of her car.

307
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:40,788
This young leukemia patient
is dying. The pains gnawing.

308
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:45,063
This woman has a rare disease.
She suffered for nine hours.

309
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,147
Look at their eyes. Look.

310
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,667
All of them. Do you hear me?

311
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:53,623
They were all alive
when these pictures were taken.

312
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,789
So tell me again
that the idea of a martyr

313
01:01:57,071 --> 01:01:58,982
is an invention of
the religious world!

314
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:01,222
We've tried everything.
Even children.

315
01:02:01,512 --> 01:02:03,946
It's proven that women

316
01:02:05,072 --> 01:02:07,745
are more sensitive for
a transformation.

317
01:02:09,153 --> 01:02:10,825
Young women.

318
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:13,502
It is that way.

319
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:26,354
Anna?

320
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:28,514
Are you there?

321
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,473
I'm here.

322
01:16:30,639 --> 01:16:33,108
Anna?
- Yes, Lucie.

323
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,676
Why are you never afraid?

324
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,398
Sometimes I'm afraid.

325
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,033
Not like me.

326
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,151
I didn't go through what you the same things.

327
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:44,837
What do you have to do
to stop being afraid?

328
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:47,232
I think you have to let yourself go.

329
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:49,194
Do you think so?

330
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,034
Let oneself go.

331
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:54,552
If I can't do it,
will you be there for me?

332
01:16:54,722 --> 01:16:55,598
Yes.

333
01:16:55,762 --> 01:16:57,354
I miss you.

334
01:18:28,931 --> 01:18:31,320
You're not afraid anymore, Anna.

335
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:38,810
You're not afraid anymore, Anna.

336
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:44,972
You're not afraid anymore.

337
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:17,288
It will be okay, Anna.

338
01:19:17,696 --> 01:19:19,175
It will be okay.

339
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:21,973
The suffering is almost over.

340
01:19:24,297 --> 01:19:25,969
There's one stage left.

341
01:19:26,897 --> 01:19:28,216
The last one.

342
01:19:28,937 --> 01:19:32,647
It will be okay.
You don't have to defend yourself anymore.

343
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:34,297
It's okay, Anna.

344
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:24,997
Is she persevering?
It's amazing.

345
01:23:58,884 --> 01:24:01,194
Michel!
- What is it?

346
01:24:10,686 --> 01:24:12,802
Now. I went to feed her.
A few minutes ago.

347
01:24:12,966 --> 01:24:15,241
Are you sure?
- Like I said,

348
01:24:15,526 --> 01:24:17,756
I never saw an expression like that.

349
01:24:17,926 --> 01:24:21,840
She's liberated. Completely liberated.
Here face is like...

350
01:24:22,007 --> 01:24:24,521
Miss, her eyes...

351
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:27,281
She doesn't she
what's happening around her.

352
01:24:27,447 --> 01:24:30,599
But is she still...
- She's still alive.

353
01:27:18,145 --> 01:27:19,737
Did you see it?

354
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,502
The other world?

355
01:28:53,434 --> 01:28:56,790
Yesterday, in the afternoon,

356
01:28:57,395 --> 01:28:59,704
around 12.15,

357
01:28:59,995 --> 01:29:02,384
Anna Assaoui was martyred.

358
01:29:03,075 --> 01:29:06,624
I ask you with the utmost respect
to think of her.

359
01:29:07,396 --> 01:29:10,035
Anna Assaoui
is an exceptional being.

360
01:29:10,436 --> 01:29:12,506
In the 17 years
of trying

361
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:15,788
she's only the fourth
to reach this stage.

362
01:29:16,076 --> 01:29:19,353
And the first, yes, the first...

363
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:22,589
to make notion
of what she has seen.

364
01:29:22,877 --> 01:29:25,949
Between 12.15 en 14.30

365
01:29:26,237 --> 01:29:29,435
Miss Assaoui has clearly
seen what comes after death.

366
01:29:29,918 --> 01:29:31,192
You heard well.

367
01:29:31,478 --> 01:29:34,754
Her ecstatic state
lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes.

368
01:29:34,918 --> 01:29:38,195
It was not a near
death experience.

369
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:40,913
What she experienced,
was an authentic martyrdom.

370
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,508
At 14.30 she left that state.

371
01:29:44,199 --> 01:29:46,919
And at 15.05 she spoke.

372
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,073
At this moment she is still alive.

373
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,232
But she isn't talking anymore.

374
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,557
Miss heard her testimony.

375
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,435
That testimony, my dear friends,

376
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:00,956
will be shared in a few moments.

377
01:30:11,162 --> 01:30:12,390
Miss,

378
01:30:12,922 --> 01:30:14,560
they are waiting.

379
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:17,153
I'm coming, Etienne.

380
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,633
So there IS something?

381
01:30:24,963 --> 01:30:26,556
Off course.

382
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:29,083
Was it clear?

383
01:30:31,604 --> 01:30:33,083
Very clear.

384
01:30:34,204 --> 01:30:35,603
And precise?

385
01:30:37,485 --> 01:30:40,716
There as no room
for interpretation, Etienne.

386
01:30:43,365 --> 01:30:45,083
Thank you, Miss.

387
01:30:52,446 --> 01:30:53,356
Etienne?

388
01:30:56,126 --> 01:30:57,526
Miss?

389
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:01,484
Could you imagine
what comes after death?

390
01:31:02,287 --> 01:31:03,879
Are you okay?

391
01:31:06,088 --> 01:31:08,477
Could you?
- No, I...

392
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:12,117
Keep doubting, Etienne.

393
01:31:13,305 --> 01:32:13,909

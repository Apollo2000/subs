FEMALE NARRATOR:
It's hard to remember now,

2
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,421
but Europe was like this in 1944.

3
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:55,513
The Second World War was in its fifth year
and still going Hitler's way.

4
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,267
German troops controIIed most of Europe.

5
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,146
D-day changed all that.

6
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:09,402
D-day, June 6th, 1944.

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,820
When the aIIied forces,

8
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,322
under their commander,
General Eisenhower,

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,159
landed on the northern coast of France.

10
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,996
By July, they were able
to begin their own offensive.

11
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,999
By August, Paris was liberated.

12
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,628
Everywhere the Germans retreated.

13
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,341
But with the allied victories
came problems.

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,344
Supplies still had to be
driven from Normandy,

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,180
over 400 miles away,

16
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,474
and became dangerously short.

17
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,310
The allied advance began
to come to a halt.

18
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,857
Another problem facing
Eisenhower was this.

19
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,318
His two most famous generals,

20
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,821
Patton, who was in the south,
and Montgomery in the north,

21
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,199
disliked each other intensely.

22
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,495
Their long-standing rivalry
had never been more fierce.

23
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,540
There simply were not enough
supplies for both armies.

24
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,877
Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.

25
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,797
Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin.

26
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,925
ln September 1944,

27
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,178
Montgomery devised
a new and spectacular plan

28
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,806
given the code name Market Garden.

29
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,601
Eisenhower,
under great pressure from his superiors,

30
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,812
finally sided with Montgomery,

31
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,232
and operation Market Garden
became a reality.

32
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,901

00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,591
Well, now let's get down to the details.

166
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,801
Firstly, of course,
we should have to have a high level...

167
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,261
(lN GERMAN)

168
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,680
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

169
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,723
Montgomery or Patton?

170
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,477
-Model, what do you think?
-Patton.

171
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,313
He is their best.

172
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,316
Patton will lead the assault.

173
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,944
l would prefer Montgomery...

174
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,114
but even Eisenhower
isn't that stupid.

175
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:15,163
Bittrich's Panzer troops
need some rest...

176
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,417
if they're to stop Patton.

177
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,670
We should pull them back
somewhere safe.

178
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,464
Safe, quiet, out of the way.
But where?

179
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,217
Arnhem?

180
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,015
Arnhem.

181
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,643
-l'll be in touch.
-That'll be fine.

182
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,605
General, be safe.

183
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,025
HARRY: Why the emergency meeting?

184
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,569
Just keeping me abreast
of the little changes.

185
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,112
How big are the little changes?

186
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,407
l'll answer with typical
British understatement. Gigantic.

187
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,659
For example, they can't
get us all in at once.

188
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,287
Too many men, too much equipment,
not enough planes.

189
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,789
lt's going to take
three days to get the men into Arnhem,

190
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,499
Poles and the British.

191
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,126
How about us?

192
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,171
We'll be all right. Aside from the fact
that we're parachuting in daylight,

193
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,048
we have nothing to worry about.

194
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,551
Daylight? Has it ever been tried before?

195
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,637
Not in a major drop.

196
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,513
You think there might be
a reason for that?

197
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,890
Let's hope not.

198
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,350
What do you think?

199
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,728
lt'll be all right. lt's a no-moon period
anyway. We have to go in daylight.

200
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,564
lt doesn't matter.
Just so they get us over the target area.

201
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,275
Half a mile away,
three quarters of a mile, l'll settle for that.

202
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,527
l don't want to hear anything else.

203
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,404
ls there anything else?

204
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,740
Well, you're my Dutch adviser, Harry.

205
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,742
l forgot to tell you something?

206
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,787
Only that the Germans first tried to take
Nijmegen Bridge themselves

207
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,665
back in 1 940 and got slaughtered.

208
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,295
(SENTRY lN DUTCH)

209
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,759
Go back!

210
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,388
Do as l say!

211
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,308
But my friend lives down the road.

212
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,270
lt's my birthday
and she has a present for me.

213
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,898
Please let me through.

214
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,200
All right. Be quick.

215
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,130
Are your sure about the colors?

216
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,757
l'm sure, Father.
Believe me.

217
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,178
Model?

218
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,558
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

219
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,978
The British will have an explanation.

220
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,980
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

221
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,024
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

222
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,987
You're a good boy
and a wonderful spy.

223
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,364
Now go and help
your mother with supper.

224
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,203
Sir?

225
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,122
Yes, Fuller?

226
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,499
-We've got some information on tanks, sir.
-What?

227
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,752
Dutch underground reports
from the Arnhem area.

228
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,295
Established their strength?

229
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,173
-No, sir, but l've got some men in...
-Have they been identified?

230
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,299
Not by our intelligence.

231
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,718
So it's the same rumors as before, right?

232
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,928
-l believe these rumors, sir.
-Why?

233
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,015
The general consensus
of opinion is that our opposition

234
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,768
will consist entirely
of Hitler Youth or old men on bicycles.

235
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,561
l don't really know why, sir.

236
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,355
Perhaps because no one
in intelligence does.

237
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:31,151
l just want to be sure
our airborne carpet consists of live troops,

238
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,569
not dead ones.

239
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,490
l know everybody thinks
l'm overanxious, sir,

240
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,283
but l would like to order another

241
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,243
low-level reconnaissance of the area.

242
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,121
(STAMMERlNG)
lf that's all right with you, sir.

243
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,333
Very well.

244
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,127
-All right, Wilson.
-Sir.

245
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,295
Very well.

246
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,381
-Oh, Fuller. Fuller.
-Yeah. Sir?

247
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,177
l wouldn't be too concerned about
what people think of you.

248
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,639
You happen to be somewhat
brighter than most of us.

249
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,266
Tends to make us nervous.

250
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,240
Naturally we'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements, sir,

251
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,200
but please keep in mind

252
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,245
the one factor which is
crippling all our plans.

253
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,539
lt may seem improbable to you,

254
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,750
but we are desperately short
of transport aircraft.

255
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,085
l am aware of that.

256
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,170
ln fact, l'm surprised
that nobody mentioned it to Monty

257
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,381
when he dreamed up this operation.

258
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,717
l need drop zones
as close as possible to the bridge.

259
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,845
Now clearly this area's no use at all.

260
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,806
Can't have my chaps
landing on the top of chimneys, but...

261
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,766
Now this looks inviting here.

262
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,352
-ROY: What's the terrain like?
-Sorry, sir.

263
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,273
All our reports indicate that this
terrain here is too soft for glider landings.

264
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,024
You see the nose digs in
first on touchdown,

265
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,401
the whole thing goes ass over tip.

266
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,819
Total write-off.

267
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,487
All right.

268
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,323
-What about there?
-No. l'm afraid not, sir.

269
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,451
You see, after the drop,
when we bank for our return,

270
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,580
we run into a whole lot
of flak and rubbish from this Jerry air field

271
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,206
up here at Deelen.

272
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,418
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere.

273
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,713
Oh, yes, hopefully, sir,

274
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,548
but, as l was saying,

275
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,759
we cannot afford to lose a single aircraft.

276
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,303
That is the problem.

277
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,890
My problem is
l don't just need drop zones.

278
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,976
l need drop zones l can hold and defend.

279
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,605
The rest of my division
arrives with the second drop

280
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,065
and General Sosabowski's
Polish brigade with the third.

281
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,483
l understand, sir.

282
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,944
But we really think
we found the right place.

283
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,072
lt's large enough
for your needs, it's flat and firm,

284
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,199
and also easily defended.

285
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:44,659
Well, where the hell is it?

286
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,537
Well, it's not actually
on this photograph, but,

287
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,873
it should be... Excuse me, sir.

288
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,251
lt would be, about here, l think.

289
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,173
That could be 1 0 miles from the bridge.

290
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,674
No, just under eight, actually, sir.

291
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,968
lf you'd like to have a look at this.

292
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,349
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.

293
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,186
All our information substantiates that...

294
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,563
Yes, sir?

295
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,692
Just making sure whose side you're on.

296
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,496
Now a drop zone eight miles
from Arnhem Bridge

297
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,999
might be thought by some
to present problems.

298
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,792
(WHlSPERlNG) My God. He can't mean it.

299
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,212
l'm afraid he does.
He must know what he's doing.

300
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,089
That's more than l know.

301
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,216
Why should he have
the corner of the market?

302
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,343
...cannot under
any stretch of the imagination

303
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,429
be considered ideal,

304
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,349
but the gliders will be bringing in
a reconnaissance squadron ofjeeps

305
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,144
specially fitted with
twin Vickers machine guns.

306
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,271
Now the instant we land,

307
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,065
they will race ahead
to the bridge and hold it

308
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,318
until the other battalions arrive on foot.

309
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,071
And they'll be quick enough to secure
both ends ofArnhem Bridge?

310
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,114
Most certainly.

311
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,783
Good, good.
Now if you all know where l shall be.

312
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,286
My headquarters will be
in the center with 82nd.

313
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,955
Nowjust you remember
that we're all totally interlocked.

314
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,249
This is a bottom to top operation.

315
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,586
1 01 st pass XXX Corps on to 82nd.

316
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,005
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.

317
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,051
lf any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

318
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,637
All we need now

319
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,140
are three days of clear skies.

320
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,225
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

321
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,937
Only the weather can stop us now.

322
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,814

324
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,113
General Browning, what of the Germans?

325
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,658
Don't you think that since we know that
Arnhem is so crucial to their safety,

326
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,160
they might know that, too?

327
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,536
BROWNlNG: Now, look here.

328
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:38,374
The few troops
in the area are second class.

329
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,627
They're not frontline caliber,

330
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,836
not at all.

331
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,588
Do you understand?

332
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,590
l think you ought to
have a little more faith

333
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,383
in Montgomery's
intelligence reports, you know.

334
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,928
He's done pretty well
for us in last three or four years.

335
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,347
l will tell you the extent of my faith.

336
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,892
l am thinking of asking
for a letter from you

337
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,812
stating that l was forced
to act under your orders

338
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,772
in case my men are massacred.

339
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,983
l see.

340
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,113
Yes, l do see.

341
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,202
Do you wish such a letter?

342
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,830
No.

343
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,833
No, of course not.

344
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,043
ln the case of massacre,

345
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,629
what difference would it make?

346
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,809
-You mean you don't believe me, sir?
-STEELE: Well, clearly not.

347
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,436
All right, boys.
NAAFl's up. Take your break.

348
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,773
God almighty.

349
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,316
Sorry about that, sir.

350
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,693
But what, then?

351
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,154
l just don't believe
these damn radios are strong enough

352
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,073
to carry the eight miles
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

353
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,200
Don't happen to have
any cigarettes, do you, sir?

354
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,286
-No.
-They're perfectly okay.

355
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,580
l've used them
God knows how many times.

356
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,124
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.

357
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,377
Well, l didn't have
any problems with them in the desert.

358
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,795
Yes, l know.

359
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,381
You see, Cole, what bothers me,

360
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,925
what genuinely and truly
has me more than a bit disturbed,

361
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,886
is that Holland being half under water,

362
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,097
is somewhat soggier
than most deserts you're apt to find.

-Any biscuits?
-Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

365
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,691
Shouldn't you tell the General if you're
so certain about it, sir?

366
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,776
lf l were, believe me, l would.

367
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,070
What if they really don't work?

368
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,655
Well, what difference will it make?

369
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,283
The General will be
on the bridge himself by nightfall.

370
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,118
He won't have to make contact
with the bridge

371
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,203
if he's on it.

372

Will he, sir?

373
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,456
Well,

it's not gonna be me.

There.

Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.

384
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,948
Wait a moment, sir.
lt's a lot clearer in the next picture.

But, sir, you see that they are tanks.

00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,705

-Still got guns.
-So have we.

Sir, if they weren't serviceable,

396
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,799
why would they try to conceal them?

Normal routine, Fuller.

398
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,887
But, sir, we keep getting reports
from the Dutch underground.

399
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,222
l've read them

400
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,808
and so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

401
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,643
Now look here,

402
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,814
there have been thousands of photographs
from this sortie and from all the others.

How many of them have shown tanks?

404

Just these, sir.

405
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,195

asking us to cancel

mounted since D-day

No, sir.

01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:22,992
All right, here we go.

969
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,042
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

970
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,378
-Mr. Cornish is straight through there.
-Right, thank you.

971
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,215
Hello, Dick.

972
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,675
-Hello, sir.
-lt's all right. Sit down. All right?

973
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,220
-Fine, sir, it's only a flesh wound.
-Oh, good.

974
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,429
How are things?

975
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:45,223
-Not too bad, sir.
-Good.

976
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,893
Well, what is bad, l'm afraid, is this.

977
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,269
-Careful.
-Sorry, sir.

978
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,522
We hold the north end of the bridge,

979
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,940
Germans hold the south.

980
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,734
But now they probably
control most of the town,

981
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:58,528
including the church tower.

982
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,905
So, what you're saying
is that we're surrounded?

983
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:02,698
Yes, something like that.

984
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,826
-Now, what else?
-Sir.

985
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:09,497
l was a bit surprised
to find Bittrich's Panzer troops here, sir.

986
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:21,008
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe
all that nonsense they told us, did you?

987
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:23,219
l mean, about the enemy
being made up of,

988
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:26,305
what was it, old men, children?

989
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,267
l'll have to risk it.

990
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,103
lt's halfway through the morning
and things aren't getting any better.

991
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,437
LATHBURY: Well, Sergeant, how is it?

992
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,690
Sir. We can't clear the street, sir.

993
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,233
Enemy strength keeps increasing

994
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,318
and it's just impossible
to get through to the bridge.

995
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,070
-That's all. Thank you, Sergeant.
-Sir.

996
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,072
Gerald, it's imperative
that l get back to HQ

997
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,949
before the situation
gets completely out of hand.

998
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,325
Well, if it's all right with you, sir,

999
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,578
Cleminson and l will come
part of the way. All right, Jimmy?

1000
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,288
-Let's move.
-Out.

1001

1002

1003

You go. He will be fine.

l would like an explanation.

1022
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:57,475
Yeah, well, l expect the fog
has a certain amount to do with it.

1023
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:00,144
l'm told there are aircraft
flying 50 miles to the south.

and equipment cannot be moved

1025
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,982
from here to there
and then fly to Arnhem?

1026
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,443

whether we like it or not,

1029
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,827
fog, it moves.

1030
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:18,829
Of course, it moves. Where?

1031
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,165
Well, that's very difficult to say, General.

Now, you think you've got it and then it,

1034
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,215
it reverses itself and leaves you behind.

1035
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,093
Won't you please sit down?

1036
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:35,304
What l'm trying to say, General,

1037
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:37,807
is, l mean, even if we move
your troops the 50 miles,

1038
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:40,476
where, l grant you,
just now the sun is shining,

1039
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:42,561
the chances are that
by the time we get there,

1040
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:45,356
the fog could quite easily
have preceded us.

1041
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,150
So we simply have to wait.

1042
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,527
And do nothing?

1043
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:52,029

1285
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:15,569
Good evening, Kate. May l introduce,

1286
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:18,406
Mrs. Ter Horst, Colonel Weaver.

1287
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:21,909
ls your husband not returned?

1288
01:57:22,953 --> 01:57:25,246
He should have been here by now.
He must be having

1289
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:27,915
difficulties coming through
the German lines.

1290
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,459
Well, in that case,

1291
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:33,629
we will have to ask you for a decision.

1292
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:36,298
Colonel Weaver has a request to make.

1293
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:40,970
Well, what we've done is
we've set up a defensive pocket,

1294
01:57:41,513 --> 01:57:45,683
more or less thumb-shaped,
with the river as the base.

1295
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,228
Mrs. Ter Horst speaks
surprisingly good English, Colonel.

1296
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:50,312
Oh.

1297
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:52,648
Well, then you understand
that we're in quite a strong position

1298
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:55,443
for holding out until
XXX Corps reaches us,

1299
01:57:55,819 --> 01:57:58,195
but we have to make
certain arrangements.

1300

The words come through.

1301

the military strategy.

1302

You understand that we have great need
of additional space.

1306
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:25,181
Our house would seem suitable.

1307

lt's just for the slightly wounded.

You know, we'll patch them up,
send them back, that sort of thing.

in continuing this fighting.

are hanging on by their fingernails.

-No.

No, thank you.

the start till 9:00 just to make sure.

Fine. Fine.

1423
02:07:17,588 --> 02:07:20,674
They're gonna get creamed
from the far embankment.

1424

Your smoke screen's gonna be
their only protection.

an extra hour's fun and relaxation.

-Major.
-Yes?

1434
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:55,167
We got any more information
on those boats?

1435
02:07:55,251 --> 02:07:57,627
We're reliably informed that they float.

1436
02:07:58,087 --> 02:08:00,213
Outside of that, we don't know squat.

1437
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:02,966
Not how many,
not how heavy, not how big.

1438
02:08:03,718 --> 02:08:07,387
We are sure that the river is wide
and that the current is strong.

02:08:07,764 --> 02:08:09,890
And as any more
cheery information comes my way,

1440
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:11,516
l'll just be too happy to pass it along.

1441
02:08:11,601 --> 02:08:14,853
ln the meantime,
just think of this as on-the-job training.

1442
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:20,192
What's the matter, no sense of humor?

1443
02:08:22,195 --> 02:08:23,362
God damn it!

1444
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:26,740
We go at noon.

1445
02:08:39,629 --> 02:08:41,797
Come on! Clear it off the road!

1446
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:18,166
You men are probably wondering
why l've called us here together.

1447
02:09:19,627 --> 02:09:23,422
l've reached a decision
that l'd like to share with you all.

1448
02:09:25,258 --> 02:09:27,801
l intend to go across
like George Washington,

1449
02:09:27,844 --> 02:09:29,386
standing on the prow.

1450
02:09:30,138 --> 02:09:31,930
You guys can do the rowing.

1451
02:09:39,689 --> 02:09:41,440
That's it! Move them out!

1452
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:51,616
Come on.

1453
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:00,167
What the...

1454
02:10:00,877 --> 02:10:04,671
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload them!

1455
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,390
Careful. Careful!

1456
02:10:18,895 --> 02:10:21,188
Pull it! Son of a bitch! Pull it up!

1457
02:10:21,939 --> 02:10:23,273
How many more?

1458
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:24,733
Get those sides up.

1459
02:10:24,817 --> 02:10:26,026
Fire!

1460
02:10:32,909 --> 02:10:33,950
(lN GERMAN)

1461
02:10:34,035 --> 02:10:35,577
What else can you see
besides smoke?

1462
02:10:35,661 --> 02:10:39,039
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

1463
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:41,500
lt will fail.

1464
02:10:41,584 --> 02:10:44,294
Of course it will fail, but...

1465
02:10:44,378 --> 02:10:47,380
what do we do if it doesn't?

1466
02:10:47,423 --> 02:10:50,091
l ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

1467
02:10:50,176 --> 02:10:51,676
Out of the question.

1468
02:10:53,638 --> 02:10:55,722
l understand, Field Marshal.

1469
02:10:56,682 --> 02:11:00,769
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

1470
02:11:00,853 --> 02:11:02,771
Have the demolition charges
been checked?

1471
02:11:02,855 --> 02:11:05,815
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.

1472
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:08,735
Captain Kraft
is standing by as ordered.

1473
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:13,657
The bridge will not fall
into enemy hands.

1474
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:17,369
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...

1475
02:11:18,496 --> 02:11:19,829
l'll blow it sky-high.

1476
02:11:32,843 --> 02:11:35,971
-Let's get going!
-All right! Go, go, go!

1477
02:11:55,074 --> 02:11:58,076
Hurry, get to the water!
Go on, go on, go, boy, go!

1478
02:12:05,585 --> 02:12:07,127
Let's go, come on!

1479
02:12:11,215 --> 02:12:13,133
Jump in, boys. Let's move.

1480
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,350
lf you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butt!

1481
02:12:22,393 --> 02:12:24,352
Anything! Row! Row!

1482
02:12:49,962 --> 02:12:51,671
(CHANTlNG) One! Two!

1483
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:01,973
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right!

1484
02:13:09,231 --> 02:13:12,233
-Support fire ordered, sir.
-GAVlN: Right. Thank you.

1485
02:13:14,654 --> 02:13:15,904
Row!

1486
02:13:34,006 --> 02:13:35,215
Get down!

1487
02:13:39,929 --> 02:13:45,600
Go! Go!

1488
02:13:48,104 --> 02:13:52,440
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1489
02:13:52,942 --> 02:13:54,234
Hail Mary.

1490
02:13:54,276 --> 02:13:55,735
Over to the right!

Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

02:13:58,864 --> 02:14:00,031
Hail Mary...

02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:08,623
Hail Mary, full of grace.

(CHANTlNG) One! Two!

1495
02:14:12,628 --> 02:14:14,587
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1496
02:14:16,841 --> 02:14:18,341
Keep rowing!

1497
02:14:20,636 --> 02:14:21,970
Straight ahead!

1498
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:30,562
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1499
02:14:31,522 --> 02:14:33,189
We're drifting! Pull to your left!

1500
02:14:33,274 --> 02:14:35,817
-Come on, pull!
-COOK: Hail Mary, full of grace.

1501
02:14:38,487 --> 02:14:40,822
Go, boys. Keep rowing!

1502
02:14:41,073 --> 02:14:43,158
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1503
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:47,954
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1504
02:14:49,665 --> 02:14:50,790
Stay down!

1505
02:14:52,126 --> 02:14:53,209
Hail Mary.

1506
02:14:53,586 --> 02:14:54,919
Come on, boys!

1507
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:57,714
COOK: ...full of grace. Hail Mary.

1508
02:14:59,175 --> 02:15:03,052
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1509
02:15:05,014 --> 02:15:09,184
Thy will be done.

1510
02:15:09,268 --> 02:15:11,561
-Hail Mary, full of grace.
-Thy will be done.

1511
02:15:11,645 --> 02:15:13,521
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1512
02:15:13,647 --> 02:15:15,440
Thy will be done.

1513
02:15:21,947 --> 02:15:23,198
Let's go!

1514
02:15:38,506 --> 02:15:40,548
Snipers! Snipers!

1515
02:15:51,936 --> 02:15:57,440
Help me. Help me.

1516
02:16:14,917 --> 02:16:16,251
Go up the side!

1517
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:30,807
-Can we make it through the tunnel?
-No way, sir.

1518
02:16:33,477 --> 02:16:36,020
-Get up the bank.
-l'm with you, sir.

1519
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:50,660
Cover. Cover.

1520
02:16:59,962 --> 02:17:01,129
Come on.

1521
02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:04,132
Let's go. Right here.

1522
02:17:09,471 --> 02:17:10,805
Follow me up here.

1523
02:17:45,507 --> 02:17:48,259
Sergeant! Take four across. Draw fire.

1524
02:17:48,344 --> 02:17:50,803
Harry and l'll go up the side. You cover.

1525
02:17:51,013 --> 02:17:53,598
-Go!
-Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1526
02:17:59,188 --> 02:18:01,481
-Come on.
-Come on! Let's go!

1527
02:18:21,043 --> 02:18:22,085
(lN GERMAN)

1528
02:18:22,169 --> 02:18:23,461
Are you ready?

1529
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:24,712
Yes, General.

1530
02:18:35,224 --> 02:18:36,391
Cover me.

1531
02:18:40,729 --> 02:18:42,480
Damn it. God damn it.

1532
02:19:12,386 --> 02:19:13,428
(lN GERMAN)

1533
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:14,470
Now.

1534
02:19:16,974 --> 02:19:17,974
Now!

1535
02:19:18,851 --> 02:19:22,103
Again!

1536
02:19:32,072 --> 02:19:33,114
(lN GERMAN)

1537
02:19:33,157 --> 02:19:36,492
My God, they're only
1 8 kilometers from Arnhem.

1538
02:19:37,619 --> 02:19:39,537
Who can stop them now?

1539
02:19:41,498 --> 02:19:42,874
No one.

1540
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:04,437
Come on!

1541
02:20:15,324 --> 02:20:16,699
Oh, hell.

1542
02:20:17,034 --> 02:20:18,659
Any chance, Whitney?

1543
02:20:18,994 --> 02:20:21,329
Not unless we're relieved
in the next few hours, sir.

1544
02:20:21,413 --> 02:20:22,830
FROST: Harry?

1545
02:20:23,207 --> 02:20:24,916
Try and get him down
to the cellar, will you?

1546
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,501
Very good, sir.

1547
02:20:52,069 --> 02:20:53,277
lt's working.

1548
02:20:53,779 --> 02:20:55,696
l'm through to HQ. Where's the colonel?

1549
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:57,532
-Down below.
-Well, get him! Get him.

1550
02:20:57,574 --> 02:20:58,908
Colonel Frost!

1551
02:20:58,992 --> 02:21:00,993
-What is it?
-Up top!

1552
02:21:01,787 --> 02:21:03,538
Up top, sir!

1553
02:21:04,456 --> 02:21:06,833
RADlO OPERATOR: lt's headquarters, sir,
on the radio!

1554
02:21:07,084 --> 02:21:08,292
Coming!

1555
02:21:11,839 --> 02:21:14,465
RADlO OPERATOR: Sunray on set.
Pass your message. Over.

1556
02:21:15,509 --> 02:21:17,927
What's your situation, Johnny? Over.

1557
02:21:18,011 --> 02:21:20,346
l hadn't expected the pleasure, sir. Well...

1558
02:21:20,389 --> 02:21:21,931
We're holding out.

1559
02:21:24,434 --> 02:21:28,396
We need reinforcements
and, above all, ammunition. Over.

1560
02:21:28,522 --> 02:21:31,315
l'm not sure if it's a case
of us coming for you,

1561
02:21:31,942 --> 02:21:33,609
or you coming for us.

1562
02:21:33,694 --> 02:21:36,696
Well, we'll just wait for XXX Corps then.

1563
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:38,364
That would probably be best.

1564
02:21:39,116 --> 02:21:41,534
Very reassuring talking to you, sir.

1565
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:44,495
l'm sorry, Johnny.

1566
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:47,790
Getting stuck on that bloody bridge
four days on your own.

1567
02:21:48,292 --> 02:21:49,709
Have you anything else for me?

1568
02:21:49,751 --> 02:21:52,920
No, sir.
l'll give you a call when our friends arrive.

1569
02:21:53,088 --> 02:21:54,422
-Over.
-All right.

1570
02:21:56,383 --> 02:21:59,177
Good luck. Out.

1571
02:22:05,767 --> 02:22:08,436
-Sergeant Tomblin!
-Here, sir!

1572
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:09,854
l'm coming over!

1573
02:22:10,272 --> 02:22:12,023
Where's the covering fire?

1574
02:22:13,275 --> 02:22:14,650
Sergeant Taylor!

1575
02:22:25,621 --> 02:22:27,997
COOK: l don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?

1576
02:22:28,081 --> 02:22:29,790
What's the matter with you guys?

1577
02:22:29,833 --> 02:22:32,126
Those are British troops at Arnhem.

1578
02:22:32,544 --> 02:22:34,003
They're hurt bad.

1579
02:22:34,922 --> 02:22:37,798
You're not gonna stop, not now.

1580
02:22:37,925 --> 02:22:40,301
l'm sorry. We have our orders.

1581
02:22:40,469 --> 02:22:43,095
We busted our asses getting here,
half my men are killed,

1582
02:22:43,138 --> 02:22:44,889
and you're just gonna stop

1583
02:22:45,849 --> 02:22:48,559
and drink tea?

1584
02:22:48,644 --> 02:22:51,062
Look, we're now facing
a completely different situation.

1585
02:22:51,146 --> 02:22:52,855
We can't lead with tanks up that road.

1586
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:55,066
Jerry will pick us off like sitting ducks.

1587
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:57,360
Our infantry is still fighting in Nijmegen.

1588
02:22:57,444 --> 02:22:59,570
When they get here, we'll move on.

1589
02:23:04,326 --> 02:23:06,911
For Christ's sake,
must you do everything by the book?

1590
02:23:06,995 --> 02:23:09,372
Our orders are to wait for the infantry.

1591
02:23:10,374 --> 02:23:12,166
l'm sorry, but there it is.

1592
02:23:20,175 --> 02:23:21,259
Sir.

1593
02:23:21,969 --> 02:23:23,511
Sir. Sir.

1594
02:23:24,137 --> 02:23:25,846
lt's Major Carlyle, sir.

1595
02:23:33,814 --> 02:23:35,106
FROST: All right.

1596
02:23:40,028 --> 02:23:42,196
All right, Wicks. l'm all right.

1597
02:23:50,247 --> 02:23:53,374
-Hello, Harry.
-Hello, Johnny.

1598
02:23:55,377 --> 02:23:57,378

02:42:46,674 --> 02:42:48,800
So we must take every precaution.

1759
02:42:48,843 --> 02:42:51,719
Now, l've designed this
like a collapsing bag.

1760
02:42:51,804 --> 02:42:54,055
Macdonald here has agreed
to man the wireless

1761
02:42:54,140 --> 02:42:56,141
in order to give the Germans
something to listen to.

1762
02:42:56,183 --> 02:43:00,562
And all the padres and the medical staff
have volunteered to stay behind as well.

1763
02:43:00,771 --> 02:43:02,814
Now, the wounded,
who are too bad to move,

1764
02:43:02,857 --> 02:43:04,691
will replace the men firing,

1765
02:43:05,484 --> 02:43:07,652
so our defense will seem as before.

1766
02:43:07,987 --> 02:43:10,447
By the time the Germans
find out what's happening,

1767
02:43:10,531 --> 02:43:12,991
we should all be safely across the river.

1768
02:43:14,743 --> 02:43:18,037
-Pleasant journey.
-ALL: Thank you, sir.

-Are you all right, laddie?
-Thank you, sir.

1770
02:45:13,195 --> 02:45:16,614
l'm beginning to believe
we're actually going to make it, sir.

1771
02:45:16,657 --> 02:45:19,492
l thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

1772
02:46:56,632 --> 02:46:59,258
General Browning will be
down right away, sir.

1773
02:47:05,599 --> 02:47:08,643
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

1774
02:47:09,228 --> 02:47:10,436
Change?

1775
02:47:10,688 --> 02:47:12,105
Your clothes, sir.

1776
02:47:13,982 --> 02:47:15,358
No, thanks.

Hello, Roy.

1779
02:47:37,172 --> 02:47:38,297
How are you?

1780
02:47:39,717 --> 02:47:42,135
l'm not sure that l'll know for a while,

1781
02:47:43,887 --> 02:47:46,389
but l'm sorry about the way it worked out.

1782
02:47:47,975 --> 02:47:49,559
You did all you could.

1783
02:47:51,770 --> 02:47:54,063
Yes, but did everyone else?

1784
02:47:58,277 --> 02:48:01,112
They've got a bed
for you upstairs if you want it.

1785
02:48:02,406 --> 02:48:04,323
l took 1 0,000 men into Arnhem.

1786
02:48:04,658 --> 02:48:06,743
l've come out with less than two.

1787
02:48:07,161 --> 02:48:09,203
l don't feel much like sleeping.

1788
02:48:10,539 --> 02:48:11,706
Quite.

1789
02:48:14,668 --> 02:48:16,502
l've just been on to Monty.

1790
02:48:18,297 --> 02:48:20,131
He's very proud and pleased.

1791
02:48:21,383 --> 02:48:24,051
-Pleased?
-Of course.

1792
02:48:25,053 --> 02:48:27,680
He thinks Market Garden
was 90% successful.

1793
02:48:29,641 --> 02:48:31,225
But what do you think?

1794
02:48:34,188 --> 02:48:38,274
Well, as you know, l've always thought
that we tried to go a bridge too far.

1795
02:49:09,681 --> 02:49:10,890

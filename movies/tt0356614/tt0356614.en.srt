2
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:16,827
- 30 seconds. How far?

3
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,838
- 120, 121, 122.

4
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,844
- Hustle. You're only halfway.

5
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:27,364
- 10 floors. 252 steps in total.

6
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,375
- Including landings?
- Including landings.

7
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:41,514
- 252. No sweat. I'm there.

8
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,220
- Good. One minute ten.

9
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,625
You OK?

10
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:46,831
- Yeah...

11
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:48,136
Keep going.

12
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:51,147
- The 10th floor is secured
without lock or handle from the stairs.

13
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:53,857
Apply our acid to the door.
It'll melt through the cover

14
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:55,864
and the door hasp
in about 90 seconds.

15
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,784
- What's your overall time limit?
- Seven minutes.

16
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:03,892
- How can you be sure?
- We stake out

17
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,601
each guard multiple times,
and when fat boy here

18
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:08,609
leaves his post
with the newspaper,

19
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,618
he's gone for an average
of 12 minutes, never under seven.

20
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,726
- Reads while he craps?
- Don't you?

21
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,332
- It's through.

22
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:18,443
- Great. Run. 11 laps gets you
to the front door.

23
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,089
- Hamish Jewellers,

24
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,900
office number 1044.
Got to pick a Hodge deadbolt.

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,509
30 seconds.

26
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,014
- Shh!

27
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,343
20.

28
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,271
10.

29
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,396
Yes! Go, get in there!

30
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,313
You've got 30 seconds
to bypass the alarm.

31
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:09,220
The target used is a Z-Ron Five

32
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,628
motion-detector system
with 30-second delay

33
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:15,542
and silent alarms to the police
and the lobby guard.

34
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,155
Match the line resistance and
then we place the jumper cables

35
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:21,162
here... and here.

36
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:29,892
Error, error, error, error...

37
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,799
- What?

38
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,708
- Error, error, error,

39
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,217
error, error.

40
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,429
- Go back. You said the system
was a Z-Ron Five.

41
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,637
Was it their early beta model
or a retail unit?

42
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,242
- Beta shmeta, what's the diff?

43
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:46,049
- Well, if it was the beta model,

44
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:47,754
then this circuit jump
wouldn't work.

45
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:49,560
In fact, it would short out.

46
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:51,668
Big time.
- How do you know a beta unit?

47
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,173
- Beta units are sealed

48
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,679
with crappy factory bolts.

49
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,392
Now, new models use nice,
shiny chrome, hex-head screws.

50
00:03:58,492 --> 00:03:59,997
I saw them.

51
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:02,606
They're hex-head screws.

52
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,512
- Got a picture of the alarm box?

53
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:05,918
- No.

54
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:10,233
- Error, error.

55
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,942
- Sorry, no cigar.

56
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:17,057
No picture, no points.
Them's the rules. Sorry.

57
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,064
- All right.

58
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,677
I'll get the photo tomorrow.

59
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,887
- But, Rob,
they're hex-head screws.

60
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:28,597
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a sec.
We can't show the rest?

61
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:30,203
We're going to lance a safe.

62
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,812
It's the coolest burn
we've ever done. Come on,

63
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,221
let's keep going.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Sam.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,531
Whoa, whoa. You mind...

65
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,338
not doing that?

66
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,245
Game over. Thank you.

67
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:45,757
- See, Sam, you have to run it
flawlessly from start to finish.

68
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:48,165
Or else it's not foolproof.

69
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,172
- Yeah, but I wanted
to blast the safe.

70
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,677
- Mm. Well, sorry.

71
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,283
- Don't.

72
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,699
- Aww... relax, Rob.

73
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,909
You won't be needing that next time.
You want to know why?

74
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,823
Because it's foolproof,
that's why.

75
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,339
Don't walk away Eileen

76
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:12,951
- Kev, can you spot me
this round?

77
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:14,959
Every round.

78
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,665
- Sorry. Every penny
is going towards rent.

79
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,873
The landlord is threatening
to cut off the heat.

80
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,478
- Well, gee, Beaver,

81
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,586
maybe it's time
you get a paper route.

82
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,291
- Oh, ha, ha!

83
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,796
- Sam.

84
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:30,714
Please cut that out. Please.

85
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,026
- I could get a paper route,
or...

86
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,233
I could rob a jeweller.

87
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,838
- Shut up!

88
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,949
- Will you keep your voice down?
- Come on, you did nice work.

89
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,756
It's kind of like
that French gang,

90
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,064
who pinched the Mercury
Emeralds back in '82.

91
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:46,570
- You read ahead.

92
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,379
That's against the rules.
- I just noticed

93
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,085
that you didn't look into
how to, um...

94
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,690
fence the diamonds.

95
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,196
- Oh, here we go again.

96
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:57,407
- Also against the rules, Rob.

97
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,818
It's about the art of the crime,
not about moving stolen crap.

98
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,030
- But that's part of crime.
- Yeah, but not part of the game.

99
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,137
All I'm saying is,
why not broaden

100
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:08,345
the playing field,
raise the bar a little?

101
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:11,256
Why not look into fencing,
laundering and other stuff?

102
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:14,165
I'd be happy
to ask a few questions.

103
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:17,377
- Too risky. So, uh,
keep your mouth shut, okay?

104
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,986
- Well, I need more.
I say we go further.

105
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,696
- Really?
- Really?

106
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,300
- All those opposed?

107
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,906
- Nay.
- Nay.

108
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,318
- Motion denied.

109
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,727
Now, drop it... here.

110
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:33,433
- Put it away.
- I'm on my bike.

111
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:36,343
You hold on to it.
- No, no, no, no.

112
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:38,751
You're plan coordinator
this round. It's your job.

113
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:40,357
Now, take it.

114
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:43,267
- Kevin, relax.

115
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,274
You are so uptight.

116
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:49,187
- Stan, hey.
Listen, perfect timing.

117
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:51,094
I, uh, I think
you're making a big mistake,

118
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,202
paying out
on that basement fire.

119
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:54,907
- Oh, yeah? Why?

120
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,915
- Well, because I don't think
we pay insurance claims

121
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,822
to people who blow up
their own property.

122
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,126
- It was an electrical fire.

123
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,133
- No, no.
Take a closer look, Stan.

124
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:05,244
Check out the amount of sodium-
hypochlorite residue at the scene.

125
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:08,355
- All right, that's bleach, smart guy.
It was a laundry room?

126
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,864
- Nope, it's not just bleach
and not at those levels.

127
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,372
And not with so much hydrogen
peroxide mixed in, either.

128
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,379
Now, you put all those
big words together,

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,486
and what do you get?
Sodium chlorate.

130
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,393
Ka-boom!

131
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,601
Homemade bomb? Yes.

132
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:24,411
Big insurance payoff?
Not so much.

133
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:27,622
Think.

134
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,459
Maggie.

135
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,567
You look lovely today.

136
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,678
- What do you want?
- Can I have some courier receipts?

137
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,689
- Why?
- Because I've got gum.

138
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,505
- There's another karaoke bash
Friday night.

139
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:55,118
Perfect for getting drunk
and making a total ass of yourself.

140
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,225
We could, uh, go together.

141
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:58,931
- That would be nice, Maggie.

142
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,738
But, uh...

143
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:03,447
Weekends are kind of bad for me.

144
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:06,658
- You haven't been to a single office
function in the year you’ve been here.

145
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,665
People are starting to think
you're a knob.

146
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,780
- Really?

147
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,162
Hi. How ya gawin'?

148
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,472
Morgan and Fairchild accounting?
Sign there.

149
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:42,684
- Oh, I'm sorry,
but you have the wrong address.

150
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,494
- Oh, naw.
This is unit 1044, right?

151
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,903
- Uh, yeah,
but we're not accountants.

152
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:50,109
We're diamond wholesalers.

153
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,120
- Then, we've got a bit
of a problem, don't we?

154
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:56,833
- Let me check the waybill, then.
It's in here somewhere.

155
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:58,339
Yeah, it's in one of those.

156
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,049
We'll have a quick look
through that.

157
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:10,080
Not even close.

158
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:15,498
Gay koala.

159
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,616
- Look, it says
1340 Spadina on the envelope.

160
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,724
- Oh, would you look...
- That's across the street.

161
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:26,236
- That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Sorry to take up your time...

162
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,146
I had some pints for breakfast...
Be lucky to find my way home.

163
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:34,064
Thank you.

164
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:37,074
Sorry about that.
It's a new camera.

165
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,790
Oops, ha-ha. Sorry about that.

166
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:44,901
Oi, there's a chair there.

167
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,545
Oh, looks like a nice set of
hex-head screws there, Rob,

168
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,653
you dingo's anus.

169
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:03,665
- Hello?

170
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,380
- Hey, Sam, guess what?
We're foolproof.

171
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,390
- Shit, Kev, you won't like this.
- What's up?

172
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,398
- I was robbed.

173
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:15,106
- What? Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

174
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:18,117
Its just...
they broke into my place.

175
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,429
- Gee, Sam, I'm sorry.
Well, as long as you're all right.

176
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,035
- Kevin...

177
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:27,650
they took the envelope.

178
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,471
- The envelope?

179
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:38,588
So, that's all they took?
The laptop and the plans?

180
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,499
- And my gym bag, but the plans
were in my gym bag.

181
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:44,710
- Sam! You left the plans
in the gym bag?

182
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,516
- Probably took it
to carry the computer.

183
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,022
- How did they get in?

184
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:49,628
- Kicked the door.
- Smash and grab.

185
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:52,336
- Amateurs.
- Even so, they still got our plans.

186
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,745
- They won't contact the police.
It's just paperwork.

187
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,250
- It's kind of specific paperwork.

188
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:59,462
- What if they decided...
to give it a crack?

189
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,870
- Ha, boost the jeweler?

190
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,676
- Whoa, whoa, ha-ha.

191
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:08,192
We're talking about a bunch
of amateurs here, OK? Punks.

192
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,601
Our plan has lock-picking,
circuitry, chemistry,

193
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:13,109
not to mention some pretty
high-end hardware

194
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,413
to burn through that safe.

195
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,521
No, no, no, that's not going
to happen.

196
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,427
- Yeah, well, still?

197
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:21,539
It looked like
a pretty good plan.

198
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,048
- Pretty good? It's foolproof.

199
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,653
- Hell, yeah.

200
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,200
One minute. Make it fast
and simple, then we got to go.

201
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,608
- Yeah, and try
and sound pleasant.

202
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,917
- Mr. Hamish, please.
- Who may I say is calling?

203
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:47,831
- It's Helen Calling.
Helen Hayes.

204
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:49,436
- Hello?

205
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:52,245
- You need to listen carefully.
This is very important.

206
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,754
My friends and I, uh...

207
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:57,263
Actually, you know, you might
kind of find this funny...

208
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,579
We play this game
where we figure out how to hack

209
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,485
through people's security...
we'd never do it.

210
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:05,993
It's more of an academic
exercise, really.

211
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:08,804
Last month, we figured out how
to break into your business.

212
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,408
- What?

213
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,316
- And now we sort of lost
the plans.

214
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,624
No, this is not a crank call!

215
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,630
I am serious.
Call Z-Ron Security.

216
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:18,939
Get them to install
a new alarm system.

217
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,946
Change the front door lock.
Maybe the safe.

218
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,455
Tell that fat guard
to poo faster.

219
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:27,168
Tell that fat guard
to poo faster? What was that?

220
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:28,773
Shut up!

221
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,680
Who says "poo"?
What are you, eight?

222
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,787
To give in

223
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,694
Like you fight in a fight

224
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,199
But you know

225
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,705
You can't win

226
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,511
Don't you know you've got to

227
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,517
Stand up, shake it off

228
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:44,127
Look them in the eye
you can never

229
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,439
Get another chance
to make things right

230
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,245
No passing by

231
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:54,162
It felt like you never said
all the things you want to say

232
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:55,766
This is your chance

233
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,172
So stand up...

234
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:02,692
- Ach!

235
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:07,408
Learn the angles.

236
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:10,519
Think, then rethink.

237
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,827
Formulate that perfect plan,
Harry...

238
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,738
Then you can proceed
with absolute confidence.

239
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,547
- Yes, that is right, my friend.

240
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,152
Oh, God.

241
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:25,371
- See you.

242
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:49,154
- Thank you for suggesting
we talk in private, Officer, uh...

243
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,660
- Detective, actually.

244
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,770
Well, we understand it can be
awkward having police drop by.

245
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,476
We try to stay low-key.

246
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:01,598
- And, uh, how can I help?

247
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:04,107
- Well, Mr. Kraft. Uh...

248
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,020
That with a "K"?

249
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,030
- Yeah.

250
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:14,844
- Mr. Kraft, we received a call
on our anonymous-tips line saying...

251
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,452
you might be able
to shed some light on a robbery

252
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:21,166
that occurred the night before last.
The target was a business

253
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:24,979
called Hamish International.
It's a jewellery wholesaler

254
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,886
on Spadina. Heard of them?

255
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,910
- Sorry. No.

256
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,917
- Uh, where were you
Wednesday night?

257
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:41,938
- Um, I was, uh, I was at my-my
place, um, from about 6:00, 6:15

258
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,045
until I left for work
the next morning.

259
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:46,253
- Anyone there with you?
- No.

260
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:48,662
- Girlfriend?
- No.

261
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:54,281
- Do you know a Helen Hayes?
- No.

262
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,912
- You've never heard
of Helen Hayes?

263
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,724
- No.

264
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,742
Yeah... Helen Hayes,
the actress.

265
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:14,753
Of course I've heard of her.
I, um...

266
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:17,161
what was the, uh,
what was the movie she was in?

267
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:19,468
The Love Bug movie?

268
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:22,279
- Herbie Rides Again.

269
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,189
- Yeah.

270
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,397
Yeah, that's it.

271
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:30,006
Um, what I meant to say
was that I don't know

272
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:33,016
any living person
named Helen Hayes.

273
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,826
And also that I'm sorry, uh...

274
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:39,138
I really don't think
that I can help you.

275
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,119
- There you go.

276
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,829
That's a boy.

277
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:36,037
Don't worry, Jaws,
I'm not going to forget you.

278
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,387
Kevin Kraft.

279
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,493
- Hello, Mr. Kraft.
Did you get my invitation?

280
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:55,504
- Uh, no, um,
I mean, I don't know...

281
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,113
Who-who's calling, please?
- I had it delivered

282
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:00,823
this morning.
Should be in your top drawer.

283
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,944
Check in with your paper clips.

284
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,050
Found it?

285
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,169
- Yes.

286
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,579
- Good. We'll get together
tonight, then.

287
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,493
- The take was over 450,000
in diamonds.

288
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:52,303
I conned their insurance company
into sharing the claim file.

289
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,009
Every detail is in this report.

290
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,718
They did the alarm jump,
the safe burn, the acid job.

291
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,026
It's totally our plan.

292
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:01,033
Beat for beat.

293
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:03,040
- That little thief!

294
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,048
There should be a law.

295
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:09,161
- It's like Carmine De Souza,
the gangster chameleon.

296
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,670
He'd, um, visit mobsters
in Sing Sing

297
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,577
and, uh, trick them
into revealing

298
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,688
their uh, plans for future hits.

299
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,995
Then, he'd do the jobs himself.

300
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,902
Never an original idea.

301
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,325
They cut off his privates,
you know.

302
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,848
- Would you get a grip?

303
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,765
So, do you think
that's our mystery caller?

304
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:41,977
- He looks like a sentry.
- I could take him.

305
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:45,087
Or you could keep
your hands to yourself.

306
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:48,097
We have no idea
what we're up against here.

307
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:52,413
And you, just... be cool, Rob.

308
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,019
Don't say a word.

309
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,727
Let's not give them anything more
than they already have.

310
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,910
Sam, no!

311
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,419
- The first punch
had better kill him.

312
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:54,329
That martial-arts crap is fine,
at first,

313
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,335
but Kenny will keep coming.

314
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:59,045
Broken nose, broken wrist,
cracked ribs.

315
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,253
I've never seen him give up.

316
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:04,866
More to the point,
I've never seen him lose.

317
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:07,775
Never.

318
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:10,184
There's no need for the pat-down
anyway, is there?

319
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,693
- Let go.

320
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:15,001
Dinner will be ready
in a few minutes,

321
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,109
so I'll keep this brief.

322
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,326
As you know, I stole your plans
and hit the jeweler.

323
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:24,534
And obviously,
I know where you all live,

324
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:28,448
where you work,
and... how you operate.

325
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:31,860
Now...

326
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,877
This is a page
from your game plan.

327
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,988
Now, can anyone tell me what those
grey smudges are along the edge?

328
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,704
- Fingerprint powder.

329
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:49,521
- Very good. And whose fingerprints
do you think are on this paper?

330
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:53,134
Well, I'll give you a hint:
It's the same three sets of prints

331
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,342
that are all over
that lovely little plan.

332
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:00,158
So, I'll get to the point.

333
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,976
You're going to work for me.

334
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,786
One job, full plan,

335
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,491
full execution.

336
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:11,197
No one gets hurt.

337
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:17,018
And you get your papers back.
- Look,

338
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:18,824
Mr...
- Gillette.

339
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,931
Leo Gillette.

340
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:25,045
Mr. Gillette...

341
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,260
We're not really criminals.

342
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,866
- No shit.

343
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:37,087
Keep those... souvenirs
of your move up to the big league.

344
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,897
- We don't want to play
in any league.

345
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,904
- Number one, you're obviously
top-shelf strategists...

346
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,520
Very thorough, very precise.

347
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,330
Number two, you have
just the expertise I need

348
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,438
to pull off
this particular job,

349
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:55,552
and, number three, I don't care
what you want and don't want.

350
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:57,759
Pick those up.

351
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,283
Don't even think

352
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:06,189
of puking in my restaurant,
boy-o.

353
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:11,909
- What's stopping us
from going to the police?

354
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,031
- Have you?

355
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:27,062
- I spoke to a detective
this morning.

356
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:32,582
- Yeah, but you lied to him,
didn't you?

357
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:39,204
Perfect.

358
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:40,810
I knew you would.

359
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:45,727
- We're so fucked.

360
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:48,236
- Yes.

361
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:51,748
But relax, they won't be back.

362
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:55,261
At least, not unless
I tip them off... again.

363
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:56,766
- How did you know?

364
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,780
- You didn't just break in and happen
to find the plans, did you?

365
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,995
How did you know
about Foolproof?

366
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:06,500
Was it fat mouth over here?

367
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,005
- Foolproof?

368
00:23:08,106 --> 00:23:10,513
Is that what you call it?

369
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,746
I believe this is yours.

370
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:25,365
It's an impressive read.
Bold, yet meticulous, strategies.

371
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,874
I love the one
where you tried to figure out

372
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,380
how to pinch the Stanley Cup.

373
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,287
It's very...

374
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:32,792
Canadian.

375
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,303
Don't worry, I skipped
the more personal entries.

376
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:41,622
I'm a thief, not a scoundrel.

377
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:44,030
- You kept a diary of Foolproof?

378
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,740
- Oh, it wasn't the journal
that tipped me off.

379
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,148
And it wasn't, um...
- Rob.

380
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:51,657
- Fat mouth...
No, it was you, Kevin.

381
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:54,066
Yeah, one of my people
spotted you

382
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,378
staking out the jeweler...
several times.

383
00:23:57,578 --> 00:23:59,986
So, I had you followed,

384
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:02,294
which led to the others
and, eventually,

385
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:04,603
to your little plan.

386
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:06,108
Been watching for weeks.

387
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,333
What are you doing?

388
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,157
Get your own damned dinner.

389
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,378
I want a call by noon tomorrow.

390
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:42,234
- Um... they-they call you
Leo The Touch,

391
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:43,940
don't they?

392
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:45,847
- I haven't heard that one
in years.

393
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,574
- I told you to keep
your yap shut.

394
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,083
"Leo The Touch,"
give me a break!

395
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,590
- Nice fucking car, Rob.

396
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:01,200
Yeah, well,
take the bus next time.

397
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,905
Wiggle the distributor cap.

398
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:05,315
- Next time? What, next time
we're summoned by the mob?

399
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:07,322
- He's not the mob.
- Here, hold this.

400
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:10,532
- Jeez.

401
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,840
- Okay, so who is he?

402
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:16,052
Leo Gillette... he's known
as the Midas touch of crime.

403
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:18,461
He's done bank jobs,
armored cars.

404
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,873
He's smart, careful,
never a day of jail time.

405
00:25:21,973 --> 00:25:23,477
He's a real pro.

406
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:27,793
- Okay... options?

407
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,298
- Run!
- Oh, right,

408
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,205
I got enough airline
points to get to Buffalo.

409
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,513
I'd rather face the cops.

410
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:36,021
But we already lied to them.

411
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:39,233
- He was sitting right there.
What did you want me to do, Sam?

412
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,842
Get you on the speaker-phone?
Talk strategy?

413
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,753
- Maybe we should just go
to the cops. We'll just explain.

414
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:46,860
- Explain what, Rob?
We lied to the cops.

415
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,368
We planned the robbery. We're
in possession of stolen diamonds.

416
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:50,974
- Shh!
- Now, I'm no lawyer,

417
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:53,282
but I'm pretty sure
we're guilty of something.

418
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:56,895
- I am not going to jail
for this shit.

419
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:59,604
- Let's not be so fast at throwing
ourselves at the police.

420
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:04,120
We got to buy some time,
learn the angles, think.

421
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:08,435
Formulate that perfect plan,
and then we can proceed...

422
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:11,646
- With absolute confidence?
The only thing I'm confident about

423
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:14,054
right now,
is that we're absolutely fucked.

424
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:17,868
- No. No. We don't have to be.

425
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:20,778
- Maybe we should
just whack the bastard.

426
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:23,989
I'm kidding. Hello?

427
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:25,795
- Yeah, like
when you grabbed that guy?

428
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,903
That was hilarious, Sam.
You almost got us killed.

429
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:29,508
- Look, I had him under control.

430
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:33,121
- No. You have nothing under control.
I said to keep your hands to yourself!

431
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:36,934
- You got this guy on our tails in
the first place. This is your fault.

432
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:40,346
- Mine? I told you to secure the plan.
A gym bag isn't secure.

433
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:42,253
And don't even get me started

434
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:44,761
on your secret little Foolproof diary.
Talk about careless.

435
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:46,167
- Screw you!
- Stop it.

436
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,976
You're making it worse.

437
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:52,187
Right now, we're just going to have
to stick together on this one.

438
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:54,195
- Ah, speak for yourself.

439
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:55,800
Feeble.

440
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,633
So, where do you want the tour?

441
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,542
Patrice National
Investments, 22nd floor.

442
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:39,954
I suggest you take a look
at the stairwell, hallway and lobby,

443
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,761
and obviously,
anything on the inside.

444
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,872
- Any footage of sensors,
alarm panels and security cameras.

445
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:46,779
- Uh, yeah, I've done this before.
Remember?

446
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:03,938
In 1985, Heikrun
Technologies of Germany

447
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:06,949
issued $44 million
in capital bonds...

448
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:10,461
That's non-registered
bearer bonds... good as cash.

449
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,366
In two weeks,

450
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,876
395 of those honeys
are going to be kept here

451
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,184
en route
to their New York custodian.

452
00:28:19,794 --> 00:28:22,102
And we're going to steal them.

453
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:24,209
- What's the denomination?

454
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,517
- 50 grand a bond.

455
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:29,828
- That's $20 million.

456
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:31,836
- Roughly.

457
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,244
I could have hired
any number of punters

458
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:37,455
to help me blast my way
in there, but there's a catch:

459
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:40,967
I need this job executed
with a perfect... finesse.

460
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:44,379
- Damn it!
- Oh, and you'd be amazed

461
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,290
how little finesse there is
for hire in this business.

462
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:48,895
The bottom line is,

463
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,905
you have finesse... you proved
that with the Hamish job.

464
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,314
So you get the challenge.

465
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:57,124
You have to get in and out
of there without a trace.

466
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:59,834
They can't know
they've been jacked.

467
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:02,442
- Why? You said those bonds
are as good as cash.

468
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:05,152
- Those bonds may be unregistered,
but they are numbered.

469
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:08,263
If Patrice reports them stolen,

470
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:11,173
Interpol will be watching,
and no one will cash them.

471
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,580
- Even if we can get in
and out clean,

472
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,789
somebody is going to notice
$20 million in missing bonds.

473
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:18,498
- Not if you switch them
with forgeries.

474
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:21,409
See, if they don't know
they've been robbed,

475
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:25,522
then you'd be free
to cash out the real bonds...

476
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,128
no questions asked.

477
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,738
- Very good, Robert.

478
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:31,945
Move to the front of the class.

479
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,179
So, as you can see,

480
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,989
the windows on the Patrice floor
are sealed tight.

481
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,497
So, ultimately,
if we can't access the windows

482
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,307
and there can't be
any floor or wall damage,

483
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:20,615
this doorway is the only way
into the offices.

484
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:23,225
- Right. The security panel
at Patrice Investments

485
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:26,335
is a Statlin... Alpha series.
- Card key and access code.

486
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:29,647
- One per employee, so they know
exactly who is coming and going.

487
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,754
- Can we jump that system?

488
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,367
- The entire floor is wired
with top-graded, shielded cable.

489
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:38,176
Plus they got these brutally
sensitive end-line resistors.

490
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:41,187
Try bypassing, the whole place
goes hot for sure.

491
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:43,696
- Okay...

492
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,703
So, we need a card
and a pass code.

493
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,811
- Sorry I'm late.

494
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,118
We started at 9:00, Sam.

495
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,129
- And I said I was sorry.
- Well, this isn't part-time

496
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,039
at Starbucks, girlie.
When I set a time, you stick to it.

497
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,046
You pull this shit
on my job again,

498
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:00,354
and i'll deliver your fingerprints
to the cops myself.

499
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:03,665
He's right, Sam. I mean,
are we professionals here...

500
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:05,171
or not?

501
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:10,590
- Ach.

502
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,829
So, that's 30 foot square
inside.

503
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:24,338
Does that include the tempered
shield and fireproofing?

504
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:25,843
- Where have you been?

505
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:27,850
- OK.
What's the radius on that?

506
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,359
- You missed the division meeting
this morning.

507
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:33,570
- I see, OK.
Uh, I'm on the phone here, Stan.

508
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:36,079
- Oh.

509
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,584
- Go ahead.

510
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:40,594
- You know, word is you haven't
closed a file in a week.

511
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,100
- OK, who verified that?

512
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,709
- What's wrong, brainiac?
Having trouble with the old...

513
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,616
- Hey, Stan?

514
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,121
Eat shit, 'K?

515
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,640
Sorry about that. Nothing.

516
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,647
Flushing my life
down the toilet.

517
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:58,056
What's the tumbler grading
on that vault?

518
00:31:58,156 --> 00:32:00,364
And your contact verified that?

519
00:32:00,464 --> 00:32:02,972
Who is he?

520
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,578
His name
is Lawrence Yeager.

521
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:07,288
He's Patrice's number-two bond manager.
He's been showing up

522
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:09,797
on and off at night,
no consistent time.

523
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,402
- Insomniac?

524
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:14,613
- Technically, he's supposed
to be checking the opening trades

525
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:17,523
on the European bond market.

526
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:20,835
But, uh, sometimes...

527
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:23,846
it sure doesn't look
like business.

528
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:26,755
- So, what does he do?

529
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:28,562
- Hmm.

530
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:30,167
Excuse me.

531
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,995
Move over a bit.

532
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,804
That's it.

533
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:43,414
You like that, don't you?

534
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,729
Now...

535
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,545
take off your bra.

536
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,251
Smell it.

537
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:57,262
Good.

538
00:32:57,463 --> 00:32:59,872
Oh, you are so...

539
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:01,376
hot.

540
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:03,283
Move your hips.

541
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,992
Yeah.

542
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,799
Now... rub

543
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,111
your... self.

544
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:12,616
Oh, yes!

545
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:15,224
Oh, keep...

546
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:16,730
- What?

547
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,934
- What?
- What?

548
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:20,945
- Mm, no-no, a hand went below
the desk, that's when I stop.

549
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,248
- Oooh.
- Ah.

550
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,156
- That's pretty creepy stuff.
- Totally.

551
00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:26,465
- Ewww.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

552
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:29,775
Even the thought of saying it
out loud makes me want to gargle.

553
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,783
- OK, here's what we do.

554
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:34,693
Captain Phone Sex over there
is essentially a blessing.

555
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,302
If we can clone his card
and bust his pass,

556
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:40,412
no flags will go up
when we go in during the night.

557
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:42,821
No. Thank you.

558
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,032
- And what's to stop Free Willy here
from coming back once we're inside.

559
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,642
- I'll keep him busy,
now that I know what he likes.

560
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,248
- We don't have lots of time.

561
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:52,153
We'll move on him tomorrow.

562
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,770
- How much contact will we have with him?
Sam, you'll need a disguise.

563
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:16,137
- Ooh!
- Oh! I'm so sorry.

564
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:18,245
- No, I'm sorry.
- I'm so clumsy.

565
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:19,951
It's these new heels.

566
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:22,460
Oh, my melons!
They're getting away.

567
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,104
Oh, thank you.

568
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,723
It's very sweet of you.

569
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:49,956
Oh, excuse me, sir?

570
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,862
Is this yours? Did you drop it?

571
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,372
Now.

572
00:35:23,473 --> 00:35:26,283
The guard's down. Go!

573
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,210
OK, he's in.

574
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,318
All right.
Now, get out of there.

575
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:51,069
- Nice fucking... car, Rob.

576
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,488
Time you got yourself
a new car, kid.

577
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,796
It sticks out.

578
00:35:58,997 --> 00:36:01,907
Not to mention it being
an affront to our environment.

579
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:09,232
Never had a woman
on my crew before.

580
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,143
Capone said, "Never trust a woman
or an automatic weapon."

581
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:13,748
- That was Dillinger.

582
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:21,074
Uh, I mean,
I... think it was Dillinger.

583
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:26,292
- So, what's the story
with you three?

584
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,701
- Me and Kevin met Sam
in university,

585
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:31,610
and we started hanging out
and hacking and stuff.

586
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,320
And then we came up with Foolproof,
and ever since then,

587
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,628
it's just been about the game.
- Enough games.

588
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,739
Time you got a life.

589
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:47,767
Here. Buck up.

590
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:49,373
It's for the Hamish job.

591
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,196
Now, don't worry.
It's a square cut.

592
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:57,901
I'm good to my people.

593
00:36:57,902 --> 00:37:02,017
It's your call whether you count
the other two in or not.

594
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:03,823
Just, uh...

595
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:05,528
buy a decent car.

596
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,052
Look sharp.

597
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,872
- He's on his way up.

598
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,412
- Excuse me.

599
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,567
Thank you, Larry.

600
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:26,512
- Oh, man, they look
pretty real to me.

601
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:28,419
- Oh, they're perfect.

602
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:31,830
- Good enough for you to fool them
till you cash out the real ones?

603
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:34,540
- Oh, yeah.
I got this guy in Manchester.

604
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,945
Now, he can forge anything.

605
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:38,353
Just don't ask him
to counterfeit the British pound.

606
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:41,264
The bugger loves the Queen
like his own mother.

607
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:42,768
Access denied. Access denied.

608
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:44,374
- Shut up!

609
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,308
- Acc...

610
00:38:58,122 --> 00:38:59,526
Access denied.

611
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:02,839
- Urghh! I'm warning you.

612
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,545
- Access denied. Access denied.

613
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,852
- Oh, you're so dead.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

614
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,160
Hey, you leave our son alone.

615
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:11,167
He's just doing his job,
aren't you, Robo-boy?

616
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:13,375
What's that, boy?
- Access de...

617
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,881
- Uh?

618
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:16,788
He's got gas.

619
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,749
You know...

620
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,657
You may want to lay off
the donuts.

621
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:38,864
Yeah, you might want
to lay off the donuts.

622
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,777
- That's the clip release.

623
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:45,086
You hold the gun straight,
you press it,

624
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:47,294
and the clip slips out,
drop free.

625
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,899
- What the hell is that?

626
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,107
- It's a.45 calibrate longslide
Glock 21

627
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:54,118
with octagonal right rifting
and dual-ported barrel exhaust.

628
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,023
What the hell does it look like?

629
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:58,232
- No... guns.

630
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,744
We take that rule very seriously,
don't we, Rob?

631
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:03,651
- Hey, cool Glock.

632
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,357
- For Christ's sake.

633
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:10,173
Jesus! Fuck!

634
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,678
What's wrong with you guys?

635
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,890
- Take it easy, Kev.
I mean, Leo was just showing me.

636
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:18,302
It's not for the job.
- OK Whatever.

637
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,710
- Here. Hold this.

638
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,215
Can I see?

639
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:26,731
Thanks.

640
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:31,849
- Have to admit you're
overreacting a bit, Kevin.

641
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:35,161
I mean, no offense, but, uh,
I never picked you

642
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:36,766
as the bitch of this group.

643
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,773
- Hey, Leo, remember how

644
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,679
you said you had your ass
totally covered?

645
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,991
Ever think that one of us
just might blow your head off?

646
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,195
- Sam...

647
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,102
- You got a better idea, Kev?

648
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,027
- Do you honestly think
I'd hand you a loaded gun?

649
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,431
There's no clip, sweetie.

650
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:58,643
- You mean the one l just pulled
from your pocket?

651
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:07,173
Ha... and don't call me
"sweetie."

652
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:14,398
- You know something, Leo?
- Shut up, Rob.

653
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:25,135
- She's not pulling the trigger.

654
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:27,343
- Get out of the way, Rob.

655
00:41:27,544 --> 00:41:28,949
- Not on me.

656
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:31,157
Not on you.

657
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,973
No one.

658
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,478
See, I know Sam.

659
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,392
I mean, sure,
she can kick your lights out.

660
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,998
But a gun?

661
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:50,323
She hasn't got the balls.

662
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,698
- Fuck.

663
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,041
- Leo...

664
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,148
- You shut up!

665
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,570
Take it.

666
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:45,415
- Please... Leo.

667
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:01,973
- All right, genius.
Let's get to work.

668
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:29,570
- Sam.

669
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:39,003
After we bypass
the laser security grid,

670
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:40,608
we have to deal
with the vault itself.

671
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:44,722
It's a keypad orientation, not unlike
the alarm panel in the lobby.

672
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,330
But, uh...

673
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:49,037
- But what?

674
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:51,045
- But eight digits.

675
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:53,353
- Yikes.
- And unlike the front door,

676
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:56,364
we have to hit the vault's combination
on the first three attempts.

677
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:58,571
- Three failed attempts drops the alarm.
- Exactly.

678
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:02,284
And the safe defaults to dead-set,
then no one gets in.

679
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:04,391
The vault company has to come

680
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:06,398
and reprogram
a whole new combination.

681
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,516
- Any way
of bypassing the keypad?

682
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:15,932
- Uh, no way... not without burning
a big, ugly hole to get at the guts.

683
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:22,755
- So, what are you thinking?

684
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,386
Warning, warning, warning.

685
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:33,593
- You're going in twice,
aren't you?

686
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:36,704
- Now you go to the front
of the class, Leo.

687
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:44,632
- Wow, you downloaded
all these recipes from the Internet?

688
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:48,144
- Yeah. My favourite
is the, uh, Hawaiian chicken,

689
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:50,552
because I-I love
canned pineapple.

690
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:54,165
- Me too. Ha-ha!
We have so much in common.

691
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:55,770
It's uncanny.

692
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:59,383
- Um, would you like
a copy of the recipe?

693
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:07,813
Everything seemed
to turn to gold and such

694
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:09,517
Well you must be

695
00:45:09,518 --> 00:45:11,124
The queen of alchemy

696
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:13,833
You changed me
through and through

697
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:17,848
- Maybe we could go back
to your place and print it out?

698
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,955
My name is Sandi.

699
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:22,363
- I'm, I'm... I'm Larry.

700
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,277
- Hi, Larry.

701
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:06,718
- Good.

702
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,545
Lawrence is engaged
for the evening.

703
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,054
You're a go.
- Copy that.

704
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:18,660
- Oh, shit!

705
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:23,075
- What? Ooh!

706
00:46:23,276 --> 00:46:25,082
- What is it? What? What?

707
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:28,595
- Oh, crikey, Rob.
- I almost stepped on it.

708
00:46:28,695 --> 00:46:29,899
It could've bit me.

709
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,412
- I'm going to bite you
if you don't get off!

710
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:57,897
You tapped in?

711
00:46:58,098 --> 00:47:00,807
- Yeah.

712
00:47:00,907 --> 00:47:04,520
Um, can't we use the stairs?

713
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,828
- No. There's a security camera
on every third floor.

714
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:08,936
- Anyway, stairs are for girls!

715
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,971
Woo-hoo!

716
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:20,777
I can't hear you calling

717
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:23,787
I know that's all right

718
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,798
You can keep on calling me

719
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:29,006
Until you see the light

720
00:47:29,206 --> 00:47:31,314
I don't need the aggravation

721
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,023
You're giving me all along

722
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,230
You you do all the chasing

723
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:38,438
But how I think
it's all wrong...

724
00:47:40,947 --> 00:47:42,653
Yeah, baby!

725
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:45,564
I can't hear you calling...

726
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:51,183
I can't hear you calling

727
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:57,204
- All right, we got
120 permutations in 10 minutes.

728
00:47:57,405 --> 00:47:58,810
Let's rock.

729
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,314
685...

730
00:48:00,415 --> 00:48:03,024
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
six is not one of the numbers.

731
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:05,533
- No, I listed these permutations
from the numbers you gave me.

732
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:08,042
- I never gave you the number six.
- Yes, you did.

733
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:10,451
I wrote them down:
You said, 68521.

734
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,267
Oh... no, 12589.

735
00:48:15,468 --> 00:48:16,973
Not six.

736
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:19,281
- We are on a heist
with Gilligan.

737
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:22,392
- Do you need a juice
or something?

738
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,305
- Heads up.

739
00:48:26,506 --> 00:48:28,212
Security is on the move.

740
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:30,219
- He is a little early, Sam.

741
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,330
- What do you want? I only had
a week to scout his movements.

742
00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:34,936
- When will he reach this floor?

743
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,640
- Starts at the top.
Five minutes, maybe.

744
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,046
- Climb up. Track him.

745
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,154
92815.

746
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:41,960
- Negative.

747
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:43,466
- 92158.

748
00:48:57,113 --> 00:48:59,121
- Oh, shit.

749
00:49:17,284 --> 00:49:19,592
- 51298.
- Negative.

750
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:21,297
- 92518.

751
00:49:21,298 --> 00:49:24,007
- Negative.
- 92581.

752
00:49:24,207 --> 00:49:26,014
- Negative.

753
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,046
- He is on 29. How are you coming?
- Not yet...

754
00:49:35,247 --> 00:49:37,855
Don't interrupt again until
he's one floor above, then we'll bail.

755
00:49:38,056 --> 00:49:40,364
Go, fast!
- 91258.

756
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:50,800
- He's on 23... get out of there.
- Negative.

757
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:54,714
- Uh, 12985. 18952.

758
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:56,621
18529.

759
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:58,428
18925.

760
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,933
18295.

761
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:02,441
Uh, all right,

762
00:50:02,642 --> 00:50:05,151
81259.
- O K.

763
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:07,660
It's open. Get in here.
Go, Sam, go.

764
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,165
Go, go, now!

765
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,684
- Shit.

766
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,700
- Come on, come on, come on...

767
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:03,554
We did it. Ha-ha...

768
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:07,067
We actually broke in somewhere.

769
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:09,576
- Yeah, it feels kind of weird.

770
00:51:11,282 --> 00:51:13,188
Not like I imagined.

771
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:19,109
- Yeah, now we're inside,
it feels...

772
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,317
not so...
- Not so bad.

773
00:51:24,127 --> 00:51:25,832
- Not so scary.

774
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:28,542
- I'm feeling kind of...

775
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:31,954
kind of tingly, you know,
like right... right in here.

776
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,663
- Tingly?

777
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:36,972
No kidding?

778
00:51:37,171 --> 00:51:38,576
- What the hell
are you thinking?!

779
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:41,587
This isn't a game. Stay focused.

780
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:48,412
And you, save your introspection
for your diary.

781
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:05,169
Everything OK?

782
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:10,589
It's just, you usually pick
these in 30 seconds max.

783
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,195
It's coming up on four minutes.

784
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:18,516
Look, it's OK, Kev,
you just got to...

785
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:22,029
- Don't... tell me to relax.

786
00:52:55,746 --> 00:52:57,151
Don't...

787
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:01,175
Do you think
you can get under it?

788
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,590
- You've got to be kidding me.

789
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,511
- Well... we'll get you there.

790
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:13,718
Just not today.

791
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:17,532
Today you just have
to hit the buttons.

792
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,349
- Ha... sweet.

793
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:47,035
- Everything good?

794
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:50,146
- Yeah...

795
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:53,156
Sweet... camera's set.

796
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:00,181
- Uh-oh... strike one.

797
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:13,829
- Time's ticking.

798
00:55:14,029 --> 00:55:17,441
What's your status?
- Standby... asshole.

799
00:55:19,046 --> 00:55:21,254
- You, uh, you sure
that will evaporate by morning?

800
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:25,269
- It will be gone. It's dry ice.

801
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,984
- Hoo-ah! Strike two.

802
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:32,694
A few more hits and we'll foul
the third combination.

803
00:55:39,317 --> 00:55:40,722
What?

804
00:55:40,822 --> 00:55:42,328
- Nice eggy.

805
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:44,937
- All right, OK, that's enough.

806
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:46,743
Let's pack it up and move.

807
00:55:49,152 --> 00:55:51,961
Ow! What did you do that for?

808
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:55,072
- Haven't got the balls...
my ass.

809
00:55:55,373 --> 00:55:56,778
Kev!

810
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:19,658
- Where is Leo?

811
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,966
- Over there.

812
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:25,981
- Then whose car is this, Rob?

813
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:28,388
- Pretty flash, huh?

814
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:32,202
See you in the morning.

815
00:57:02,608 --> 00:57:05,618
- I don't know.
It's your damn vault.

816
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:08,428
I was punching in the numbers
and it just went crazy.

817
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:11,238
Now, get someone
down here and fix it.

818
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:13,848
- Are you guys getting this?

819
00:57:14,048 --> 00:57:16,255
Somebody hit that alarm
with a chair or something!

820
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:18,965
Oh, God,
would you look at him?

821
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,875
Why doesn't somebody hit him
with a chair?

822
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:23,682
Oh, Sandi's the best.

823
00:57:23,782 --> 00:57:26,592
That is one lucky loser.

824
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:28,699
- It's not fair.

825
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,810
I mean, I put my ass on the line
busting in there

826
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:34,921
and "Master Bates" is living
a freaking Penthouse fantasy.

827
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:37,129
I haven't been laid in a year.

828
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,735
- Liar.

829
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:40,741
- I'm not. It's been a whole year.

830
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,246
- Year, my ass.

831
00:57:42,346 --> 00:57:45,357
I've known you for six
and you've never been laid.

832
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,282
Sucker.

833
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:02,718
Standby, vault engineer
is out of the security area.

834
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:05,628
- Good thing you're not charging
by the hour. Took long enough.

835
00:58:05,828 --> 00:58:07,734
Why couldn't we just reprogram
the old combinations?

836
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,545
- Security protocol.
For your protection.

837
00:58:10,846 --> 00:58:14,359
It's in the contract.
Memorize this, then I'll destroy it.

838
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,466
- Punch in.

839
00:58:19,075 --> 00:58:20,679
Can you get it?

840
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,688
See, it's on a tilt here.

841
00:58:22,788 --> 00:58:24,996
Can't hold focus.
- Then zoom in some more.

842
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:28,007
- No, it will over-pixilate.
- We can't read it.

843
00:58:28,207 --> 00:58:31,016
- Let him work.

844
00:58:31,117 --> 00:58:32,723
Got it.

845
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,737
- Oh, damn it.

846
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:39,647
- Give me a minute, all right?
I'll... roll the tape back.

847
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:42,757
I'll use
a few algorithmic filters.

848
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:47,474
Vault engineer
leaving the president's office.

849
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,681
The vault technician's
coming out of the building.

850
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:52,894
He's wearing blue coveralls. Follow
him. Don't move on him till I say.

851
00:58:53,093 --> 00:58:55,803
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Just in case.

852
00:58:56,004 --> 00:58:58,011
- What? You can't force
the combination from the tech.

853
00:58:58,111 --> 00:59:00,821
- If I have to.
- That's not part of the plan.

854
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:03,430
- It is now.
- You said that nobody gets hurt.

855
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:05,637
- Maybe, maybe not.
My job, my call.

856
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:08,648
- No! This is my plan.
You can't go changing the rules.

857
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:11,257
- Fuck your rules!
- Fuck your job!

858
00:59:16,777 --> 00:59:18,181
- I got it.

859
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,095
Clear as a bell.

860
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:37,148
We're two days away
from $20 million.

861
00:59:37,348 --> 00:59:39,657
Do not fuck this up.

862
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:45,577
- $20 million?
What are you talking about?

863
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:47,584
I'm talking about
a lot of money.

864
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,494
A square cut...
if you don't blow this.

865
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:52,702
- Do you even remember
why we're doing this?

866
00:59:58,121 --> 00:59:59,726
Fine.

867
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:01,432
Whatever.

868
01:00:01,433 --> 01:00:05,447
Hey! Just don't you forget
those Hamish plans.

869
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:07,955
- Of course.

870
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:30,032
- So, then, we pulled the security
tapes from Hamish Jewellery

871
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:32,039
and, you know,
I could swear the guy

872
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,347
with the glasses
and the Polaroid is you.

873
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:37,458
It's not much to go on, I know,

874
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:39,566
but it was enough
for a search warrant.

875
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:41,071
Nothing usable.

876
01:00:41,172 --> 01:00:43,981
- Left it nice and tidy.
- Yeah.

877
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:46,791
- You black or white?

878
01:00:46,891 --> 01:00:49,300
- Black.

879
01:00:51,206 --> 01:00:53,013
- You are in trouble, Kevin.

880
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:57,929
White's closing in
from all sides

881
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,635
and you are still
playing offense.

882
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:02,646
You're too clever for your own good,
if you ask me.

883
01:01:02,747 --> 01:01:04,754
- I didn't.

884
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:15,289
- Hi.

885
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,197
- Move. Where's Leo?

886
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:19,906
You know, for a genius,

887
01:01:20,107 --> 01:01:22,214
you really can act
like an idiot, you know that!

888
01:01:22,415 --> 01:01:24,020
- You said the cops
wouldn't be back!

889
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:26,329
- So you came here? You've been
followed before, Einstein!

890
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,340
- How smart was it to flag me
in the first place, huh?

891
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,647
- You could have blown
the whole job!

892
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,980
- I'm done down there, Kenny,
you can lock it back up.

893
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:42,585
- All right, fine.

894
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:48,004
- Leo protects his wine
like other people protect their money.

895
01:02:22,123 --> 01:02:23,629
Thought I told you don't move.

896
01:02:25,837 --> 01:02:28,346
- And you can keep
your damn souvenir diamonds.

897
01:02:28,546 --> 01:02:31,556
As of tomorrow, all ties are cut
and we're done. Let's go.

898
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:33,864
- See you, Lurch.

899
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,595
- What?

900
01:02:42,696 --> 01:02:46,810
- I know where our plans
are hidden.

901
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:49,620
- Now when I was
a young boy...

902
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:54,437
- I'm closed!

903
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,361
...the greatest man alive

904
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:02,866
Now I'm a man...

905
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:06,981
OK, OK, OK...
Look, I'm sorry, I'm closed.

906
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:10,894
- Oh, no.
But I really need your help.

907
01:03:11,195 --> 01:03:13,704
My TV went all fuzzy,
and the game's on tonight and...

908
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:15,609
Could you take a quick look?

909
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:18,922
- Yeah, um, I'm closed.

910
01:03:19,223 --> 01:03:23,036
- I'd really appreciate it.
And Leo said you were the best.

911
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,946
- Leo said?
- Mm-hmm.

912
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:28,556
- Oh, well, all right, sure.
I'll take a quick peek.

913
01:03:28,756 --> 01:03:31,666
Here, let me.

914
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,677
No "B"

915
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,084
"O" child

916
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:39,092
- Damn it!

917
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:47,823
Yeah?

918
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,628
- Hey, Lurch, it's Sam.

919
01:03:49,629 --> 01:03:51,034
- What do you want?

920
01:03:55,149 --> 01:03:56,452
What the fuck?

921
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:00,567
Hang on. I got crap coming out
of this phone.

922
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:03,176
- Never mind that.
You got to listen to me.

923
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:04,782
Leo's in danger.

924
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:07,090
I think Kevin will break
into the restaurant tonight.

925
01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:08,595
- What?

926
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:11,907
No way. Not going to get by...

927
01:04:12,107 --> 01:04:14,013
- Don't be so sure.

928
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:15,921
Know what
dimethyl sulfoxide is?

929
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:17,627
It's a tissue solvent.

930
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:20,838
You mix it with about
4 or 5 milligrams of ketamine,

931
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:23,045
and, uh, apply it directly
to your face

932
01:04:23,246 --> 01:04:25,454
and, oh, Kenny,
you'd be out in no time.

933
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:27,360
Know what I mean?

934
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:29,569
Ken?

935
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,175
Kenny?

936
01:04:31,977 --> 01:04:34,485
Kenny?

937
01:04:36,994 --> 01:04:38,801
How long will he be out?

938
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,113
- That dose? 10 to 15 minutes.

939
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:48,836
Maybe a little closer to 20.

940
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,214
- Hello.

941
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:16,834
- All right... Step back.

942
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:19,443
Let's see here.

943
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:25,664
Hmm...

944
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:27,270
Bingo.

945
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,076
- Cute.

946
01:05:36,201 --> 01:05:38,308
Hoo-ah!

947
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:41,921
- Check that.

948
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,350
I think l just got
your tingly feeling.

949
01:05:55,067 --> 01:05:56,472
- Crikey.

950
01:06:05,102 --> 01:06:07,410
- You know,

951
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:09,918
I don't remember hearing
about this part of the plan.

952
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:12,327
Did I miss an important vote
or something?

953
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,836
I mean, you really should have
sent me a memo.

954
01:06:27,781 --> 01:06:32,598
You know, when Leo told me
you gave the diamonds back,

955
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:37,615
I knew you were making a play...
l just knew it.

956
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:40,727
Oh...

957
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:44,540
Thank you.

958
01:06:46,245 --> 01:06:49,457
Hmm... the old ultraviolet-ink-

959
01:06:49,657 --> 01:06:52,066
on-the-envelope trick.

960
01:06:56,783 --> 01:07:01,398
Who are you to take
this opportunity away from me?

961
01:07:01,499 --> 01:07:06,416
You arrogant, feeble fuck.

962
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:08,925
- Rob, we just...

963
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,530
- Oh, we, we.

964
01:07:10,731 --> 01:07:12,537
We... like what?
You, me and Sam?

965
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:15,548
Or we like, you and Sam
and fuck Rob!

966
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:25,884
- These gentlemen
will escort you home.

967
01:07:25,984 --> 01:07:28,292
And you will remain
under their supervision

968
01:07:28,493 --> 01:07:31,404
until we reconvene

969
01:07:31,604 --> 01:07:35,919
in 19 hours and 22 minutes.

970
01:07:39,532 --> 01:07:42,141
After that...

971
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:43,947
none of you leaves my sight.

972
01:07:44,048 --> 01:07:45,954
No more games.

973
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,968
- I'm going in with you
tomorrow night.

974
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:52,377
- Leo, I'll be there.
- No offense, Robert,

975
01:07:52,477 --> 01:07:56,090
but if you want something protected,
you have to protect it yourself.

976
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:03,214
Show them out.

977
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:13,158
Are you sure it will evaporate
by morning?

978
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,065
- It will be gone.

979
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,121
Hey.

980
01:09:31,322 --> 01:09:32,828
I have an idea.

981
01:09:32,928 --> 01:09:34,734
Why don't you go help Mini-Me

982
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:37,543
take down the spy-cam
in the president's office?

983
01:09:37,744 --> 01:09:39,450
- Don't be smart.

984
01:09:51,492 --> 01:09:53,399
- All set.

985
01:10:05,642 --> 01:10:07,248
You're sure you measured right?

986
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,556
- Yes, I'm sure.

987
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:13,368
You might want to exhale first.

988
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:20,394
Maybe I should give you
a go signal.

989
01:10:20,494 --> 01:10:21,899
- Fine.

990
01:10:21,999 --> 01:10:23,604
- Go.

991
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:14,783
- Ready.

992
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:17,392
- Seven.

993
01:11:17,593 --> 01:11:19,901
- No more, Sam.

994
01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:28,732
- Six.

995
01:11:32,044 --> 01:11:35,054
Two.

996
01:11:40,372 --> 01:11:41,978
Five.

997
01:11:43,985 --> 01:11:45,591
Five.

998
01:12:24,025 --> 01:12:26,333
- Found them.
Send in the dummies.

999
01:12:26,533 --> 01:12:28,641
- Ha, nice try.

1000
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:30,848
First, you send out the bonds,

1001
01:12:30,849 --> 01:12:32,655
then I send in the forgeries.

1002
01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:34,763
- What, you don't trust us?

1003
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:37,672
Ha, so why should we trust you?

1004
01:12:37,873 --> 01:12:40,884
Maybe now would be a good time
to hand over the Hamish plans.

1005
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:43,292
- You get when I say.

1006
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,905
- Here is the forged set.

1007
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:51,822
All right, we'll destroy the plans
when we get back to the restaurant.

1008
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:54,431
It's all right, Kev.

1009
01:12:54,632 --> 01:12:56,037
Leo promised.

1010
01:12:56,237 --> 01:12:58,044
- Hey, get the fuck
away from me.

1011
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,807
Leo, some help moving this stuff

1012
01:13:44,907 --> 01:13:47,015
would get us out of here
a lot faster.

1013
01:13:58,756 --> 01:14:00,462
- Sam.

1014
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,680
- What would be the point now?

1015
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,701
- It's not over till we're out.
Keep pushing.

1016
01:14:29,061 --> 01:14:30,667
- You're next.

1017
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:41,705
- Rob?

1018
01:14:41,906 --> 01:14:44,515
What the hell are you doing?
- Rob?

1019
01:14:44,616 --> 01:14:46,322
Stop this thing!

1020
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,927
Hey!

1021
01:14:47,928 --> 01:14:49,934
- What are you doing, Rob?

1022
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:51,841
What's going on?

1023
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:54,350
- What are you doing?
- Let us up!

1024
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,260
- Leo, I'm not sure
I can do this.

1025
01:14:57,461 --> 01:14:59,970
- You're not sure?
It was your plot, mate.

1026
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:03,481
Standing there, staring at me
with those cold shark eyes.

1027
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,589
"They're dead weight, Leo,
just take them"

1028
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:07,395
"out of the equation
and it's foolproof."

1029
01:15:07,496 --> 01:15:09,503
I knew it.

1030
01:15:09,703 --> 01:15:11,510
With you, it's all talk,
isn't it?

1031
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:12,915
Well, next time, boy-o,

1032
01:15:13,116 --> 01:15:15,724
unless you've got the guts for it,
keep your mouth shut.

1033
01:15:15,824 --> 01:15:17,430
Don't let him
control you, Rob.

1034
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:20,642
Just let us up. Rob!

1035
01:15:20,943 --> 01:15:23,552
Don't be so feeble!

1036
01:15:28,569 --> 01:15:29,974
Think about
what you're doing.

1037
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,580
Don't do this, Rob!

1038
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,992
You traitor.
I'm going to kill you!

1039
01:15:35,092 --> 01:15:38,303
You're dead! You hear me?

1040
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:40,209
Rob?

1041
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,815
Dead, Rob!

1042
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:08,609
- Sh... it! Oh, shit.

1043
01:16:33,195 --> 01:16:35,001
- Holy...

1044
01:16:37,711 --> 01:16:41,022
- Well, it will be a few weeks
before the cops figure out

1045
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:43,330
what the hell they were doing
in that mess.

1046
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:44,936
That gives us plenty of time

1047
01:16:45,036 --> 01:16:48,348
to climb down the shaft
at the other end of the building.

1048
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:00,992
Come on.

1049
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:20,962
- Oh, my God. Damn it!

1050
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,789
- What?

1051
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:30,394
Shit!

1052
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,409
- Well, at least we know
where to find them.

1053
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:07,925
Whoa!

1054
01:18:08,026 --> 01:18:09,832
Jesus...

1055
01:18:18,562 --> 01:18:19,967
They're not in here.

1056
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:21,573
- You looking for these?

1057
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,106
- So much for the no-guns rule.

1058
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:34,619
- Ha... don't tell Kev.

1059
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:41,041
You know, I got to admit,

1060
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:44,051
I knew we lost you.

1061
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:46,962
But this...

1062
01:18:48,969 --> 01:18:53,484
You've... come a long way...
Robert.

1063
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:57,699
- Come on, Sammy,
you're bleeding out.

1064
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,405
Look, just give us the bonds

1065
01:18:59,606 --> 01:19:02,015
and I promise, I'll help you
till somebody gets here.

1066
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:03,620
- Ha...

1067
01:19:05,526 --> 01:19:08,236
Come on, there's no time.

1068
01:19:17,468 --> 01:19:19,776
What do you say?

1069
01:19:25,296 --> 01:19:29,008
- I say... balls.

1070
01:20:56,213 --> 01:20:58,822
You got laid, didn't you?

1071
01:21:03,037 --> 01:21:05,044
- How could you possibly know?

1072
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,691
Well, it's freaky,
that's what it is.

1073
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,197
- Yeah.

1074
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:45,385
Man, you jumped.

1075
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:48,395
- Yeah, for a moment,
I didn't think you made it out.

1076
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,038
- What the hell happened?

1077
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:31,144
- The fire started
in the basement.

1078
01:22:31,244 --> 01:22:33,352
By the time the alarm went,
flames were everywhere.

1079
01:22:33,452 --> 01:22:35,058
I couldn't get to the stuff,
Leo.

1080
01:22:42,785 --> 01:22:45,093
- Leo The Touch, I presume.

1081
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,200
- Oh, don't get familiar...
sheriff.

1082
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,308
- It's detective, actually.
You do this?

1083
01:22:52,018 --> 01:22:53,122
- Why would I?

1084
01:22:53,322 --> 01:22:55,429
- I got an anonymous call
about a half-hour ago.

1085
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:57,135
You mind?

1086
01:22:57,235 --> 01:22:59,845
- It's on my back.
Permit's in my wallet.

1087
01:23:00,045 --> 01:23:01,952
- Caller said you pulled
the Hamish diamond job.

1088
01:23:02,053 --> 01:23:03,759
- You can't believe anything
that comes from

1089
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:05,766
that bloody Crime Stoppers line,
now, can you?

1090
01:23:05,966 --> 01:23:08,073
- This has been fired recently.

1091
01:23:08,173 --> 01:23:10,482
- Target practice.

1092
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:12,589
- You target practice with blanks?

1093
01:23:15,901 --> 01:23:17,808
I say... balls.

1094
01:23:21,018 --> 01:23:23,226
- Leo, some help
moving this stuff

1095
01:23:23,427 --> 01:23:25,534
would get us out of here
a lot faster.

1096
01:23:36,573 --> 01:23:37,878
- Hey, Detective!

1097
01:23:38,078 --> 01:23:40,888
We may have found what
you're looking for in the basement.

1098
01:23:41,089 --> 01:23:43,998
- Well, it's not mine.
My lawyer will prove that.

1099
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,006
- Then you won't mind
if we open it.

1100
01:23:46,106 --> 01:23:47,812
- Be my guest.

1101
01:23:47,912 --> 01:23:50,020
Mind the fingerprints.

1102
01:23:55,438 --> 01:23:56,843
- Looks like a bond.

1103
01:23:59,252 --> 01:24:01,259
- Bearer bond.

1104
01:24:22,935 --> 01:24:24,439
Get these downtown.

1105
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,053
And, as the man says...

1106
01:24:28,254 --> 01:24:30,461
be careful with the prints.

1107
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:36,783
Well, you're looking
a little peevish, Leo.

1108
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,548
- Sh... it! Oh, shit.

1109
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:00,566
OK. OK, you got to jump.

1110
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:02,373
They're burning faster
than we thought.

1111
01:25:02,573 --> 01:25:04,479
You've got to get to me now.

1112
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,788
Hey. Hey, look at me.

1113
01:25:06,989 --> 01:25:08,794
Hey, Sam, you look at me, OK?

1114
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:14,113
We're foolproof... right?

1115
01:25:48,634 --> 01:25:49,938
Sam?

1116
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:51,444
- Yes, Kevin.

1117
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:53,050
- Hold on.

1118
01:26:08,202 --> 01:26:11,213
Here... take my hand.

1119
01:26:11,413 --> 01:26:12,818
- Cute.
- You got it?

1120
01:26:12,919 --> 01:26:15,428
- Do you mind?
I got to get down there and die.

1121
01:26:15,528 --> 01:26:17,033
Good luck.

1122
01:26:43,827 --> 01:26:47,238
Hoo-ah... ha-ha-ha...
Hoo-ah...

1123
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:48,944
Ha-ha-ha...

1124
01:26:49,145 --> 01:26:51,654
Hoo-ah... ha-ha-ha...

1125
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:22,762
I was in the right place

1126
01:27:22,963 --> 01:27:25,271
But it must have been
the wrong time

1127
01:27:25,472 --> 01:27:27,780
I was saying
all the right things

1128
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:30,590
But I must have used
the wrong line

1129
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,897
And I was on the right trip

1130
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:35,607
But I must have used
the wrong car

1131
01:27:35,808 --> 01:27:38,116
My head is in a bad place

1132
01:27:38,317 --> 01:27:40,625
And I wonder
what it's good for

1133
01:27:40,826 --> 01:27:43,134
'Cause I was
in the right place

1134
01:27:43,335 --> 01:27:45,642
But it must have been
the wrong time

1135
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,750
'Cause I was
in the right world

1136
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:50,660
But it seemed
like the wrong wrong wrong...

1137
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:09,927
- Well...

1138
01:28:10,027 --> 01:28:11,733
- I got them.

1139
01:28:11,934 --> 01:28:13,640
- We did it!
- We did it!

1140
01:28:16,852 --> 01:28:19,160
- Man, we... we did it.

1141
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,370
I can't believe
we actually pulled it off.

1142
01:28:24,076 --> 01:28:26,184
We really did it.
- No...

1143
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,689
you did it!

1144
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,998
You pulled it off.
What a performance.

1145
01:28:30,198 --> 01:28:31,903
Robert, you are the man!

1146
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:33,308
Whoo-hoo!

1147
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:36,419
- Ahh! Ha, ha...
- Hoo-ah!

1148
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,731
- Yeah! Whoo!

1149
01:28:39,932 --> 01:28:44,047
- We've got one last bit of business
that we've got to deal with.

1150
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,361
The diamonds.

1151
01:28:49,164 --> 01:28:50,368
- The diamonds.

1152
01:28:51,272 --> 01:28:52,275
- The diamonds.

1153
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:57,794
- Souvenirs?

1154
01:28:58,998 --> 01:29:00,604
Kidding.

1155
01:29:02,109 --> 01:29:03,314
- You know, we never did look

1156
01:29:03,414 --> 01:29:05,220
into the process
of fencing diamonds, did we?

1157
01:29:05,321 --> 01:29:07,930
- Oh, God, Rob.
- We'll return them as planned,

1158
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:09,435
for sure. All I'm saying is,

1159
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:11,442
why not keep them
for a couple more days,

1160
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:13,650
you know, just to see
if we learn more?

1161
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:17,262
- All right, then, well, let's put it
to a vote then, shall we?

1162
01:29:17,563 --> 01:29:20,374
All those opposed? Nay.

1163
01:29:20,574 --> 01:29:22,681
Sam?

1164
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:27,798
- Kidding... still kidding.

1165
01:29:27,799 --> 01:29:30,709
- Ha, ha...
Yeah, but you have to say "nay."

1166
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:33,018
- Right.

1167
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,422
- Sam!

1168
01:29:34,622 --> 01:29:36,329
- What was the motion again?

1169
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,160
Yes!

1170
01:29:51,984 --> 01:29:55,195
Whoo! I love this car!

1171
01:29:56,305 --> 01:30:56,398

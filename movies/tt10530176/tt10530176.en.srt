SUNG-HO'S STRAWBERRIES

3
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,389
Hey. Why did you only show up now?

4
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,020
Did you go see your mom at the hospital?

5
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,398
Sung-ho.

6
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,945
Can I borrow your phone?

7
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,200
No answer?

8
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,494
No.

9
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,663
Do you have any idea where you left it?

10
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,666
I think I left it on the train.

11
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,794
You can use mine for the day.
I'm not expecting calls anyway.

12
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,588
It's okay.
I'm sure there's a phone at home.

13
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,674
At home?

14
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,764
This house is still the best one
in the village.

15
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,624
<i>Hello?</i>

16
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,586
Hello. You found this phone, right?

17
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,629
<i>Yes.</i>

18
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,468
I'm the owner of that phone.
Did I leave it on the train?

19
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,094
<i>Yes.</i>

20
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,599
Where are you?
I'll come and pick it up from you.

21
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,560
<i>-Maybe she'll give us some money. Ask her.</i>
<i>-You ask her.</i>

22
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,145
<i>Is there a reward?</i>

23
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:50,980
Sorry?

24
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,441
<i>This is a Galaxy Note 9, right?</i>

25
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,777
<i>We'll call you back.</i>

26
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,570
Hello?

27
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,203
<i>The number you have called is currently</i>
<i>unavailable. Please leave a message…</i>

28
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,748
<i>The number you have called…</i>

29
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,709
FIND MY DEVICE

30
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,301
LOOKING FOR MY DEVICE

31
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,304
Hello?

32
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,934
<i>You were right.</i>

33
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,395
<i>My mom's insane.</i>

34
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,189
<i>I'm totally locked up in the house.</i>

35
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,234
I'm sorry,
but who were you trying to call?

36
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,153
<i>Isn't this Sun-hee's number?</i>

37
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,574
No, I think you have the wrong number…

38
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,837
Do you see this film
covering the right side of the brain?

39
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,464
This surgery requires us to make
an incision on the skin,

40
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,510
then we must split the skull
in order to remove the tumor.

41
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,971
We can't perform the surgery here.

42
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,141
It's a complicated procedure,
so she'll need to go to a bigger hospital.

43
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,478
A one or two millimeter difference
can lead to a coma or a paralysis.

44
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,653
You're cutting away all the fruit.

45
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,369
Do you remember Young-mi?

46
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,204
No.

47
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,541
You know,
my friend who works in insurance.

48
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,710
She has fair skin and a high nose bridge.

49
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,712
What about her?

50
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,258
She'll take care of it.

51
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,885
Take care of what?

52
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,054
What do you think? The insurance payout.

53
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,807
It's impossible to save up 100 million won
working at a convenience store.

54
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,311
You should…

55
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,773
go visit Dad's grave tomorrow.

56
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,443
Ask the manager there

57
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,738
if I should be buried beside him,

58
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,199
or if we should be buried together.

59
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,080
Mom, how can you even say that?

60
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,209
What?

61
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,004
Do you think you have the right
to be buried next to Dad?

62
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,132
What?

63
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,385
Am I wrong?

64
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,181
You shouldn't talk like that.

65
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,823
Do you still feel like painting your nails
in this situation?

66
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,418
FEBRUARY 24, 1965 – NOVEMBER 27, 1999

00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,354
Hello?

68
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,732
<i>Sun-hee! I think Mom's trying to kill me.</i>

69
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,692
I'm sorry?

70
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:27,738
<i>Come over now. You know my address, right?</i>
<i>4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup!</i>

71
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,075
Who are you? You keep calling me.

72
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,703
<i>Isn't this Sun-hee's store?</i>

73
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,913
No, it's not.

74
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,417
<i>Bullshit. Are you doing this on purpose?</i>

75
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,877
What?

76
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,772

FIRE FLOODING REPELS GHOSTS
BY BURNING THEM

79
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,624
THE PLAGUED BATHROOM SHALL BE BURNT DOWN
IN SECRET AND MOTHER SETS ME ON FIRE

80
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,520
Do you know her?

81
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,856
Young-sook…

82
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,150
Young-sook?

83
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,030
Was she a shaman?

84
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,077
No, not Young-sook. But her mother was.

85
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,789
Did our house used to belong to a shaman?

86
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,083
No, I wouldn't say that.

87
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,044
You just said her mother was a shaman.

88
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,550
Well, that was ages ago.

89
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,136
It was back in the '90s,
so I hardly remember anything.

90
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,306
-But you knew her name--
-Strawberry, what's this?

91
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,599
I told you not to do this.

92
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,186
How many times do I have to tell you?
Come here. Come.

93
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,312
Come here.

94
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,354
Come on! Come here.

95
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,739

<i>Sun-hee, please come help me! Hurry!</i>

98
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,282
What?

99
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>Mom's trying to set me on fire now!</i>

100
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,204
<i>My mom is trying to…</i>

101
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,250
Hello?

102
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,465
<i>Hello?</i>

103
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,665
Give it here.

104
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,460
<i>Hello?</i>

105
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,008
<i>Why didn't you come yesterday?</i>

106
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,802
<i>How can you do this to me?</i>

107
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:34,350
Is your address really
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup?

108
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,687
<i>Isn't this Sun-hee?</i>

109
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,651
I saw your picture, Ms. Oh Young-sook.

110
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,405
The one that was taken
on November 26, 1999.

111
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
<i>What?</i>

112
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,495
But it's the 18th today.

Are you watching me right now?

<i>This is going to be hard to believe,</i>

118
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,953
but I think…

119
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,874
we're in the same house right now.

120
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm sorry.
I must've called the wrong number.

121

Does this even work?

Do you want to go back
to the mental hospital?

137
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,932
Do you want to end up like your mom?

138
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,986
Oh Young-sook.

139

Oh Young-sook.

140
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,387
This is happening

He'll return from the States

It sounds like him, but…

00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,915
So there's a computer inside the phone?

<i>Yes.</i>

160

00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,382
Do you have Walkmans?

163
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,468
"Walkmans"?

164
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,552
Yes.

165
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,722
Don't you know what they are?

166
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,015
<i>They play music.</i>

167
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,183
Oh, music?

168
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,685
Of course you can.

169
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,147
You can take pictures, watch movies,
and even shop on your phone.

170
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,525
Sounds like you're lying to me.

171
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,820
<i>I can understand. When I was young,</i>

172
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,614
I never imagined
we'd be able to make video calls.

173
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,573
<i>Video calls?</i>

174
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,661
Yes, you can see the other person
while talking on the phone.

175
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,454
That's possible?

176
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,666
Are you curious about anything else?

177
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,004
I wonder what I'll be like.

178
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,759
Oh, good question.

179
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,220
You want me to find out?

180
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,555
OH YOUNG

181
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,472
<i>No.</i>

182
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,937
Why not?
Finding you would be a piece of cake.

183
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,482
My mom told me
that I'm cursed with a wretched fortune.

184
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,237
<i>She said I was born</i>
<i>with a brutal, atrocious fate.</i>

185
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,782
<i>Anyway, she's crazy.</i>

186
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,869
<i>She locks me up at home</i>
<i>and doesn't let me see anyone.</i>

187
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,081
Do you not get along with your mother?

188
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,416
<i>With my mom?</i>

189
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,043
That woman is not my real mom.

190
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,462
My real mom is dead.

191
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,426
I'm sorry.

192
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,677
<i>Why are you sorry?</i>

193
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,095
It's not like you killed her.

194
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,434
Actually, I also lost my dad
when I was young.

195
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,894
<i>Really?</i>

196
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,355
<i>How?</i>

197
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,231
There was a fire at our place.

198
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,942
My mom forgot to turn off the gas valve.

199
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,205
Hey, Young-sook.

200
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:54,998
Yes?

201
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,627
<i>What did you say the date was over there?</i>

202
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,888
Seo-yeon, I think my mom's coming.

203
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,932
<i>I'll call you back in a bit.</i>

204
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,100
Hey, wait.

205
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,557
NOVEMBER 21, 1999

206
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,657
We're here!

207
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,410
Wow! Chickens!

208
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,080
Hey, be careful. Don't run.

209
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,792
What a nice house! Isn't the air so clean?

210
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,089
A missionary used to live here.

211
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,301
It's a luxurious mansion,
which is hard to come by in this area.

212
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,635
I see.

213
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,555
You shouldn't touch that.

214
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,559
It's a nice location with good feng shui.

215
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,686
You know what our elders always say.

216
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,772
You've got to live on a good lot
to improve your health and wealth.

217
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,277
You said it's about 100 pyeong
both floors combined, right?

218
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,361
That's right.

219
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,905
It's pretty big.

220
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,657
Oh, they have fish.

221
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,284
Hey, don't run.

222
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,078
Look, it's spacious enough
for your kid to run around.

223
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,417
Could we see upstairs too?

224
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,313
Seo-yeon.

225
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,066
Seo-yeon?

226
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,529
Stop poking around in someone else's home.

227
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,368
What's that room for?

228
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,913
That's my daughter's room.

229
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,168
Just a moment.

230
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,762
Open the door.

231
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:02,936
Hello.

232
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,359
Dad.

233
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,152
That girl is scary.

234
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,195
Seo-yeon.

235
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,117
I'm so sorry.
She's too young to know better.

236
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,169
Is your name Seo-yeon?

237
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,180
Hello?

238
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,725
<i>Hey! Wake up. Now!</i>

239
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,227
What is it?

240
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,145
<i>Hold on.</i>

241
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,816
<i>I guess you're planning</i>
<i>to run a farm or something?</i>

242
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,361
<i>Yes. We want to live</i>
<i>in a quiet and peaceful place now.</i>

243
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,573
<i>And it'd be nice for my daughter</i>
<i>to grow up close to nature.</i>

244
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,868
<i>Oh, yeah? This is the best place for that.</i>

245
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,704
<i>I'm thinking of starting a flower farm.</i>

246
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,082
<i>Well, it won't be easy</i>
<i>for city folks like you.</i>

247
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,084
<i>I'm originally from Bosung.</i>

248
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,878
<i>Oh? Are you?</i>

249
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,713
<i>Yes, I sure am.</i>

250
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,007
Dad, come on. Chickens.

251
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,759
All right, let's go.

252
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,011
-Did you see them in the yard?
-Yes.

253
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,596
When did you see them?

254
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,769
Did you hear them?

255
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,562
What do you think?

256
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,690
<i>Hello?</i>

257
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,110
You're shocked, aren't you?

258
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,863
<i>Hey…</i>

259
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,074
Young-sook, I…

260
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,408
<i>What?</i>

261
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,161
<i>Can you…</i>

262
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,752
You know what? I have a fun idea.

263
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,468
Maybe I can

264
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,972
bring your dad back to life.

<i>You can eat all the good things at once</i>

<i>Get the nutrients you need, all at once</i>

271
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,287
<i>All at once</i>
<i>You don't need separate side dishes</i>

272
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,039
<i>You don't even need your chopsticks</i>

273
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,584
<i>Here are the ingredients you need</i>
<i>To make this nutritious hot pot rice</i>

274
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,004
<i>First, you need regular rice,</i>
<i>Sweet rice, and shiitake mushrooms</i>

275
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:03,635
<i>Second, fried tofu, peas, kidney beans</i>

<i>Chestnuts, pine nuts, and green onions</i>

Why do you look so dazed?

278
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,899
You should help out.
All you do is sleep during your breaks.

279
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,109
Come on.

280
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,152
Hey, look at this.

281
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,279
Look. It's a frog.

282
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,656
He probably snuck in
since it's cold outside.

283
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,574
How adorable.

284
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,536
He has such grumpy eyes.
He looks just like you.

285
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,087
What's the matter? Did something happen?

286

Hey.

287

Here, have some spinach.

297
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,115
It's a new soybean paste. Do you like it?

298
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,658
No wonder. It's good!

299
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,993
-Doesn't it taste great?
-Yes, it does.

300
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,458
-It's good.
-Why aren't you eating?

301
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,294
I'm about to.

Hello?

<i>Just a second, Dad. I'm on the phone.</i>

-Is it heavy?
-Yes, it's heavier than I thought.

321
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,905
It's the potatoes.
I'm going to make potato pancakes.

-Potato pancakes?
-Gosh, we'd better turn the lights on.

323
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,742
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

324
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,540
Hello?

325
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,504
Hello? Young-sook?

326
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,715
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

327
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,260
<i>-</i>What?
<i>-I thought you wanted me to call you back.</i>

328
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,475
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have you been calling all this time?

329
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,018
I was out with my parents.

330
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,230
<i>Oh…</i>

331
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,830
Come on, you had me worried for a second.
I thought you were mad at me.

332
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,556
<i>Shit…</i>

333
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,270
<i>God damn it.</i>

334
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,068
<i>You little bitch… Fuck.</i>

335
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,072
<i>Why you…</i>

336
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,868
Hey, are you okay? What's wrong?

337
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,203
<i>You bitch…</i>

338
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,205
<i>Hey!</i>

339
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,594
Hello?

340
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,013
Hello? Young-sook? Young-sook!

341
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,306
<i>Who is this?</i>

342
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,600
<i>Why are you talking</i>
<i>to Young-sook on the phone?</i>

343
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,686
<i>Don't ever call her again,</i>
<i>you could get hurt.</i>

344
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,107
Untie me! I said, untie me!

345
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,486
Untie me! Fuck!

346
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,112
Shit!

347
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,198
Hey!

348
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,604
Stop, Mom…

349
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,068
Mom, please stop.

350
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,651
Mom…

351
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,907
Mom, I'm sorry.

352
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,014
OH YOUNG-SOOK

MURDERED HER STEPDAUGHTER DURING EXORCISM

362
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,523
Young-sook.

363
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,901
You picked up fast today.

364
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,656
<i>Hey, about your mom…</i>

365
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,033
My mom?

366
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,245
Where is she right now?

367
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,374
Why are you asking?

368
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:58,046
<i>Young-sook, listen to me carefully.</i>

369
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,634
<i>I think…</i>

370
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,221
you're going to die tonight.

371
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,851
What are you talking about?

372
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,146
You already…

373
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,566
<i>died in this house.</i>

374
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,581
You really killed me.

375
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,424
Why did you do that?

376
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,807
Why did you want to kill me?

377
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,814
Your fortune says…

378
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,775
-What?
-…there are several deaths in your future.

379
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,293
Young-sook.

380
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,337
I don't care.

381
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,096
I have nothing to lose.

382
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,168
Answer me.

383
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,253
Why did you do that?

384
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,006
Why did you kill me?

385
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,008
Why?

386
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,053
Answer me! Now!

387
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,807
Are you still reciting that bullshit?

388
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,455
Hello?

389
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,378
Is that you, Young-sook?

390
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,756
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

391
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,302
Are you okay? Nothing happened, right?

392
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:36,932
<i>Yes, everything's good now.</i>
<i>Mom and I had a misunderstanding.</i>

393
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,267
I'm so glad.

394
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,270
I was really worried.

395
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,364
Are you sure you're okay?

396
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,449
<i>I feel like I've been reborn.</i>

397
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,535
<i>What?</i>

398
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,329
<i>It feels like my birthday today.</i>

399
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,902
Go on in.

400
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,195
Hey, Strawberry!

401
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,697
-Hello, Sung-ho.
-Hey, Seo-yeon. You're home.

402
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,992
My gosh, what's that?

403
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,660
-Hey, you.
-I just picked these.

404
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,120
You spoil us every year.

405
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,455
It's strawberry season.

406
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,040
My goodness.

407
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,169
They look so delicious.

408
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,879
These look especially good.

409
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,172
-Wash these.
-These are for you.

410
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,965
-Strawberries spoil fast.
-I'll do it.

411
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:34,883
No, it's fine.

412
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,094
-The fridge, please.
-Sure. Let's do that.

413
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,362
Is it a special day?

414
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,864
Do I look pretty?

415
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,210
I brought some strawberries.

416
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,003
Strawberries?

417
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,266
Come here.

418
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,987
Is your mom out?

419
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,374
Hey.

420
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,794
Which one looks better?

421
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,173
This one or this one?

422
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,176
I'm not sure. They both look good.

423
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,470
I don't know much about these things.

424
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,430
Really?

425
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,266
Hold on.

426
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,697
Jeez.

427
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,034
What is all this?

428
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,595
Hey!

429
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,222
Sung-ho, what about this one?

430
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,806
What…

431
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,392
What is this?

432
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,279
Why did you open that?

433
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,657
Blood…

434
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,843
I don't care for marriage.
I'm fine being single.

435
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,973
You should still get married.
Aren't you lonely?

436
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,684
No, I don't feel lonely at all.

437
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,731
Bark, bark. Is that so?

438
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,736
Hello?

439
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:51,079
<i>Don't… Please, don't…</i>

440
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,090
<i>Shit. I just bought these clothes.</i>

441
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,888
What was that?

442
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,657
Did Sung-ho leave?

443
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,660
Who?

444
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,578
Sung-ho.

445
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,248
Who's Sung-ho?

446
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,877
The owner of the strawberry farm.

447
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,588
Strawberry?

448
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,798
What are you talking about?

449
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:09,324
SUNG-HO'S STRAWBERRIES

450
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,255
Hello.

451
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,049
Hello. How can I help you?

452
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,219
By any chance,

453
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,765
do you know a man named Park Sung-ho
who used to run a strawberry farm here?

454
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,142
What? What farm?

455
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,854
The strawberry farm
beside the green tea field.

456
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,358
A strawberry farm?
Did we ever have one around here?

457
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,111
What about it?

458
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:47,737
Pardon?

459
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,032
Why are you looking for someone
who died ages ago?

460
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,535
What do you mean he died?

461
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,264
Yes, it was Oh Young-sook.

462
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,057
Victim, Park Sung-ho.

463
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,024
VICTIMS SUNWOO JA-OK, PARK SUNG-HO

464
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,152
MURDERED AND MUTILATED
AT THE ASSAILANT'S HOME

465
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,624
Anyone home?

466
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,045
Hello?

467
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:51,634
Hello.

468
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,305
We're from Bosung Police Station.

469
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,810
What is it?

470
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:05,315
Well, we're just making our rounds
collecting witness statements.

471
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,401
Do you know about the strawberry farm
by the church?

472
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,156
Do you know Park Sung-ho?

473
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,870
No, I don't think so.

474
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,747
I see.

475
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,706
All right.

476
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,627
Aren't those strawberries?

477
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,964
Mr. Park was handing them out
to his neighbors yesterday.

478
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,343
Oh.

479
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,846
You're right.

480
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,688
I guess my mom got them from him.

481
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,733
Could we speak to your mother?

482
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,277
-My mom?
-Yes.

483
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,322
She's not home.

484
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,535
When will she be back?

485
00:58:59,118 --> 00:58:59,953
Not sure.

486
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,663
She went somewhere far.

487
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,706
When did she leave?

488
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,375
Two days ago.

489
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,001
MOM, OUT, TWO DAYS AGO

490
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,337
Didn't your mother get those yesterday?

491
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:16,636
Right. It must've been yesterday then.

492
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,145
YESTERDAY

493
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,567
BAEK MIN-HYUN

494
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,155
I guess there was a murder in the village.

495
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,535
Did someone die?

496
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,420
Welcome.

497
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,921
Hello.

498
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,173
Hello. What are you looking for?

499
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,009
Well…

500
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,805
Do you happen to know
someone named Oh Young-sook?

501
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:12,317
<i>I thought she was a good-natured girl.</i>

502
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,030
She'd listen to me
complain about my alcoholic dad,

503
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:21,034
and I'd sometimes sneak her snacks.

504
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,130
If it wasn't for her mom…

505
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,924
I'd be dead now.

506
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:51,689
<i>It's me.</i>

507
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,568
I have something to ask you.

508
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,236
Was it you?

509
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:00,990
What?

510
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,326
Your mom and Sung-ho.

511
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,537
Did you kill them?

512
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,176
What are you talking about?

513
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:31,437
"Serial killer Oh Young-sook
sentenced to life imprisonment."

514
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:37,985
Life imprisonment?

515
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,576
So it really was you.

516
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:50,415
Are you saying I'll rot in jail
for the rest of my fucking life?

517
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,793
<i>But I finally feel like I'm alive.</i>

518
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,798
How can you say that right now?

519
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,137
How did the cops figure it out?

520
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,725
Sung-ho didn't even do anything wrong.

521
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,941
Find out what kind of evidence
the police found.

522
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,240
You didn't forget, did you?

523
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,410
I saved your dad.

524
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,311
<i>You fucking bitch.</i>

525
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:58,191
How dare you hang up on me, fucker?

526
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,153
Did you forget
that I saved your dad's life, you bitch?

527
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,697
I ask you to help me,
and this is what you fucking do?

528
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,616
Hey!

529
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,702
<i>Where did you learn</i>
<i>to be so ungrateful, you bitch?</i>

530
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:13,873
Hello?

531
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,752
Hello?

532
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,048
Fuck.

533
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,553
You bitch!

534
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:22,942

01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,678
Hey, the door's open.

537
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:38,434
Oh, you're home.

538
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,730
We were waiting
for your mother to show up.

539
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,317
We were supposed to meet her
at the realtor's office at 11.

540
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,070
-Oh.
-Is she not at home?

541
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,201
Mom!

542
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,664
Mom!

543
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,547
I think she fell asleep.

544
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,550
You can wait inside.

545
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:15,429
Come wait inside.

546
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,111
Seo-yeon.

547
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,530
Yes?

548
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,115
Did something happen?

549
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,201
No, of course not.

550
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,214
Get out.

551
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:51,257
Why?

552
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,801
Just get out.

553
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,346
Wow!

554
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,057
Stay put.

555
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:01,600
Okay.

556
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:03,894
Hey, strawberries!

557
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,113
Jeez! Hey.

558
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,198
Don't step on it so briskly.

559
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,410
Relax your foot and just tilt your ankle.

560
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,587
If you don't spill the coffee
when you brake, you pass.

561
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,346
Is the strawberry good?

562
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,694
Hey, you're a good driver.

563
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,154
Can you see?

564
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,742
You should have a good view
of the rear window. Yes, that's it.

565
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,502
Dad.

566
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,050
Dad?

567
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,350
No, Dad…

568
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,768
Dad!

569
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,648
Dad! No, Dad!

570
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,948
No, Dad!

571
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,417
No!

572
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,087
No!

573
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,421
Dad!

574
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:58,759
No!

575
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,514
It's your fault
for not picking up the phone.

576
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,227
Right?

577
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,898
Look at the mess you've made.

578
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:42,238
SEO-YEON, ANSWER THE PHONE

579
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,011
What did you do?

580
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,013
Jeez. You're finally picking up.

581
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,933
Why is it so hard to get through?

582
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,894
What did you do to my dad?

583
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:18,065
<i>I warned you not to disconnect the phone.</i>

584
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,235
What?

585
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:22,987
Do you know what?

586
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,824
Chickens still run around
even after their heads are cut off.

587
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,410
<i>Your dad was kind of like that.</i>

588
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,412
You fucking bitch!

589
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,000
Fuck you.
I'm going to find you and kill you.

590
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,210
I'll kill you
just like how you killed him!

591
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,128
<i>Hey!</i>

592
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,088
How do you plan on doing that?

593
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,799
You can't even come here.

594
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:48,262
<i>Wait, no.</i>

595
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,597
You're already here.

596
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,183
With me.

597
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,563
I'll give you an hour.

598
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:02,067
Find out exactly how
the police will arrest me.

599
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,328
Oh, right.

600
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:19,251
Now that I think about it,
didn't you say you hate your mom too?

601
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,090
Fuck!

Fuck! Just listen to me, bitch!

655
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:55,261
<i>Why won't you pick up your phone?</i>

656
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:58,056
<i>The realtor told me</i>
<i>you went to visit the house.</i>

657
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,266
<i>Page me when you get this.</i>

658
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:14,197
<i>Listen, you lying devil.</i>

659
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,658
<i>Should I tell you something?</i>

660
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,453
<i>I'm sure you're dying to know.</i>

661
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:30,088
I thought very hard
whether I should tell you this or not,

662
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,884
but I think you should know.

663
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,432
<i>You know how your dad died in a fire?</i>

664
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:48,440
It wasn't your mom's fault.

665
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,858
<i>Aha, aha, aha</i>

666
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:53,403
<i>You can eat all the good things at once</i>

667
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:55,405
<i>Get the nutrients you need, all at once</i>

668
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:02,704
<i>Now, turn on the gas.</i>

669
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:04,539
Oh, you.

670
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:06,708
<i>What did I tell you to do</i>
<i>when you turn on the gas?</i>

671
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:07,959
<i>Keep your face away.</i>

672
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,462
<i>That's right.Let's turn it on.</i>

673
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,338
<i>Great!</i>

674
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:15,175
<i>Always be careful with fire!</i>

675
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,594
<i>Ha ha ha ha, be careful when handling gas</i>

676
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:19,262
<i>Ha ha ha, be careful when handling fire</i>

677
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:22,057
<i>Ha ha ha ha, be careful when handling gas</i>
<i>Be careful when handling fire</i>

678
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,225
<i>You know, I'm an expert in this field.</i>

679
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,811
Aren't you a pathological liar?

680
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,523
<i>I mean, I know you hated your mom, but…</i>

681
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,569
Should I kill her for you?

682
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:12,690
EVIDENCE FOUND AND REPORTED BY
HWANG YOUNG-CHUL, MALE, AGE 76

683
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,318
Hey, old man.

684
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,908
Why did you take something
that doesn't belong to you?

685
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:10,039
It might seem trivial,
but it can change a person's life.

686
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,179
Are you her mother?

687
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,889
That's right.

688
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,725

LEFT THE STATION AT 7:38 P.M.

690
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,693
Okay. We're done.

691
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:40,862
Oh. Is that all?

692
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,699
Aren't you going to search the house?

693
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:47,535
We'll work according to our protocols.

694
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,287
Okay.

695
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,052
Ma'am.

696
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,639
Did you just say the address was
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup?

697
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:13,478
MISSING PERSONS REPORT
4, YEONGCHEON-RI, BOSUNG-EUP

698
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:45,403
Listen… you might get killed.

699
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:53,036
Hello, I'm from the Bosung Police Station.

700
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:55,663
STARTED SEARCHING INDOORS

701
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:00,335
ACCOMPANIED BY THE MISSING CHILD'S MOTHER

702
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,677
USED A CORDLESS PHONE

703
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:27,695
Hello?

704
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,614
The phone.

705
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:04,023
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

706
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,319
What time did they leave?

707
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:11,447
I'm not sure.

708
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:14,742
Maybe around noon?

709
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,959
This is my daughter's.

710
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,994
Can we check upstairs too?

711
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:01,831
Sure. Go ahead.

712
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:20,933
Check over there.

713
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,664
I don't think she's here.

714
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:33,965
Let me try calling my husband again.

715
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,013
I'm sorry, but could we use your phone?

716
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:41,931
The phone?

717
01:32:42,014 --> 01:32:42,848
Yes.

718
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:45,268
It's broken.

719
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:51,107
It sounds fine.

720
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:54,485
She says it works. Let's lower the volume.

721
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:10,251
USED A CORDLESS PHONE

722
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:23,139
Mom?

723
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,516
<i>Mom, get out of that house right now.</i>

724
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,186
Oh Young-sook will kill you!
Get out right now!

725
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,229
Hello?

726
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:32,732
-Was it your husband?
-No.

727
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:35,526
Some woman picked up.

728
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:37,236
What woman?

729
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:41,073
She called me Mom,

730
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,077
and told me to get out
of this house at once.

731
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:46,454
I'm sorry?

732
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:00,217
Give me the phone.

733
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,391
What's the matter with you?

734
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,772
Didn't you want your mom dead?

735
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,365
You don't have to tell me. I already know.

736
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,120
Because you and I are alike.

737
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:12,665
You bitch!

738
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,647
Hey! Open the door!

739
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,232
Open up, damn it!

740
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:43,214
I'm calling from
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup.

741
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:46,217
<i>She's trying to get</i>
<i>into this room, please…</i>

742
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,134
Mom?

743
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,221
Are you okay, Mom?

744
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,555
<i>She's holding a knife.</i>

745
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,766
Why are you still there?

746
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:55,267
Please hurry!

747
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:03,442
Mom, you need to calm down.

748
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:07,988
Do you see anything in the room
you can use as a weapon?

749
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:11,826
<i>Anything sharp</i>
<i>or heavy enough to strike her with?</i>

750
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,288
I see a fire extinguisher.

751
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,832
<i>Hurry up and grab it.</i>

752
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,877
Stay focused!

753
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,964
<i>Grab the fire extinguisher, now!</i>

754
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:35,432
Remove the safety pin and wait.

755
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:39,645
Spray it at her face
when she opens the door.

756
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,452
Help!

757
01:37:58,289 --> 01:37:59,707
Help!

758
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,462
Mom.

759
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:08,299
Mom.

760
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:12,595
Mom.

761
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:15,848
Mom.

762

Mom.

765
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:28,485
-Mom, Mom…
-Seo-yeon, it's okay.

766
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:32,156
It's okay, sweetie.
Mom's here, so you're safe now.

767
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:41,665
Mom, answer me.

768
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,751
Mom?

769
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,173
Mom!

770
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:52,092
Answer me!

771
01:38:53,218 --> 01:38:54,678
Can't you hear me?

772
01:39:11,528 --> 01:39:12,655
Mom.

773
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:22,748
Mom!

774
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:41,725
I'm sorry.

775
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:45,396
Mom, I'm…

776
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:50,609
I'm sorry about what I said.

777
01:39:52,444 --> 01:39:53,570
I'm sorry, Mom.

778
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,110
Mom.

779
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:18,363
I'm sorry.

780
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:25,788
Do you know the person
who used to live at 4, Yeongcheon-ri?

781
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:29,625
Four, Yeongcheon-ri? I don't recall.

782
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,545
Okay, thank you.

Seo-yeon!

786
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:59,339
Why won't you pick up your phone?

787
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,759
Gosh, do you know how many times
I called you?

788
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:03,886
Jeez.

789
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:06,680
Seo-yeon.

790
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:13,270
Why are you crying?

791
01:43:14,271 --> 01:43:15,105
What's wrong?

792
01:43:18,108 --> 01:43:20,569
Oh, dear. Why are you dressed like this?

793
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:23,488
Goodness gracious.

794
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:28,243
I still have to feed you and dress you.

795
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,787
Isn't it chilly?
You'll catch a cold dressed like this.

796
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:33,665
My goodness, your hands are ice-cold.

797
01:43:34,499 --> 01:43:36,043
What am I gonna do with you?

798
01:43:39,421 --> 01:43:42,841
If your dad saw you,
he'd say you're still a baby.

you might get killed.

They wanna toss my cell, Jimmy.
They're gonna find my manuscript.

That book is the only thing
I got left in here.

76
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:32,243
You understand me? That's the only
chance I got to get out of here.

77

I lose that, they gonna lose too.

78

Rubin, who do you think the first man
through this door has gotta be now?

What if that manuscript...

wasn't in this cell
when we tossed it?

84
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,236
What if it was stuffed
down your pants or something...

85
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,560
stuffed in your crotch,
and we couldn't see it?

86
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:58,404
I can make sure
you weren't strip-searched, okay?

87
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:00,516
Don't bullshit me.

Keep the chin up.
Keep the passage open.

- Just for a moment.
- Would you raise his head?

116
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:13,556
Can you make out these two men?
Are these the two men who shot you?

117

Look carefully, sir.
Are these the two men who did it?

156
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,635
Yeah, well, I like the summers
in Brooklyn better.

157
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,404
Is all these people out here
freezing their butts off to buy books?

158
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,880
- That's right.
- Lined up like this...

159
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:21,996
not for a movie
or a ball game or somethin'?

160
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,276
- Ain't it great?
- No, "isn't it." "Isn't it great?"

161
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,396
Very good.
I stand corrected, Les.

162
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:30,198
Used books,
books nobody wants any more.

163
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,122
Aw, that's the great thing
about books, you know.

164
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,840
Once you use 'em, you can pass 'em
along to somebody else like a torch...

165
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,399
or a football,
you know, something you pass.

166
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,595
Okay, bring it on in.

167
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,797
Put it down.
Good, good. Down.

168
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,561
Okay, young man,
that'll be 25 cents.

169
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:38,279
- Jesus.
- Twenty-five cent?

170
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,077
Mustn't be much of a book.

171
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:43,038
<i>- Ah, listen, everybody
- Everybody</i>

172
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:45,633
<i>Especially you, girl</i>

173
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,881
So, Lesra, what'd you get?

174
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:50,155
Uh, this.

175
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:53,038
- What is it?
- I don't know. It's about a boxer.

176
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:56,601
It's got like 337 pages,
though, you know.

177
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:59,478
Well, it probably takes a lot of words
to tell someone's life story, eh?

178
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:01,436
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, well, this guy must be...

179
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:04,841
like 150 years old, you know,
if he gon' use all these words.

180
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,921
You know what, Les? Sometimes
we don't pick the books we read.

181
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:10,401
<i>- They pick us.
- Somebody, somewhere</i>

182
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:14,643
<i>- I tell you, it's unfair
- Can I get some whisky</i>

183
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,643
<i>Can I get some whisky
Yeah</i>

184
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,439
Mr Broden, we've been home schooling
this young man for eight months.

185
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,556
That's how it applies to us.

186
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:26,437
No, I'm not married.
Mr Swinton, who you spoke with...

187
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,715
is one of the two men I live with.

188
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,235
No, Sam Chaiton is
the other man I live with.

189
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,276
No, I don't think you do see,
Mr Broden.

190
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,202
They are my business partners
and my roommates.

191
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,883
And you're the Department
of Education...

192
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,997
and you're telling me you're prepared
to stop this young man's education...

193
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,561
because you can't find
some goddam high school records?

194
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:57,793
Yep, that's exactly
what I'm doing, Mr Broden.

195
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,721
No, no, I'm not asking you
to make an exception.

196
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,995
I'm asking you to do your job,
which is qualitatively different...

197
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,559
but I thank you for it anyway.

198
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:09,519
- Shit.
- Political Science 101, the art of gentle persuasion.

199
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:12,603
Never mind 101.
I need a smoke.

200
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,523
- So how was the book sale?
- Great.

201
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:17,363
<i>- There.
- Did you get The Other America?</i>

202
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,840
<i>Uh, I couldn't find The Other America,
but I got you, uh-</i>

203
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,877
Sam Robertson Davies, R.D. Laing.

204
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:25,314
- You don't want to piss me off today.
- It's a book sale, Lisa, not a library.

205
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:26,924
- Whatever.
- Hey, look, Lisa.

206
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:30,355
<i>Got this one right here for 25 cent.
The Sixteenth Round.</i>

207
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,158
- Oh, your first book, huh?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,435
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

209
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:42,801
Hurricane is the professional name
that I acquired later on in life.

210
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:45,917
Carter is the slave name
that was given to my forefathers...

211
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:49,435
who worked in the cotton fields
of Alabama and, and Georgia...

212
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,920
and was passed on to me.

213
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,321
The kindest thing I can say
about my childhood...

214
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,640
is that I survived it.

215
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:02,316
Paterson was a run-down town,
a poor and violent place.

216
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,959
The only way to survive
was to know how to handle yourself...

217
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:07,724
and I learned fast.

218
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,914
Come on! Hurry up!

219
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:14,798
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's get out of here!

220
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:23,440
Take this out.

221
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,313
Hey, Donnique, go for a swim!

222
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,195
Hello, boys.

223
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,195
Wanna see something?

224
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,400
Huh? Isn't that pretty?

225
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,125
You like that?

226
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,395
- What's your name?
- Donnique.

227
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:53,959
Donnique?

228
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,645
That's a pretty name, Donnique.

229
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,756
You wanna be good to me, sugar?

230
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:02,958
H- H-Hey, mister!
Leave him alone!

231
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,634
I wouldn't hurt your friend.
Would I?

232
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:11,281
You don't need
to be afraid, Donnique.

233
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,999
You're pretty.
How old are you?

234
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,478
- Ten.
- Ten?

235
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:18,039
I said, leave him alone!

236
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:24,484
Run! Run! Come on!

237
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,800
- Get outta here!
- Run!

238
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,156
You little bastard.

239
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:31,957
Let's get outta here!

240
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:35,600
You black bastard, you!
Goddam it!

241
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,875
Please, mister! Put me down!

242
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:42,317
- Shut up, you son of a bitch!
- Put me down!

243
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:45,555
Hey!

244
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:04,396
- I didn't- didn't do nothin'!
- Come on! Let's go!

245
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,402
- I didn't- I didn't-
- Shut up.

246
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,402
I didn't do nothin'.

247
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:14,916
- Come on, you-
- No!

248
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:19,436
- Get in there.
- I-It wasn't me.

249
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,563
I-I- didn't do nothin'!

250
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,835
Sit down, kid.

251
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,160
What have we got here?

252
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,241
It's a juvenile case.

253
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:51,914
He's a kid, Sarge.
He's only 11 years old.

254
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:58,038
It's a nigger with a knife.

255
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:01,202
I don't care how old he is.

256
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,475
Take care of him.

257
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:10,957
We know you were at the falls last week,
and we know what happened.

258
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,599
So you're gonna talk,
you little son of a bitch.

259
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:17,479
You'll be makin' speeches
when I get through with your black ass.

260
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:19,755
Ralph. Ralph.

261
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,718
I'm Sergeant Detective Della Pesca.

262
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:38,040
You wanna tell me what happened?

263
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,000
What is it, you were trying to rob
this man's gold watch...

264
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:49,482
and he fought back,
and so you stabbed him?

265
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:52,438
Is that pretty much it?

266
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:56,274
I-I- didn't do nothin'.

267
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,636
Let me tell you something, sunshine.

268
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,835
The man you stabbed...

269
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,923
is a very important member
of this community...

270
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,037
and you are goin' down.

271
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:16,442
Do you see?
And I am going to see to it personally.

272
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:22,162
As for you, Rubin Carter,
you're a menace to society.

273
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,753
If something isn't done
about you soon...

274
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,637
you'll become a dangerous man
in later life.

275
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:30,883
I only wish you were old enough
I could send you to state prison.

276
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:33,075
I therefore sentence you...

277
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:36,561
to the state home for boys
in Jamesburg...

278
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:40,041
from this day till you're
21 years of age.

279
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,440
- So be it.
- It's okay, son.

280
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:47,236
Jamesburg was a place of horror
that I would be forever sorry...

281
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,595
to have known existed.

282
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,434
It was there that I spent the next
eight years learning how to maim...

283
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:57,240
butcher and fight for my survival.

284
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,205
I don't get what's goin' on here.
I'm the boy's father.

285
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:13,715
I take care of him.
I don't know what you people-

286
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:16,882
I mean, what's it to you?

287
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:19,758
M- Mr Martin, we've gotten to know
Lesra over the past few weeks.

288
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:23,355
And I gotta tell you, he's got
more natural ability and enthusiasm...

289
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:27,034
than just about any kid
I've ever worked with.

290
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:30,919
So, when he told us
he wanted to go to college...

291
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:33,275
we just figured
that's the way it was gonna be.

292
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:36,397
Well, I know he's smart.

293
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:38,720
There's no doubt about that,
but, uh...

294
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:41,996
he can't read, Mrs Martin.

295
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,514
But we think that we could teach him.
I mean, within...

296
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,637
probably two years, with a lot of work,
we could get him ready for college.

297
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:50,279
- Yeah, well, that school sure not doin' it.
- Now wait just a second.

298
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:52,157
- I am that boy's father-
- But if they can give him more-

299
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:54,321
They're talkin' to me, Alma!

300
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,913
Uh, Mr Martin, you know,
we got plenty of room.

301
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:00,037
And if Lesra wants to learn,
then we can teach him.

302
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:01,917
If you don't want that, that's fine.
That's up to you.

303
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:05,515
But no one here is trying
to replace you, sir.

304
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:17,434
- This what you want, boy?
- I wanna go to college.

305
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:23,556
And if that's what it's gonna take,
then, yeah.

306
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,960
It don't seem right.

307
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,600
Why you gotta go, Lesra?

308
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,922
- Don't you want me to go, EI?
- You should be here backin' me up.

309
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:43,003
Leave the boy, Elston.
Lesra goin' to Toronto now.

310
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,640
Got a job to do.
Wants to go to college.

311
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:59,443
After eight years at Jamesburg,
I escaped.

312
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,602
I was angry,
embittered with life.

313
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:05,193
I ran as if on a cloud...

314
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:09,000
unaware of how high I was stepping
or of anything else around me.

315
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,515
There was room in my head
for only one word...

316
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:15,557
one thought:

317
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:18,040
Freedom.

318
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,397
I ran straight into the U.S. Army
and a pair of paratrooper wings...

319
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:24,277
and my whole life changed.

320
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:26,635
I learned that
knowledge of self and kind...

321
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,723
is the only true means
to the liberation of the black man.

322
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:32,598
I could do anything.
I overcame my stutter.

323
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,398
I became a prizefighter.
I came back to Paterson...

324
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:38,437
the all-Army European
welterweight champ.

325
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:40,601
Let me have a soda, please.

326
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:45,116
Judy, who's that fine soldier
standing over there at the bar?

327
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:55,318
Oh, he's a local boy.
Rubin Carter, I think.

328
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,561
Make it two.

329
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,321
- He's comin' over here.
- Uh-oh. Stay cool.

330
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,641
I'm back. I'm back.

331
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,758
- Mmm, so you missed me, did you?
- So tell me-

332
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,479
- Well, what do you want to know?
- You're in my seat.

333
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:31,244
Uh, you know, I'm from Georgia.

334
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,243
And I was thinkin'
that afterwards you and me-

335
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,277
You're in my seat, country.

336
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,715
I don't see your name anywhere.

337
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:46,405
That's 'cause you're blinded by
the ass-kickin' I'm about to put on you.

338
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:49,881
Now get up out of my seat.

339
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:52,155
- Hey, come on now. Take it easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

340
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:55,482
- Calm down. Calm down. - Let that
motherfucker go. - Just stop it. Listen.

341
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,800
- Not here.
- You know what? I wanna dance. You wanna come over here and dance with me?

342
00:25:57,925 --> 00:26:00,678
- Not here. - Hey, I'm
talkin' to you. - Hmm?

343
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:03,114
Oh, you wanna fight,
or you wanna dance?

344
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,713
- He ain't worth it.
- Yeah, you wanna dance. Come on.

345
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,841
<i>- Brother got a lot of hostility up in him.
- Should I let myself go</i>

346
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:15,279
<i>In his direction</i>

347
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:19,637
<i>- Come on, sweet thing. Let's dance.
- Is his love strong enough</i>

348
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:23,840
<i>For my heart's protection</i>

349
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,482
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>

350
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:35,644
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>

351
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:38,563
<i>- You dance nice.
- But he loves me so good</i>

352
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,721
<i>- Till I think I should
- Thank you.</i>

353
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:47,397
<i>If I gave him my heart</i>

354
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:51,598
<i>- These hands were meant for more than just fighting.
- Would he refuse it</i>

355
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,913
<i>Would he tear it apart</i>

356
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:03,358
<i>- Or tenderly use it
- Her name was Mae Thelma.</i>

357
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:08,036
<i>- I don't know
- And she was the prettiest woman I had ever seen.</i>

358
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:12,841
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>

359
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,115
<i>But he hugs me so tight</i>

360
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:17,315
<i>Till I think I might</i>

361
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:20,801
You got a girl around?

362
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:24,281
No. I ain't got no girl.

363
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:26,316
No?

364
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:31,321
Well, I had a good time
with you tonight.

365
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:37,404
- Mae Thelma, is that you?
- Yeah. Mama, I'll be right up.

366
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:42,037
- You gon' call me tomorrow?
- I'm gon' call you tonight.

367
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:44,520
- No, you can't call me tonight now.
- I'll call you tomorrow then.

368
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:46,715
You'll call me tomorr-

369
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:53,043
- Is that your father?
- No. My father's asleep.

370
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:57,318
- Your name Rubin Carter?
- Yeah.

371
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:59,595
- You're comin' with us.
- For what?

372
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:02,676
You heard the man.

373
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:13,122
What'd you think,
we weren't gonna find you?

374
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:18,365
You still owe me time.

375
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,876
<i>104, meet Vice officers
at Glory Park.</i>

376
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,120
All right. Get out.

377
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:01,034
- This way now.
- Okay.

378
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,121
From that moment on...

379
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:14,396
I decided to take control
of my life.

380
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:18,404
I made up my mind
to turn my body into a weapon.

381
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:37,234
I would be a warrior-scholar.

382
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:39,640
I boxed. I went to school.

383
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:43,917
I began reading
W.E. B DuBois, Richard Wright.

384
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,600
Move, tier one! Move it!

385
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,879
So I gave up
all the worthless luxuries...

386
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:03,041
that most inmates crave-

387
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:07,158
the girlie books, fags,
cigarettes, the movies.

388
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,037
I hated them.

389
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:11,235
In fact, I hated everyone.
I didn't even speak English.

390
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:15,040
I spoke hate,
and its verbs were fists.

391
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,563
I made up my mind
to turn my body...

392
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:27,360
into a weapon that would
eventually set me free...

393
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,841
or kill anyone who sought
to keep me in prison.

394
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:48,402
On September 21, 1961...

395
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:51,722
I was released,
and I vowed upon everything holy...

396
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:55,235
never to come back to prison again.

397
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:04,520
I had spent almost half my time
on this Earth...

398
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:06,795
in jail.

399
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:28,564
Hey, come on, Lesra.
Time to get up. Breakfast, buddy.

400
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Yeah, I'm up. I'm up.

401
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,877
Did you get any sleep?
Your light's been on all night.

402
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:41,600
I just can't stop reading, man.
This book's about my life.

403
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:45,274
Jeez, Lisa, you gotta smoke
for breakfast?

404
00:31:56,765 --> 00:32:01,555
- Do you know when we met in Brooklyn?
- Yeah.

405
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,763
Why'd you take me home?

406
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:11,279
Well, you know, you-
you met my folks, man...

407
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:15,762
and you brought me up here,
you did all this stuff for me.

408
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:17,762
Yeah.

409
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:20,240
No, I mean, why?

410
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:22,276
Why'd you do all that?

411
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:25,920
'Cause you were smart and funny.

412
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,879
And short. You know, we figured
it'd be good for you to...

413
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:31,916
spend a little time
with some tall white people.

414
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:35,799
- Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah. - What,
did you do it 'cause I'm black?

415
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:39,315
And you thought
I couldn't do it myself?

416
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:43,836
'Cause Rubin- Rubin did it
all himself, you know.

417
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:47,241
Hey, Les, we didn't feel
sorry for you.

418
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,720
We met you and got to know you and realized you could accomplish some things...

419
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:53,076
and, like a lot of us,
you could use some help.

420
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:59,123
I'm sure that Hurricane Carter
had some help along the way.

421
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:02,396
- None of us does it alone.
- Hey.

422
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:06,757
As far as doin' it for yourself goes,
nobody can learn anything for you.

423
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:11,163
Trust me. Everything you're doing now,
you're doing for yourself.

424
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,715
I'll get it.

425
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,120
- You know, I been thinkin'.
- Yeah?

426
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:28,237
- How're you doing?
- About what?

427
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:30,720
No, no, no, he's here. He just-

428
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:34,474
Think I wanna put up a heavy bag.
You know, like a big punching bag.

429
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:36,675
Uh, those renovations?
Probably the end of the month.

430
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:39,273
- Oh, any special reason?
- No. No, man.

431
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:41,361
I just feel like punchin'
something, you know?

432
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:44,035
That's it. It's set.

433
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:47,955
- A little low. A little low.
- Keep your hand up. Keep the left down.

434
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:51,600
Straight out of prison,
I was a fighting machine.

435
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:56,401
One thing I could do,
and the only thing, was box.

436
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:59,323
I had tasted my own blood...

437
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:01,800
and I loved it.

438
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,315
This is your ringside commentator.

439
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:11,197
Tonight's fight brings together...

440
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:14,601
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
from Paterson, New Jersey...

441
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,876
and Joey Cooper,
who is currently undefeated.

442
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,882
Yeah! Way to go, Hurricane!

443
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,521
Hit him!

444
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:29,963
And the champion, Joey Cooper,
seems to be helpless...

445
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,679
against Rubin Carter,
the challenger.

446
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,595
Yeah!

447
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,643
And I'll tell ya, folks,
things are taking a surprising turn...

448
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,915
in this middleweight fight tonight.

449
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:56,242
Joey Cooper in big trouble.
Rubin Carter pourin' it on.

450
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:59,516
Left hook, right hook, uppercut- Oh!

451
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,722
He's down.
Oh, look at this.

452
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,915
What a disaster for Cooper.

453
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:23,958
Carter is punishing him.
He's gonna- Oh, he is down, folks.

454
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:26,963
He is down for the count,
and he is not getting up.

455
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,918
- Four, five, six...
- I'll tell you that right now.

456
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,240
- Get up! - seven...
- Get up now!

457
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,356
Right now!

458
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:36,840
You're out!

459
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:40,844
Unbelievable! Rubin Carter
comes on like a hurricane...

460
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:43,798
and defeats
the undefeated Joey Cooper...

461
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,485
in round one of
this middleweight fight.

462
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,994
- I don't believe it! Oh!
- Unbelievable upset tonight.

463
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,685
Have you ever seen anything like it?

464
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:55,241
- And the crowd is goin' wild here in Reading, Pennsylvania.
- You all right, Cooper?

465
00:35:55,365 --> 00:36:00,314
- And Rubin Carter took this fight right away from him here this evening.
- I'm okay.

466
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:09,561
Mrs Carter, what do you think it's gonna be like being married to such a ferocious fighter?

467
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:14,395
- Well, uh- - Well, it's gonna be a little
scary, but I'll try my best. All right.

468
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:18,439
Can you believe
that black son of a bitch?

469
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:22,956
He thinks he's champion of the world.
Fighter of the year, my ass.

470
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,882
A low-life criminal.

471
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:29,917
<i>My mother told me</i>

472
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:35,795
<i>'Fore she passed away</i>

473
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:40,558
<i>Said, son, when I'm gone</i>

474
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:46,321
<i>Don't forget to pray
'cause there'll be hard times</i>

475
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:50,916
<i>- What the hell do they expect? Of course a riot broke out.
- Hard times</i>

476
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:53,036
Every time we try to stand up
and defend our own neighbourhoods...

477
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,599
they send the cops in
to bust us in our heads.

478
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:01,121
If you feel so strongly about all this,
Hurricane, why aren't you out there...

479
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:03,918
instead of sittin' in here drinkin'?

480
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:08,118
I'm drinkin' club soda, first of all, and I'm in here because you asked me to be here.

481
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:11,203
But you're right.
Maybe I should go down there.

482
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:13,714
Yeah, maybe I should go grab my gun,
shoot me a half a dozen...

483
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:16,313
of them nigger-hatin' cops, huh?

484
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:20,563
What you think, Bucky? I know I can get
me about five of'em before they get me.

485
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:25,596
Ed? Huh?

486
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,919
How about you?
You wanna come?

487
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:39,320
Shit. That's off the record,
by the way.

488
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:41,913
Oh, he knows that.
Don't you?

489
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:44,400
Sure, champ. Sure.

490
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,195
You betcha.

491
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,514
- Take that, champ!
- Get down.

492
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:04,874
- Right here.
- Rubin, what is this?

493
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:09,840
- Get down, get down! Stay down! - Oh,
Lord, what is- - Let's get outta here!

494
00:38:18,605 --> 00:38:22,883
- You all right, T.?
- Shh, it's okay.

495
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:25,803
It's okay. It's okay.

496
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,802
Shh. It's okay.

497
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:30,803
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

498
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:34,440
- You all right?
- You know why they did this.

499
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,284
Shh. All right. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

500
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:40,841
- I told you it was off the record.
- Nothin' with you is off the record!

501
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:43,433
- Look, I don't want to go into it right now.
- You ain't had no business talkin' to them people.

502
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,237
- You know everything that you say...
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

503
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,639
- They gon' make up something different.
- Mae, what you want me to do, huh?

504
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,164
- What you want me to do?
- Why do you say these things?

505
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,560
- I know what they doin'. I know exactly what they doin'.
- Are you trying to get us killed?

506
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:53,438
So what you want me to do, huh?

507
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,875
You want me to roll over
and just lay dead?

508
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:59,883
- Pride. It ain't nothin' but pride!
- You're damn right it's pride.

509
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,473
- I'm guilty.
- Give me my baby.

510
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:06,435
Shit.

511
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:23,636
<i>You will not be able
to stay home, brother</i>

512
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:29,154
<i>You will not be able to plug in
turn on and drop out</i>

513
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:33,039
<i>You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials</i>

514
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,599
<i>Because the revolution
will not be televised</i>

515
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,402
<i>The revolution will not be televised</i>

516
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:43,403
<i>The revolution will not be brought
to you by Xerox and ball parks</i>

517
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:45,800
<i>Without commercial interruptions</i>

518
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:50,441
<i>The revolution will not be right back after a message
about a white tornado white lightning or white people</i>

519
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:55,081
<i>You will not have to worry about a dove in your bedroom,
the tiger in your tank or the giant in your toilet bowl</i>

520
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:57,639
<i>The revolution
will not go better with Coke</i>

521
00:39:57,765 --> 00:40:00,279
<i>The revolution will not fight germs
that may cause bad breath</i>

522
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:03,078
<i>- The revolution will put you in the driver's seat
- Break it up! Break it up!</i>

523
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:05,878
<i>The revolution will not be televised
Will not be televised</i>

524
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:08,235
<i>Will not be televised
Will not be televised</i>

525
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,641
<i>The revolution won't be no rerun, brothers The revolution will be live</i>

526
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:18,561
Champion of the world!
Champion of the world!

527
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:24,920
Yeah, they're still out.

528
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:47,680
I've seen a lot of things in my time,
but it's taken 35 minutes...

529
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:51,957
for these judges to tell us
what this home town crowd already knows.

530
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:55,441
Joey Giardello
is about to the lose the crown...

531
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,681
to Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.

532
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,355
Ladies and gentlemen...

533
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:09,794
it's a unanimous decision.

534
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:14,601
The winner
and still champion of the world...

535
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,841
Joey Giardello!

536
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:19,923
Giardello!

537
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:25,638
No. No, no. No. No.

538
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,036
Hey. What?

539
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:32,963
- You've stolen it!
- Aw, shit!

540
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:37,078
- This is bullshit!
- What's goin' on here?

541
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:41,244
- Yes, yes!
- Boo!

542
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:52,242
Well, all I can say
is these Philly judges...

543
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,515
must have been watching
a different fight...

544
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,797
because in the one we just saw,
Hurricane Carter took the title.

545
00:42:15,245 --> 00:42:18,555
<i>Oh, now tell me
where can you party, child</i>

546
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:21,757
<i>- All night long
- In the basement</i>

547
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:23,796
<i>Down in the basement, yeah</i>

548
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:27,679
<i>Oh, where can you go
when your money gets low</i>

549
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:31,241
<i>In the basement
Whoa, down in the basement</i>

550
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:35,358
<i>And if a storm is takin'place
you can jam and still be safe</i>

551
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:38,363
<i>- In the basement, down in the basement
- I got somethin' special for you.</i>

552
00:42:38,485 --> 00:42:43,434
- Hey, Hurricane, how you doin'?
- Hey, champ.

553
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:46,125
<i>In the basement
Down in the basement</i>

554
00:42:46,245 --> 00:42:48,839
<i>- Oh, you got the comforts of home
- Anybody call a cab?</i>

555
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:51,763
<i>- A nightclub too
- In the basement</i>

556
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:54,638
<i>- Oh, down in the basement
- Anybody call a cab?</i>

557
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:57,154
I did, unless Rubin's
taking me home.

558
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,753
Yeah, if I take you,
it ain't gonna be home.

559
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:04,438
Mr Carter. M-Mr Carter.

560
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,443
- Headed 'cross town, Mr Carter?
- Yeah. Why? You need a ride?

561
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:09,715
- Wo- Would you mind?
- No, I wouldn't mind.

562
00:43:09,845 --> 00:43:13,315
- All right! Okay.
- Come on.

563
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:15,436
- You drive.
- Drive your car?

564
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:18,079
- Come on.
- Oh, shit!

565
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:22,164
My friends are never gonna believe
I was cruising with The Hurricane.

566
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:25,595
- You know, what we wanna know is, can we get his autograph?
- No. No, no.

567
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:30,083
Oh, shit.

568
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:33,117
Motherfuckers.

569
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,281
- John, you been drinkin'?
- No. - All right.

570
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,316
All right, just relax.
Let me handle this.

571
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:39,800
All right.

572
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:42,200
Licence and registration.

573
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:04,154
It's okay. I got it.
You guys come with me.

574
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:19,318
B-E-L-L-O. Bello.

575
00:44:19,445 --> 00:44:23,120
Bradley. B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.

576
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:25,122
Okay.

577
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:31,083
Are those the guys?

578
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:34,641
No?

579
00:44:34,765 --> 00:44:37,040
Okay, let's go.

580
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:47,961
So what are you doing
around here at that hour?

581
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,474
Well, we was just out, you know,
takin' a walk, right?

582
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,802
- Yeah. Just gettin' a pack of cigarettes. That's it.
- Yeah.

583
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:57,235
Both of you are in big trouble.

584
00:44:57,365 --> 00:45:00,163
You're in violation
of your parole.

585
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:04,164
But I don't wanna talk
about the burglary.

586
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,357
We'll talk about
your parole problem later, Bello.

587
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:12,155
As far as I'm concerned...

588
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:15,083
no proof a burglary
really took place.

589
00:45:16,405 --> 00:45:18,680
See what I mean?

590
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:27,554
Yeah, I see what you mean.

591
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:30,040
I'm only interested
in the facts in this case...

592
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:32,963
and you and Bradley here are the only
two people that can really help me out.

593
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:35,121
Do you follow?

594
00:45:41,445 --> 00:45:44,755
- Yeah, I follow.
- Good.

595
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:49,515
Now, is there any scenario
that you can imagine...

596
00:45:49,645 --> 00:45:53,524
in which you could be sure...

597
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:56,762
really, positively sure...

598
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:59,353
that the man you saw that night...

599
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,160
was Rubin Carter?

600
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:22,675
Yeah, Rubin Carter. Yeah.

601
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:25,956
Wanna tell me again what happened? You were there having a drink? What was that?

602
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:28,121
No, no, it was, uh-

603
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:31,043
- I was goin' out for a pack of cigarettes.
- Yeah.

604
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:34,680
I heard a couple of shots, then I saw these two coloured guys, they come out of the bar.

605
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,319
And one of them was?

606
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:39,322
- One of them was Rubin Carter.
- Rubin Carter?

607
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:41,640
- Right, Rubin Carter, the fighter.
- Yeah, sure.

608
00:46:49,645 --> 00:46:51,920
All rise.

609
00:46:53,485 --> 00:46:58,001
The court will come to order.
The Honourable Judge Larner presiding.

610
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,400
Be seated.

611
00:47:06,645 --> 00:47:08,954
The defendants will rise.

612
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:16,235
Rubin Carter...

613
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:19,835
although you still contend you are not guilty of the crimes charged against you...

614
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:24,481
you were afforded a full and fair trial
by a jury of your peers.

615
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:29,440
Have you reached a verdict?

616
00:47:32,205 --> 00:47:34,435
Yes, we have, Your Honour.

617
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:37,637
We, the jury, find the defendants,
Rubin Carter...

618
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:40,643
and John Artis,
guilty on all counts.

619
00:47:40,765 --> 00:47:42,915
Oh, no!

620
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:46,321
- No!
- That ain't right! He's innocent!

621
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:52,238
- Order.
- No!

622
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:55,516
- Order in the court.
- No!

623
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:59,433
- Order! Bailiff will see to it that order prevails.
- No! No!

624
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:02,238
This ain't right. Railroaded!

625
00:48:07,005 --> 00:48:10,077
- No.
- Rubin Carter...

626
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,514
John Artis...

627
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:15,239
for the murder of James Oliver,
it is the court's sentence...

628
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:18,437
that you be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.

629
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,442
No!

630
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,238
On the second count,
the murder of Fred Nauyaks...

631
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:26,914
you are sentenced to be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.

632
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:29,081
No, God, no!

633
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:34,074
As to the third count involving
the murder of Hazel Tanis...

634
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:36,799
it is the sentence of this court
that you be imprisoned...

635
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,564
for the remainder
of your natural life.

636
00:48:53,005 --> 00:48:55,519
Okay, Carter, let's go.

637
00:48:55,645 --> 00:48:57,522
Take it easy.

638
00:48:57,645 --> 00:48:59,920
You're a tough guy.

639
00:49:02,285 --> 00:49:05,482
He thinks he's gonna stay in a room,
and that's it.

640
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:13,434
Put your clothes, your shoes, your ring, your watch and whatever else you've got in that bag.

641
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:17,524
You are being issued a standard inmate
uniform with your number sewn on it...

642
00:49:17,645 --> 00:49:20,876
so that we can identify you
immediately.

643
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,473
And you'll go to have your facial hair
shaved. You know the rules.

644
00:49:24,805 --> 00:49:26,796
No, I can't do it, Warden.

645
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:30,162
I beg your pardon?

646
00:49:30,285 --> 00:49:33,163
I cannot do it.

647
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:37,836
Look, you have legal custody
over my body...

648
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:40,081
but I'm innocent.

649
00:49:40,205 --> 00:49:44,437
I've committed no crime.
The crime's been committed against me.

650
00:49:46,165 --> 00:49:49,043
And I will not wear the clothes
of a guilty man.

651
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:52,840
Now, I'll go anywhere you want me to go
in this penitentiary, Warden...

652
00:49:52,965 --> 00:49:56,799
but you let it be known
in no uncertain terms...

653
00:49:56,925 --> 00:50:01,999
that any man who tries
to put his hands on me-

654
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,640
This place is where we
tell you the rules.

655
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:07,881
You hear that?

656
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:12,678
Do you understand me?

657
00:50:12,805 --> 00:50:15,239
Do you?

658
00:50:15,365 --> 00:50:19,438
Because if you do,
you had better strip right now...

659
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:22,557
and put on that fucking uniform.

660
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:31,160
I can't do that.

661
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:36,444
Put this man in the hole.

662
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:39,033
Give him sufficient time
to reflect...

663
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,963
on how he intends to behave
in this institution.

664
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:46,040
Ninety days.

665
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:09,364
Hey, Bobby,
we've got another one for ya.

666
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:29,323
I like your suit.

667
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:34,163
Three, two...

668
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,958
one.

669
00:52:37,085 --> 00:52:39,360
Lights-out.

670
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:42,763
You see?

671
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:48,482
"Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil."

672
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,675
There's doubt.

673
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:54,115
The shadow is doubt.
The shadow is doubt.

674
00:52:56,165 --> 00:53:00,955
But you're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me.

675
00:53:01,085 --> 00:53:03,360
Lights-out.

676
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:08,840
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

677
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:11,843
You can't break me
'cause you didn't make me.

678
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:15,082
You understand? Huh?

679
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:25,842
You fucked everything up for everybody,
Rubin. It's all fucked-up.

680
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:34,120
Who's that?

681
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:39,162
Y'all ain't got no speakers in here.
Who is that?

682
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:45,513
I put us into this situation
any goddam way...

683
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:47,920
motherfucker.

684
00:53:48,045 --> 00:53:52,277
I done fucked everything up for everybody. You know, that shit that's all fucked up.

685
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:56,796
What the fuck they expect us
to do now, huh? Motherfucker.

686
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:05,515
I'm s- I'm s- I'm scared.

687
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:12,083
Just shut up. Shut the fuck up,
you little skinny motherfucker.

688
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:15,003
You think your father used to beat
your little stuttering ass?

689
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:18,162
Don't make me
jump over there on ya.

690
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:21,675
No, you shut up.
Just shut the fuck up, talkin' to me.

691
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:24,319
Fuck you talkin' to? You ain't-
You ain't telling me what to say.

692
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:26,754
I'm running shit around here.
Fuck is wrong?

693
00:54:26,885 --> 00:54:28,762
Ain't nobody runnin' shit.
I'm runnin' shit.

694
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:31,160
Shut the fuck up!

695
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:38,683
What you say?

696
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:42,161
No. No.

697
00:54:42,285 --> 00:54:46,198
What are we gonna do now?

698
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:49,556
Huh?

699
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:52,404
I don't know what.

700
00:54:52,525 --> 00:54:54,914
Shit, ain't nobody touchin' me.
No goddam soul touchin' me.

701
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:58,082
Put your hands on me not twice. You
better not put your fuckin' hands on me.

702
00:54:58,205 --> 00:55:00,480
- I got-
- Shut up!

703
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:26,914
Oh, yeah. There's our man.
I can feel the hate. Can you feel it?

704
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:30,958
You can feel the hate, Rubin.
Don't you wanna just hurt somebody?

705
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:33,394
I feel like
I wanna kill somebody...

706
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:36,562
'cept there ain't nobody
in here to kill.

707
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:40,680
'Cept you, boy.

708
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,594
How 'bout it, Rube?

709
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,954
Get away from me!

710
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:25,365
All right, Carter. Time's up.

711
00:57:02,925 --> 00:57:05,041
Jesus Christ.

712
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:09,959
You could really use a shower.

713
00:57:11,525 --> 00:57:14,517
You smell awful, Mr Carter.
Why don't you take a shower?

714
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:17,955
Get you a decent cell
with a bed and some food.

715
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:21,555
- You'll feel a lot better.
- At what price do I, uh...

716
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,562
take this shower?

717
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:27,314
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what do I put on...

718
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,517
after I take this shower
that's gonna make me feel so good?

719
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:35,759
What everyone else puts on.
That's the rules.

720
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:41,243
Yeah, well, you can just take me
on back down to the hole.

721
00:57:49,205 --> 00:57:51,765
You could die down there.

722
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,161
I could die up here too.

723
00:57:56,965 --> 00:58:00,799
Look, what if I got you a pair
of pyjamas from the prison hospital?

724
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:06,244
As far as I'm concerned,
you'd be wearing prison-issued clothing.

725
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,560
They got stripes?

726
00:58:15,685 --> 00:58:18,563
- No stripes.
- What 'bout numbers?

727
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:22,075
- No numbers.
- What colour are they?

728
00:58:22,205 --> 00:58:24,958
They're white.

729
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,684
Okay, I can live with those.

730
00:58:35,085 --> 00:58:40,842
- Thank you, Mr Carter.
- You're welcome, Mr Williams.

731
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:43,240
Shower's all yours.

732
00:58:51,205 --> 00:58:53,799
Thank you.

733
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:57,361
It came to me as kind of a revelation
that my own freedom...

734
00:58:57,485 --> 00:59:02,240
lay in not wanting or needing anything
of which they could deprive me.

735
00:59:02,365 --> 00:59:05,960
If punishment consisted
of being locked in your cell...

736
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:09,395
then by simply choosing
to never leave my cell...

737
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:11,402
I deprived them of that weapon.

738
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:14,756
I would not work in their shops.
I would not eat their food.

739
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:19,561
I began to study. I dissected
my entire case piece by piece...

740
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:23,314
beginning with my initial arrest
through the trial itself...

741
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:26,596
and finally to the awful verdict.

742
00:59:26,725 --> 00:59:30,081
I didn't get a trial free from constitutional error and racial prejudice.

743
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:32,480
He knows that. You know it.

744
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:34,835
That's not helpin' me
in here, Myron.

745
00:59:34,965 --> 00:59:39,720
Look. Look, I'm innocent,
that's why.

746
00:59:39,845 --> 00:59:42,075
Seven years! You're goddam right
it's seven years!

747
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:45,641
Just get me outta here.
I want a new trial. Okay?

748
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:50,756
The people united
will never be defeated.

749
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:54,719
The people united
will never be defeated.

750
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:57,882
The people united
will never be defeated.

751
00:59:58,005 --> 00:59:59,882
The people united-

752
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:03,759
It shows that there's still hope.

753
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:07,161
There is hope for change
in America.

754
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:09,640
I believe in law and order,
and I believe that everybody...

755
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:12,359
has a right to,
uh, get another trial.

756
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:15,921
<i>Here comes the story
of T he Hurricane</i>

757
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:19,674
<i>The man the authorities
came to blame</i>

758
01:00:19,805 --> 01:00:23,400
<i>- For something that he never done
- Give a hand for Miss Ellen Burstyn.</i>

759
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:25,959
<i>Put in a prison cell
but one time</i>

760
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:31,318
<i>He could have been
the champion of the world</i>

761
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,435
They ain't givin' up. They said
they're gonna demonstrate again.

762
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:41,682
Muhammad Ali and- and Ellen Burstyn.
Bob Dylan.

763
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,080
- Everybody.
- That's good, Mae.

764
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:46,480
Everybody.

765
01:00:49,965 --> 01:00:52,604
Look, Mae, uh...

766
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:57,640
we've already lost two trials, and now they've turned down my request for an appeal.

767
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:05,997
I'm sorry. It, uh- It's over.

768
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:08,400
It's finished.

769
01:01:09,885 --> 01:01:12,399
I'm gonna die in here,
Mae, so-

770
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:14,914
- Baby, listen, there is still a chance.
- Listen to me now.

771
01:01:15,045 --> 01:01:19,436
- Now, all we have to do is hang on.
- There's nothin' to hang on to.

772
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:24,355
I want you to divorce me,
understand?

773
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:27,761
And I don't want you
to come back down here.

774
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,322
- No. No, now you listen to me.
- Mae, don't make- don't make this-

775
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:34,675
There- There are still things
that we can do.

776
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:38,275
- We just gotta get you out of here.
- I am not gonna be a weight hanging around your neck.

777
01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:43,240
- You are no weight around my neck!
- Well, then you're a weight around mine.

778
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:47,035
Now, I can't do all the years
I gotta do in here...

779
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:51,477
knowin' that they can take your beautiful face away from me anytime they want to.

780
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:55,075
- You understand?
- Rubin.

781
01:01:55,205 --> 01:01:58,117
I ain't walkin' away from you.

782
01:02:05,565 --> 01:02:07,635
I'm dead.

783
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:14,041
- Rubin.
- Just bury me, please.

784
01:02:17,565 --> 01:02:19,840
Rubin?

785
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:23,837
Rubin.

786
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:27,514
Rubin, we're- we're in this together
now. We just gotta hang on.

787
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:30,159
Guard.

788
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:32,924
Rubin.

789
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:35,605
Rubin?

790
01:02:35,725 --> 01:02:39,240
We just gotta hang on.

791
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:41,640
We just gotta hang on.

792
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:52,433
I will bend time to my own clock.

793
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:54,635
When the prisoners awake,
I will sleep.

794
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:57,643
When they sleep, I will wake.

795
01:02:57,765 --> 01:03:01,201
I will live neither in their cell...

796
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:04,556
nor in my own heart...

797
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:07,643
only in my mind...

798
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:10,279
and my spirit.

799
01:03:10,405 --> 01:03:13,044
"Once I reached my hand out for help.

800
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,633
It came down and then withered...

801
01:03:15,765 --> 01:03:19,963
as dry grass blown away into dust
leaving nothin'.

802
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:23,521
Now I wait for nothin'.
I need nothin'.

803
01:03:23,645 --> 01:03:28,161
Not tomorrow, not freedom,
not justice.

804
01:03:28,285 --> 01:03:32,244
In the end,
the prison will vanish...

805
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:35,755
and there'll be no more Rubin...

806
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:38,080
no more Carter...

807
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,003
only The Hurricane.

808
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:43,764
And after him...

809
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:46,160
there is no more."

810
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:53,679
Man, what are we gonna do?

811
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:57,559
- About what?
- About The Hurricane, that's what.

812
01:03:57,685 --> 01:04:00,404
Well, there's not much
we can do, Lesra.

813
01:04:00,525 --> 01:04:05,315
B- But the man's innocent, yet he's been
in jail 15, 16 years. That's not right.

814
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:10,878
- I know that's what his book says.
- Uh, two juries found him guilty, Les.

815
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:14,395
- Yeah, two white juries.
- Hey, hey, not all white people are racists.

816
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:17,164
Not all black people are murderers.

817
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,039
Look, I just- I just want
to write him a letter...

818
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:32,521
and tell him how much his book
meant to me, that's all.

819
01:04:37,725 --> 01:04:42,241
<i>I know you told me</i>

820
01:04:42,365 --> 01:04:45,084
<i>- Such a long time ago
- Dear...</i>

821
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:50,676
<i>- Mr Hurricane.
- That you want me</i>

822
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,956
<i>- You don't love me no more
- No, that's really stupid.</i>

823
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:02,116
<i>- I wanna know
- What's that?</i>

824
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:06,562
<i>- It's ten dollars, U.S.
- Oh, what you mean to me</i>

825
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:09,358
<i>- I thought he might need some money for stamps...
- Believe me, darlin'</i>

826
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:11,396
if you want him
to write you back.

827
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:14,244
<i>Oh-oh, no</i>

828
01:05:14,365 --> 01:05:17,163
Yeah. Yeah, write me back.

829
01:05:17,285 --> 01:05:21,403
<i>- That's cool. Thanks, Lisa.
- I know you told me</i>

830
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:23,800
No problem.

831
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:34,001
<i>- Dear Mr Rubin Carter.
- And I know</i>

832
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,477
I read your book...

833
01:05:39,605 --> 01:05:43,757
and I really felt sad
about what happened to you.

834
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:49,755
I want you to know
how much your book meant to me.

835
01:05:49,885 --> 01:05:53,673
<i>Little baby, child
move you</i>

836
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:56,638
<i>Whoa-whoa-whoa</i>

837
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:59,040
<i>Please</i>

838
01:06:52,765 --> 01:06:55,563
It's here! Hey, he wrote us back!
It's here!

839
01:06:55,685 --> 01:06:58,358
It's here! He wrote us back!
Home of the brave!

840
01:06:58,485 --> 01:07:00,919
Land of the free!
He wrote us back!

841
01:07:01,045 --> 01:07:04,674
- Can you stand it?
- Well, open it already.

842
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:08,161
I don't know.
You think I should?

843
01:07:16,885 --> 01:07:18,955
"Dear Lesra...

844
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:22,555
please forgive
the seemingly tardy reply...

845
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:25,961
but he who bemoans
the lack of opportunity...

846
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:30,954
forgets that small doors
many times open up into large rooms.

847
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:38,042
It was not only thoughtful,
but insightful on your part.

848
01:07:38,165 --> 01:07:42,158
Stamps, paper and envelopes...

849
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:45,641
were exactly what was needed
to complete this transmission.

850
01:07:48,085 --> 01:07:53,318
Your letter, feelings,
concerns, desires and warmth...

851
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,754
literally
jumped off the page at me...

852
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:58,479
when reading
your heartfelt message.

853
01:07:58,605 --> 01:08:00,994
It is as if you heard
my thoughts...

854
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,434
and reached out
to share yours with me...

855
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:07,399
at a moment when I can hear you.

856
01:08:07,525 --> 01:08:09,402
So thank you once again.

857
01:08:09,525 --> 01:08:12,244
Forever...

858
01:08:12,365 --> 01:08:14,754
your friend and brother...

859
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:19,080
Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

860
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:24,558
Wow.

861
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,323
You got your answer.

862
01:08:28,765 --> 01:08:30,801
Yeah.

863
01:08:30,925 --> 01:08:34,201
Dear Rubin...

864
01:08:34,325 --> 01:08:38,443
I've been thinking about my life
compared to yours.

865
01:08:38,565 --> 01:08:41,443
I come from Bushwick in Brooklyn.

866
01:08:41,565 --> 01:08:46,241
My parents are alcoholics
and my brother's in prison.

867
01:08:46,365 --> 01:08:49,721
I was third in my class,
and I couldn't even read.

868
01:08:49,845 --> 01:08:53,520
I couldn't write you this letter
just a year ago...

869
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:58,844
but then I met these friends from Canada
when I had a summer job at the EPA.

870
01:08:58,965 --> 01:09:02,241
They offered to educate me
and they got me out.

871
01:09:04,365 --> 01:09:08,836
Sometimes I feel guilty about my family
'cause I left 'em behind.

872
01:09:08,965 --> 01:09:13,436
Now that I know you,
I know it isn't right.

873
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:16,637
I shouldn't cry
about my own feelings...

874
01:09:16,765 --> 01:09:19,643
not if you can do what you've done.

875
01:09:19,765 --> 01:09:21,721
I've been thinkin' though.

876
01:09:21,845 --> 01:09:25,633
I would like to come and visit you,
if that will be all right.

877
01:10:06,965 --> 01:10:09,320
Palm down, right hand.
Keep the line moving.

878
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:11,640
- Put your right hand out, please. Palm down.
- Keep the line moving.

879
01:10:11,765 --> 01:10:14,643
- Keep the line moving, please.
- Come on. Come on.

880
01:10:16,765 --> 01:10:19,040
Okay, now.

881
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:28,361
Y'all listen up now. Visits for Jones,
Taylor, Harris, Ramos...

882
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:32,080
Sykes, Carter, Tucei,
line up right here.

883
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:34,355
Uh, you didn't call my boy's name.

884
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:37,124
Hemmings. Eric Hemmings, 65660.

885
01:10:37,245 --> 01:10:39,361
- Hemmings?
- Yeah.

886
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:43,478
Uh-uh, no visit for Hemmings today.
He's in lockup.

887
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:47,644
- Okay, Mac, open it up.
- Keep out of the way.

888
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:03,764
Extend your arms. Palms.
Turn around.

889
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,843
Show me your feet.
Okay, spread 'em.

890
01:11:06,965 --> 01:11:09,240
Next.

891
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:16,999
Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue.

892
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:19,923
Extend your arms.

893
01:11:20,045 --> 01:11:22,479
Show me your palms.
Turn around.

894
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,960
Show me your feet.

895
01:11:27,085 --> 01:11:29,315
Spread 'em.

896
01:11:29,445 --> 01:11:31,720
Ready on the outside!

897
01:11:33,245 --> 01:11:35,918
Okay, come on.
Single file, y'all.

898
01:11:36,045 --> 01:11:39,355
Let's go. Single file.

899
01:11:39,485 --> 01:11:41,953
Hey, sweetheart!

900
01:11:42,085 --> 01:11:44,235
Single file.

901
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:46,640
Let's go. Single file.

902
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,080
You look nice.

903
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:25,240
Mr Carter?

904
01:12:25,365 --> 01:12:29,756
- Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

905
01:12:29,885 --> 01:12:34,163
- I'm sorry, you don't look like your pictures. I thought you'd be bigger.
- Hey, I'm bigger than you.

906
01:12:35,645 --> 01:12:39,797
- But don't tell anybody, okay?
- All- All right.

907
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:43,161
Okay. Sit down.

908
01:12:53,765 --> 01:12:56,359
- Hey, this is some place, man.
- No.

909
01:12:56,485 --> 01:13:00,956
No, it's not. This is no place,
not for a human being.

910
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,760
Don't ever get used to
a place like this, Lesra.

911
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,115
You got a lot of guts, kid.

912
01:13:08,525 --> 01:13:11,961
Takes a lot of courage to come
all the way down here by yourself.

913
01:13:12,085 --> 01:13:14,553
I'm impressed.

914
01:13:14,685 --> 01:13:19,236
- I was scared you weren't gonna let me come.
- Me too.

915
01:13:19,365 --> 01:13:21,515
But you're Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
What would you be scared of?

916
01:13:21,645 --> 01:13:25,160
Well, doors opening,
of the light outside...

917
01:13:26,525 --> 01:13:28,436
of you.

918
01:13:28,565 --> 01:13:30,715
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

919
01:13:30,845 --> 01:13:33,200
- Mr Carter, I don't understand.
- Oh, no, no, no, don't call me Mr Carter.

920
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,680
- Call me Rube.
- Rube?

921
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:38,956
Yeah. Rube.

922
01:13:40,685 --> 01:13:42,835
All right. Rube.

923
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:47,916
So, tell me about these folks
you're livin' with.

924
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:50,513
- Oh, the Canadians. - Yes.
- Yeah, I got pictures of'em.

925
01:13:50,645 --> 01:13:53,637
Here.

926
01:13:53,765 --> 01:13:57,235
This is Sam, this is Terry,
and this is Lisa.

927
01:13:57,365 --> 01:13:59,640
- They're the greatest, man.
- Huh.

928
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:03,314
Yeah, I met 'em at an EPA in Brooklyn,
and, you know, they was doin' business.

929
01:14:03,445 --> 01:14:06,960
They brought me home and stuff,
and the rest is what happened, man.

930
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:09,963
Yeah, that's when
my life changed, Rube.

931
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:13,157
Just yanked a brother up and took him
up to Canada, just like that?

932
01:14:13,285 --> 01:14:15,753
No, no, they asked my folks.

933
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,524
I see. So what do they do?
Are they a religious group...

934
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:21,159
or, uh, hippies or a commune or-

935
01:14:21,285 --> 01:14:23,799
No, they fix up houses and sell 'em.
You know?

936
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:26,155
- They're just people.
- Just people.

937
01:14:26,285 --> 01:14:29,516
Just workin', eatin',
livin' together?

938
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:32,557
I don't know. This is what they do, man.
That's their thing.

939
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:35,836
- What'd your folks say?
- Oh, well, my dad, you know, he's happy.

940
01:14:35,965 --> 01:14:37,956
- He's glad for me.
- Oh, good.

941
01:14:38,085 --> 01:14:39,962
You see 'em much,
your people, your folks?

942
01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:42,041
Yeah, but sometimes
it's hard though.

943
01:14:42,165 --> 01:14:44,679
Yeah, well-

944
01:14:44,805 --> 01:14:47,080
Yeah, it's hard.

945
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:51,677
You give them hope.

946
01:14:51,805 --> 01:14:55,798
- Yeah, I guess.
- You do. You give 'em hope.

947
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:58,644
Because you have transcended, Lesra.

948
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:03,680
It is very important to transcend
the places that hold us.

949
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:07,434
You know that? You've learned to read.
You've learned to write.

950
01:15:07,565 --> 01:15:10,363
Writing is- it's magic.

951
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:15,639
You feel that sometimes?

952
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:18,199
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Mm-hmm.

953
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:20,600
When I started writing...

954
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:26,364
I discovered that I was doing more
than just telling a story.

955
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,601
See, writing is a weapon...

956
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:31,842
and it's more powerful
than a fist can ever be.

957
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:36,163
Every time I sat down to write, I could
rise above the walls of this prison.

958
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:41,882
I could look out over the walls
all across the state of New Jersey.

959
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:44,917
And I could see Nelson Mandela
in his cell writing his book.

960
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:48,435
I could see Huey.
I could see Dostoyevsky.

961
01:15:48,565 --> 01:15:52,240
I could see Victor Hugo, Emile Zola,
and- and they would say to me...

962
01:15:52,365 --> 01:15:54,435
"Rubin, what you doin' in there?"

963
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:57,443
And I say,
"Hey, I know all you guys."

964
01:15:59,645 --> 01:16:02,523
It's magic, Lesra.

965
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:05,637
Mmm, they sure don't teach it
that way up in Canada.

966
01:16:05,765 --> 01:16:08,962
- Maybe you could tell me some books to read.
- I can do that.

967
01:16:09,085 --> 01:16:11,963
But these people in Canada or anywhere
else, they can only teach you so much.

968
01:16:12,085 --> 01:16:15,157
It's up to you. It's your search. You
gotta find out what's true for you...

969
01:16:15,285 --> 01:16:19,961
what is true for Lesra Martin.

970
01:16:20,085 --> 01:16:23,555
I never met nobody like you before.

971
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,474
You think I killed
those people, son?

972
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:34,444
- No, I know you didn't.
- How you know?

973
01:16:34,565 --> 01:16:36,795
I just know.

974
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:45,514
I'm so glad I met you, Lesra.

975
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:49,642
Me too.

976
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:54,042
Visit's up.

977
01:16:54,165 --> 01:16:56,076
Everybody out.

978
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,919
Come on, folks. Let's go.

979
01:17:00,045 --> 01:17:02,434
You like a quick picture
of you and your son, Mr Carter?

980
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:05,238
- Come on, folks. Let's go.
- It's up to my son.

981
01:17:05,365 --> 01:17:07,640
Yeah, all right. All right.

982
01:17:10,245 --> 01:17:13,362
That's enough pictures.
Come on. Let's go.

983
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:56,321
Dear Lesra...

984
01:17:56,445 --> 01:18:01,565
whoever is responsible for your present
condition obviously cares a great deal.

985
01:18:01,685 --> 01:18:06,361
For me, it was a miracle to see
such light in a human being again.

986
01:18:06,485 --> 01:18:11,081
When you came, it was like the day
had started off without the sun.

987
01:18:11,205 --> 01:18:13,514
It's dim and it's cool.

988
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:16,079
Then suddenly,
and without any warning...

989
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:20,164
the sunshine breaks through the dimness
and lights up everything.

990
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:34,037
<i>What ya gonna do
Do you wanna get down</i>

991
01:18:34,165 --> 01:18:36,884
<i>What ya gonna do
Do you wanna get down</i>

992
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:39,155
You been all around the world,
huh, Mobutu?

993
01:18:39,285 --> 01:18:43,039
- Been everywhere.
- Shut your motherfuckin' mouth up!

994
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:46,362
<i>Get down on it
Get down on it</i>

995
01:18:46,485 --> 01:18:49,716
<i>- Come on and get down on it
- Where your people from, Africa?</i>

996
01:18:49,845 --> 01:18:52,678
Born in the Congo. Mm-hmm.

997
01:18:52,805 --> 01:18:55,080
In the blackness of black.

998
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,916
My mother was a Pygmy.
She stood four foot, one inch.

999
01:19:00,045 --> 01:19:03,674
- Hmm.
- My father was a big Watusi.

1000
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,875
He was seven foot, ten.

1001
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:10,681
He'd have to pick her up
like a little child to kiss her.

1002
01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:13,683
<i>- Hmm, cute.
- Get down on it</i>

1003
01:19:13,805 --> 01:19:15,716
<i>Come on now
Get down on it</i>

1004
01:19:15,845 --> 01:19:18,154
<i>If you really want it
get down on it</i>

1005
01:19:18,285 --> 01:19:20,640
What do you think of white folks?

1006
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:27,720
They're just a little bit too much
of this stuff, you know?

1007
01:19:27,845 --> 01:19:30,643
But, uh, then again...

1008
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:35,441
I once rode the rails
with a hobo by the name of, um...

1009
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:37,760
Alabama.

1010
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:40,763
Now, he was white folks...

1011
01:19:40,885 --> 01:19:43,957
and he was a good man.

1012
01:19:44,085 --> 01:19:48,442
Mm-hmm. He saved my life
three times.

1013
01:19:48,565 --> 01:19:52,274
- Three times?
- Mm-hmm. Three times.

1014
01:19:54,405 --> 01:19:57,795
Three times life, huh?

1015
01:19:57,925 --> 01:20:00,359
Everything I lost...

1016
01:20:00,485 --> 01:20:04,717
that really matters
I lost at the hand of white folks.

1017
01:20:04,845 --> 01:20:07,643
I know what you mean...

1018
01:20:07,765 --> 01:20:10,325
but they ain't all bad.

1019
01:20:12,925 --> 01:20:15,678
<i>What ya wanna do
Do you wanna get down</i>

1020
01:20:17,085 --> 01:20:20,441
<i>- What ya gonna do
- But they sure can't dance.</i>

1021
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:26,563
Oh, shit.

1022
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:28,243
Mm-hmm.

1023
01:20:31,365 --> 01:20:33,674
Hey, y'all,
th-this is where we go in.

1024
01:20:33,805 --> 01:20:36,478
Come on.

1025
01:20:36,605 --> 01:20:38,880
Come on!

1026
01:20:39,005 --> 01:20:42,361
- Don't look now, but we're being watched.
- Stop it.

1027
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:47,163
Somehow I don't think
you can smoke in there.

1028
01:20:49,005 --> 01:20:51,280
Right over there.

1029
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,677
Hey, Rube, man, we made it.
How you doin', man?

1030
01:20:55,805 --> 01:20:57,921
All right.

1031
01:20:58,045 --> 01:21:01,162
- Sam.
- Hey, Rubin. Good to meet you.

1032
01:21:01,285 --> 01:21:03,435
Yeah. Good, good, good.

1033
01:21:03,565 --> 01:21:06,159
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1034
01:21:06,285 --> 01:21:08,401
- This is Terry.
- Terry.

1035
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:11,517
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pleasure, Terry. Heard a lot about you.

1036
01:21:11,645 --> 01:21:14,159
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

1037
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:18,517
So, you don't look like
I thought you would look.

1038
01:21:19,925 --> 01:21:22,917
Lesra said you were so tough.

1039
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:28,244
- Is that good?
- Don't know. Don't know.

1040
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:30,799
Don't know. Come on.

1041
01:21:32,205 --> 01:21:34,480
Sit down.

1042
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:47,160
Everybody together!
I can't stand it.

1043
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:49,674
So, uh, Rubin,
how's the appeal goin'?

1044
01:21:49,805 --> 01:21:53,957
Uh, we hear it's with the New Jersey
Supreme Court. Have they set a date?

1045
01:21:56,205 --> 01:21:58,321
Why don't we talk about Lesra?

1046
01:21:58,445 --> 01:22:01,881
I'm sure that Lesra wants to know
what's happening with your case too.

1047
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:05,315
My case is doing what it's doing.

1048
01:22:05,445 --> 01:22:08,755
I have to focus on the fact
that I have to do the time.

1049
01:22:10,085 --> 01:22:12,838
Well, how do you do that?

1050
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:19,285
How do I do that? I do that by not
allowing myself to want or to need...

1051
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:22,163
anything.

1052
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:26,915
I'm free in here because
there's nothing I want out here.

1053
01:22:27,045 --> 01:22:31,118
Not free to want?
Not free to risk human contact?

1054
01:22:31,245 --> 01:22:33,520
This place doesn't allow you
to be human.

1055
01:22:33,645 --> 01:22:38,082
The only contact you get in here is gettin' stabbed in the back or gang-raped in the shower.

1056
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:43,233
That's what they've reduced you to. I mean, you've
obviously elevated it to something else with Lesra.

1057
01:22:43,365 --> 01:22:46,118
Yeah, because of you, Rube,
I wanna be a lawyer when I grow up...

1058
01:22:46,245 --> 01:22:48,122
and prove you innocent.

1059
01:22:48,245 --> 01:22:51,317
Except we don't have to wait till I'm a lawyer, Rube, because these guys want to help, man.

1060
01:22:51,445 --> 01:22:55,757
- We all believe in your innocence.
- I've been innocent for 16 years.

1061
01:22:55,885 --> 01:23:00,959
That's how long I've been in here. Innocence is a highly overrated commodity.

1062
01:23:01,085 --> 01:23:03,553
None of us can judge what you've been
through, but you might wanna consider-

1063
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:05,915
You're damn right none of you can judge
what I've been through...

1064
01:23:06,045 --> 01:23:08,081
because none of you
have been through it.

1065
01:23:08,205 --> 01:23:11,163
What do you know about doing time?
Tell me about it.

1066
01:23:11,285 --> 01:23:14,721
What do you know about what it is to be me? What do you
- What do you know about being in this place?

1067
01:23:14,845 --> 01:23:18,360
- Hey, this is too much, you guys.
- Yeah, you're right. This is too much.

1068
01:23:18,485 --> 01:23:21,557
Um, y'all, look,
let's just go, all right?

1069
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,155
- Rubin. Rubin. Rubin.
- Right there.

1070
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:33,357
Hey, listen, we left a package
for you in the mail room.

1071
01:23:57,765 --> 01:24:00,040
Yes.

1072
01:24:13,765 --> 01:24:17,235
Visitors left this for you
in the mail room.

1073
01:24:17,365 --> 01:24:20,994
We had to open it
'cause of security.

1074
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,400
Nice to have friends.

1075
01:24:39,805 --> 01:24:42,365
"Special gift for The Hurricane."

1076
01:24:49,245 --> 01:24:52,237
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.

1077
01:24:52,365 --> 01:24:54,481
Don't trust 'em.

1078
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:06,043
You trust a bunch of little white-ass
do-gooders more than you trust me...

1079
01:25:06,165 --> 01:25:08,759
more than you trust us.

1080
01:25:10,085 --> 01:25:12,360
Yeah. No more hate.

1081
01:25:14,285 --> 01:25:16,162
Try that on, huh?

1082
01:25:16,285 --> 01:25:19,163
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.
They'll turn on ya. Don't trust 'em, no.

1083
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:22,561
- Think me and you. Me and you.
- See how that fits.

1084
01:25:25,645 --> 01:25:28,159
- It's time.
- For what?

1085
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:32,241
It's time for you to go.

1086
01:25:32,365 --> 01:25:36,438
Don't you turn your back on me,
nigger.

1087
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:38,840
Rubin!

1088
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:40,717
Rubin!

1089
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:43,518
Ladies and gentlemen...

1090
01:25:43,645 --> 01:25:45,920
in this corner-

1091
01:25:47,365 --> 01:25:50,960
<i>In this corner,
from Paterson, New Jersey...</i>

1092
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:53,758
<i>wearing the white trunks
with black stripes...</i>

1093
01:25:53,885 --> 01:25:56,001
<i>Rubin "Hurricane" Carter!</i>

1094
01:26:09,325 --> 01:26:11,316
- Okay, Sam. Are you joining us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1095
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:13,322
- Lesra, get up back.
- Dear Rubin...

1096
01:26:13,445 --> 01:26:16,243
- I can't believe the warmth and beauty of your letter.
- Ready?

1097
01:26:16,365 --> 01:26:19,323
We get a rich, deep feeling
of experiencing your presence.

1098
01:26:19,445 --> 01:26:23,154
You've- You've made what we've
been saying the truth-

1099
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:25,674
that you can't keep people back
who refuse to be kept back.

1100
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:27,397
Here we go. Here we go.

1101
01:26:27,525 --> 01:26:31,313
We work out of our home, so we're
always here if you'd like to call.

1102
01:26:31,445 --> 01:26:33,913
We'd really like
to hear your voice.

1103
01:26:34,045 --> 01:26:36,923
You are very persuasive...

1104
01:26:37,045 --> 01:26:40,435
and I thank you
for all the things you send me...

1105
01:26:40,565 --> 01:26:43,716
but you people
are a bad influence on me.

1106
01:26:43,845 --> 01:26:47,440
I'm startin' to like all this stuff
a little too much.

1107
01:26:47,565 --> 01:26:49,954
You're lettin' me get loose.

1108
01:26:58,925 --> 01:27:01,962
Hello?

1109
01:27:02,085 --> 01:27:06,237
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.
Hey, Rube, what's happening, man?

1110
01:27:06,365 --> 01:27:11,359
Lesra, boy, you, uh- Well,
you sound more like a man every day.

1111
01:27:11,485 --> 01:27:14,682
Get outta here.

1112
01:27:14,805 --> 01:27:17,956
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, you know Canadians, man.

1113
01:27:18,085 --> 01:27:21,794
They're not happy unless they're outside,
you know, rakin' leaves or tappin' a tree for maple syrup.

1114
01:27:21,925 --> 01:27:23,836
I don't know how they do it, man.
It's cold out there too.

1115
01:27:23,965 --> 01:27:26,525
Hey, what's up, Rube?
Something happen?

1116
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:29,443
Yeah, I, um...

1117
01:27:29,565 --> 01:27:32,079
heard from the courts, Lesra.

1118
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:35,038
Been denied. I lost the appeal.

1119
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:39,685
Oh, no, man. Well-Well,
look, look, look, hold on, Rube.

1120
01:27:39,805 --> 01:27:42,239
- Let me tell everyone, okay?
- I gotta go, little brother.

1121
01:27:42,365 --> 01:27:45,038
No, well, wait, Rube!
W- Wait! Wait. Wait. But, Rube!

1122
01:27:45,165 --> 01:27:47,554
Rubin!

1123
01:27:47,685 --> 01:27:50,518
What's going on?

1124
01:27:56,765 --> 01:27:58,881
Lost the appeal.

1125
01:28:01,045 --> 01:28:04,082
Oh, no.

1126
01:28:17,645 --> 01:28:20,955
Dear Lesra, Terry, Sam...

1127
01:28:22,405 --> 01:28:24,919
Lisa...

1128
01:28:25,045 --> 01:28:28,754
this is, in many ways, the saddest
letter I've ever had to write.

1129
01:28:30,165 --> 01:28:33,919
I appreciate your many efforts
and kindnesses...

1130
01:28:34,045 --> 01:28:36,240
but I am a prisoner.

1131
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:40,404
My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival-

1132
01:28:40,525 --> 01:28:45,440
"My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival...

1133
01:28:45,565 --> 01:28:49,001
lies in my ability to do the time.

1134
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:53,357
This place is not one in which humanity
can survive. Only steel can.

1135
01:28:55,965 --> 01:28:58,843
This will be my last letter to you.

1136
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:02,321
Please do not write.
Please do not visit.

1137
01:29:03,645 --> 01:29:08,799
Please find it in your hearts
to not weaken me with your love.

1138
01:29:08,925 --> 01:29:10,836
Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

1139
01:29:16,045 --> 01:29:18,115
Open up, Ken.

1140
01:29:18,245 --> 01:29:20,315
Okay.

1141
01:29:22,085 --> 01:29:24,155
Thanks.

1142
01:29:34,565 --> 01:29:36,760
Rubin.

1143
01:29:38,565 --> 01:29:41,637
I got a letter here
for you from Canada.

1144
01:29:43,285 --> 01:29:46,482
I'm just gonna slide it
in here for you.

1145
01:29:50,405 --> 01:29:52,873
You do what you want with it.

1146
01:30:04,085 --> 01:30:06,235
"Dear Rube...

1147
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:08,720
I know you asked us not to write...

1148
01:30:08,845 --> 01:30:10,915
so I'm not writing...

1149
01:30:11,045 --> 01:30:13,639
just sending you two things.

1150
01:30:13,765 --> 01:30:17,838
One's a picture of me
and my new girlfriend, Pauline.

1151
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:21,236
The other...

1152
01:30:21,365 --> 01:30:24,675
is something that
rightfully belongs to you-

1153
01:30:24,805 --> 01:30:27,558
my high school diploma.

1154
01:30:27,685 --> 01:30:32,042
Your friend and brother forever,
Lesra Martin."

1155
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:56,965
<i>Don't count the stars</i>

1156
01:30:57,085 --> 01:31:01,158
<i>Or you might stumble</i>

1157
01:31:07,085 --> 01:31:09,235
Hello.

1158
01:31:11,765 --> 01:31:14,757
Yes, I accept-
I-I accept the charges.

1159
01:31:19,565 --> 01:31:22,159
Rubin? Hey.

1160
01:31:25,565 --> 01:31:28,033
R- Rubin, I-I-I can't hear you.

1161
01:31:36,085 --> 01:31:39,122
Rube-

1162
01:31:39,245 --> 01:31:41,315
Hello?

1163
01:31:50,965 --> 01:31:53,957
He said he can't do the time.

1164
01:32:27,245 --> 01:32:29,361
Uh, collect call to anyone...

1165
01:32:29,485 --> 01:32:32,636
from Mr Rubin Carter.

1166
01:32:32,765 --> 01:32:36,075
- Get it. Get it.
- Take one.

1167
01:32:36,205 --> 01:32:38,196
<i>- Yes.
- Rubin?</i>

1168
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:42,034
<i>- Lesra?
- No, it's Terry. I'm here with Lisa and Sam, and Lesra's here.</i>

1169
01:32:42,165 --> 01:32:44,121
Hey. How y'all doin'?

1170
01:32:44,245 --> 01:32:47,237
<i>Look out the window.</i>

1171
01:32:47,365 --> 01:32:49,242
What?

1172
01:32:49,365 --> 01:32:53,040
<i>You see that light?
The one that's blinking?</i>

1173
01:32:53,165 --> 01:32:55,360
<i>You see it?</i>

1174
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:57,521
Yeah.

1175
01:32:57,645 --> 01:33:00,921
<i>Can you see Lesra?</i>

1176
01:33:05,885 --> 01:33:09,673
Yeah, I see you.
What are y'all doin' here?

1177
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:14,237
- Can he see us?
- Yeah, he can see you.

1178
01:33:15,405 --> 01:33:18,283
- Rube!
- We're here.

1179
01:33:18,405 --> 01:33:20,475
We've moved down here.

1180
01:33:22,445 --> 01:33:25,960
<i>- For what? - We 're in this thing
full-time until you walk out of there.</i>

1181
01:33:26,085 --> 01:33:28,440
<i>Hold on.
Lisa wants to say something.</i>

1182
01:33:28,565 --> 01:33:30,760
Hurricane!

1183
01:33:30,885 --> 01:33:33,240
Hey, Rube.

1184
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:36,357
<i>Looks like you got
some foot soldiers now, huh?</i>

1185
01:33:38,685 --> 01:33:43,236
We're all in this together,
and we're not leaving till we all leave.

1186
01:33:47,765 --> 01:33:50,120
You're beautiful.

1187
01:33:50,245 --> 01:33:53,203
We're gonna take you home.

1188
01:33:53,325 --> 01:33:55,793
Okay.

1189
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,804
Okay.

1190
01:34:16,605 --> 01:34:19,642
Rubin has, uh, asked us to give you
copies of everything that we have...

1191
01:34:19,765 --> 01:34:21,642
and to answer any questions.

1192
01:34:21,765 --> 01:34:25,235
And since we've represented him
for over ten years...

1193
01:34:25,365 --> 01:34:27,242
there's an awful lot of material.

1194
01:34:27,365 --> 01:34:30,562
I mean, we have rooms
full of files.

1195
01:34:30,685 --> 01:34:32,755
Absolutely.
And, uh, please understand...

1196
01:34:32,885 --> 01:34:36,036
that we are not here
to second-guess you or-

1197
01:34:36,165 --> 01:34:40,078
You know, we- we've come down here
to help in any way we can.

1198
01:34:40,205 --> 01:34:43,163
Anything, you know.
Anything at all.

1199
01:34:48,205 --> 01:34:50,082
Well, that's very kind of you.

1200
01:34:50,205 --> 01:34:54,084
And I congratulate you
on your dedication to Rubin's case.

1201
01:34:54,205 --> 01:34:56,355
Uh, maybe I should add
that in those ten years...

1202
01:34:56,485 --> 01:34:58,760
we've been working on this,
we've donated our services.

1203
01:34:58,885 --> 01:35:01,319
We've never asked for a dime.
We never expect one. Do we?

1204
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,198
- No.
- I wanted to be sure.

1205
01:35:04,325 --> 01:35:07,715
And also in that time, uh,
there have been a lot of people...

1206
01:35:07,845 --> 01:35:10,154
great people...

1207
01:35:10,285 --> 01:35:12,480
all well-intentioned.

1208
01:35:12,605 --> 01:35:14,482
- Famous.
- Infamous.

1209
01:35:14,605 --> 01:35:18,644
Or not. Boxers, singers,
writers, actors...

1210
01:35:18,765 --> 01:35:20,721
journalists, et cetera.

1211
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:23,803
A lot of brave people
who gave their time...

1212
01:35:23,925 --> 01:35:27,804
and, to some degree,
risked their reputations.

1213
01:35:27,925 --> 01:35:30,962
People like you.

1214
01:35:31,085 --> 01:35:33,315
And, uh...

1215
01:35:33,445 --> 01:35:38,200
people come and go,
and, frankly, nobody lasts.

1216
01:35:39,685 --> 01:35:42,279
Nobody stays the course.

1217
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:47,160
Nobody goes the distance,
because it's too tough.

1218
01:35:47,285 --> 01:35:49,640
It's too slow...

1219
01:35:49,765 --> 01:35:52,802
and it's heartbreaking.

1220
01:35:52,925 --> 01:35:56,804
- It's too heartbreaking.
- Well, with all due respect, Mr Friedman...

1221
01:35:56,925 --> 01:36:00,804
what you have to understand
is that we're here.

1222
01:36:00,925 --> 01:36:05,715
We've moved here, and we have every intention of staying here until Rubin is free.

1223
01:36:05,845 --> 01:36:08,359
Right on.

1224
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:13,684
So we finally got in to see your lawyers, Beldock and Friedman, the other day.

1225
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:17,559
- How'd they take it?
- Oh, I'd say we handled ourselves pretty well.

1226
01:36:17,685 --> 01:36:21,473
Yeah, well, we hauled about what, ten
tons of documents, into the apartment.

1227
01:36:21,605 --> 01:36:24,881
- In broad daylight? - Yeah. - Oh,
yeah. - Wait a minute. Listen to me.

1228
01:36:25,005 --> 01:36:27,758
This is not Canada.

1229
01:36:27,885 --> 01:36:30,797
Now, I can protect you in here...

1230
01:36:30,925 --> 01:36:34,235
but there's not much
I can do for you on the outside.

1231
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:36,321
The only way I'm ever leaving
this place is if...

1232
01:36:36,445 --> 01:36:39,118
a lot of very important people
are exposed.

1233
01:36:39,245 --> 01:36:42,237
They're not gonna
just let that happen.

1234
01:36:42,365 --> 01:36:45,675
- You understand?
- We'll be careful.

1235
01:36:45,805 --> 01:36:49,195
Okay. Well, why don't you walk us
through what happened that night?

1236
01:36:49,325 --> 01:36:54,035
Now, three cops have testified
the shooting occurred at 2:45.

1237
01:36:54,165 --> 01:36:58,124
- So, uh, what time did you leave the Nite Spot?
- 2:30.

1238
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:02,841
<i>Oh, now tell me where can you party
child, all night long</i>

1239
01:37:02,965 --> 01:37:06,719
<i>- In the basement
- Anybody call a cab?</i>

1240
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:09,803
<i>- Oh, where did you go
- Time for me to get outta here.</i>

1241
01:37:09,925 --> 01:37:12,758
- How much do I owe you, Big Ed?
- Your money's no good here, champ.

1242
01:37:12,885 --> 01:37:16,844
- Anybody call a cab?
- I did, unless Rubin's taking me home.

1243
01:37:18,725 --> 01:37:21,398
If I take you,
it's gonna be more than home.

1244
01:37:21,525 --> 01:37:23,755
Get on outta here, girl.

1245
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:25,637
Shit.

1246
01:37:25,765 --> 01:37:28,916
What were you doin' out so late
on a Thursday night?

1247
01:37:29,045 --> 01:37:32,276
- What does it matter what night it was?
- Wasn't Thursday night ladies' night?

1248
01:37:32,405 --> 01:37:35,158
Didn't it matter to your wife?

1249
01:37:36,525 --> 01:37:40,438
I'm in the penitentiary for murder,
not attempted adultery.

1250
01:37:45,325 --> 01:37:49,523
So there was a cab there.
He must have seen you leave, right?

1251
01:37:49,645 --> 01:37:53,001
No. No, he left before I did.

1252
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:55,639
- Hey.
- Poor daddy goin' home.

1253
01:37:58,685 --> 01:38:01,153
- Bye, Rubin.
- Take it easy.

1254
01:38:01,285 --> 01:38:03,958
- Hey, champ.
- Huh? Hey!

1255
01:38:05,885 --> 01:38:07,955
Whoa! He's gone!

1256
01:38:11,805 --> 01:38:14,638
I wish to God John Artis
had met a girl that night.

1257
01:38:14,765 --> 01:38:19,236
I wish that, uh,
he hadn't been there at all.

1258
01:38:19,365 --> 01:38:23,278
He didn't deserve this.
He didn't deserve any of it.

1259
01:38:25,645 --> 01:38:28,113
Artis, let's go. You're done.

1260
01:38:28,245 --> 01:38:30,713
He got the same sentence I got,
and all he had to do...

1261
01:38:30,845 --> 01:38:34,281
was lie and say I killed
those people and...

1262
01:38:34,405 --> 01:38:39,274
they would have let him out
and his nightmare would have been over.

1263
01:38:39,405 --> 01:38:42,875
Most men couldn't have stood up
to that kind of torture...

1264
01:38:44,405 --> 01:38:46,361
but John Artis did.

1265
01:38:46,485 --> 01:38:48,760
The man is my hero.

1266
01:38:54,765 --> 01:38:58,155
So the police said it was 2:45
or a little after...

1267
01:38:58,285 --> 01:39:00,276
when all hell broke loose
at the Lafayette bar.

1268
01:39:00,405 --> 01:39:02,839
That's what they said.

1269
01:39:02,965 --> 01:39:06,355
Apparently, the two gunmen entered the
bar and immediately started shooting.

1270
01:39:16,085 --> 01:39:20,761
According to William Marins,
two guys barged in and just opened fire.

1271
01:39:20,885 --> 01:39:23,683
Oliver goes down first.

1272
01:39:23,805 --> 01:39:26,160
Nauyaks.

1273
01:39:26,285 --> 01:39:29,163
Then Marins was the only one
who got a look at 'em.

1274
01:39:29,285 --> 01:39:31,435
Then they shoot Hazel Tanis
and leave.

1275
01:39:38,245 --> 01:39:42,921
- What's Bello doing?
- Bello was a lookout for a burglary up the street.

1276
01:39:47,325 --> 01:39:50,203
- And who else saw anything?
- Patty Valentine.

1277
01:39:50,325 --> 01:39:53,203
She said she saw the getaway car.

1278
01:39:57,765 --> 01:40:01,235
And there was a man who lived across the
street by the name of Avery Cockersham.

1279
01:40:01,365 --> 01:40:03,435
Cockersham? That name
was in the police report.

1280
01:40:03,565 --> 01:40:06,363
- That's right.
- So how come he didn't testify?

1281
01:40:06,485 --> 01:40:09,716
The judge threw
the police report out.

1282
01:40:09,845 --> 01:40:12,405
Cockersham left town.
Nobody could find him.

1283
01:41:09,685 --> 01:41:13,758
It was two coloured guys. They just
walked in, they started shootin'.

1284
01:41:13,885 --> 01:41:16,240
Call the cops.

1285
01:41:29,245 --> 01:41:33,523
Now, according to the police,
the murders were racially motivated.

1286
01:41:33,645 --> 01:41:36,921
See, the bar didn't serve blacks, so naturally this crazy nigger, Rubin Carter...

1287
01:41:37,045 --> 01:41:40,196
had to take out his vengeance
on the entire white race.

1288
01:41:44,405 --> 01:41:46,635
Uh, this is, uh, Exhibit 11-F.

1289
01:41:46,765 --> 01:41:48,756
- This is 1966. - Wait a minute. What are
you talking about? Where are- Where are you?

1290
01:41:48,885 --> 01:41:50,796
- Trial transcripts, 1966.
- Oh. Stick to the blue cards.

1291
01:41:50,925 --> 01:41:53,280
- Valentine- Valentine first said...
- I know the blue cards.

1292
01:41:53,405 --> 01:41:55,521
The car's taillights
were similar to the getaway car.

1293
01:41:55,645 --> 01:42:00,002
- "Similar." - Right. Then in '76,
Exhibit 89-C, she says, quote...

1294
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:03,197
"The Carter car was unquestionably
the same car. There was no doubt."

1295
01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:05,202
- Closed quote.
- Exactly.

1296
01:42:05,325 --> 01:42:07,156
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?

1297
01:42:07,285 --> 01:42:11,119
Second trial, ten years later,
suddenly she changes her story.

1298
01:42:11,245 --> 01:42:14,396
She drew a picture,
like a bow tie.

1299
01:42:14,525 --> 01:42:18,484
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it here.

1300
01:42:18,605 --> 01:42:22,837
"Taillights lit up all across the back like a butterfly, as the killer's car drove away."

1301
01:42:22,965 --> 01:42:24,842
"Like a butterfly."

1302
01:42:24,965 --> 01:42:27,684
So the first thing we have to do is find out exactly what Rubin's car looked like.

1303
01:42:27,805 --> 01:42:30,956
- We need to find a '66 Dodge Polara.
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:42:31,085 --> 01:42:33,553
There's the bow-tie lights,
like Patty Valentine described.

1305
01:42:33,685 --> 01:42:36,245
- I'm not so sure about
that. - You ready? - Yeah!

1306
01:42:36,365 --> 01:42:39,118
Yeah.

1307
01:42:43,885 --> 01:42:47,275
See that?
They don't light up all the way.

1308
01:42:47,405 --> 01:42:50,158
Oh, no, that's a Dodge Monaco.
You don't want one of those.

1309
01:42:50,285 --> 01:42:54,164
They don't have the power. Look,
I'll make you a good deal on this one.

1310
01:42:54,285 --> 01:42:56,753
- Shit.
- Monaco?

1311
01:43:36,565 --> 01:43:40,319
- Mr Carter?
- Yeah.

1312
01:43:40,445 --> 01:43:42,959
I was told to get you.

1313
01:43:43,085 --> 01:43:46,236
Get me? By whom?

1314
01:43:46,365 --> 01:43:48,481
The warden wants to see you.

1315
01:43:52,765 --> 01:43:55,563
- For what?
- I don't know.

1316
01:44:09,085 --> 01:44:11,360
Open up, Al.

1317
01:44:30,445 --> 01:44:32,640
Mr Carter.

1318
01:44:37,245 --> 01:44:41,523
I have a difficult job
running this place...

1319
01:44:41,645 --> 01:44:43,158
but I do it.

1320
01:44:43,285 --> 01:44:46,436
I do it really well.

1321
01:44:47,845 --> 01:44:51,394
You called me down here
at 3:00 in the morning to tell me that?

1322
01:44:51,525 --> 01:44:55,040
I hear things.
I hear everything.

1323
01:44:57,045 --> 01:44:59,354
What have you heard, Warden?

1324
01:44:59,485 --> 01:45:02,682
I hear something's goin' down.

1325
01:45:02,805 --> 01:45:07,720
I don't want a mess,
something that I can't clean up.

1326
01:45:07,845 --> 01:45:10,678
This doesn't have anything
to do with my case, does it?

1327
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:13,603
Shit happens every day...

1328
01:45:13,725 --> 01:45:17,354
and I wanna warn you, that's all.

1329
01:45:17,485 --> 01:45:22,036
Somebody tries to take you down,
something gets started...

1330
01:45:22,165 --> 01:45:24,121
I can't stop it.

1331
01:45:24,245 --> 01:45:28,557
- You understand me?
- What do you suggest I do?

1332
01:45:28,685 --> 01:45:31,563
Stay alive.

1333
01:45:31,685 --> 01:45:35,394
And that goes for your friends too.

1334
01:45:35,525 --> 01:45:38,358
Guard.

1335
01:46:03,325 --> 01:46:08,240
- Who is it?
- We're looking for an Avery Cockersham.

1336
01:46:11,925 --> 01:46:15,122
Do the Cockershams live here?

1337
01:46:15,245 --> 01:46:18,442
I'm Mrs Cockersham.
What do you want?

1338
01:46:18,565 --> 01:46:20,442
You're black.

1339
01:46:22,045 --> 01:46:24,559
You're white.

1340
01:46:24,685 --> 01:46:28,564
Baked fresh this morning.
Now, you take the white one.

1341
01:46:31,005 --> 01:46:34,395
Yeah, there were plenty coloured folks
in the neighbourhood...

1342
01:46:34,525 --> 01:46:37,722
and in the bar too.

1343
01:46:37,845 --> 01:46:41,042
- Avery and me were regulars.
- They served blacks in the bar?

1344
01:46:41,165 --> 01:46:43,042
We had a running tab.

1345
01:46:43,165 --> 01:46:46,601
So much for the racial motive, eh?

1346
01:46:46,725 --> 01:46:50,115
My Avery got a good look
at those men...

1347
01:46:50,245 --> 01:46:52,395
and it wasn't Rubin Carter.

1348
01:46:52,525 --> 01:46:55,676
He told the police.
He told 'em and he told 'em.

1349
01:46:55,805 --> 01:46:58,399
He even signed a statement
for that detective.

1350
01:46:58,525 --> 01:47:01,517
You know the one. Heavy set.

1351
01:47:01,645 --> 01:47:04,557
He looked like
a bulldog with glasses.

1352
01:47:04,685 --> 01:47:07,643
- Della Pesca.
- That's the one.

1353
01:47:07,765 --> 01:47:11,838
Could we, uh,
talk with your husband?

1354
01:47:14,085 --> 01:47:16,360
Avery's dead.

1355
01:47:17,885 --> 01:47:20,843
He died just before the trial.

1356
01:47:24,565 --> 01:47:26,795
I'm sorry.

1357
01:47:48,685 --> 01:47:51,836
Here's stuff I wanna check out.

1358
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:54,354
What is this?

1359
01:47:54,485 --> 01:47:57,318
Who the fuck you think you are?

1360
01:47:59,365 --> 01:48:03,358
- Does this look like Toronto to you?
- Excuse me?

1361
01:48:03,485 --> 01:48:05,555
You know, you people, you got
some nerve comin' down here...

1362
01:48:05,685 --> 01:48:09,724
pokin' your nose
where it don't belong.

1363
01:48:09,845 --> 01:48:14,202
Let me ask you something,
Mr Canada.

1364
01:48:14,325 --> 01:48:16,998
What the fuck do you know
about this place, huh? Huh?

1365
01:48:17,125 --> 01:48:20,037
You know anything?
You don't know shit.

1366
01:48:20,165 --> 01:48:22,360
Let me enlighten you...

1367
01:48:22,485 --> 01:48:26,763
because you don't know
what you're doin'.

1368
01:48:26,885 --> 01:48:31,834
You are making enemies
that you don't know exist.

1369
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:35,799
- Huh?
- We know about you.

1370
01:48:35,925 --> 01:48:38,962
You don't know shit about me.
You understand?

1371
01:48:39,085 --> 01:48:41,963
You don't know shit about this place,
and let me tell ya something else.

1372
01:48:42,085 --> 01:48:44,076
You're not welcome here, okay?

1373
01:48:44,205 --> 01:48:46,799
You're not fuckin' welcome here.

1374
01:48:46,925 --> 01:48:50,520
You got that?
Go back to where you belong.

1375
01:49:14,205 --> 01:49:16,765
Lesra's gonna have to get on
with school, so...

1376
01:49:16,885 --> 01:49:20,195
we might want to send him back
for a while.

1377
01:49:20,325 --> 01:49:23,078
- I understand. It's probably the best.
- Yeah.

1378
01:49:23,205 --> 01:49:26,356
- Yeah.
- What about you?

1379
01:49:26,485 --> 01:49:31,115
Oh, it's- it's gonna take
a little longer than we thought.

1380
01:49:34,405 --> 01:49:36,555
Y'all all right?

1381
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:41,597
Yeah.

1382
01:49:51,085 --> 01:49:53,121
I have asked myself, Lisa...

1383
01:49:53,245 --> 01:49:57,158
if I could do for anyone...

1384
01:49:57,285 --> 01:50:01,324
what you and Sam and Terry and Lesra
have done for me, and the answer is no.

1385
01:50:01,445 --> 01:50:03,720
- So if you feel like you need
to go home... - Shh. We're not-

1386
01:50:03,845 --> 01:50:07,884
for any reason,
I'll understand. You-

1387
01:50:08,005 --> 01:50:10,963
No, you gotta understand.
We're not-

1388
01:50:11,085 --> 01:50:14,077
We're not leaving without you.

1389
01:50:16,205 --> 01:50:18,844
All right?

1390
01:50:18,965 --> 01:50:21,638
And we're gonna find something.

1391
01:50:27,485 --> 01:50:29,077
Um, well, I found something-

1392
01:50:30,565 --> 01:50:33,875
a fellow by the name of Barbieri.

1393
01:50:35,605 --> 01:50:39,598
He's a private investigator. Prosecution
hired him in the second trial.

1394
01:50:39,725 --> 01:50:42,193
- Didn't he resign from the case or something?
- He quit...

1395
01:50:42,325 --> 01:50:45,522
and he turned in his murder book
and crime-scene photos...

1396
01:50:45,645 --> 01:50:48,796
list of evidence, but no notes.

1397
01:50:48,925 --> 01:50:51,598
- Anyone talk to him?
- Myron tracked him down.

1398
01:50:51,725 --> 01:50:54,034
- What'd he say?
- Nothin'. He was scared.

1399
01:50:54,165 --> 01:50:57,555
- Of whom?
- Of the people he was workin' with.

1400
01:51:07,445 --> 01:51:09,800
- Mrs Barbieri?
- Miss.

1401
01:51:09,925 --> 01:51:13,998
- Hello. Uh, is Mr Barbieri in?
- There isn't any mister.

1402
01:51:15,845 --> 01:51:19,076
Uh, Dominick, Dominick Barbieri?

1403
01:51:19,205 --> 01:51:23,118
That was my father.
He passed away years ago.

1404
01:51:34,645 --> 01:51:37,955
Wow. Maybe you oughta have
a yard sale.

1405
01:51:38,085 --> 01:51:40,474
That case always bothered
my father.

1406
01:51:40,605 --> 01:51:44,678
He never talked about it. He said
he had to live in this town, you know?

1407
01:51:44,805 --> 01:51:47,273
Yeah. Do you have any idea
where his notes might be?

1408
01:51:47,405 --> 01:51:50,681
Well, if he kept them at all,
they'd be in one of those boxes.

1409
01:51:54,085 --> 01:51:57,964
Guy was a pack rat. He must have saved
every case he ever worked on.

1410
01:52:01,205 --> 01:52:03,480
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1411
01:52:05,365 --> 01:52:07,959
- I found it. Look at this. Look.
- What?

1412
01:52:08,085 --> 01:52:10,724
- He kept a damn diary.
- Oh, look.

1413
01:52:10,845 --> 01:52:14,360
Who would have thought he'd put it
in a diary? But he did. Look at this.

1414
01:52:14,485 --> 01:52:16,441
There.

1415
01:52:16,565 --> 01:52:19,557
A call was placed to
an emergency operator named Jean Wahl...

1416
01:52:19,685 --> 01:52:22,677
at 2:28 a. M. To report the shooting.

1417
01:52:22,805 --> 01:52:25,273
- At 2:28?
- That's right.

1418
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:28,238
She then calls the cops
to tell them.

1419
01:52:28,365 --> 01:52:30,720
They say they already know about it.
In fact...

1420
01:52:30,845 --> 01:52:34,918
they've got a cruiser on its way
over to the Lafayette at that moment.

1421
01:52:35,045 --> 01:52:37,115
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

1422
01:52:39,565 --> 01:52:42,033
According to Barbieri...

1423
01:52:42,165 --> 01:52:45,714
"time on the record
of customer contact was changed...

1424
01:52:45,845 --> 01:52:48,723
from 2:28 to 2:45."

1425
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:51,757
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch.

1426
01:52:51,885 --> 01:52:54,353
Which, if true,
puts John Artis and myself...

1427
01:52:54,485 --> 01:52:58,034
at the Nite Spot
at the time of the killings.

1428
01:52:58,165 --> 01:53:00,963
Well, if we can prove
she got the call at 2:28.

1429
01:53:01,085 --> 01:53:03,235
We'll prove it.

1430
01:53:05,965 --> 01:53:08,115
We can prove it.

1431
01:53:19,605 --> 01:53:21,755
Mrs Wahl?

1432
01:53:21,885 --> 01:53:26,561
Hi. My name is Sam Chaiton. We spoke on the phone about the Rubin Carter case.

1433
01:53:26,685 --> 01:53:29,279
- I told you, I don't want to talk to you.
- Mrs Wahl, please.

1434
01:53:29,405 --> 01:53:31,521
Um, you told an investigator
named Barbieri...

1435
01:53:31,645 --> 01:53:36,241
that an emergency call you took the night of the Lafayette bar murders was at 2:28.

1436
01:53:36,365 --> 01:53:39,118
I don't know what I told him.
It was a long time ago.

1437
01:53:39,245 --> 01:53:43,079
Uh, but there's a card
that says 2:45 on it...

1438
01:53:43,205 --> 01:53:46,083
and, uh, you didn't sign the card.

1439
01:53:46,205 --> 01:53:49,754
According to Barbieri, it was signed
by a Miss Lenore Harkinson.

1440
01:53:49,885 --> 01:53:53,400
- She was my supervisor.
- Why would your supervisor sign the card?

1441
01:53:53,525 --> 01:53:55,675
And wouldn't you normally
do that yourself?

1442
01:53:55,805 --> 01:53:59,639
Look, if there's a card and that's
what it says, then that's what it says.

1443
01:53:59,765 --> 01:54:04,236
I don't remember anything else. And if someone tries to make me testify, that's just what I'll say.

1444
01:54:04,365 --> 01:54:07,516
Uh, look, Mrs Wahl-

1445
01:54:07,645 --> 01:54:09,715
Thank you.

1446
01:54:11,925 --> 01:54:15,679
So this is a copy of the phone
company's record of customer contact.

1447
01:54:15,805 --> 01:54:19,115
It's all there,
just like Barbieri said.

1448
01:54:19,245 --> 01:54:21,440
2:45.

1449
01:54:23,445 --> 01:54:25,322
Look at the signature on the card.

1450
01:54:25,445 --> 01:54:29,404
It's signed by Lenora Harkinson,
Jean Wahl's supervisor.

1451
01:54:29,525 --> 01:54:32,676
Does that mean anything to you?

1452
01:54:34,325 --> 01:54:37,237
It means she didn't have
to write up a phoney ticket.

1453
01:54:37,365 --> 01:54:39,925
What?

1454
01:54:40,045 --> 01:54:42,434
He signed it himself.

1455
01:54:42,565 --> 01:54:45,557
Who?

1456
01:54:45,685 --> 01:54:49,883
His handwriting is
on every report that...

1457
01:54:50,005 --> 01:54:53,554
put me in prison
since I was 11 years old.

1458
01:54:56,165 --> 01:54:58,360
It's Della Pesca.

1459
01:55:01,405 --> 01:55:03,760
It's his handwriting.

1460
01:55:16,245 --> 01:55:18,634
- Oh, shit! What's happening?
- What the hell is that?

1461
01:55:18,765 --> 01:55:21,643
- Don't know.
- What is that?

1462
01:55:26,325 --> 01:55:28,156
- Oh, shit!
- Hold on!

1463
01:55:33,805 --> 01:55:37,081
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1464
01:55:37,205 --> 01:55:39,719
- Les, you okay? - I'm
all right. - Are ya?

1465
01:55:41,885 --> 01:55:44,957
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I think so. Damn.

1466
01:55:46,685 --> 01:55:48,915
- Yeah? - Shit.
- Hey, you okay?

1467
01:55:49,045 --> 01:55:51,559
- What the fuck was that?
- Need help?

1468
01:55:51,685 --> 01:55:53,721
We're okay. Thanks.

1469
01:55:53,845 --> 01:55:55,836
- Are they all right?
- Goddam.

1470
01:55:55,965 --> 01:55:58,843
The car just went right over
the centre divider-

1471
01:56:11,685 --> 01:56:15,075
Rubin, the law states we have to take our new evidence back to the original trial judge...

1472
01:56:15,205 --> 01:56:19,278
- and then if he turns us down, we go to the
state appeals court- - No. No, no, no, no!

1473
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:24,081
Listen to me. These people
aren't gonna just let that happen.

1474
01:56:24,205 --> 01:56:26,275
They've made their careers
on my case.

1475
01:56:26,405 --> 01:56:29,522
- What are you talking about, Rubin?
- I'm talking about lawyers, prosecutors, judges...

1476
01:56:29,645 --> 01:56:33,081
who have moved up the ladder
on my black back.

1477
01:56:34,965 --> 01:56:37,240
We don't even know what enemies
we have out there in this state.

1478
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:40,914
We gotta take it out of New Jersey, and
we gotta take it to the federal court.

1479
01:56:41,045 --> 01:56:43,513
Rubin, if you go
into federal court...

1480
01:56:43,645 --> 01:56:46,318
with new evidence that hasn't been
heard in the state court...

1481
01:56:46,445 --> 01:56:48,913
the judge is gonna throw
it out, okay?

1482
01:56:49,045 --> 01:56:51,354
- That is the law.
- Then we transcend the law.

1483
01:56:51,485 --> 01:56:54,477
We, we, we get back to humanity.

1484
01:56:54,605 --> 01:56:57,073
You said it yourself.
You said if we take the new evidence...

1485
01:56:57,205 --> 01:57:00,675
before the federal judge, he's gotta look at it before he throws it out, right?

1486
01:57:00,805 --> 01:57:04,354
- Right.
- I believe that once he looks at it, he will have seen the truth.

1487
01:57:04,485 --> 01:57:08,558
Having seen the truth,
he can't turn his back on me.

1488
01:57:08,685 --> 01:57:11,995
And what if you're wrong
and he does turn away? Then what?

1489
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:15,322
Then you throw out all this evidence
that everyone's fought so hard to get.

1490
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:19,563
And you know what, Rubin? You will never be able to mention it in a court of law again.

1491
01:57:19,685 --> 01:57:23,963
It is finished. It's erased.
It's as if it never happened.

1492
01:57:24,085 --> 01:57:28,203
This evidence is the key to getting you out of here, and you'll be throwing it away, Rubin...

1493
01:57:28,325 --> 01:57:31,556
- when in a few more years-
- I don't have a few more years, Myron!

1494
01:57:33,165 --> 01:57:35,679
- Leon, help me out.
- I can't.

1495
01:57:35,805 --> 01:57:38,080
I agree with Rubin.
It's time to move on.

1496
01:57:38,205 --> 01:57:40,878
- Move on? What do you mean, move on? Move on where?
- The state's biased, Myron.

1497
01:57:41,005 --> 01:57:42,961
We're never gonna get anything there.
We have to go federal.

1498
01:57:43,085 --> 01:57:47,875
- We can't take the risk of going federal with this.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

1499
01:57:53,085 --> 01:57:55,360
I'm 50 years old.

1500
01:57:58,965 --> 01:58:02,799
I've been locked up
here for 30 years.

1501
01:58:06,045 --> 01:58:10,277
I've put a lot of
good people's lives at risk.

1502
01:58:10,405 --> 01:58:13,283
Now, either I get outta here-

1503
01:58:18,205 --> 01:58:20,719
Get me outta here.

1504
01:58:44,085 --> 01:58:46,155
Ready?

1505
01:58:48,565 --> 01:58:50,760
Good luck, Rubin.

1506
01:58:58,045 --> 01:59:01,401
This is for you.
You stay strong.

1507
01:59:07,965 --> 01:59:12,436
- Good luck.
- My man. Peace, baby. Be cool now.

1508
01:59:12,565 --> 01:59:14,635
Good luck, Mr Carter.

1509
01:59:36,685 --> 01:59:39,961
- Rubin.
- Rubin Carter, prisoner 45472.

1510
01:59:41,365 --> 01:59:43,959
- See you around.
- Okay, Jimmy.

1511
01:59:51,845 --> 01:59:54,359
Your Honour, we appear before you...

1512
01:59:54,485 --> 01:59:58,956
in our 19th year before the courts.

1513
01:59:59,085 --> 02:00:02,680
Rubin Carter has never enjoyed
a full, fair...

1514
02:00:02,805 --> 02:00:05,239
and unforced disclosure
of the facts...

1515
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:08,277
to which he is
constitutionally entitled.

1516
02:00:10,445 --> 02:00:14,199
For 19 years,
the truth has been hidden...

1517
02:00:15,685 --> 02:00:18,153
not only from Rubin Carter's eyes...

1518
02:00:18,285 --> 02:00:21,561
- but from the eyes of justice
itself and- - Uh, Your Honour.

1519
02:00:21,685 --> 02:00:23,676
The prosecution
objects forcefully here.

1520
02:00:23,805 --> 02:00:26,194
Counsel is attempting
to present new evidence...

1521
02:00:26,325 --> 02:00:28,839
and circumvent
the State Court of New Jersey.

1522
02:00:28,965 --> 02:00:31,320
Your Honour must,
according to the law...

1523
02:00:31,445 --> 02:00:34,562
drop this entire petition
where it belongs- into the garbage.

1524
02:00:34,685 --> 02:00:37,882
Your Honour, we implore you
to at least hear us...

1525
02:00:38,005 --> 02:00:40,041
before making your ruling.

1526
02:00:40,165 --> 02:00:42,235
Mr Beldock, I hope you understand...

1527
02:00:42,365 --> 02:00:45,243
the implications of your action.

1528
02:00:45,365 --> 02:00:49,517
That is a very slippery slope...

1529
02:00:49,645 --> 02:00:53,240
you're trying to climb.

1530
02:00:53,365 --> 02:00:56,914
- We do, Your Honour.
- Proceed.

1531
02:01:01,765 --> 02:01:04,757
In 1976, the State of New Jersey's...

1532
02:01:04,885 --> 02:01:07,763
chief investigator of this case,
Dominick Barbieri...

1533
02:01:07,885 --> 02:01:11,195
resigned because he
discovered the truth.

1534
02:01:11,325 --> 02:01:13,316
He discovered
that this case was built...

1535
02:01:13,445 --> 02:01:17,484
on a foundation
of forgeries and lies.

1536
02:01:17,605 --> 02:01:20,563
Those lies show the guilt
not of Rubin Carter...

1537
02:01:20,685 --> 02:01:24,758
but of a corrupt police force
and the prosecutor's office.

1538
02:01:29,045 --> 02:01:33,323
And now this wall of lies
has been destroyed...

1539
02:01:33,445 --> 02:01:36,323
so that this court
may finally see the truth...

1540
02:01:36,445 --> 02:01:39,482
and, pray God,
not turn its eyes away.

1541
02:01:39,605 --> 02:01:43,837
This court is
not unmoved by your...

1542
02:01:43,965 --> 02:01:46,525
eloquence and passion...

1543
02:01:46,645 --> 02:01:49,443
but the prosecution is correct.

1544
02:01:49,565 --> 02:01:52,125
This petition
contains new evidence...

1545
02:01:52,245 --> 02:01:57,239
that has not been presented
before the State Court of New Jersey...

1546
02:01:57,365 --> 02:02:00,960
and there is no legal argument
that you could make...

1547
02:02:01,085 --> 02:02:03,838
which would allow me to consider it.

1548
02:02:03,965 --> 02:02:07,514
Therefore, you have
two choices before you:

1549
02:02:07,645 --> 02:02:10,717
I can send this case
back to the state court...

1550
02:02:10,845 --> 02:02:13,439
and you can present the evidence...

1551
02:02:13,565 --> 02:02:16,716
or, if you insist...

1552
02:02:16,845 --> 02:02:20,315
on, uh, proceeding...

1553
02:02:20,445 --> 02:02:24,040
this evidence will be lost
to you forever.

1554
02:02:28,325 --> 02:02:32,204
You understand the choice
before you, Mr Beldock?

1555
02:02:38,885 --> 02:02:43,561
Your Honour, may I request
a moment to confer with my client?

1556
02:02:43,685 --> 02:02:47,564
That's the smartest thing
you've said all morning, Counsellor.

1557
02:02:54,525 --> 02:02:58,234
Rubin, listen to me. This judge is telling us as clearly as he possibly can...

1558
02:02:58,365 --> 02:03:00,833
that he's going
to rule against you.

1559
02:03:00,965 --> 02:03:03,638
- This is our last stand, Myron.
- Rubin, I am begging you-

1560
02:03:03,765 --> 02:03:05,915
Let's proceed.

1561
02:03:15,765 --> 02:03:21,795
Your Honour, my client wishes
to continue with this proceeding.

1562
02:03:21,925 --> 02:03:23,961
Uh, do you do so formally...

1563
02:03:24,085 --> 02:03:27,680
and, uh, are you aware of the, uh...

1564
02:03:27,805 --> 02:03:31,081
significance of such an action?

1565
02:03:31,205 --> 02:03:34,402
We do so formally.

1566
02:03:39,445 --> 02:03:42,676
- Proceed.
- But, Your Honour-

1567
02:03:42,805 --> 02:03:44,875
- Yes?
- Uh, the state is not prepared...

1568
02:03:45,005 --> 02:03:47,280
to proceed to argue
the merits of this case.

1569
02:03:47,405 --> 02:03:49,236
Why not?

1570
02:03:51,085 --> 02:03:52,962
Well, we, we assumed...

1571
02:03:53,085 --> 02:03:56,600
that the court would not hear
this petition based on new evidence.

1572
02:03:58,605 --> 02:04:00,482
You assumed wrong.

1573
02:04:04,205 --> 02:04:06,275
Proceed.

1574
02:04:07,965 --> 02:04:11,355
So, Your Honour, this case
was poisoned from the start.

1575
02:04:11,485 --> 02:04:13,362
No evidence.

1576
02:04:13,485 --> 02:04:17,160
No witnesses,
except admitted liars.

1577
02:04:17,285 --> 02:04:20,083
Only a racially charged atmosphere...

1578
02:04:20,205 --> 02:04:23,641
which was fanned by the police
and the prosecutors...

1579
02:04:23,765 --> 02:04:27,360
who knew the truth
and distorted it...

1580
02:04:27,485 --> 02:04:31,239
and subverted it and destroyed it...

1581
02:04:31,365 --> 02:04:33,560
to convict an innocent man.

1582
02:04:36,045 --> 02:04:38,320
What more can the State
of New Jersey do, Your Honour...

1583
02:04:38,445 --> 02:04:40,879
than give a man not one...

1584
02:04:41,005 --> 02:04:43,314
but two jury trials?

1585
02:04:43,445 --> 02:04:46,084
And nothing has changed since then.

1586
02:04:46,205 --> 02:04:50,483
Mr Carter is, and always has been,
a menace to society.

1587
02:04:50,605 --> 02:04:52,800
He's been in and out of jail
his whole life.

1588
02:04:52,925 --> 02:04:55,519
A criminal.
He's a violent man.

1589
02:04:55,645 --> 02:04:57,954
His whole life has been violence.

1590
02:04:58,085 --> 02:05:01,236
And it is our duty, Your Honour,
to continue to protect...

1591
02:05:01,365 --> 02:05:04,437
the general public
from such a man.

1592
02:05:04,565 --> 02:05:06,840
Thank you.

1593
02:05:13,605 --> 02:05:18,884
I've heard your statements.
Uh, I'll take them under consideration.

1594
02:05:19,005 --> 02:05:22,793
Now, is there anything else
that counsel wishes to add...

1595
02:05:22,925 --> 02:05:26,361
before I make my final ruling?

1596
02:05:26,485 --> 02:05:28,555
- What are you doing? - I want to say
something. - What are you gonna say?

1597
02:05:28,685 --> 02:05:31,438
I want to-
I need to say something.

1598
02:05:31,565 --> 02:05:34,238
Uh, Your Honour, m-my-
my client, Mr Carter...

1599
02:05:34,365 --> 02:05:36,560
wishes to address the court.

1600
02:05:38,405 --> 02:05:40,760
Request granted.

1601
02:05:40,885 --> 02:05:42,955
Thank you, Your Honour.

1602
02:05:45,365 --> 02:05:48,118
I was a, um...

1603
02:05:48,245 --> 02:05:50,440
prizefighter.

1604
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,559
My job was to...

1605
02:05:54,685 --> 02:05:56,676
take all the hatred...

1606
02:05:56,805 --> 02:05:59,399
and skill that I could muster...

1607
02:05:59,525 --> 02:06:04,076
and send a man to his destruction,
and I did that.

1608
02:06:06,165 --> 02:06:09,362
But Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
is no murderer.

1609
02:06:11,925 --> 02:06:15,076
Twenty years I've spent
locked up in a cage...

1610
02:06:15,205 --> 02:06:17,355
considered a danger to society.

1611
02:06:19,165 --> 02:06:21,440
Not treated like a human being.

1612
02:06:21,565 --> 02:06:24,159
Not treated like a person.

1613
02:06:24,285 --> 02:06:27,083
Counted 15 times a day.

1614
02:06:29,325 --> 02:06:31,680
I serve my time
in a house of justice...

1615
02:06:31,805 --> 02:06:34,114
and yet, there's
no justice for me.

1616
02:06:35,645 --> 02:06:41,117
So, I ask you
to consider the evidence.

1617
02:06:41,245 --> 02:06:46,160
Don't turn away from the truth.
Don't turn away from your conscience.

1618
02:06:46,285 --> 02:06:49,834
Please, don't ignore the law.
No, em-embrace that...

1619
02:06:49,965 --> 02:06:53,958
higher principle for which
the law was meant to serve.

1620
02:06:58,085 --> 02:07:00,758
Justice. That's all
I ask for, Your Honour.

1621
02:07:02,965 --> 02:07:05,525
Justice.

1622
02:07:09,325 --> 02:07:11,919
This court is in recess.

1623
02:07:25,765 --> 02:07:28,040
Oh, thank you.

1624
02:07:39,845 --> 02:07:41,915
It's good.

1625
02:07:48,605 --> 02:07:51,915
Come a long way,
huh, little brother?

1626
02:07:54,085 --> 02:07:56,553
Yeah.

1627
02:07:56,685 --> 02:07:58,960
Look, Rubin, I just want you to know
if this doesn't work...

1628
02:07:59,085 --> 02:08:01,883
I'm bustin' you outta here.

1629
02:08:02,005 --> 02:08:04,075
- You are?
- Yeah. That's right.

1630
02:08:04,205 --> 02:08:06,275
I'm bustin' you outta here.

1631
02:08:09,005 --> 02:08:11,724
What was the first book
you ever bought?

1632
02:08:13,165 --> 02:08:15,315
Yours.

1633
02:08:16,645 --> 02:08:20,035
You think that was an accident?

1634
02:08:20,165 --> 02:08:23,123
- No.
- No, me neither.

1635
02:08:23,245 --> 02:08:26,920
Lesra, short for Lazarus.

1636
02:08:27,045 --> 02:08:30,321
"He who has risen from the dead."

1637
02:08:31,765 --> 02:08:34,120
Rubin.

1638
02:08:34,245 --> 02:08:37,237
Genesis, chapter 29, verse 32.

1639
02:08:37,365 --> 02:08:39,879
"Behold a son."

1640
02:08:42,205 --> 02:08:44,355
You put those two together, Lesra,
and you have...

1641
02:08:44,485 --> 02:08:47,636
"Behold a son who is risen...

1642
02:08:47,765 --> 02:08:49,915
from the dead."

1643
02:08:52,645 --> 02:08:54,795
That's no accident.

1644
02:08:58,765 --> 02:09:01,563
Hate put me in prison.

1645
02:09:03,605 --> 02:09:06,597
Love's gonna bust me out.

1646
02:09:10,485 --> 02:09:14,956
Just in case love doesn't,
I'm gonna bust you outta here.

1647
02:09:25,565 --> 02:09:27,635
Yeah.

1648
02:09:27,765 --> 02:09:31,121
You already have, Lesra.

1649
02:09:31,325 --> 02:09:33,316
All rise.

1650
02:09:36,325 --> 02:09:39,556
This Federal District Court
of New Jersey is now in session.

1651
02:09:39,685 --> 02:09:41,835
Judge Sarokin presiding.

1652
02:09:45,485 --> 02:09:48,079
Be seated.

1653
02:10:05,605 --> 02:10:10,360
This court does not arrive
at its conclusion lightly.

1654
02:10:10,485 --> 02:10:13,716
On one hand, Rubin Carter
has submitted a document...

1655
02:10:13,845 --> 02:10:16,518
alleging racial prejudice...

1656
02:10:16,645 --> 02:10:19,921
coercion of testimony
and withholding of evidence.

1657
02:10:20,045 --> 02:10:22,081
On the other hand...

1658
02:10:22,205 --> 02:10:25,197
Mr Carter was tried twice...

1659
02:10:25,325 --> 02:10:27,475
by two different juries...

1660
02:10:27,605 --> 02:10:30,073
and those convictions
were subsequently upheld...

1661
02:10:30,205 --> 02:10:33,880
by the New Jersey
State Supreme Court.

1662
02:10:34,005 --> 02:10:38,044
He's gonna rule against us.
Rubin's gonna lose.

1663
02:10:38,165 --> 02:10:40,395
However, the extensive record...

1664
02:10:40,525 --> 02:10:42,914
clearly demonstrates
to this court...

1665
02:10:43,045 --> 02:10:45,275
that Rubin Carter's conviction...

1666
02:10:45,405 --> 02:10:48,522
was predicated upon an appeal...

1667
02:10:48,645 --> 02:10:50,840
to racism...

1668
02:10:50,965 --> 02:10:53,035
rather than reason...

1669
02:10:53,165 --> 02:10:55,315
and concealment...

1670
02:10:55,445 --> 02:10:58,517
rather than disclosure.

1671
02:10:58,645 --> 02:11:01,113
To permit convictions to stand...

1672
02:11:01,245 --> 02:11:03,520
which have
as their sole foundation...

1673
02:11:03,645 --> 02:11:07,274
appeals to racial prejudice...

1674
02:11:07,405 --> 02:11:09,680
is to commit...

1675
02:11:09,805 --> 02:11:11,955
a violation...

1676
02:11:12,085 --> 02:11:14,041
of the Constitution...

1677
02:11:14,165 --> 02:11:18,044
as heinous as the crimes
for which the defendants...

1678
02:11:18,165 --> 02:11:20,156
were tried...

1679
02:11:20,285 --> 02:11:22,196
and convicted.

1680
02:11:22,325 --> 02:11:24,680
I hereby order Rubin Carter...

1681
02:11:24,805 --> 02:11:27,399
- released from prison...
- Yes!

1682
02:11:27,525 --> 02:11:30,403
Henceforth, from this day forward.

1683
02:11:30,525 --> 02:11:33,278
Yes! Yes.

1684
02:11:34,805 --> 02:11:37,524
This court is adjourned.

1685
02:11:37,645 --> 02:11:41,558
Hey, Rube, you made- you made it, man!
You're free! Can you stand it?

1686
02:11:45,205 --> 02:11:47,639
You did it, Rube.
You did it, man.

1687
02:11:49,405 --> 02:11:52,203
- Yeah, huh?
- Yeah!

1688
02:12:10,565 --> 02:12:13,443
<i>Rubin Carter has just been freed.</i>

1689
02:12:26,565 --> 02:12:29,033
All right!
You're free, Rubin!

1690
02:12:54,485 --> 02:12:57,045
Mr Carter.
Hey, Mr Carter.

1691
02:12:57,165 --> 02:12:59,235
Mr Carter.

1692
02:13:14,365 --> 02:13:17,323
Mr Carter? Mr Carter?

1693
02:13:20,165 --> 02:13:24,158
Mr Carter? Now that you're out,
a- are you still gonna be The Hurricane?

1694
02:13:26,645 --> 02:13:30,035
Oh, I'll always be The Hurricane.

1695
02:13:30,165 --> 02:13:33,635
And The Hurricane is beautiful.

1696
02:13:36,285 --> 02:13:39,038
This is unbelievable!

1697
02:13:39,165 --> 02:13:41,315
The crowd is going wild.

1698
02:13:41,445 --> 02:13:45,677
Everybody wanted this victory,
and Hurricane has delivered.

1699
02:13:49,325 --> 02:13:52,715
<i>Yes, that's the story
of T he Hurricane</i>

1700
02:13:52,845 --> 02:13:55,882
<i>But it won't be over
till they clear his name</i>

1701
02:13:56,005 --> 02:13:59,441
<i>And give him back
the time he's done</i>

1702
02:13:59,565 --> 02:14:02,204
<i>Put in a prison cell
but one time</i>

1703
02:14:02,325 --> 02:14:06,796
<i>He could have been
the champion of the world</i>

1704
02:15:12,685 --> 02:15:16,075
<i>When your life's a wall</i>

1705
02:15:16,205 --> 02:15:19,754
<i>Can't see the light of day</i>

1706
02:15:19,885 --> 02:15:23,400
<i>When your hope is gone</i>

1707
02:15:23,525 --> 02:15:27,234
<i>When you second-guess your faith</i>

1708
02:15:27,365 --> 02:15:30,323
<i>When you turn around</i>

1709
02:15:30,445 --> 02:15:34,404
<i>And realize that no one else</i>

1710
02:15:34,525 --> 02:15:36,880
<i>Will believe in you</i>

1711
02:15:37,005 --> 02:15:41,283
<i>Only yourself</i>

1712
02:15:41,405 --> 02:15:44,920
<i>When you're holding on</i>

1713
02:15:45,045 --> 02:15:48,640
<i>You can't find the will to breathe</i>

1714
02:15:48,765 --> 02:15:52,121
<i>Can you right the wrong</i>

1715
02:15:52,245 --> 02:15:55,760
<i>That has brought you to your knees</i>

1716
02:15:55,885 --> 02:15:59,195
<i>Though you barely lived your life</i>

1717
02:15:59,325 --> 02:16:03,079
<i>You keep on believing you'll survive</i>

1718
02:16:03,205 --> 02:16:10,520
<i>And all that's left is what's inside</i>

1719
02:16:10,645 --> 02:16:17,676
<i>Amazing, I have heard my inner voice</i>

1720
02:16:17,805 --> 02:16:23,755
<i>That I need to rejoice</i>

1721
02:16:23,885 --> 02:16:27,275
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1722
02:16:27,405 --> 02:16:31,683
<i>- And way down
- Never thought that I would need</i>

1723
02:16:31,805 --> 02:16:37,641
<i>Amazing but now that I am free</i>

1724
02:17:31,445 --> 02:17:36,758
<i>Amazing and now I'm</i>

1725
02:17:36,885 --> 02:17:43,802
<i>Free</i>

1726
02:17:43,925 --> 02:17:48,521
<i>Amazing, now</i>

1727
02:17:48,645 --> 02:17:53,799
<i>I am free</i>

1728
02:17:53,925 --> 02:17:56,598
<i>Yeah, yeah
A hurricane forever</i>

1729
02:17:56,725 --> 02:17:58,522
<i>Imagine you lie down forever</i>

1730
02:17:58,645 --> 02:18:01,205
<i>Could you stand forever
Could you hold it together</i>

1731
02:18:01,325 --> 02:18:03,077
<i>I can't even explain the pain</i>

1732
02:18:03,205 --> 02:18:05,799
<i>Imagine if your life
was like a hurricane</i>

1733
02:18:05,925 --> 02:18:07,756
<i>A hurricane forever
Imagine you lie down</i>

1734
02:18:07,885 --> 02:18:09,876
<i>Forever, ever, ever</i>

1735
02:18:10,005 --> 02:18:13,395
<i>Could you hold it together
Yo, I can't explain the pain with words</i>

1736
02:18:13,525 --> 02:18:16,164
<i>You know what I'm sayin, 'Just imagine
if your life was like a hurricane</i>

1737
02:18:16,285 --> 02:18:18,674
<i>The clouds cracked
and the heaven's gate was stormed</i>

1738
02:18:18,805 --> 02:18:21,194
<i>God placed it on man
on the day he was born</i>

1739
02:18:21,325 --> 02:18:23,793
<i>Convicted minutes after
a true natural disaster</i>

1740
02:18:23,925 --> 02:18:26,678
<i>Framed for manslaughter
The Hurricane Carter rising</i>

1741
02:18:26,805 --> 02:18:29,239
<i>Come up from south water
like torrential rain</i>

1742
02:18:29,365 --> 02:18:31,515
<i>In the ring
no opponent escaped unscathed</i>

1743
02:18:31,645 --> 02:18:33,954
<i>You can't believe
The world we live in is unjust</i>

1744
02:18:34,085 --> 02:18:36,235
<i>All I see is more proof
There's no place for us</i>

1745
02:18:36,365 --> 02:18:38,925
<i>They had my man Carter
locked in a cage like an animal</i>

1746
02:18:39,045 --> 02:18:41,798
<i>Robbed him to a point
where the mind worked mechanical</i>

1747
02:18:41,925 --> 02:18:44,723
<i>Or worse by remote control
It was done to all of us</i>

1748
02:18:44,845 --> 02:18:46,563
<i>They tapped directly into our soul</i>

1749
02:18:46,685 --> 02:18:49,153
<i>Either up at Sing-Sing
or these bars around our mind</i>

1750
02:18:49,285 --> 02:18:51,355
<i>There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide</i>

1751
02:18:51,485 --> 02:18:54,079
<i>And it's six-by-six
a guilty man cried</i>

1752
02:18:54,205 --> 02:18:56,560
<i>For penitence and losses
where innocence is</i>

1753
02:18:56,685 --> 02:18:59,597
<i>Hurricane
Could you lie down forever</i>

1754
02:18:59,725 --> 02:19:01,795
<i>Could you stand forever
Could you hold it together</i>

1755
02:19:01,925 --> 02:19:04,723
<i>I can't even explain the pain
hear what I'm sayin'</i>

<i>Your life was like a hurricane A hurricane forever Imagine behind bars forever</i>

1757
02:19:09,605 --> 02:19:12,278
<i>Could you stand it
Could you live for that</i>

1758
02:19:12,405 --> 02:19:15,203
<i>Tough for that
Chunk of that to know the pain</i>

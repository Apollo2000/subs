You're sensitive.

You're an artist.

drawings.

171
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,928
‐ In a strange town,
in a stranger's home,

172
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,056
after a long night journey...

173
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,099
For moments like these,

174
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,478
the good Lord gave us tea
and cake.

175
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,146
Come.

176
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,862
I wasn't planning
on stopping.

177
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
I was, um‐‐.

178
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,575
I‐I was headed to LA,
and I just...

179
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,119
couldn't stand the thought
of, uh, being nauseous

180
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,497
for a day and a half on a bus.

181
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,833
‐ I'm sure
you weren't nauseous, dear.

182
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,086
‐ Oh, but I was.

183
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,463
‐ Nauseous means you make
other people sick.

184
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,508
Nauseated is what you were.

185
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,511
‐ Ellie is very particular
about words,

186
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,513
especially medical words.

187
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,182
See, Ellie was
a registered nurse‐‐

188
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,518
you know, someone that does
what a doctor does

189
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,603
for a dime, not a dollar.

190
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,730
‐ Now, Sam Austin,
that is not true.

191
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,066
Doctors and nurses
are completely different.

192
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,818
Doctors treat illnesses.

193
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,696
Nurses treat people.

194
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,823
‐ As for me, I don't know
what to do with my hands

195
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,825
if I'm not building.

196
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,954
I did the chairs
and this table.

197
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,790
Just did the cabinets.

198
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,377
Carved my own wooden leg.

199
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,420
No, kidding.

200
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,507
Can you imagine?

201
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,385
‐ So did you build this house?

202
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,554
We just added
here and there.

203
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,639
Oh, he's such a modest mouse.

204
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,891
He doubled the size
of this place.

205
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,728
When you start
fixing things,

206
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,729
you know how it is.

207
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,606
There's always something else.

208
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,025
‐ Oh, no, don't.

209
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,446
‐ Yeah, a little bit
of a roach problem.

210
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,281
Don't worry about it.

211
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,201
I say we should just gas 'em,
but Ellie won't hear of that.

212
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,955
‐ It's so much easier
to take life than to make life.

213
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,127
‐ And on that
cheery little note,

214
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,504
this old man's going to bed.

215
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,173
Good night, all.

216
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,469
‐ What's in LA?

217
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,512
‐ Oh.

218
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:03,142
Tell you the truth,
I'm not sure where I'm going.

219
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,810
‐ Maybe the only way to know
where you're headed

220
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,355
is to keep going
till you find it.

221
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,690
‐ Maybe.

222
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,901
I'm just taking
some time to look around.

223
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,529
How about you?

224
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,741
You know what? Sorry.
That's none of my business.

225
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,288
‐ I had a bad experience...

226
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,041
at school with a guy.

227
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,084
‐ Bad breakup?

228
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,836
‐ More like a breakdown.

229
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,547
Life sucks.

230
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,049
‐ Yeah.

231
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,385
Like my dad says,
we ain't born laughin'.

232
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,886
‐ Hmm.

233
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,846
Sounds like a smart man.

234
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,391
You know his one
big piece of life advice‐‐

235
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,602
in this world,
you're either the anvil

236
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,813
or the hammer.

237
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,690
Which do you want to be?

238
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,275
‐ I'd rather be the ant.

239
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
‐ What ant?

240
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,196
‐ The ant crawling
across the anvil

241
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,825
when the hammer comes down.

242
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,327
Then at least
it's over quickly.

243
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,127
Oh, um...

244
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,545
uh, sorry?

245
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,507
‐ I just have a thing
with mouth noises.

246
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,008
Any noises, really.

247
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,094
Sometimes I think
I'd just be happier deaf.

248
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,512
‐ Oh, don't say that.

249

No, no, no.
It's a‐‐it's a thing.

250
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,349
My doctor says
it's neurological.

251
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,311
It's called misophonia‐‐
literally the hatred of sound.

252
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,106
‐ Wow.
That must suck.

253
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,274
‐ Would've probably been better

254
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,151
if I'd just crawled
back into the womb

255
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,861
and stayed there.

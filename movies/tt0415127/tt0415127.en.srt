2
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,635
Hi.

3
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,469
Hi.

4
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,033
What's new?

5
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,628
Nothing.

6
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,593
Family?

7
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,955
Fine.

8
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,879
And yours?

9
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,915
News?

10
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,719
Catastrophe!

11
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,878
Why, what happened?

12
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,278
Little Cera's got flu
for the third time this year.

13
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,159
Henriette!

14
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,794
Hi, Papa!

15
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,312
You said

16
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,149
the assistants clean up the place.

17
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,468
Not any more! The boss's wife
said they've got too much to do!

18
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,719
- Henriette!
- Yes, madam!

19
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,949
Bye!

20
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,308
Did you know they're using
Henriette to wash the floor?

21
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,311
No, but I know

22
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,437
there's a job going
at the pharmacy in a month.

23
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,190
She mops the floor
and any bloke can stare at her arse!

24
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,758
Why all the fuss?
It's only another month.

25
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,117
I told you not to put
your elbows on the table!

26
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,357
What's your problem?
Don't talk to her like that!

27
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,431
No elbows on the table!

28
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,151
Why aren't you eating?

29
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,715
She'll eat when she wants!
Why d'you talk to her like that?

30
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,590
- Why aren't you eating?
- Don't talk to her like that...

31
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,837
- What's wrong with you?
- You understand me?

32
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,673
How come you're
shouting like this?

33
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,513
- Look who's talking!
- What's wrong with you now?

34
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,512
- You're rude, that's what.
- Why d'you speak like that?

35
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,990
- How did the food get here?
- Why are you shouting?

36
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,355
Who brings the money home?

37
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,671
- Be quiet and eat up!
- I bring as much as I like!

38
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,877
- Why've you become such an animal?
- You don't get it, eh?

39
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,155
You were fine when you came.
What's got into you?

40
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,071
Will you ever shut up?

41
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,112
Where you going?

42
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,470
Have you finished your dinner?

43
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,796
Here you are, gentlemen.

44
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,308
- To your health!
- Thank you...

45
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,759
- Call my daughter!
- Henriette!

46
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,631
Get your things and come!

47
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,239
What's that?

48
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,112
I'm taking her away.

49
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,794
What do you mean
"taking her away"?

50
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,071
Get your things and come!

51
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,398
Henriette! Go back
and finish your work!

52
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,833
Yes, madam.

53
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,839
Henriette!

54
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,115
I told you to get your stuff!

55
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,509
Henriette!
I forbid you to leave!

56
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:34,709
You're not staying here another
minute. Get dressed!

57
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,996
I'm sorry, madam.

58
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,798
You're mad...

59
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,949
Hurry!

60
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,152
Listen, Maloin!

61
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,034
If you like,
she can leave in a week.

62
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,192
In fact, she's got to
leave after this

63
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,317
because I won't tolerate
this in my shop.

64
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,711
But she must work the full week!

65
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,793
I won't let her stay!

66
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,159
Listen here,

67
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,438
I'll go to the police if I have to!

68
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,918
Do what you want!

69
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,592
I don't give a damn!

70
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,357
I'm going to complain to
the workers' tribunal!

71
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,199
Henriette!

72
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,439
Henriette!

73
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,918
Sorry, madam!

74
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,914
Maloin!

75
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,712
Maloin!

76
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,558
She'll definitely make a complaint.

77
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,916
She can do what she wants!

78
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,993
Had the boss been in, it would've
certainly ended in a fight.

79
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,992
He's an animal!

80
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,839
Don't worry!

81
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,717
You have a nice pipe.

82
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,476
Did you get it from Mum?

83
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,715
No.

84
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,752
Give me another!

85
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,391
Mum is bound to be angry.

86
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,079
Don't worry!

87
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,354
You know I love it
when you come here!

88
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,635
I adore you...

89
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,395
But a terrible thing
happened last night.

90
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,911
An Englishman came in here

91
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,430
and asked me for a cigarette
and a coffee.

92
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,072
He sat down and drank it.

93
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,788
Later...

94
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,359
he came over again and
asked me if I had a free room.

95
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,434
I said of course I had.

96
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,478
He took it

97
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,399
and went up.

98
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,754
But a famous inspector arrived
from London later that night!

99
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,639
I didn't understand and
I started to get suspicious.

100
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,958
When I came down this morning,

101
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,191
I saw them sitting at
one of the tables, talking.

102
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,150
And then the man from London
stood up and left.

103
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,431
He didn't pay the bill!

104
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,718
He didn't pay for the
cigarettes or the coffee.

105
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,869
The inspector created such a ruckus

106
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,994
that even the local police
came round.

107
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,558
You know I've no doubt they're
going to catch that bloke.

108
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,514
But what good will it do me?

109
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,795
Who is going to reimburse me?

110
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,030
Because if they catch him,

111
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,396
he'll get sent to prison.

112
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,233
And we know that no one
pays from prison.

113
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,110
And if he manages to get away with
the money, I still won't get back

114
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,557
what I paid in... See?

115
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,035
Okay, bring me another glass!

116
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,068
But then you'll come up, won't you?

117
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,439
Oh, well!

118
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,552
Do you like it?

119
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,991
Do you think it's real?

120
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,595
Aren't you going to drink that?

121
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,593
Thanks, no.

122
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,318
Okay, let's go.

123
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,950
- These are our best furs.
- Our most beautiful furs!

124
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,874
Look how silky they are.
Look at the cut...

125
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,878
- They were sewn by fairies!
- The hands of skilled tailors!

126
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,956
- Excellent quality!
- Just feel it!

127
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,632
- Look at the quality!
- Stroke it!

128
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,234
- Try it on!
- Perhaps this one...

129
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,193
- What about this?
- Or look...

130
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,517
- This red fox is very special...
- Or would you prefer white?

131
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,558
- It suits you so well!
- Try it on, miss!

132
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,110
- Silky, isn't it?
- Especially fine work...

133
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,556
- Don't hesitate!
- Look how well it suits you!

134
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,950
Or perhaps this one?
It suits a young lady!

135
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,190
Try this stole!
Just stroke it!

136
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,952
Don't hesitate.
Try it on!

137
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,270
Take a look!
Perfect, isn't it?

138
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,438
Beautiful! It suits you so well.
Magnificent!

139
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,278
Excellent choice.

140
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,949
With discount...
that will be 456.

141
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,351
Do you want it gift-wrapped
or will she keep it on?

142
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,829
- She'll keep it on.
- Really? Fine.

143
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,638
Thank you, sir.

144
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,119
Do you like it?

145
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,714
I do. I just hope Mum
won't be angry.

146
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,669
How long can a fur
like this last?

147
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,990
It should be fine for 1 ״ years
if you look after it.

148
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,515
I'll only wear it on Sundays.

149
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,838
What have you done?

150
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,988
Nothing.

151
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,390
What do you mean "nothing"?

152
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,396
I just brought her home.

153
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,950
What's that? Brought her home?

154
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,319
I couldn't let her work there.

155
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,590
You've gone completely mad!

156
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,958
- I won't have anyone staring at her arse!
- Have you lost your mind?

157
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,833
On the contrary.

158
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,799
It's so like you!
You keep your mouth shut for months,

159
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,834
then at the worst possible moment
you do something idiotic!

160
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,237
- It's not idiotic.
- It couldn't be more idiotic!

161
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,434
No one's going to take her on
when word gets out about this!

162
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,677
Don't you understand?

163
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,077
- It doesn't matter.
- How can you say that?

164
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,030
We'll sort it out tomorrow!

165
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:37,196
You take all our money and
spend it on that shitty fur!

166
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,679
Are you drunk?

167
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,312
Leave me in peace!

168
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,631
You take all our money and
spend it on that shit!

169
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,918
- Leave me in peace!
- I have!

170
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,908
For 25 years...
Just look around you!

171
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,992
Leave me in peace!

172
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,439
Are you mad?

173
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,750
We'll take it back tomorrow.

174
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,590
- Come here!
- Yes?

175
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,792
- Take it down!
- This?

176
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,031
- Throw it over!
- There?

177
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,708
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

178
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:54,479
I'm Police Inspector Morrison.

179
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,439
I need some information from you.

180
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,628
From me?

181
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,109
Yes!

182
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,069
You.

183
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,716
Do you always work nights?

184
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,554
Always.

185
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,874
Tell me,

186
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,470
are these windows always closed?

187
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,758
In the winter, yes.

188
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:20,719
How can you keep an eye on
the wagons and the dock?

189
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:25,628
Just like you. I wipe them.

190
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,952
Last night...

191
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,910
didn't you notice anything unusual?

192
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,789
What would you call unusual?

193
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,231
Something like this.

194
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,595
Pull!

195
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,952
- Evening.
- Evening.

196
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,268
Evening.

197
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,394
Now then!

198
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,109
Take it away!

199
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,315
Lift!

200
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,873
One, two, now!

201
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,110
There's someone in the hut!

202
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:34,755
- What?
- There's a man in the hut.

203
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:39,154
- What does he look like?
- I don't know, I only saw his eyes.

204
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,635
- Did he say anything?
- He didn't say a word.

205
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,797
I was scared so I locked
the door and ran home!

206
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,195
What?

207
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,916
You locked him in the hut?

208
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,239
Sorry, Papa!

209
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,712
Now listen here!

210
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,869
Not a word about this to anyone.

211
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,792
Do you understand?

212
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,033
Not a peep!

213
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,478
I'll take a look.

214
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,468
The key!

215
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:57,190
- What do you want to do, Papa?
- Nothing.

216
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,154
You're not going to hurt him,
are you?

217
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,352
Take care, Papa!

218
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,037
Don't worry about me!

219
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,993
Brown?

220
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,789
Brown!

221
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,919
Arrest me!

222
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:37,836
I killed the Englishman.

223
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,115
When?

224
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,679
An hour ago.

225
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,669
Where?

226
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,397
I'll take you there.

227
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,314
Let's go!

228
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:18,789
Sir!

229
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,676
Take this up to my room!

230
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,879
Look after it!

231
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:34,076
Try to keep her here!

232
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,470
Don't let her in!

233
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,429
I only... brought him food.

234
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,429
I understand your state of shock.

235
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,992
You should know...

236
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:12,836
...that I have investigated
a good number of cases.

237
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:19,678
Yours is a case of self-defence.

238
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:31,959
Please accept Mitchell's gift.

239
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,593
Do take it...

240
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:43,432
...you deserve it...

241
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,319
Go home...

242
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:05,270
and forget the whole thing.

243
02:07:06,305 --> 02:08:06,929

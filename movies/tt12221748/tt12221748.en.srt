2
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,809
Hey, Josh.

3
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,354
What's happening?

4
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,906
Well, I usually listen to my music.

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,535
This is what I do in the car.

6
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,622
I have an eclectic taste in music.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,876
It depends on the mood:
whether I want to be inspired,

8
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,502
or whether I just want to...

9
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,129
thump it out.

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,339
Hit me!

11
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,220
# How y'all doing this evening? #

12
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,890
# Do y'all want that bounce? #

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,644
Because sometimes you need to bounce
before you do something.

14
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,438
# That bounce? #

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,030
# Everybody wanna be like you #
They want power and praise like you, but #

16
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,700
# See there is no god like our God
Like our God #

17
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,911
# There's no one like you... #

18
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,832
# And it won't stop... #

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,353
# And it won't stop #

20
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,190
# One more time, y'all #

21
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,443
# Here we go
Let me see your ones #

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,487
# There's no one like you
Let me see your ones #

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,906
# There's no one like you #

24
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,534
# And we don't stop
Because we can't stop #

25
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,537
# There's no one like you
Let me see your ones #

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,289
# There's no one like you
You need to remember that #

27
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,749
# There's no one like you #

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,086
# God has not given you
A spirit of fear #

29
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,839
# There's only one
There's no one like you #

30
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,394
Hey.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,272
- Wow.
- Got to have a book cake.

32
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,107
Get a picture of our book cake.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,151
Oh, my goodness!

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,318
Wow.

35
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,530
- How do they do this kind of stuff?
- I wonder who did this?

36
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,407
Wow.

37
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,117
Don't touch it!

38
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,619
Don't touch it, lady!

39
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,373
She's going to touch it. Go sit down.

40
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,128
- Ma.
- ...these stairs.

41
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,796
- Yep.
- Oh, I can see.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,881
I got you, too.

43
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,592
OK, now, you all,
we can walk a little faster.

44
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,093
OK. All right, big stuff.

45
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,263
Wow.

46
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,248
It's full.
I mean, like, the rafters...

47
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,002
I just saw my family

48
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,253
and I got a little...

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,671
...verklempt.

50
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,966
Heavenly Father,
thank you for this moment

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,010
and for all you've done
to bring us to this point.

52
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,762
It's a privilege to have this opportunity,

53
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,139
and we know that you have
a greater purpose for all of this.

54
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,433
- In Your name we pray...
- ...amen.

55
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,560
You OK, Mel?

56
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,356
Mel's crying.

57
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,858
All right.
I'm not going to touch your clothes.

58
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,695
- Love you, sweetie.
- You, too.

59
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,197
Way to go.

60
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,785
You don't have to keep it together.

61
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,121
You don't have to...
You can cry your eyes out.

62
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,084
- I can't do that right now.
- No. OK.

63
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,800
Hello, Chicago!

64
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,054
She served our country

65
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,267
as the 44th First Lady
of the United States.

66
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:32,647
She made us always feel like
the White House was really our house,

67
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,190
the people's house.

68
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,151
She is your hometown girl

69
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,904
from the South Side of Chicago.

70
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:44,826
Welcome, Michelle Obama!

71
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,007
OK, everybody.

72
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,426
- We're home.
- We're home.

73
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,927
Yeah, feels good.

74
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,929
I've got to say...

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,641
can we talk about leaving the White House?

76
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,687
When you got on the helicopter,
did you think, "Free at last.

77
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,147
Free at last"?

78
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,859
- Yeah.
- Or was it bittersweet? What was it?

79
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,653
That whole day was a trip, first of all,

80
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,114
you know, for so many reasons.

81
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,783
So what was happening on our last day

82
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,413
was that Sasha's and Malia's friends,

83
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,332
who had grown up in the White House,

84
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,793
came to me that night and were like,
"We want to sleep over."

85
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,837
And I'm like, "What?

86
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,256
You want a sleepover?"

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,508
"Yeah, we...

88
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,385
We're going to miss being here.

89
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,888
We want our last breakfast."

90
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,682
Because you can get
what you want to eat at the White House,

91
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,017
so all those girls were like,

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,227
"I think I'll have
the fried chicken biscuit."

93
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,063
"I'm going to have a waffle."

94
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,647
So we're trying to move,

95
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,941
and then they wake up,
and I've got to get them out.

96
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,361
"Come on, wake up. The Trumps are coming.

97
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,695
You've got to get up,

98
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,405
get out,"

99
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,782
you know?

100
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:06,949
Wow.

101
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,994
And there are tears, and there's crying,
and the staff is crying,

102
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,371
and I'm trying not to cry.

103
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,790
I said, "If I walk out there crying,

104
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,750
they'll swear I'm crying
for a different reason."

105
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,751
Yeah, for sure.

106
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,878
So I'm like,
"We have got to get it together."

107
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,964
So it was a very emotional day.

108
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,925
But then we got on Air Force One,

109
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,094
and when I got on the plane,

110
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,554
I think I sobbed...

111
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
You did?

112
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,849
...for 30 minutes.

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:37,814
And I think it was just
the release of eight years

114
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,983
of trying to do everything perfectly.

115
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,327
One day,
you're a normal family.

116
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,955
An election happens,

117
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,707
and your life changes instantly.

118
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,503
It's like we were shot out of a cannon.

119
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,383
We didn't have time to, like,
adjust to it.

120
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,264
Being the First Lady has been
the greatest honor of my life.

121
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,394
But how many people are in that position

122
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:21,232
where the entire attention
of everything is you?

123
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,277
Every gesture you make,

124
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,155
every blink of your eye,
is being analyzed.

125
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,452
You have the world
watching every move you make.

126
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,206
Your life isn't yours anymore.

127
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,720
The whole idea of doing the tour

128
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,891
is to be able to have the time
to actually reflect...

129
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,270
to figure out what just happened to me.

130
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,024
It's kind of the panic moment of,

131
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,151
"Yeah, this is totally me,

132
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,405
unplugged,
for the first time in a long time."

133
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,087
We are ready.

134
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,924
And now I can leave.

135
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,469
See, this is not normal.

136
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,766
Now I can walk out of my door.

137
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,018
Morning.

138
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,312
Morning. Thank you.

139
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,606
Thanks so much, all of you. Morning.

140
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,649
Love your book.

141
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,108
Thank you so much.

142
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,696
Ooh...

143
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,657
Do it.

144
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,622
We want you back!

145
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,253
When we started talking about touring,

146
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,964
I visualized ahead,
"OK, how are we going to do this?

147
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,467
How do we reach the most people?
How do we reach kids?"

148
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,096
And before you knew it,
it was just a big thing.

149
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,063
We have a three-day swing that takes us
to Tacoma, Portland and Phoenix.

150
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,439
So it's hard to...

151
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,524
Finding, prepping,

152
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,653
doing travel arrangements, and
all that stuff for 21 different moderators

153
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,363
is an enormous amount of work.

154
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,783
This is where it's like...
I don't know the hassle.

155
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,036
But it would be more interesting
to have more people and different people.

156
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,373
- It would make for a better show.
- No explanation needed.

157
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,542
Do any of those other men jump out at you?

158
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,003
Like, Seth, James, Conan...

159
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,879
Justin Bieber?

160
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,507
I would watch, I'm not gonna lie.

161
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,758
What?

162
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,930
But when I think of somebody,
it's, like, curiosity and energy,

163
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,640
and sort of a cur...

164
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,225
Gayle, you know?

165
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,518
I'm becoming...

166
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,938
more comfortable saying no,

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
more confident saying yes...

168
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,401
...and more willing to say...

169
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,987
what's on my mind.

170
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,155
...what's on my mind.

171
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:19,035
They told me that I am
the first male moderator.

172
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,329
We're really testing this out, Conan.

173
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,665
Knowing how to engage an interview...

174
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,500
- It's a skill.
- It's a skill.

175
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,795
- Colbert is the best.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,757
He will get
into some dangerous territory.

177
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,594
Before the White House, did he ever
get you coffee in bed on Mother's Day?

178
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,179
Nah.

179
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,265
We are here to talk about a book.

180
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,476
It's a book. Isn't that something?

181
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,478
All of these people are here
because you wrote...

182
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,271
Nobody's twerking.

183
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,023
No, there's no twerking.

184
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,526
- We are reading, y'all.
- That's right.

185
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,906
What I experience in these big arenas

186
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,241
is the power of gathering...

187
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,745
of sharing a set of experiences.

188
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,831
Oh, my gosh.

189
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,250
I'm so pumped.

190
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,960
I know, just look at her.

191
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,396
Oh, my God.

192
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,939
I know, right?

193
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,191
How's everybody doing?

194
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,276
- When are you due?
- In four weeks.

195
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,653
Oh, my gosh!

196
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,114
- Do you know what you're having?
- Yeah, a girl.

197
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,490
- It's my first.
- Strong girls.

198
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,741
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

199
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,285
- How are you?
- My daughter's name is Sasha.

200
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,829
- You have a Sasha?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,455
Is she sassy like mine?

202
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,957
Oh, we have feuds.

203
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,669
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- Look at you.

204
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,837
Did you do this for me?

205
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,548
- Of course! I had to put it on for you.
- It's fabulous!

206
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,007
- How are you, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

207
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,093
- It's so nice to see you.
- I'm so happy to meet you.

208
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,762
- Thank you for taking the time to be here.
- Of course.

209
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,639
Hi, bright eyes!

210
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,641
- How are you?
- I'm good.

211
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,727
I'm in college.
I'm going to be a graphic designer.

212
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,937
Excellent. All right, stay on it, OK?

213
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,105
- Thank you.
- Proud of you.

214
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,189
- Thank you.
- All right.

215
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,445
It's like an emotional,
sociological dance with people.

216
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,825
It's important to make sure I take
every person as they come up.

217
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,412
- How are you guys doing?
- It is such an honor to meet you.

218
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,622
- This is my daughter.
- How old are you, babe?

219
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,124
- I'm 13.
- Oh, my goodness.

220
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,834
- School's going well?
- Uh-huh.

221
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,879
When somebody walks up to me,
don't look around,

222
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,505
don't look beyond them;

223
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,175
look them in the eye, take in the story.

224
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,052
Your story about your daughters

225
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,306
for moms who are going
through postpartum depression...

226
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,143
And just hearing your story
is such a blessing.

227
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,479
So I thank you, and God bless you so much.

228
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,148
- Do you have children?
- Yes, I have a one-year-old.

229
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,776
Sharing somebody's story

230
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,987
gives me perspective that I need,
that I don't get

231
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,407
because all my interactions
are kind of sanitized.

232
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,327
It's so nice to meet you.
It's so wonderful to meet you.

233
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,954
- Are you students?
- We are. We're all undergrads.

234
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,080
We're first-years.

235
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,042
So this is how I relate to people,

236
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,127
and it helps me stay connected.

237
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,589
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,176
Don't make me cry.
I just had this face done.

239
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,345
Catch your breath. Take a breath.

240
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,264
- What's your name?
- Theresa.

241
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,391
- Theresa.
- I so admire you.

242
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,434
Oh, my goodness.

243
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,062
- Thank you so much, babe.
- This was unexpected.

244
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,855
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,816
What did you think was going to happen?

246
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,405
It's so good to see you guys.

247
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,746
...next level and deal with their fears.

248
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,165
I'm getting caught up
on what you guys are...

249
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,006
I crave some longer experiences
with young people...

250
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,884
through the community events.

251
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,222
The tour could do a great job
of giving me a little taste of it.

252
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,934
How do you feel, like...
How do I put this?

253
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,438
How do you feel,
transitioning back to your normal life?

254
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,191
Because, like, it got...
I don't want to say it got "interrupted."

255
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,569
But it was, like, a huge...

256
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,653
You can say it.

257
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,613
It was, like, a huge bump in the road.

258
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,158
You were going to live this normal life,
and then your husband became president.

259
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,079
So how does it feel, trying to get back
on the track of your normal life

260
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,247
that you had before?

261
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,083
What I've learned is,
"Get back on what track?"

262
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,751
It's a whole new track.

263
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,712
It's not going back. It's not...

264
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,340
You know, it's just all different,
and it's different forever.

265
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,843
So it's not getting back on track,

266
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,345
but it's creating my next track.

267
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,097
I'm doing what you're doing.

268
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,975
I'm figuring out, "What do I want to do?

269
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,435
What do I care about?"

270
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,522
And it takes time to process your life

271
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,191
and figure out what it all means.

272
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,487
So little of who I am
happened in those eight years.

273
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,866
So much more of who I was
happened before.

274
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,206
So are you guys going to take
a final look when you're done

275
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,043
at the monitors in the foyer?

276
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,463
Mrs. Obama's ready.

277
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,050
I'm ready, too.

278
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
So tell us about Michelle Obama
as a little girl,

279
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,222
because she says she was feisty,

280
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,558
and that part of you
really liked her feistiness.

281
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,893
- True?
- I did.

282
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,479
Well, it goes back to Craig.

283
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,649
I think I was too soft with him,

284
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,734
trying to make him the nice little boy,

285
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,861
- That's right.
- And I don't think that works.

286
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,321
So I just...

287
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,906
She was too soft on you.

288
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,243
No, she made me too soft.

289
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,079
She was too strict.

290
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,165
Your sister took the brunt of that.
I hope you feel bad.

291
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,043
Do you feel
you have your life back?

292
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,544
Do you miss the White House at all?

293
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,921
- No.
- No?

294
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,047
Not at all.

295
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,509
- All right. Bye, team.
- OK. All right.

296
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,971
- I'll see you guys tonight.
- OK. All right.

297
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,347
- Bye.
- Bye.

298
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,726
- Hello.
- I thought you were wearing the pink.

299
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,604
No, that was for earlier,
and that had food on it.

300
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,439
That's the evening attire.

301
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,943
- That was for the day.
- That looks like two belts.

302
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,238
It's one belt, but it's three separate...

303
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,699
Oh, it's got a top belt, too.

304
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,826
- Oh, I see.
- Yep, this, this, and this.

305
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,119
But it's not separated?

306
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,913
No. It's one belt,
but you buckle it three different times.

307
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,582
And is that the style,
to have your belt so high now?

308
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,211
Is that the style?

309
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,171
- I don't know...
- People, what's so...

310
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,174
- I don't...
- I just asked if it was the style.

311
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,801
It isn't about you.

312
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,261
Come on, zip it. Let's go.

313
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,347
That was a compliment.
I like the belt up that high.

314
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,850
- I don't know what people...
- It looks like a holster.

315
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,351
Like, if you had some...

316
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,730
- You could. It's when I...
- You shouldn't laugh.

317
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,691
- That's what I was talking about.
- That's the problem.

318
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,775
Come on, Craig.

319
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,487
My brother, my big brother...

320
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,657
You know, he was my first crush,
my big brother.

321
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,702
My brother's the kind of person...
Everybody liked Craig.

322
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,497
You know,
my mother liked Craig better than me.

323
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,875
I joke about this all the time.

324
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,045
You know, we would have Thanksgiving
at the White House.

325
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,672
And I'd be around.
There would be butlers and stuff going on.

326
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,257
And, "Where's Craig?

327
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,510
But when's Craig coming?"

328
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,263
And I was like, "Ma. Come on, lady.

329
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,558
I am the First Lady.
What more do I have to do?"

330
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,311
You know? I mean...

331
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,151
Everybody in the world
knows who she is.

332
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,861
That's incredible.

333
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,489
Everybody in the world knows
who my sister is.

334
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,324
What is that? That's dumb.

335
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,618
Nobody should have
to deal with that. No one.

336
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,454
No brother should have
to deal with their sister

337
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,040
being the most popular person
in the world.

338
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,928
- Ooh, it's chilly. Hey, Mommy.
- It is chilly.

339
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,639
- Sorry for the snow.
- Take you on a tour...?

340
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,558
If it weren't for you,
we'd put the blinds up.

341
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:22,976
Yeah.

342
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,437
- That's a preference.
- Is she allowed...

343
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,566
Are those people terrorists?
Are they going to attack?

344
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,860
- See, that's not right.
- No.

345
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,696
Craig always has a good supply of wine.

346
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,242
- Right. So we have some kale salad.
- I love coming here and drinking his wine.

347
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,743
I have wine, too.

348
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,330
- I know...
- Did you see it? China, you still saw it.

349
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,040
I've got wine, too.

350
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,542
That's right.

351
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,460
I get the special wine.

352
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,587
Mich just gets White House wine.

353
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,965
"When I come to Craig's house..."

354
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,050
That's right, Ma. You tell her.

355
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,428
"...I just get... The wine is just..."

356
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,515
- I'm going to have some of this wine.
- Here's some of my wine.

357
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,933
Here, refill mine.

358
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,227
Let me see. Wait, let me see. Let me see.

359
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
Family.

360
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,981
These are my favorite pictures.

361
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,529
God, that tree looks ugly.

362
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,198
Because you actually let us
decorate the tree.

363
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,867
That's why it looks ugly.

364
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,661
Because a seven-year-old did that.

365
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,538
Oh, here's the...

366
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,123
Oh, there's the dress.

367
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,876
You can see all these pleats.

368
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,669
Look how pretty you are, Mommy.

369
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,213
- Could have been on TV, in movies.
- So young.

370
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,758
- Were you excited about your wedding?
- I think so.

371
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,262
At least you weren't pregnant,
because I didn't come until later.

372
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,722
"I might have been happy about it."

373
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,057
I haven't seen it in a long time, but...

374
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,935
that was good.

375
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,271
That was good.

376
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,275
Do you know, the last time
we went through these pictures like this

377
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,818
had to be when Dad was alive.

378
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,903
Sure.

379
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,447
He just liked people.

380
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,824
Look how handsome Dad is.

381
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,127
I am from the South Side of Chicago.

382
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,258
That tells you as much about me
as you need to know.

383
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,638
It was a typical working-class community.

384
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,264
Some good music,

385
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,933
some good barbecue,

386
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,184
some good times.

387
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,736
Our dinner table was the first table
where I felt like I belonged.

388
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,948
And then you go out into the world

389
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,659
expecting the same thing.

390
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,247
You're in high school,

391
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,207
you are accomplished.

392
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,335
You were class treasurer?
Do I remember that right?

393
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,587
I was senior class treasurer, yes.

394
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,172
I was still that kid.

395
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,551
You were on the honor roll,

396
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,721
and you went to go see
your guidance counselor.

397
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,598
Your brother had gone to Princeton,

398
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,643
and you thought, "I'm going to aspire
to go to Princeton, too."

399
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,645
But that guidance counselor
had other ideas,

400
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,481
didn't see in you
what you saw in yourself.

401
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,193
Yeah, and she decided
that my wish to go to Princeton

402
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,153
was thinking too big,

403
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,655
that I was reaching too high.

404
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,908
And at that point, she told me,
"I don't think you're Princeton material."

405
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,743
- The nerve!
- Yeah.

406
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,872
- Well, she was wrong.
- Yeah.

407
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,128
I went back to the school just recently
and the principal was like,

408
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,130
"She doesn't work here anymore."

409
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,634
I was like, "I bet she doesn't."

410
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,222
I share that
because obviously it worked out OK.

411
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:54,104
But that statement, while I was able
to get over it, it was a punch.

412
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,231
I'm still a little salty...

413
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,859
...about that.

414
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,946
Still a little salty about it.

415
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,791
Your book really stuck to me,

416
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,503
how there's just so much
that African-American women go through

417
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,381
and African-American individuals
go through, as a whole.

418
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,301
And we go through those alone.

419
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,762
We don't have backup.
We don't have support.

420
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,473
With me being a first-generation student,

421
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,558
I've lived in subsidized housing
all my life.

422
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,435
I didn't believe that I would be sitting

423
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,812
next to the former First Lady
of the United States.

424
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,274
And I just wanted to know,
how did you, as a black woman,

425
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,277
persevere through, just, invisibility?

426
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,114
For me, I never felt invisible.

427
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:51,787
And I think, in thinking through my story
about why do I not now feel invisible,

428
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,414
I think it's because my parents

429
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,043
made me always feel visible.

430
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,755
It came from
not what was going on in the world,

431
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,466
but what was going on at my dinner table.

432
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,344
My mother, she let us ask anything.

433
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,762
You had to be polite.

434
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,723
We got spankings if we were too...
You know?

435
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,059
She was still a black mother.

436
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,189
But that invisibility, it starts here.

437
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,945
We can't afford to wait for the world
to be equal to start feeling seen.

438
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:25,946
We're far from it.

439
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,781
Time will not allow it.

440
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,450
It's not going to happen
with one president, one vote.

441
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,995
So you've got to find the tools
within yourself to feel visible,

442
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,456
and to be heard, and to use your voice.

443
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,505
I have high expectations of young people.

444
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,634
It's the same expectations
my family had of me.

445
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,224
My grandfather Dandy
expected us to be great.

446
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,812
But he went through life
being underestimated.

447
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,443
Growing up, he was a brilliant young man,

448
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,653
somebody that loved to read books,

449
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,157
loved to delve into things
in a deep and meaningful way.

450
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,995
He could have been a professor.
He could have been a doctor.

451
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,582
But because of race and class,

452
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,793
he couldn't get into colleges.

453
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,337
He didn't have the money, the resources...

454
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,008
And imagine walking around
with all this ability,

455
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,051
and the world telling you, "No.

456
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,137
No, you're not good enough.
No, you're not ready."

457
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,557
Watching people half your intelligence

458
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,517
being promoted past you.

459
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,270
You know,
watching opportunities slip away,

460
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,857
not because you're not able,
but because nobody thinks you deserve it.

461
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,988
That caused him
a lot of disappointment and anger.

462
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,949
That made him push us to be better.

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,710
This is a super-normal Wednesday.

464
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,754
Very normal.

465
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,425
Every so often a book comes along
that creates bridges.

466
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,343
Yeah.

467
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,429
So we thought it was a great idea
to bring two book clubs together

468
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,307
to talk about
their unique experiences with the book,

469
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,059
but also the common things.

470
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,311
- You come from Chicago, also.
- My parents.

471
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,355
- Where did you grow up?
- My mom's from Gresham.

472
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,023
That's where Barack organized.

473
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:29,152
But it was fascinating to read
because they were lifelong,

474
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,030
they lived there, they grew up there,
family there, steeped there.

475
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,783
And they were definitely
part of the white flight.

476
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,369
Do you have a sense
of what they were fleeing

477
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,495
when they decided to leave?

478
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,871
Or did they even know?

479
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,957
I don't know that my parents did.

480
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,417
If you look at my parents' parents,

481
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,128
that's when you see the veiled racism.

482
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,590
That's when you would hear
the off-the-cuff remarks

483
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,051
like, "Well, they're moving
into the neighborhood."

484
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:57,931
And it was so interesting to read that
from your perspective, versus what I knew.

485
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,015
Yeah.

486
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,310
What was going on in the '70s

487
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,690
was that, as black families like ours
were moving into neighborhoods,

488
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
white families were being scared away.

489
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,820
They were being told,
"Sell your home quick.

490
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,322
Your property values
are going to go down."

491
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,826
And so they fled further to the suburbs.

492
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,539
You can even see it in class pictures
of my kindergarten class

493
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,541
and my eighth-grade class.

494
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,211
I mean, it does something to kids like me,

495
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,338
and we have to remember that

496
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,217
as we are pointing out people
who belong and don't belong.

497
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,136
Because my family, sadly,

498
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:40,056
was one of those families,
to some, who didn't belong.

499
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,353
I ended up going to Princeton.

500
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,151
I was one of a handful
of minority students.

501
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,697
It was the first time in my life
where I stood out like that.

502
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,162
I learned that
one of my roommates moved out

503
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,749
because her mother was horrified
that I was black.

504
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,337
She felt her daughter was in danger.

505
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,174
I wasn't prepared for that.

506
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:22,265
In hindsight, I think I needed
to go to Princeton to see for myself

507
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,935
what all this was
that I wasn't good enough for.

508
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,648
And then you're in class with
some of these guys, and you realized what?

509
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,734
Well, they're not that smart.

510
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,863
And it's not even
just an image that we have.

511
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,490
It's an image that we're given.

512
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,826
People have told us, "No,
these are the things that aren't for you."

513
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,330
So one of the most empowering things
as a young person

514
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,207
was to go to one of the top schools

515
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,002
and realize that there are all kinds
of affirmative action.

516
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,505
You know, there's legacy...

517
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,506
Yes.

518
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,757
- There's...
- Yes.

519
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,719
There's the college athlete.

520
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:06,101
And universities have a right
and an interest in diversifying.

521
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:11,439
The problem is that when it comes
to students of color, poor kids,

522
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,192
all of a sudden,
that's affirmative action,

523
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,735
and that's a problem.

524
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,571
- And they're lesser than, yes.
- And they're lesser than.

525
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:23,451
And I have been at, probably, every
powerful table there is in the world.

526
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,621
I've been at G-summits,
I've been in castles and palaces,

527
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,126
in boardrooms and academic universities.

528
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,753
- And...
- Can I drop the microphone?

529
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,131
And I'm coming down from the...

530
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,885
Yes.

531
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,970
You know,

532
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:46,766
I am coming down from the mountaintop
to tell every young person

533
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,270
that is poor and working-class,

534
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:54,023
and has been told,
regardless of the color of your skin,

535
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,400
that you don't belong,

536
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,402
don't listen to them.

537
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,946
They don't even know
how they got at those seats.

538
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,448
Yes, yes, yes.

539
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,741
They don't know.

540
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,162
D...

541
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,580
O...

542
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,417
L-P-H-I-N-S!

543
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,922
Some of these young women
that we selected for this activity today

544
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,008
asked the question, "Why me?"

545
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,634
"You chose me. Why?"

546
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,928
- Well, why not?
- That's interesting, yeah.

547
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,307
So, how many of you thought that?
Like, "Why me?"

548
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,936
There's girls who I feel, like,
they are president of this club,

549
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,147
their ACT, SAT is this, this...

550
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,064
Whatever, right?

551
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,400
I just literally come to school,

552
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,360
I do whatever I have to do,

553
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,156
and then I stay for one club,
and that's Latinos Unidos,

554
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,742
and then I leave, and then I go to work.

555
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,243
And why do you work?

556
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,245
My dad... He had an accident.

557
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,040
He doesn't work like he used to.

558
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,251
Helping him out in some way
would make him feel good.

559
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,880
And also
because I have three little brothers,

560
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,216
everything that I do is for them.

561
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,134
I go to work and I bring them food.

562
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,552
Like, everything...

563
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,596
And she wonders why she's here.

564
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,808
That story,

565
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,810
with all the highs and lows,

566
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,978
and what seems so ordinary,

567
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,939
and what seems like nothing to you,

568
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,649
is your power.

569
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,199
Oof!

570
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,700
Last day.

571
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,502
Chris.

572
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,629
Over here.

573
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,465
Do you have your yearbook?

574
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,887
I am a senior at Whitney Young
here in the South Side of Chicago.

575
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,640
And I am a Mexican girl.

576
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,312
This is my last week of high school.

577
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,361
I remember the first year, I was like,
"I want to transfer to a different school.

578
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,904
I can't do this work."

579
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,948
Just putting myself down.

580
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,200
- That's nice.
- Yeah. Sorry.

581
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,619
What kept me motivated was

582
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,831
here you get to be friends with people

583
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,584
that are completely different from you,

584
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,253
from different parts of the world,

585
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,380
and I'm very thankful for that.

586
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,674
Girl, you always cry!

587
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,805
Knowing that I'm one of the first ones
to graduate high school

588
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,641
is just very important
for my family and I.

589
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,476
Elizabeth Cervantes.

590
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,317
I'm very excited
about what the future holds

591
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,319
and going to college.

592
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,530
It's a huge accomplishment for me.

593
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,008
When you come out,
you'll say, "Hello, Washington D.C."

594
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,094
However you would want
to maybe identify yourself.

595
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,763
"I worked with the Obamas.

596
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,140
I've been an advisor
for the Obamas for years.

597
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,975
I'm Valerie Jarrett, your host tonight."

598
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,227
Just to do a little establishing.

599
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,229
- OK, I can do that.
- Cool.

600
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,524
And then she comes up here.
You are in this chair.

601
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,401
She's in that chair.

602
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,780
So you guys can hug, wave, sit...

603
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,616
converse.

604
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,497
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Michelle Obama!

605
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:47,423
# This girl is on fire #

606
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,803
I was in my twenties.

607
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,179
I was a lawyer.

608
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,764
And up until that point,

609
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,101
I had been what I describe in the book
as a "box-checker."

610
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,728
I was doing what I thought
I was supposed to do.

611
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,731
You know, I was an A-student.
I got the star.

612
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,194
And that landed me
from Princeton to Harvard,

613
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,238
to a firm,

614
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,282
without really thinking
about what I cared about.

615
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,535
You start practicing law,

616
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,287
and then, out of nowhere,

617
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,166
comes a young man
with a very peculiar name.

618
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,003
And you were supposed to be his mentor.

619
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,964
And then
I had to call him on the phone.

620
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,175
This is when I first got a hint that there
might be a little something more there.

621
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,927
He's like, "Hello?"

622
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,638
And he's got that Barack Obama voice

623
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:40,059
that did not match the nerdy image
I had in my head.

624
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,686
And I was sort of like, "Whoa!"

625
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,188
I really was like, "Whoa!"

626
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,567
The heat was coming out of the phone
from that voice.

627
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,611
But then he was late,

628
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,991
and I was like, "Trifling black man,
late on the first day."

629
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,910
He flashed that smile.

630
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,996
He was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry."

631
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,416
"I was... I was late.

632
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,668
I wasn't equipped with an umbrella."

633
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,715
You know, and I started going, "OK."

634
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,594
And he was walking by.

635
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,679
All the secretaries
were looking at me, like...

636
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,770
And I was like, "I know. I know, girl."

637
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,147
Get him in the office.

638
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,868
Yeah, it's fun listening to her
tell these stories.

639
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,079
- Yeah.
- Some of which, you know...

640
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,498
Part of me is like, "No.

641
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,500
Hold on a second.

642
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,711
That's not exactly how it happened."

643
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,923
But because he was my advisee I was like,

644
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,800
"Yeah, no, we're not dating."

645
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,177
Because he asked me out
probably a month in,

646
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,180
and I was like,
"Dude, that would be so tacky."

647
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,850
The two black people
from Harvard, you know?

648
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,727
I was like,
"That's what they're waiting for."

649
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,021
It's like,
"You guys love each other, don't you?

650
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,066
You're black, he's black.
This will be great."

651
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,028
I was not gonna fall into that stereotype.

652
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,033
But how do you fall for a guy
who's driving a yellow Datsun?

653
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,576
Yellow,

654
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,246
with a hole in the floor,
that when you're driving,

655
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,081
you can see the street as you're moving.

656
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,292
I mean, this was love, y'all.

657
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,130
One day, you guys are hanging out
in the middle of the night,

658
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,590
and you see him staring off into space,
and you're thinking,

659
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,218
"I wonder if he's thinking about moi?"

660
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,804
And you said,
"What are you thinking about?"

661
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,015
It could be, like, income inequality or...

662
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,227
the fate of the black community.

663
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,396
I was like, "Oh, how romantic."

664
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,065
He was a different kind of dude
from the very beginning.

665
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,275
He was very different.

666
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,360
And he was different from me,

667
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,029
and he challenged me in different ways.

668
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,907
I knew he was a tsunami coming after me,

669
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,451
and if I didn't get my act together,

670
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,995
I would be swept up.

671
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,249
I didn't want to just be
an appendage to his dreams.

672
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,502
So that forced me to work and think,

673
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,880
and make decisions like leaving law.

674
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,301
Speaking of your husband...

675
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,931
Flowers!

676
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,402
Wait, this is like when Jay-Z comes out

677
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,571
during the Beyoncé concert.

678
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,407
# Young B and R-O-C #

679
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,662
You know, that's in "Crazy in Love."
It's the same thing.

680
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,706
It's just a little sample...

681
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,292
to enhance...

682
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,085
the concert.

683
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,714
There are a couple of things
I would correct.

684
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,674
You don't have to do that here.

685
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,635
- It's my book.
- But that's my point.

686
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,473
- It's my book, my version of reality.
- And we have to drive home together.

687
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,951
My relationship with Barack
was all about our partnership.

688
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,870
If I was going to have an equal voice

689
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,998
with this very opinionated man,

690
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,751
I had to get myself up.

691
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,045
I had to set myself off

692
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,299
to a place where I was confident
that I was going to be his equal.

693
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,680
The thing that really changed it
was the birth of our children.

694
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,558
I wasn't really ready for that.

695
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,520
That really made it harder.

696
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,564
Something had to give,

697
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,193
and it was my aspirations and dreams.

698
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,528
I made that concession,

699
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,905
not because he said,
"You have to quit your job."

700
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,866
It felt like, "I can't do all of this.

701
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,620
So I have to tone down my aspirations.

702
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,455
I have to dial it back."

703
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,129
You shared that
you went to marital counseling,

704
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,089
which I think is so important.

705
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,924
Counseling helped me to look at,

706
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,095
"How do I take control of my own happiness
within our marriage?"

707
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,597
But it's hard. It's hard.

708
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,976
- It is hard blending two lives together.
- Yeah.

709
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,311
Did the marital counseling help?

710
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,438
I went to five marriage counselors.
It didn't help me.

711
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,856
What was the name of yours?

712
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,775
I should have gone to your guy.

713
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,820
That's what I should have done.

714
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,655
So, did it help?

715
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,324
Because, you know, you think...

716
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,579
You go to marital counseling and
you think that they're going to tell you,

717
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,664
"He's right," or "You're right,"
or, "You're wrong."

718
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,583
- And in my view...
- That's frustrating.

719
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,085
I took Barack to marital counseling

720
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,129
so that they would fix him.

721
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,213
Yes.

722
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,343
And then he started looking over at me.
I was like, "Why are you talking to me?"

723
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,596
I am perfect.

724
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,097
He is the problem.

725
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,559
But one of the things I learned
that helped me,

726
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,227
and I think helped our marriage,

727
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:21,275
was that my happiness is not dependent
on him making me happy.

728
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,110
Yes. Bravo, yes.

729
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,072
And sometimes I felt that
that was one of the rubs.

730
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:30,910
My resentment for him was that Barack
was prioritizing himself, in a way.

731
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,787
We had babies; he was at the gym.

732
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,456
I was like,
"How do you find time to work out?"

733
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,333
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

734
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,002
"So let me stop being mad at him
for going to the gym

735
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,797
and let me get to the gym," you know?

736
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,595
Did it feel like a show
that you would want to see?

737
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,806
Yeah.
You're just a good storyteller.

738
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,891
OK. Thank you, guys.

739
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,227
Thank you.
It was amazing tonight. Thank you.

740
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,187
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

741
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,231
- Thanks.
- Take it easy.

742
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,273
Thank you.

743
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
Thanks.

744
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,036
Good afternoon.

745
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,747
Can you all...? Oops. Sorry.

746
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,207
Good afternoon!

747
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,708
Good afternoon!

748
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,377
This is the Obamas.

749
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,881
This guy you'll hear from later, Barack.

750
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,927
Sasha, better known as "Natasha,"
and Malia.

751
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,470
And I am Michelle Obama.

752
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,848
I'm married to this guy.

753
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,019
She is fantastic.

754
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,229
She really is.

755
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,608
- Done. Thank you.
- Michelle, you ready?

756
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,446
- Not today.
- OK.

757
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,489
There was something
about Michelle Obama.

758
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,658
I quit a job
that I had been in for ten years

759
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,410
to go work for her.

760
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:59,290
As a friend, I have been by her side
for almost all of this.

761
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,877
See, some beats are just good.

762
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,882
# Look, I just flipped the switch #

763
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,217
Oh, good Lord.

764
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,803
Do you know Melissa loves Barry Manilow?

765
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,139
And I don't even know why we're friends.

766
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,601
We couldn't be more opposite.

767
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,019
That's why we're friends.

768
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,318
Having watched her begin this journey
being so nervous,

769
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,111
you know,
she wasn't crazy about the process.

770
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,321
She doesn't like politics,

771
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,615
and here we were,
dragging her around Iowa.

772
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,289
For the first year of the campaign,
it was exhausting and not glamorous,

773
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,415
and we ate...

774
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,876
a lot of McDonald's.

775
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,795
And she'd lose her voice

776
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,796
by the end of the day,

777
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,633
because that's how hard we were
working her; she was that valuable.

778
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:57,515
She said to me,
"I don't know if this country is ready

779
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,308
for someone like my husband.

780
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,354
I hope they are, but they may not be."

781
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,193
Here you are on the campaign trail,

782
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,071
and the way that
you were vilified in the press,

783
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,490
the way you were misinterpreted
in the press,

784
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,367
really, was a horrible time

785
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,036
that I think many of us
really were not aware of.

786
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:19,995
Yeah.

787
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,333
Because I was going around the country
doing big, huge rallies.

788
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,543
It was so much fun.

789
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:31,257
Please join me
in welcoming Michelle Obama

790
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,718
and the Democratic Party's nominee.

791
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,473
But then the attacks started.

792
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,434
A fist bump? A pound?

793
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,020
A terrorist fist jab?

794
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,940
The gesture everyone seems
to interpret differently.

795
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,361
I was becoming effective
in the campaign,

796
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,906
so they went after me
like they went after a candidate.

797
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,659
It blindsided me.

798
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,454
One way people will try to defeat Obama

799
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,248
is if they can't prove he's a Muslim,

800
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,458
"Then let's prove his wife
is an angry black woman."

801
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,085
And I think it's going to get ugly.

802
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,421
She's out on the campaign trail.

803
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,381
She's making speeches
on behalf of her husband.

804
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,882
She's fair game.

805
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,218
One of her biggest hurdles
will be defining herself

806
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,761
before anybody else does.

807
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,681
Over the course of the campaign,

808
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,641
I was telling my story.

809
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,393
I was being vulnerable.

810
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,061
Let me tell you something.

811
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,523
For the first time in my adult lifetime,

812
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,525
I'm really proud of my country.

813
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,738
And not just because Barack has done well,

814
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,033
but because I think
people are hungry for change.

815
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,494
And to have that distorted,

816
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,830
it just felt so wrong.

817
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,208
Does Michelle Obama dislike America?

818
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,502
I think she's got a chip on her shoulder.

819
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,254
She has a Stokely Carmichael

820
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,048
in-a-designer-dress thing going.

821
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,424
Her instinct is to start

822
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,176
with this, "Blame America.

823
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm the victim."

824
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,846
Speaking her mind can get her in trouble.

825
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,139
An angry woman.

826
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,849
She's not warm and fuzzy.

827
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,684
She's adding fuel to the fire.

828
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,646
Michelle must think
about what she's become in her life.

829
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,400
I stopped talking off-the-cuff.

830
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,569
I stopped talking freely.

831
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,655
I used teleprompters.

832
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,907
I had to be much more scripted

833
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,159
than I had ever been before.

834
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,039
I was just, sort of, waking up to...

835
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,960
the truth of who we can be:

836
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:36,048
so ready to assume the worst in people.

837
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,261
The only thing I can do
is share that that does hurt.

838
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,431
Because if we walk around
pretending like it doesn't hurt,

839
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,101
the perpetrators just say,
"Oh, I was just joking.

840
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,936
It's just politics."

841
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,646
It's, like, "No, no. No, no.

842
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,650
That changes the shape
of a person's soul."

843
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,614
It's important to have a place
that you know as your home.

844
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,121
One place where people know you,
they've seen you grow up,

845
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,333
where people don't have to make up a story
about who you are.

846
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,421
It's what keeps me grounded.

847
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,558
And this tree has been here forever.

848
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,061
This was the tree
where I had one of my first kisses.

849
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,647
Hmm.

850
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,580
That's it.

851
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:36,585
She always played everything
over and over and over again.

852
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,420
It had to be perfect.

853
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,257
- The bulb is burned out.
- OK.

854
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,635
You can tell it's stale in here.

855
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,266
This was the living room.

856
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,685
And this is...

857
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:59,441
the radiator that Mom turned
into a chimney for Christmas.

858
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:04,196
And there used to be mirrors on this wall
to make this look bigger.

859
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,491
I was a teenager here,

860
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,453
and Barack and I lived here
for a year together.

861
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,956
But this is my dad's chair.

862
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,209
He always had some version
of this recliner,

863
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,503
where he would sit and hold court.

864
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,005
And when we all lived here,

865
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,842
his stereo system would be lined up there

866
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,886
with his speakers
and all of his jazz albums.

867
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,681
And the couch was kind of that way.

868
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,851
And he would sit for hours just playing.

869
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,938
He would get into his mood
where he would just want to hear his jazz.

870
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,276
You know, he fills up this space.

871
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,698
I think about all that we did,

872
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,993
and I think about my husband, and...

873
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:56,582
I always think about him coming home
from work, coming up those stairs.

874
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,875
Mm-hmm.

875
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:04,381
But him coming up those stairs
was like God returning home.

876
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,683
My father had MS.

877
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,022
It's a disease
that slowly deteriorates the body.

878
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,402
I can't help but think of that time
right before his death

879
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:30,324
when he struggled to get out
that back door just to get to work,

880
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,744
not giving up, not in the least.

881
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,377
While his death was sudden,

882
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,421
it was always looming.

883
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:51,595
The pain of losing him is an emptiness
I still haven't gotten over.

884
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,182
I think about all that he gave us,

885
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,018
and all that he wasn't able to see.

886
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:09,613
He had a way
of making people that he was with

887
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,074
feel his presence.

888
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,912
He just made people feel loved.

889
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,564
My grandma's from Thailand.

890
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:48,318
A lot of the culture in the house
is kind of influenced by her.

891
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,155
And when I was, like, five years old,
I got this little pencil skirt

892
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,657
and off-the-shoulder top.

893
00:49:55,659 --> 00:50:00,330
Yeah. I tell people
we focus too much on stats and not story.

894
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,000
Stats are, like,
"What college are you from?"

895
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,002
But your story is, like,

896
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,087
"What was your grandfather like?"

897
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,715
"Who was your favorite relative and why?"

898
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,300
What advice would you give to someone

899
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,178
who's trying to avoid
just becoming a stat?

900
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:21,435
Like, when you go to college
you're not just the kid with the 3.0 GPA,

901
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,395
or when you're applying for jobs

902
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,815
you're not just that person
who graduated top of her class.

903
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,943
How do you avoid just becoming a number?

904
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:35,365
I think what makes you more than a stat
is once you see yourself,

905
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,410
you see yourself as more than a stat,

906
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,788
and you start thinking, "Who are you?

907
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,042
What do you care about?
What brings you joy?"

908
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:51,298
And I hope my story urges you
to see the power of your story

909
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,841
and to own that.

910
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,265
Now that I'm going into my senior year,

911
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:04,770
I'm thinking about how to make sure
I'm doing the right things.

912
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,814
So reading Michelle Obama's book,

913
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,193
we see that she just slowly started
to assert herself,

914
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,779
and all those insecurities
just become, like...

915
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,364
small voices.

916
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,286
Reading about how her family works...

917
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,623
I was like, "Wow.

918
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,084
Wow."

919
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,752
That's our family.

920
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,257
# Caught in a landslide #

921
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,344
In the morning time,
we dance through our morning routine.

922
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,137
We'll just dance through the hallways.

923
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,974
If they're up, pleasant
and having a good morning,

924
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,769
we're playing some music,
you're kind of in good spirits, so...

925
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,439
It helps everybody shake off the cobwebs.

926
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,067
Yesterday's mistake... It's a new day.

927
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,569
I do like these curls. Turn, please.

928
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,782
The sacrifices my mom
would make makes me think, like,

929
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,992
"All right,
just strive to do what you can,

930
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,495
and just be prepared
for whatever life throws at you."

931
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,248
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Have a good day.

932
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,921
I want to be successful,
and I also want to impact somebody.

933
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,059
America opened itself up to you

934
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,687
with that historic election.

935
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,023
And I think everybody in this room
will remember where they were

936
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,609
on that November evening in 2008.

937
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,492
From the minute that
the announcement happened,

938
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,828
the world changed for us.

939
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,376
People came in with briefing books,

940
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,254
and world leaders were calling,
right then and there.

941
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,550
So we had to leave the hotel
to go to the campaign event,

942
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,510
and everything is shut down

943
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,888
when the presidential motorcade
comes down.

944
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,473
Streets are clean. Nothing is going on.

945
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,101
So it's just us in the motorcade,

946
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,853
and Malia's like...

947
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,856
"No one's coming to your party, Dad."

948
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,942
That's what she was saying.

949
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,529
And she was like,
"Oh, I feel bad for you."

950
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,929
I would not be standing here tonight

951
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,348
without the unyielding support

952
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,518
of my best friend for the last 16 years,

953
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,230
the rock of our family,

954
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,482
the love of my life,

955
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,443
the nation's next First Lady,

956
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,153
Michelle Obama.

957
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:12,582
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!

958
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,985
We'll take a look first and come back.

959
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,194
Good afternoon.

960
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,740
We're going to be leaving the RON to go
to the O2 Arena for this evening's event.

961
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,535
It was at 93%

962
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,289
when we had our walkthroughs earlier,
so approximately 15,000.

963
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,418
- The venue holds 17,500, all right?
- And now it's up to 98%.

964
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,795
For those of you
who have worked these before,

965
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,007
it should be the same footprint,
as far as the buildout and everything.

966
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,051
From her hold to the stage is 65 feet.

967
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,596
The stage is five feet tall.
And there are the six stairs to the back.

968
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,307
She goes through the hockey tunnel.

969
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,770
- Everything OK, Allen?
- Yes, ma'am.

970
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:20,483
One day, I've got to sit
and see how the sausage is made.

971
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:26,573
Like, all the pre-stuff that goes into it,
I'm just not a part of.

972
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:31,619
You know? But I always ask questions.
I always want to know where the guns are.

973
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,707
Because what if somebody
really was trying to take me out?

974
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,584
They would take these two out first.

975
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,669
I could get us to safety, Allen.

976
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,256
You guys, I got you covered.
I'm always thinking.

977
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,383
I know you could.

978
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,385
I'm very confident in that.

979
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,638
Agent Allen.

980
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:55,435
Allen is more like a brother
than he is an agent.

981
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:01,107
He was my first experience
of having a detail,

982
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,860
of being on a detail
and having a detail leader.

983
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,446
So that's been... oof!

984
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,991
Well, that's 12 years
of a relationship, if not more.

985
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,537
And I've spent a lot of time
looking at the back of his head.

986
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,211
I've been working
with Mrs. Obama since 2008.

987
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,047
You need to eat a little dinner.

988
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,091
- It's not enough time.
- We know.

989
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,676
Over that time,
if you're around a protectee,

990
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,387
you get to know each other very well.

991
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,180
I'll come back to you.

992
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,723
I'm going to win you over.

993
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,393
The stakes are very high in this job.

994
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,144
It's a no-fail mission,

995
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,148
so you have to get it right
100% of the time.

996
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,453
We took a trip to the Great Wall in China.

997
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,289
It had been planned out
that the girls would have the ability

998
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,541
to take the slide down.

999
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,043
And when Mrs. Obama saw the slide,

1000
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,295
she became interested
in wanting to do it as well.

1001
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,091
As you can see,
she's smiling and I'm not smiling.

1002
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,929
But obviously it's a very special photo.
It's a fun photo.

1003
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,722
It's actually one of my favorites.

1004
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,645
And that's something I always
have to pinch myself over and say,

1005
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,856
"Did I really experience all of that?"

1006
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,571
What did you think life in the White House

1007
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,573
was going to be like
before you got in there?

1008
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:35,160
Is there any way
somebody coming into that house can know?

1009
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,330
Families who have the legacy
of the White House have some idea.

1010
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:43,126
I mean, the Bushes, their daughters
were granddaughters in the White House.

1011
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,003
We were not those people.

1012
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,549
I didn't know
what the residence part of it looked like,

1013
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:53,219
but I do know, when I went to visit
and have tea with Laura Bush,

1014
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,182
there were butlers there
fully-dressed in tuxedos,

1015
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,017
which they wore all the time,

1016
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,979
most of them African-American
or Latino older men.

1017
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:06,065
What I spent a lot of time
thinking about is,

1018
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:10,403
"How do I make this mansion
with butlers and staff

1019
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,239
feel like a home for two little girls?"

1020
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,909
First of all, I didn't want them
to grow up thinking

1021
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:20,121
that grown African-American men
served them in tuxedos.

1022
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:25,168
Because, you know, the truth was
that some of those men were my uncles,

1023
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:28,421
and they were the Pullman porters,
and the folks...

1024
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,841
And I didn't want my girls
to grow up with that image,

1025
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,760
so we had to change the dress code.

1026
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:38,556
It was like, "You can't walk around
every day in a full tuxedo," you know?

1027
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,602
Because the girls would have pool parties
and play dates and little kids over.

1028
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,648
And it's, like, that just doesn't
even look right to me, you know?

1029
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,527
And, you know,
I had to beg the housekeepers.

1030
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,112
"These girls have to learn
how to clean their own rooms

1031
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,114
and make their beds, and do their laundry.

1032
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,826
You cannot do this every day
because they will not live here forever.

1033
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,956
And I am not raising kids that don't know
how to make a bed," you know?

1034
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,040
So...

1035
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,503
Of course the girls were like,
"They make your bed."

1036
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,047
And it's like,
"Because I'm the First Lady

1037
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,799
and I have a degree."

1038
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:24,227
# I live by my own
Just in case my faith go #

1039
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:29,065
# I live by my own law
I live by my own law #

1040
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,359
# I live by my own #

1041
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,528
As First Lady,

1042
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:38,575
I was slowly watching myself
being exposed to the world.

1043
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:43,580
I had to become more strategic
in how I presented myself,

1044
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:47,750
because it had the potential
of defining me for the rest of my life.

1045
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,212
Fashion for a woman

1046
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,756
still predominates how people view you,

1047
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,593
and that's not fair,
that's not right, but it's true.

1048
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,304
And that's when fashion
isn't just fashion;

1049
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,557
it's how you turn it into your tool,
rather than being a victim of it.

1050
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:07,186
There is a lot of thought
that Meredith Koop puts into it.

1051
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,313
And I trust Meredith.

1052
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,564
She's like my sister,

1053
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,317
daughter, friend, everything.

1054
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,535
People have these ideas
of a First Lady look.

1055
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,830
You're dealing with these outside forces

1056
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:29,125
saying things that don't match up
with this woman.

1057
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,254
So I felt a lot of my work
in the White House

1058
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,756
was more like costume design.

1059
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,636
Dressing her and her children
for this role.

1060
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:45,058
And then it's about, "Let's move
the conversation on to what she's doing

1061
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,477
versus some little fashion detail."

1062
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,314
I'd make some impassioned speech
and they would say,

1063
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,400
"Oh, she was wearing
an interesting designer dress."

1064
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:01,115
So a lot of it was, "OK, let's embrace the
fact that people are looking at my shoes,

1065
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,326
not just highlight me and the clothes,

1066
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,536
but who we wanted to be
as an administration:

1067
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,997
forward-thinking, embracing youth,

1068
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,749
embracing diversity.

1069
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,672
Now that we're out of the White House,

1070
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:21,761
not to be viewed, judged, and parceled
by every other person on the planet,

1071
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,806
yeah, it's better.

1072
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,352
It's absolutely freeing.

1073
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,021
Oh, my God!

1074
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,526
She is not a minimalist.

1075
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,653
Like, she's not... Like, hello.

1076
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,699
And, I mean,
when I look at this suit, I do see Elvis,

1077
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,327
and I don't have a problem with that.

1078
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,474
I had to shake all of that up.

1079
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,728
But, yeah, it's hard to wake up every day

1080
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,939
and maintain that level of perfection

1081
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:18,109
that was absolutely required
of me and Barack

1082
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:22,238
as the first black president
and First Lady.

1083
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,825
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

1084
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,118
All right. You, too.

1085
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,966
Our presence in the White House

1086
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,927
had been celebrated
by millions of Americans.

1087
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,765
But others reacted with fear.

1088
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,978
When Barack was first elected,

1089
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,773
various commentators had naively declared

1090
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,443
that our country was entering
"a post-racial era,"

1091
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,738
in which skin color
would no longer matter.

1092
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,534
Many were overlooking the racism

1093
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,663
and tribalism
that were tearing our nation apart.

1094
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,591
Barack and I lived with an awareness

1095
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,886
that we ourselves were a provocation.

1096
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,265
Michael Brown.

1097
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,392
Tamir Rice.

1098
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,436
Freddie Gray.

1099
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,730
Eric Garner.

1100
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,274
Trayvon Martin.

1101
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,777
Sandra Bland.

1102
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,283
When you see people gunned down

1103
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,495
because somebody was so afraid
of a kid in a hoodie

1104
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,748
that that ended his life...

1105
01:03:56,082 --> 01:04:00,253
So how were these people
dealing with the fact

1106
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:04,507
that a black family was in
what they perceived as their White House?

1107
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,554
That is the America that we live in.

1108
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,476
So if we're going to get anywhere
with each other,

1109
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,772
we have to be willing to say who we are.

1110
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,904
I am the former First Lady
of the United States

1111
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,616
and also a descendent of slaves.

1112
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,079
It's important
to keep that truth right there.

1113
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,794
My grandfather's grandmother
was in bondage.

1114
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:49,844
People have been taught to believe
in the ultimate inferiority of people

1115
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,929
because of the color of their skin.

1116
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,809
A death threat against the president.

1117
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,521
D.C. police looking into
an officer threatening Michelle Obama.

1118
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,690
Gunshots near the White House.

1119
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,650
Seven bullets hit the building.

1120
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,620
You hoped people were more ready for us...

1121
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,582
than maybe what they were.

1122
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,676
Barack and I had incredible highs

1123
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,471
and incredible lows in one day.

1124
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:38,935
So, on the day that marriage equality
became the law of the land,

1125
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,729
it was a very powerful day.

1126
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,691
But until I wrote the book,

1127
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,653
I forgot that that morning,

1128
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,571
we had attended the funeral

1129
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:55,368
of men and women who were killed
in Bible study in Charleston.

1130
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:13,803
# Amazing grace #

1131
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:20,893
# How sweet the sound #

1132
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,899
# That saved #

1133
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,112
# A wretch #

1134
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:35,783
# Like me #

1135
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:43,958
So imagine coming back
from that heavy experience, flying in.

1136
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,377
And then we're at dinner,

1137
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,839
and we hear the sounds of people gathering

1138
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,841
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

1139
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:58,014
And we had arranged in advance
to have the White House lit up,

1140
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,975
celebrating the passage
of Marriage Equality.

1141
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:10,151
And we see this happening
on TV, and I thought,

1142
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,986
"We are living in this.

1143
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:16,032
This is outside of our house.
I don't want to watch it on TV.

1144
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,909
I need to be a part
of this celebration after today.

1145
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,538
I need to be reminded
of how much progress we're making."

1146
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,915
But then I had to get out.

1147
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,587
So I go to Malia and she's like,
"OK, Mommy, I'm game. Let's do it."

1148
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,674
So you walk out your door.
There's a Secret Service agent out there.

1149
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,635
And I'm telling Malia,
"Don't look him in the eye.

1150
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:37,970
Don't say anything.

1151
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,805
We're just going to walk."

1152
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:43,184
So we get downstairs to that front door,

1153
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,521
and I go to open it, and it's locked.

1154
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,609
So I am literally shaking it,

1155
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,570
and now more Service have been called,

1156
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,781
because they don't know
what I'm trying to do.

1157
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:57,740
"What is ma'am doing?"

1158
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:01,702
"What is ma'am doing? Where is she going?
She still hasn't told us anything."

1159
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,537
And nobody really wants to ask you,

1160
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,748
because they're not supposed to ask
where you're going.

1161
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,584
They're trying to pretend
like you have freedom. So...

1162
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:13,130
So I had to turn around and say,
"I just want to get outside.

1163
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,590
Help me get outside.

1164
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,425
I want my daughter and I..."

1165
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,761
So I'm just yelling,
"Get me out of this house!"

1166
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,888
And she's like, "OK, I have an idea."

1167
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:24,183
And we ran around some back steps.
We finally got outside.

1168
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,602
We were, like, off in a corner,

1169
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,605
and we could just barely see
the sides of the lights.

1170
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,024
But Malia and I were out.

1171
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,734
And I hugged her tight.

1172
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,154
But that's sometimes how you feel, like,

1173
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:41,951
"I have to have some indicator
that all of this is worth it,

1174
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,994
that we are moving this country forward."

1175
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:47,748
Hi.

1176
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,252
- How are you all doing?
- Hi.

1177
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,336
Hello.

1178
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,171
- Hey.
- It's amazing to see you.

1179
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,464
How are you?

1180
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:01,095
What are you looking forward to in life?
And what brings you down?

1181
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:06,392
It's just us reservation kids
going through universities

1182
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,935
in the era of Trump.

1183
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,063
I see Trump hats every day in classes,

1184
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,859
and it's just like an impact
that you can't really describe.

1185
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,486
But it's just there, subconsciously,
on a subconscious level.

1186
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,364
Could you share any tips
or recommendations?

1187
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:25,244
Yeah, I mean, I can't imagine
how tough it must be for you all.

1188
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:29,248
And I want you guys to have perspective
as you're going through it,

1189
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,878
and not let this time shape what will be.

1190
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,921
So, you're in school.

1191
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,133
Be in school. Get your fricking education.

1192
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:42,469
You know, Barack and I,
all through this presidency,

1193
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,139
through the lies
and the stuff they said about us,

1194
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:49,268
all we could do was wake up every day
and do our jobs,

1195
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,897
and let our jobs and our lives
speak for itself.

1196
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:01,155
Barack and I are not interested
in being at the forefront forever,

1197
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,199
not even for that much longer.

1198
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,367
Everybody here is special, right?

1199
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,953
You know that, right?
Well, that's why I'm here.

1200
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,122
We've got this platform.

1201
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:13,667
If you believe in God,
God gave us this platform for a reason,

1202
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,211
so let's not waste it.

1203
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,255
- Don't drop the baby.
- No.

1204
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,052
- Thank you.
- She's so cute.

1205
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,263
It takes some energy to go high,

1206
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,057
and we were exhausted from it.

1207
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,309
Because when
you're the first black anything...

1208
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,478
- Yes.
- You know?

1209
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,230
So the day I left the White House,

1210
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:37,983
I wrote about how painful it was
to sit on that stage,

1211
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,403
and that a lot of our folks didn't vote.

1212
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,199
So it was almost like a slap in the face.

1213
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,338
I understand the people
who voted for Trump.

1214
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,967
The people who didn't vote at all:

1215
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,053
the young people, the women...

1216
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,266
That's when you think,
"Man, people think this is a game."

1217
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,230
And it wasn't just in this election,
but every midterm.

1218
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,525
Every time Barack didn't get
the Congress he needed,

1219
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,860
that was because our folks didn't show up.

1220
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,364
After all of that work...

1221
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,868
they just couldn't be bothered
to vote at all.

1222
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,540
That's my trauma.

1223
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:45,884
Being the First Lady
has been the greatest joy of my life.

1224
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,013
But as the first family
in the White House,

1225
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:52,975
we had to look at
what we would say in any given moment:

1226
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,768
what would that mean to the future?

1227
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,479
What long-term impacts would that have?

1228
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,273
Your iconic line,

1229
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,775
"When they go low, we go high,"

1230
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:05,112
sometimes for many people,
it's really hard to hold onto that.

1231
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,198
I'm assuming you still maintain that
and still believe that.

1232
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,534
- I try.
- OK, yes.

1233
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,703
I try. I try. We're only human.

1234
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,081
When you're President
of the United States, words matter.

1235
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,501
You know, you can start wars,
you can crash economies.

1236
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,129
There's too much power
to be that careless.

1237
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:25,883
And so that's how we operated, because...

1238
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:30,679
we had to be bigger and we had to go high.

1239
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,432
The higher up you go,
the higher up you have to be.

1240
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,979
We act like it doesn't take a toll on us,

1241
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:43,817
but you do not understand
what toll it takes

1242
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:46,278
on the people around the president.

1243
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,458
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, little potato.

1244
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,085
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, you.

1245
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,002
Oh, hi.

1246
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,504
- Hi.
- Good job.

1247
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,589
You're so good. I love you too much.

1248
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:07,257
I cried again.

1249
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,260
- Why are you always crying?
- No, it's always so...

1250
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,387
It's always so...

1251
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,222
What made you cry?

1252
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:16,308
But this has demonstrated, in a way,

1253
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:20,145
just, like, damn, those years
weren't for nothing, you know?

1254
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,941
You see that huge crowd out there?

1255
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:29,029
And that last speech you gave
about, just, like...

1256
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,867
People are here because people really
believe in love and hope in other people.

1257
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,993
Yeah.

1258
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,163
And also, every time
you guys play Stevie Wonder,

1259
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,416
I don't know, I cry a little bit.

1260
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,333
I do.

1261
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,711
- Where are Taylor and Jane?
- Taylor's in the car.

1262
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,297
They're in the car?
Everybody's in the car already?

1263
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,029
It's so nice to see you all.

1264
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,698
It's nice to see you.

1265
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:15,242
What were you all going to talk about?

1266
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,953
Becoming.

1267
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,288
I want to eavesdrop.

1268
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,707
We saw you last night,

1269
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:27,379
and you said that
you missed your spiritual community.

1270
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:31,008
So I want to ask our group,

1271
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:34,261
what advice would you give our First Lady?

1272
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:38,307
The first reaction, really,
is you've got to find your life again.

1273
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,434
There are so many different phases of you,

1274
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:43,145
and a lot of them you forget
while you're childrearing,

1275
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,813
and married, and all that stuff.

1276
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,858
So my advice to you
is just do what you're doing.

1277
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,360
- Keep on doing it.
- Yes.

1278
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,739
As my mother says, give it some time.

1279
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,658
And I'm so glad you did not get yourself

1280
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:02,247
wrapped up in the fluff
of being the First Lady

1281
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,124
and living in the White House,

1282
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,460
and, "My husband is..."

1283
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,174
Your view of me matters.

1284
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:16,261
Every time we showed up,
we showed up to make you all proud.

1285
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,680
Right. And you did. You did that.

1286
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,936
When I saw you on television,
when you were inaugurated,

1287
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,940
I said, "I never thought
that I would ever see..."

1288
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,858
Right.
My mother said the same thing.

1289
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:35,489
And I look back, and my mother
and my father had never seen it.

1290
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,033
But it was something.

1291
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:41,370
- I thank you and Barack for that.
- You saw it for them.

1292
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,579
I saw it.

1293
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,498
So it is a blessing.

1294
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,334
- Yeah.
- Michelle, I thank you.

1295
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,002
So God is good.

1296
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:52,589
- And you will always be First Lady to me.
- You will always be First Lady.

1297
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,384
- Forever First Lady.
- You will always be First Lady.

1298
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:07,145
# Happy Birthday to you #

1299
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:11,441
# Happy Birthday to you #

1300
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,568
You guys!

1301
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:16,405
# Happy Birthday, dear ma'am #

1302
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,073
Old ma'am.

1303
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:21,326
Oh, you can see the "ma'am."

1304
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,703
#...to you #

1305
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,871
- I'm rounding to 60.
- I know.

1306
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,628
- Yay!
- I can still blow out the candles.

1307
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,714
- Thanks, you guys.
- A little gift.

1308
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:34,923
- Oh, yeah.
- A gift?

1309
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,259
- A not round-to-sixty gift.
- A gift!

1310
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,013
What happens when you round to 60?

1311
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,682
- Yikes!
- Yeah.

1312
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:47,185
OK. Is it a magnifying glass?

1313
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,478
There you go.

1314
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,106
Oh, it's a selfie-cam!

1315
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,945
- Yes.
- That will come in handy.

1316
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,780
Look at the camera, not the remote.

1317
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:00,198
OK.

1318
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:06,955
What's next in life?

1319
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,795
I want to keep working
with young people.

1320
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:19,051
The future of our nation
is up to the next generation.

1321
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,595
But I know that doesn't just happen.

1322
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,056
Young people need some encouragement.

1323
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,849
You've got my eyelashes.

1324
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:27,851
Hi, Michelle.

1325
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,395
All right, get it done. Get it done.

1326
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,272
How are you?

1327
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:38,403
I love you. You guys
are up next, OK? So proud of you.

1328
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,865
Barack and I are empty-nesters,

1329
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,326
and that has been exhilarating:

1330
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:48,413
to watch the two little beings
you were in charge of grow up.

1331
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:54,294
I'm excited for her
to be proud of what she's done,

1332
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:57,381
because I think that's the most important
thing for a human to do:

1333
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,674
to be proud of themselves.

1334
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:02,219
No longer facing that same scrutiny,

1335
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:05,764
being able to let all of that
leave your mind,

1336
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,641
creates so much more space.

1337
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,777
I want to take care of me,

1338
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,238
rediscover my husband...

1339
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,785
My life is starting to be mine again.

1340
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:33,125
There is another chapter
waiting for me out there.

1341
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,114
# I will always love you #

1342
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:07,909
# How I do #

1343
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,998
# Let go of a prayer for you #

1344
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:16,835
# Just a sweet word #

1345
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:21,798
# The table is prepared for you... #

1346
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:29,639
# You look down on where you came from #

1347
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:33,685
# Sometimes #

1348
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:37,898
# But you'll have this place
To call home #

1349
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,234
# Always #

1350
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:52,162
# Still, I'll always be there for you #

1351
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,165
# How I do #

1352
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:04,466
- Tonight, the 34-stop tour ends.
- This is it, y'all.

1353
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,177
This is it.

1354
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,474
What has this journey been like?

1355
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,101
What have you learned,
maybe about yourself?

1356
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,771
And what has surprised you most
about your travels?

1357
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:22,734
I've had the rare experience
to see the world in this way,

1358
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,612
which is why I feel like
I've got to share with you all

1359
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:28,949
that, you know,
the energy that's out there

1360
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:31,660
is much better than what we see.

1361
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,163
I wish people didn't feel badly,

1362
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:38,208
because this country is good.

1363
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,709
People are good.

1364
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,545
People are decent.

1365
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,841
I tell you what I'm nostalgic for.

1366
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,468
I miss the opportunity we had

1367
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:51,680
to have leaders
who talked to us about hope,

1368
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,933
and the possibility of change,
which is what hope is.

1369
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,560
Well...

1370
01:20:57,477 --> 01:21:00,063
here's what I've learned
just on this book tour.

1371
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:03,525
You know, one of the things
we do miss about Barack Obama

1372
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,861
is that he would get out into the country

1373
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,363
and he would campaign around hope,

1374
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,115
and he would fill arenas,

1375
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,492
and then people
would come out and remember,

1376
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,578
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."

1377
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,039
"I do like this."

1378
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:22,294
And then people would be surrounded
with each other,

1379
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,379
of all different backgrounds,
and they would go,

1380
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:26,339
"Yeah, I'm not alone in this.

1381
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:31,177
I like this feeling of not being divided.

1382
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,304
I do."

1383
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:37,851
If we can open up a little bit more
to each other and share our stories,

1384
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,519
our real stories,

1385
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,563
that's what breaks down barriers.

1386
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,024
But in order to do that,

1387
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,860
you have to believe
that your story has value.

1388
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:50,196
Be vulnerable. Dare to be vulnerable.

1389
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,783
We're at a crossroads

1390
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,702
of where we have to think about,

1391
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:57,954
"Who are we as a nation?"

1392
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:02,584
I remain hopeful
that people want better...

1393
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:07,255
if not for themselves,
then for the next generation.

1394
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,552
And that is my basic joy.

1395
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,472
You know,
it gets back to mentoring others.

1396
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,058
That's what I'm going to do
until people are like,

1397
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:20,018
"OK, you're done, old lady."

1398
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:22,562
I'll just be on stage in a wheelchair,

1399
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,731
just going, "And another thing..."

1400
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,194
You know? And they'll be, like,
"Oh, that little old Michelle Obama.

1401
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:31,738
She's still just talking," you know?

1402
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:36,034
I want to be the 90-year-old woman
that you just excuse, you know?

1403
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:42,582
Ladies and gentlemen, join me in thanking
Michelle Obama for being here tonight.

1404
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,376
Thank you all so much.

1405
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,113
- I am becoming a strong...
- Yes.

1406
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:15,532
- ...confident, fierce girl...
- Yes.

1407
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:20,996
...who realizes that I have the power
to change the world.

1408
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,330
Yeah!

1409
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,551
I am a nonbinary human.

1410
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,973
And I am becoming brave

1411
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:42,183
and unafraid to live openly,

1412
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,561
truthfully and joyfully.

1413
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:57,991
I am becoming a mom
who is teaching my teenage boys

1414
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:02,120
to value and respect strong,
smart, independent women.

1415
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,538
Woohoo!

1416
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,373
Thank you!

1417
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,759
My parents emigrated from Mexico,

1418
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,635
and because of them,

1419
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:22,098
I am becoming a man
who is living the American Dream.

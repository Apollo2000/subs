1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:01,999
*

2
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,832
Your Holiness, do you need anything?

3
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,832
My fellow Members of Parliament,
we will not be intimidated

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,290
by any last minute defectors,

5
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:49,290
who might think this ship is sinking.

6
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,749
Go right ahead,
but the government is strong

7
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:57,082
and I assure you
this ship will not sink.

8
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,165
It will not sink!

9
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,999
He told them this time.

10
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,832
He just doesn't get it.

11
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,540
I'd say you don't.

12
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,749
Excuse me.

13
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,540
Please, excuse me!

14
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,290
Great job!

15
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,832
Thanks to you all!
See you on Monday, don't forget.

16
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,082
Well done, great speech!

17
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,165
Cut the compliments, Malgradi,

18
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,290
and make our friends
at the Treasury reason.

19
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,207
Since you're on the committee,
talk to them yourself,

20
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,665
you cannot simply sit there
and second.

21
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm bending over backwards
on that committee, but by now...

22
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,915
If we'd dumped them, the government
wouldn't be about to fall.

23
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,165
Enough talk,

24
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,249
take action!

25
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,790
How's it going with the amendment
on the waterfront of Ostia

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,499
to put into the Suburban Renewal Law?

27
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,832
About halfway,
seeing who's behind it...

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,082
They're the good ones,
here they are!

29
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,707
Keep up the good work, well done!

30
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,207
- What happened?
- We'll leave the Party.

31
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,415
Who'd ever thought it of you,
so straight and upright!

32
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,832
- You're one to preach!
- Well done, well done!

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,290
- Have you read it?
- What?

34
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,957
The various European statements
on us.

35
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,124
Fuck!

36
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,582
Ah, you speak Italian!

37
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,540
Ninni!

38
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,874
Going great, isn't it?

39
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,999
Take a break, that knock-out body
might rack-up victims.

40
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,624
By the way, someone's asking
for you, what do I do?

41
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,999
It could be good, he's organizing a
conference next year here in Rome,

42
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,707
I could do it myself,
if you put in a good word.

43
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,165
I'm already busy tonight.

44
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,332
- With him, like always?
- Yes.

45
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,624
I gotta find him a different girl
every night. He's obsessed.

46
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,082
Thanks to you all, good night.

47
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,249
- Sir, good evening!
- Good evening.

48
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,290
Ms. Lagarde
said Italy lacks credibility

49
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,624
in the announced measures,
isn't that a rejection?

50
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,124
No one's rejecting anyone,
let's be serious.

51
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:05,040
The opposition says
Italy is on the brink of default.

52
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,207
I think it's wrong to think Italy
is in a severe financial crisis,

53
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,957
consumer spending
hasn't decreased at all

54
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,249
and our lifestyle is
that of an affluent country.

55
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,374
We're not on the brink of any abyss.

56
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,499
- Thank you.
- Keep up the good work.

57
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,665
Goodnight, Your Holiness.

58
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,624
Darling,

59
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,124
the committee will go on late,
don't wait up.

60
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,915
Yes, I'm a little tired,

61
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,207
but don't worry,
I'll see you tomorrow.

62
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,332
Bye.

63
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,790
You can drop me here.

64
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,499
- Good evening, Mr. Malgradi.
- Hi Faisal, any news on your son?

65
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,790
- Not yet.
- I'm sorry.

66
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,082
For your trouble...

67
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,165
Thank you.

68
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,249
Have a good night.

69
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,999
Shut up,
you're upsetting my girlfriend.

70
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,832
Listen...

71
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,874
How about this signature?

72
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,040
We gotta go, Aureliano!

73
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,957
You're wasting my time
just for a signature!

74
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,540
Give me that, Mirco.

75
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,374
What are you doing?

76
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,624
- How about this signature?
- Yes!

77
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,457
- Don't cry! Yes or no?
- Yes, I'll sign!

78
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,540
I'll sign, I'll sign!

79
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,124
Good man.

80
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,082
See? That didn't take much.

81
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,915
Don't do it. No!

82
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,582
C'mon!

83
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,249
C'mon, c'mon!

84
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,957
Let's go!

85
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,707
Why all these people?

86
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,207
The first nightclub rounds are done,
now they're going again.

87
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,582
- Move, think we're on vacation?
- C'mon, let's move!

88
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,832
- Evenin', Scab.
- I said don't call me that.

89
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,457
So? What are we doing here?

90
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,957
Tell Samurai even the guy at Traiano
says he'll sell.

91
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,957
My work's almost done,
you gotta have me meet him.

92
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,207
- You can tell me.
- You?

93
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,749
Who the fuck are you?

94
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,374
If my dad hadn't got you votes,
you'd still be robbin' old ladies.

95
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,124
Your father reasoned with people.

96
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,249
- I'm not my father.
- I know.

97
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,582
In fact, you've got
more balls than brains.

98
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,582
Tell Samurai
I got more contracts in two months

99
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,665
than Dad in two years.

100
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,624
Okay?

101
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,624
Bye, Scab!

102
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,624
Roach?

103
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,249
He's inside.

104
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,582
This town's all changed,

105
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,332
the traffic, the buildings...

106
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,582
Even this place, what is it?

107
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,082
What was here before?

108
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,415
Nothing.

109
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,332
And you? Have you changed too?

110
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,165
Or are you
the same Samurai you were?

111
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,124
The warrior
at the service of the Idea?

112
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,999
I carry the Idea right here now,

113
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,874
and that's it.

114
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,415
Twenty years...

115
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,374
I did 20 years
for heists and neo-fascist terrorism,

116
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,207
but now Pippo's a big shot,

117
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,582
you've become the king of Rome...

118
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,249
And me?

119
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,124
Nothing.

120
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,999
What would you like?

121
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,749
A little piece
of your trafficking with Africa.

122
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,915
I'll handle the diamonds
from down there for you.

123
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,415
And if I say no?

124
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,207
- You can't.
- Why not?

125
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,374
Because this time I won't keep quiet.

126
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,040
What's your hand?

127
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,790
Don't worry, my cards are good.

128
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,165
Nothing's in your house, we cleaned
it out when they arrested you.

129
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,082
That's what lawyers are for.

130
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,582
You're bluffing.

131
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,165
And you're not good at it.

132
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,082
If I'm bluffing, show your hand.

133
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,124
Your lawyer is on my payroll,

134
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,624
been on it for years.

135
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,915
Ilena!

136
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,249
What's the matter?

137
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,124
Fuck, she's really sick.

138
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,499
- And she's a minor.
- It's what you asked me for.

139
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,415
I know! Help me, shit.

140
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,124
What do you want me to do?

141
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,207
You're the big shot, call someone!

142
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,457
I can't call anyone.

143
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,415
That colonel friend of yours?

144
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,207
And what do I tell him?

145
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,082
Let's take her out,
have you got the car?

146
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,249
- No, I sent the driver away.
- Call him back.

147
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,082
Shut up!

148
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,457
Don't talk shit, shut up!

149
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,915
I have to go, I can't stay here,
you can understand that.

150
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,540
You can't leave.

151
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:13,165
Cover her, will you please?
Cover her? Shit!

152
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,415
So?

153
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,749
I'll call a friend of mine.

154
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,999
Good, do that.

155
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,332
I'm off on the usual rounds.

156
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,207
Send the kids to bed,

157
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,999
it's like Christmas here.

158
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,374
Okay, get to bed!

159
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,290
Eminence...

160
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,665
What's the matter? Does he feel ill?

161
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,207
No, it's not that,

162
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,999
it's... more,

163
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,915
it's something
I should probably keep to myself,

164
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,249
because the Holy Father
confided in me like a son,

165
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,207
but the burden is too heavy.

166
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,582
What did he tell you?

167
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,707
The Pope wants to step down.

168
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,040
That can't be!

169
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,624
Did he say
when he intends to do this?

170
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,874
Very soon.

171
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:44,665
Aren't you ever sick of this place?
Why don't you sell it?

172
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,207
No way!

173
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,624
You know what's about to happen here?

174
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,832
Ostia will be like Las Vegas.

175
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,624
You'll see how much it'll be worth!

176
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,540
Why do you like it so much?

177
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,290
Because it's all mine.

178
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,082
Don't you like it?

179
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,749
You don't?

180
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,040
And what do you like?

181
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,749
You.

182
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:41,499
And this? Do you like this?

183
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,165
Yeah, that too.

184
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,082
That too?
Don't you love it most of all?

185
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,374
No, not most of all.

186
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,832
What's better?

187
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,374
Watching you sleep.

188
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,457
Okay, so...

189
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,457
I'm leaving.

190
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:39,165
Don't contact me, I'll call you.

191
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,874
- Need any help?
- No, Faisal, she drank too much.

192
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,790
- Should I call a taxi?
- I'm the taxi, bye!

193
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,999
You look tired.

194
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:33,040
Yeah, Dad, I'm exhausted,
I just got off work.

195
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,040
What did you want?

196
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,582
Nothing in particular.

197
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,457
You called me three times tonight.

198
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:58,332
That's because yesterday
I went to the cemetery.

199
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,915
Couldn't you go too, once in a while?

200
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,665
Your mother's grave
was full of dead flowers.

201
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,415
If she were alive, she'd like that.

202
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,124
I'd like her to be alive too.

203
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,207
Listen, I'm dead tired,
I need to get to bed.

204
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:30,040
Why don't I come by
the construction site tomorrow?

205
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,874
Actually, tomorrow's a mess,
but the day after...

206
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,332
Friday?

207
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,124
It was a mistake
having you come here.

208
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,915
Dad...

209
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,665
- Need a lift?
- Bye, Seba.

210
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,457
I'll pay!

211
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,707
How much?

212
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:08,249
Thank you.

213
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,499
Stop!

214
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,915
He jumped!

215
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,207
Call someone!

216
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,124
Call an ambulance, hurry!

217
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,665
Mr. Malgradi won't be here
for an hour, if you like...

218
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,707
All right, I'll wait.

219
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,165
Got any coffee around here?

220
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,124
Add a drop of cold milk
and make me happy!

221
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,707
Someone wants to talk to you.

222
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,582
We heard of your loss, condolences.

223
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,290
Thank you.

224
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,582
You must come with us now.

225
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,915
- Where?
- To Manfredi.

226
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,999
So he can explain everything.

227
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,624
What?

228
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:26,332
Why your father decided to fuck off.

229
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:31,374
How dare you speak to me like that?
Do I know you?

230
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,124
Calm down.

231
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,249
- Don't you know who Manfredi is?
- No, no idea.

232
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,665
Your father knew him well,
they were in business.

233
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,582
He's my uncle,
we have the same last name,

234
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,249
Anacleti.

235
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,915
Excuse me, let's talk about this
some other time, tomorrow...

236
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,624
No, not tomorrow, today,

237
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,707
believe me, it's better.

238
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,874
That person wants to talk to you,

239
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,582
I wasn't able to send him away.

240
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,582
How are you, Mr. Malgradi?
Everything okay?

241
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,207
Excuse me, who are you?

242
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,999
We saw each other last night.

243
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,665
Wanna talk about it
in front of everyone?

244
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,124
No.

245
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,540
Come with me.

246
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:54,124
From now on, you and your playmates
get your coke from me

247
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,290
and your hookers too,

248
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,582
you gotta get them from me too.

249
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,624
And,
seein' you got dealings all over,

250
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,124
let me cash-in on something.

251
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:09,249
What dealings? Cash-in... what?

252
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:12,874
I'm not a businessman,
I'm a politician.

253
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,582
Exactly, what the fuck
do you think I'm saying?

254
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:20,499
Politicians eat
and you gotta let me eat too

255
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:25,082
or I'll go to the cops
and tell them everything.

256
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,999
I understand.

257
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:31,332
How much? I'll find a way
to get it to you.

258
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,915
You don't see, I want you
to get me in with the right people,

259
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,999
you decide.

260
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:44,499
Relax, I'll give you time.

261
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,374
I know you're worried,

262
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:50,290
killing a minor with overdose
doesn't happen every day.

263
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,582
I didn't kill anyone.

264
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,249
You have one day,

265
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,290
I'll be back tomorrow.

266
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,874
Hello.

267
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,290
Do you know why
your father killed himself?

268
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,665
No, I don't.

269
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,290
Debts.

270
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:16,915
A mountain of debts,

271
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,499
with us.

272
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,915
Things weren't going well
for him lately.

273
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:28,540
I know he had a tough period
two years ago.

274
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,332
That continued

275
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:34,999
and we took on all his debts,

276
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,457
we're talking millions.

277
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,040
So, everything he had is ours.

278
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,124
He passed on early
and we want our investment back.

279
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:56,249
My friend, when the fat runs out,

280
00:42:56,458 --> 00:43:01,124
you get what you can, even the
nerves, right down to the bone.

281
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,999
Get my drift?

282
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,249
Too bad nothing's in my name,
or I could have...

283
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,999
We're off to a bad start.

284
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,915
How about the villa
where you organize parties?

285
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,999
No, it's in the company name,
all I have is stock.

286
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,665
The majority of share,
so, it's yours.

287
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,540
Not exactly...

288
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:29,540
I'll give you a week
to hand over the villa,

289
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,915
the house, car and all
the small change you can scrape up.

290
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,790
I'm furious with your father,

291
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:42,749
so, if you don't go, I'll chop
your leg off, put it in the fridge

292
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,665
and give it back
when you bring me the money.

293
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,374
Scabbre...

294
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,040
I need a hand, you have to help me.

295
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,040
- You asking me?
- Yes, only you.

296
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,249
I had a visit from a guy,

297
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,165
who needs to be taught
certain things can't be done.

298
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,290
Who is it?

299
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,499
A scab.

300
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,040
I'm listening.

301
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,790
Hi, Dagger.

302
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:05,832
Hi, you scared me.

303
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,165
The devil himself can't scare you!

304
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:12,332
Wait a minute.

305
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,082
The politician complained.

306
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,374
The fuck you're doing going
to his office in front of everyone?

307
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:25,207
- It's none of your fucking business.
- It's not done.

308
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,790
We treat those people different.

309
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,332
What do you want?

310
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:34,082
Are you his butler?
Why didn't he come directly to me?

311
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,707
Same reason your brother didn't go

312
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,832
and sent you.

313
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,040
Manfredi doesn't even know I saw him,

314
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,999
this is my own deal.

315
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,707
Politics aren't your thing,
forget it.

316
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:51,457
And who's thing is it, yours?

317
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:56,165
Sorry but you gotta make room for me,
I'm sittin' at this table too.

318
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:05,124
Why do you touch your dick
when you talk? Got the clap?

319
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,832
- Maybe you do.
- Don't fuck me around.

320
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,124
Who knows, maybe so.

321
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,915
Manfredi's right, when he says the
Atlantic separates you and your pa.

322
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,665
Your brother doesn't even know
where the Atlantic is, Dagger.

323
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:27,415
So, I'll tell him you'll be by
to give him a geography test.

324
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,749
- Good!
- Now get the fuck lost!

325
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,290
Manfredi!

326
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,540
Manfredi!

327
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:50,874
He died next
to the locked door of his car,

328
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,249
a brand new luxury SUV.

329
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:56,832
Maybe he wanted to run
and was attacked from behind.

330
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,707
Alberto Anacleti is local,

331
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,790
young, he grew up here.

332
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,707
A figure known to police

333
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:06,624
by his nickname, Dagger.

334
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,999
We're on the south east
side of Rome,

335
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:13,499
home to many strip clubs.

336
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:18,915
Forensics is at work
where it happened last night.

337
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,874
The victim is a young man, about 25,

338
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:27,749
it appears he was stabbed

339
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,332
and for the moment,
the men are working,

340
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,874
but the weapon
still hasn't been found.

341
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,790
Hi, Pippo.

342
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,999
ACCIDENT OR EXECUTION?

343
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,082
Did you read about Roach?

344
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:19,707
Did you do it?

345
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:23,124
It was Rome,

346
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:27,707
it's dangerous even to cross
the street in this fucking city.

347
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,290
Over time I've learned
to take it easy with the dead,

348
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,457
they're tough to handle.

349
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,582
But it seems you don't know that.

350
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,832
What are you talking about?

351
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,665
What the fuck were you thinking
calling Aureliano Adami

352
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,457
to resolve a matter
involving the Anacleti family?

353
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:59,499
Manfredi Anacleti is one
of the most badass fucks in Rome.

354
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,499
I didn't call anyone,
I don't know this Aureliano Adami.

355
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:07,457
- He's called "Number 8".
- I said I don't know him!

356
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,457
I just wanted to scare the idiot

357
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:14,332
who was blackmailing me,

358
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:16,832
I spoke to a party colleague
who has contacts...

359
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,124
Why didn't you call me?

360
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:26,124
I haven't seen
or heard from you in years.

361
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:33,124
How the fuck did I know
the asshole would kill him?

362
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,749
How did you find out?

363
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,749
I know lots of things.

364
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,749
So, why are you here?

365
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,832
To give you a hand,

366
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,540
if anyone rubs you wrong,
I'll cover you.

367
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:04,082
In exchange
I need the Suburban Renewal Law.

368
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,374
It's on its way.

369
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,290
With the amendment
for the Ostia beaches?

370
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,624
- No, that still...
- Vote it with the amendment.

371
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,332
- You're on the committee, right?
- Yes, but I can't...

372
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,457
Once again, vote it.

373
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:20,790
In a few days, your party,
the government... will fall apart.

374
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:26,040
Rumors, gossip, anyway
I'll ask my party leaders...

375
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,999
Your leaders no longer exist.

376
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:40,374
If the law passes before the
government falls, meaning days,

377
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:47,540
Santa Claus will bring your
foundation a couple of million.

378
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:58,707
Just push the law in the Chamber,

379
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:01,374
get back the defector votes...

380
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,749
Cuts are in the air, how can I?

381
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,749
If it's money you need, no problem,

382
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,249
we can buy anyone.

383
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:15,165
Just do your part,
I'll deal with the rest.

384
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:19,374
Got it?

385
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:22,915
Yes.

386
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,749
Say: "Okay!"

387
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,999
Okay.

388
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,457
Who was the girl that night?

389
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,999
Who do you think she is? A hooker.

390
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:44,832
Where does she live?

391
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,374
No, wait...

392
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,082
She's the only witness.

393
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,749
No!

394
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:54,999
She won't talk, won't say a thing.

395
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:20,124
This is absurd! Couldn't we meet
in a more discreet place?

396
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:23,457
- I feel safer here.
- What's that mean?

397
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,457
- I'm scared of you.
- Of me?

398
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,749
You ordered Dagger killed?

399
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,999
How can you even think that?

400
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,040
I know loads of things about you.

401
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,749
I've got everything:
photos, videos...

402
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,290
I filmed you when you slept,
when you did drugs.

403
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,207
If anything happens to me,
I'll ruin you. You can't touch me!

404
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,915
I didn't ask anyone to kill Dagger,

405
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:48,040
it was the mistake of an asshole
from Ostia called "Number 8",

406
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,124
what you don't understand

407
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,124
is that someone much worse
might come after you.

408
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,290
From now on, don't talk about me
and I won't talk about you,

409
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,332
it's convenient for both of us.

410
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,832
You have to go now.

411
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:09,999
Don't go back home.

412
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,374
Hear me?

413
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,290
Don't go home.

414
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,207
- Seba...
- Ninni!

415
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,665
You have to help me, I'm in trouble.

416
00:55:56,875 --> 00:56:00,499
No, please,
you don't know the mess I'm in.

417
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:03,415
- I know.
- Really, please...

418
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,832
Please, I can't go home, I'm scared.

419
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:13,332
Can I stay with you?
Just for tonight!

420
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,915
That old guy is the great Samurai?

421
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,707
And he goes around alone?

422
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:43,874
He was the only one in the
Magliana gang my dad was scared of.

423
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:45,999
Why?

424
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:50,082
He knows loads of things,

425
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,207
all the Mafias respect him.

426
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,999
You and your family are in this deal

427
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:37,874
only because it's here in Ostia,
on your turf.

428
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:41,499
You worry me,

429
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,332
you want to be the boss,
but still haven't learned how.

430
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:49,249
I don't like the way you talk.

431
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,332
I respect you,
but I want to be respected too.

432
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:59,624
Because you respect me, you killed a
guy you should have just scared?

433
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,499
He wanted in on the deal,
he told me!

434
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:04,415
Don't bullshit me, Aureliano!

435
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:07,707
The Anacletis don't know
a fucking thing about all this.

436
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,707
What's all the fuss?

437
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,999
I took a dickhead off the streets!

438
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:21,540
No backtalk, just do what I say,

439
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,540
you have to do like your father did.

440
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,499
My father licked all the asses
of the Families of the South,

441
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,624
I won't do it.

442
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,582
The "Families of the South"

443
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:46,415
poured millions into this deal

444
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:50,124
and I'm their guarantor,
I want to work in peace.

445
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:58,207
Is this big deal really coming?
We do lots of talkin'!

446
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:01,415
It's happening, if we cut the shit.

447
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,665
Can you be good
for a couple of weeks?

448
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:13,999
Answer me.

449
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,665
- I can, I can.
- I hope so, for your sake.

450
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:55,290
I wanna know who he saw last night.

451
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:00,540
Look for 'em one by one.

452
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,999
Find them.

453
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:11,165
So, it was the brother of...

454
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,707
This guy that died
was Manfredi's brother.

455
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,332
Manfredi, the...

456
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,540
The Anacletis,

457
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,582
the gypsies!

458
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:25,499
Now this guy's after me.

459
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,207
Who, the guy from Ostia?

460
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,499
No, why?

461
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,915
Maybe they're two different things,

462
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:36,749
maybe it was a thing between gangs.

463
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,415
Maybe you have nothing
to do with this,

464
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:42,707
these guys here...

465
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,457
I have to leave now,

466
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,665
I have an appointment.

467
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,040
It'll all work out, you'll see.

468
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,415
Stay as long as you like.

469
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:01,082
Bye, Ninni!

470
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:04,790
Bye.

471
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:32,124
Is Manfredi here?

472
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,665
Manfredi's here?

473
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,290
I want to talk to Manfredi.

474
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:44,374
Not today, come back tomorrow.

475
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:47,457
It's really important.

476
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,582
What?

477
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,874
I know who killed Dagger.

478
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,624
Let him in.

479
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,874
So? How do you know who did it?

480
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,499
A rumor.

481
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:36,790
I know all of Rome.

482
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,832
Give me a name.

483
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:45,874
But...

484
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,374
the villa where I work...

485
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:52,332
you have to let me keep it,
take the rest.

486
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:56,082
I want that name right now, or
I'll throw you in the cage with him.

487
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:03,165
It's a guy from Ostia,

488
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:05,832
he's got a nickname...

489
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,915
What nickname?

490
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,249
Number 8.

491
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,749
You know him?

492
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:20,457
Do you know why?

493
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:38,624
From kitten to tiger,
thanks to all the beatings,

494
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,999
he nearly ripped my nephew's arm off
the other day.

495
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,082
So, you'll have him put down.

496
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:47,665
No, I respect all warriors,

497
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,999
as long as they show me
they've got courage.

498
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:54,749
Now get out.

499
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,832
So, the villa...

500
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:03,665
I told you to get out,
my brother's dead, not my cat!

501
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:06,874
- Sorry.
- We mourn alone.

502
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,415
Ninni!

503
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,540
It's me!

504
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,332
I've been waiting so long.

505
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,082
You never came back,

506
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,915
where were you?

507
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,999
Public relations.

508
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,332
I'm cold.

509
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,165
Poor thing.

510
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,457
I'll warm you up.

511
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,999
May I?

512
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,707
I'm going home tomorrow.

513
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:35,999
Why?

514
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,915
You can stay as long as you like,

515
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:42,082
at least until they kick me out.

516
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,374
Who'll kick you out?

517
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,624
No, I just meant it...

518
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,540
as a joke.

519
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,582
I feel good here with you.

520
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,665
You do?

521
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,415
Can I say something stupid?

522
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,707
I do it all the time!

523
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:41,749
If I'd had a brother like you,
I wouldn't be a hooker.

524
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,207
No? Why, what else can you do?

525
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:48,624
- I can do lots of things.
- Like?

526
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,457
I can play hopscotch,

527
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:54,165
jump rope...

528
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,665
Anything a little more... modern?

529
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,165
I kick butt at videogames.

530
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:02,874
Okay, that's good.

531
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,415
Want to fuck?

532
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,374
Thanks for the thought.

533
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:22,082
I can just see
this shit town all changed.

534
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,707
All the lights,

535
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:37,499
cars coming and going,
neon signs, fireworks,

536
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:40,207
one big party, day and night.

537
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:07,290
All the skyscrapers,

538
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:12,499
game rooms, slot machines, casinos...

539
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:18,707
And a mile-long row of restaurants,
clubs, people having fun,

540
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:21,249
top-notch pussy.

541
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,790
All rich,

542
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,707
all beautiful.

543
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,499
Okay.

544
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,374
See you next week.

545
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,165
What are you doing?

546
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,999
They're coming.

547
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:36,624
We'll have to buy this guy something
or we'll look bad.

548
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,790
Stay down!

549
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,999
Go!

550
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:33,665
Cover your face, there's cameras.

551
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:52,999
Wait.

552
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,332
It's just a scratch.

553
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,999
Let's go.

554
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:41,582
My love, don't die on me here!

555
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,415
My love!

556
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,999
You can't leave me, please!

557
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,832
Get up!

558
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:13,790
Let's go.

559
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,082
C'mon, the cops are comin'.

560
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,124
I'm here with you.

561
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:29,415
What do we do?

562
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:51,457
Mirco!

563
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,749
Go!

564
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,624
He can't walk, Mirco!

565
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,790
He can't walk!

566
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:06,999
Go!

567
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:38,749
I'm not asking you
to change your mind,

568
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,915
just support me on
the Suburban Renewal Law.

569
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:45,082
Politics has nothing to do with it,
it's about Ostia.

570
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:48,915
It's a big project, if you say yes,
you'll be part of it.

571
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,332
Meaning?

572
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:54,624
The firm handling
the funds for the waterfront,

573
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:57,999
will need a General Manager,

574
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,915
interested?

575
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,249
What exactly would I do?
What do you need?

576
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,374
Your vote.

577
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:11,207
I already have your friends',
a few more here and there...

578
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:13,915
If you say yes, I feel more at ease.

579
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:23,582
It's a zoning issue,
if they break your balls,

580
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:26,624
tell them the agreement was
before you left the Party.

581
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:30,915
A CEO's salary?

582
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,540
- 500,000 a year.
- Plus benefits.

583
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,207
Obviously.

584
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:39,915
- Car with driver, trains, flights...
- Of course.

585
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:43,915
Length of contract?

586
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,332
Four years,

587
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,832
renewable.

588
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,249
Alright.

589
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:10,749
Just a few days left
to get the law passed,

590
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,665
so we need
to free those funds, now.

591
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,540
That's impossible,

592
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,249
it takes time to make
such large sums available...

593
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,165
Just a few days or it all blows up.

594
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:25,499
I'm sorry, I really don't know
how it can be done,

595
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,582
it's impossible.

596
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,790
Unfortunately, at this very moment,

597
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,540
there's something

598
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:39,790
bigger than me, or you,
but don't make me say it.

599
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,999
Eminence,

600
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,707
you are too intelligent

601
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:54,165
not to imagine the consequences
of your attitude.

602
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:57,999
If the deal blows,

603
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,790
they'll put you
at the bottom of the Tiber.

604
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:06,499
And I'd rather see
a better fate for you.

605
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,249
Alright,

606
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,540
but, with increased risk,

607
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,457
the expected quota
will have to increase too.

608
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,332
That's no problem at all.

609
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,749
Any better?

610
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:04,290
I didn't sleep all night,
this shit wound stings.

611
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:11,624
You gotta change location, I got
a fishing shack set up for you,

612
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:14,332
it sucks, but it's really hidden.

613
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:19,749
I'm not moving,
I'd like to see if they come.

614
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:24,915
They all know you're here,
it's not safe.

615
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:33,707
Cover her, please.

616
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:46,707
When should I go?

617
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:50,749
Today, then we fuck the Anacletis
up the ass.

618
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:55,665
They think we're freaked out,
their guard's down, and we fuck 'em!

619
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:57,915
We go after them tonight.

620
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:03,165
Do what you have to,
slaughter those shit gypsies!

621
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:09,332
Instead, nobody does a thing,
we do nothin'.

622
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:10,999
Why?

623
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:15,374
- I made a promise.
- To who?

624
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:17,790
To whoever the fuck I want.

625
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,707
We can't let them get away with this.

626
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:22,915
I make the decisions,

627
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:26,374
no more fuckin' around
or it all blows up.

628
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,082
Tell everyone to sit tight.

629
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:34,457
"I am this bread from Heaven",

630
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:36,707
said the Lord,

631
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,374
"If any man eats of this bread,
he shall live forever".

632
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,415
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

633
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:01,707
I heard, before he died,

634
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,665
Dagger was called by a piece of ass

635
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,082
who's in the big time,

636
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:11,124
one of those who cost.

637
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,749
That night she was in trouble,
so she called my brother.

638
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,499
That's the shit people
you hang with, right?

639
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,540
Know her?

640
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:25,124
Cat got your tongue?

641
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:30,332
- What do you want with her?
- Just a chat.

642
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,207
Do you know her, or not?

643
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,290
Where is she?

644
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:46,999
Tell me what you want to know,
I'll talk to her.

645
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:49,832
Want me pissed off in church?

646
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:53,249
Just tell me where she is,
don't drag your feet.

647
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:59,582
Tell me where I can find her.

648
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,290
She's at my place,

649
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:11,707
my apartment.

650
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,832
Lord, grant him eternal rest,

651
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:40,540
and let Your perpetual light
shine upon them...

652
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:42,999
O God, creator and redeemer

653
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,874
of all the faithful,

654
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:48,915
grant the souls of the deceased
universal remission of sins.

655
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,915
Seba!

656
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:01,249
I just want to know the name
of the guy who was with you.

657
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,415
What do you care?

658
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:10,457
He has nothing to do
with Dagger's death.

659
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:14,290
I say he called Number 8
to get rid of a witness.

660
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,249
He didn't call Number 8.

661
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:22,665
- How do you know?
- I just do.

662
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,874
Because I know him,

663
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:28,415
he'd never even think about it.

664
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:31,124
Give me his name, I'll do the rest.

665
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,832
I...

666
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,665
I guess you don't understand,
let's do it this way.

667
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,290
I ask a question and you answer
or I'll cut your sweet face.

668
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:50,165
- Who was it?
- He's a politician named Malgradi.

669
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:51,999
Malgradi?

670
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,749
I'll tell you all about him,
just don't hurt me.

671
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,832
I can't stand just staying here,

672
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,540
just the thought bores me.

673
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,457
Get up, Viola.

674
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,374
Go take a walk!

675
01:27:14,916 --> 01:27:17,415
Go out, I want to be alone!

676
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:35,749
Take me to Rome, I gotta get a wax.

677
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,540
- Pull over here.
- Here?

678
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,040
Hello.

679
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,832
Miss?

680
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:30,582
Excuse me,
do you have an appointment?

681
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:33,874
Stop, Miss, please.

682
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:35,999
Fuck off!

683
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,999
Can I help you?

684
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,790
Ehi!

685
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,374
Let's go.

686
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,499
C'mon!

687
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:42,207
Thanks for coming.

688
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:44,249
You never age,

689
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,207
I haven't seen you in ten years.

690
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:53,540
Stop this mess
between you and the Ostia guys.

691
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,707
I didn't make any mess.

692
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,707
To kill Number 8
you almost caused a massacre.

693
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:02,790
Let me remind you
he killed my brother

694
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:07,415
and a few hours later they wiped out
two kids I saw born.

695
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:10,124
No one can stop my revenge.

696
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:13,665
It's not the moment to have
a fucking war between you.

697
01:31:15,125 --> 01:31:17,915
I'm on a project
in the interest of the Families

698
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:19,749
and I need peace and quiet.

699
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,749
A project?

700
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,540
What project?

701
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:27,415
A project.

702
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:33,249
It must be a big deal
if you're in it,

703
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,999
how come I don't know nothin'?

704
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,915
Because it's in Ostia,

705
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,832
it involves politics, finance.

706
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:45,790
Till yesterday
you were loan sharks for nobodies.

707
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:50,082
Okay, but we've grown now
and they all respect us.

708
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:53,040
To your face, because you scare them,
but from behind?

709
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:57,624
They still call you shit gypsies.

710
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:01,790
You're still a couple of Shylocks.

711
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,415
I don't give a fuck
about that bullshit,

712
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:19,915
I just want to even up the corpses,

713
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:23,999
I'm only sorry I didn't kill
Number 8 like a dog.

714
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:27,832
I've told you what I had to.

715
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:32,457
Think twice before going against me

716
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:34,499
and the Families.

717
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,915
You shit!

718
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:03,832
You're a piece of shit!
You make me sick!

719
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,499
I trusted you! Fuck you!

720
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:29,165
In the parties you organize,
full of pussy and dirty politicians,

721
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:32,290
have you ever heard talk
of this project?

722
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:35,540
If you tell me who's behind it,
I'll give you your villa back.

723
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:43,040
Of course I've heard about it,
it's a huge project,

724
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:47,082
they want to make
a kind of Las Vegas in Ostia:

725
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,415
casinos...

726
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:52,749
A group has been pushing for months,
but approval is set for next year.

727
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,165
It's for now, they did something
to move up the project.

728
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:59,499
That's something I don't know.

729
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,915
To push it through,
they need a politician,

730
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:04,790
it might be this Malgradi.

731
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:06,040
Aida!

732
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,082
I'm working.

733
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:10,999
Malgradi?

734
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,082
Maybe.

735
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:17,374
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

736
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:24,415
Get out, all of you,
you've pissed me off!

737
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:29,040
You're driving me nuts!
Know what, I'm leaving!

738
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:31,249
Let's go, come with me.

739
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,915
Fuckin' bastards!

740
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:38,790
You're just fuckin' bastards!

741
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,499
Damned them!

742
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:54,457
You fuck off too!

743
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:56,374
You walking shitter!

744
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:17,665
I'd like to call on this politician,
know where he lives?

745
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,499
Yes.

746
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,415
- What do you mean by "call on"?
- A courtesy call.

747
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,540
Has he got a bodyguard?

748
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,707
He has a driver,
but no bodyguard, why?

749
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,665
Let's go, move.

750
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,165
This building, top floor.

751
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,040
- Perfect.
- He lives here.

752
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:48,915
Let's go!

753
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:52,499
- Give me time to walk away.
- You're coming too.

754
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:55,874
You talk better than me,
you talk to him.

755
01:35:56,083 --> 01:36:01,082
All the times we crossed paths
at parties? He'll recognize me!

756
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:03,999
See? He won't recognize you now.

757
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,665
Is this a joke?

758
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:11,540
Don't piss me off!

759
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:14,457
You can't go, you're in this like us.

760
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:19,040
You gotta get dirty,
so you don't go running to the cops.

761
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:35,874
What's going on?

762
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:38,499
Stop, you piece of shit!

763
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,874
What do you want?
Please don't hurt us!

764
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:43,999
Shut up!

765
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:46,249
Give them everything, please!

766
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:51,124
Now listen to what
this friend of mine says

767
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:54,165
and answer him straight.
Say you will.

768
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:56,082
Say you will!

769
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:57,790
- Yes.
- Louder!

770
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,124
- Yes.
- Come here.

771
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,999
C'mon!

772
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,290
The bill for the construction
of all those hotels,

773
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,499
the casinos and the Olympic
structures at the beaches of Ostia

774
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,457
is going to pass now, right?

775
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,040
We're talking about the "Waterfront",
right?

776
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:17,165
Is it true you're the one
getting this law passed?

777
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,665
- Is it you or not?
- I'm in it too.

778
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:24,999
- Mommy!
- Sweetie, stay away, it's nothing!

779
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,332
Shut up!

780
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:29,999
Look at me!

781
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:33,124
Do you know me? Get a good look!

782
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:36,332
- Know me? Know who I am?
- No, I don't.

783
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,082
I'm the brother
of the guy you had killed,

784
01:37:39,291 --> 01:37:41,124
Dagger's brother.

785
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,665
- I didn't do...
- Filthy rat!

786
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:47,082
He's gone
and you're still here breathing,

787
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:49,790
so listen up good:

788
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:52,582
you gotta block this fucking law

789
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:57,332
and tell your bosses at the top
we want a cut of 20%.

790
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,665
20%.

791
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:03,332
Tell 'em that, do like I say.

792
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:06,457
And just to be sure, lovely lady,

793
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:08,790
we're takin' this little toy,

794
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,249
and if you call the cops,

795
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:13,999
the toy could get broken.

796
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:16,290
It could get broken!

797
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,332
You're sure you just
put him to sleep?

798
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:37,290
Don't worry, he's all yours now.

799
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,249
Meaning?

800
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:43,207
Keep an eye on him and tell me
if there are problems.

801
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:44,832
But...

802
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,540
How do I figure into this?
I can't do it!

803
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:53,582
You're mine now, I'll do
what the fuck I want with you.

804
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:58,999
Now take me to your house,
we'll hide the kid there.

805
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,249
Pippo!

806
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:17,290
I have to talk to him.

807
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:20,540
- Good evening.
- Get lost.

808
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,665
- Who the fuck...
- Get lost!

809
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:26,082
Go, out!
You guys too, out!

810
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,207
What happened?

811
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:34,707
Manfredi Anacleti came to my house
and kidnapped my son,

812
01:39:34,916 --> 01:39:37,249
you said you'd protect me.

813
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:41,415
You didn't do a fucking thing,
so our deal is off!

814
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:45,582
I'll bring him home, just relax.

815
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:47,499
I won't 'just relax',

816
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:50,415
I don't believe anything or anyone
anymore, especially you,

817
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:54,374
you can shove the law up your ass,
shove it up your ass!

818
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:58,290
Pippo, you don't have to do anything,
just calm down

819
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,374
and listen to me.

820
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:04,332
Go home, go stay with your wife.

821
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:09,332
What did he ask in exchange?

822
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,540
He wants a cut of the deal,

823
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,457
20%.

824
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,415
I'll fix this thing for you,

825
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:25,374
nothing will happen to your son!

826
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:00,707
Don't get any closer.

827
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:02,415
C'mon!

828
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:05,540
Don't complain,

829
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:10,665
another guy would throw you off
the bridge for the shit you pulled.

830
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:16,165
What do you think?

831
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:20,332
We're playing cops and robbers,
havin' fun?

832
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:22,124
Not one fucking bit!

833
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:28,290
Any bullshit, the millions go
and we get years in jail.

834
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:33,165
- We can't always let it go.
- What the fuck do you know?

835
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:43,290
You made a mess!

836
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:46,790
I evened the score for you, didn't I?

837
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:50,082
Now it's World War 3
against the gypsies!

838
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:52,207
It's my fault?

839
01:41:53,333 --> 01:41:55,207
Yeah, it's your fault.

840
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:30,207
Careful!

841
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:31,832
Careful!

842
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:36,249
Go! On my three: one, two, pull!

843
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:40,207
Careful!

844
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:01,290
A grim chance discovery:

845
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,749
the body of a woman
was found this morning

846
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,332
at the bottom of a man-made lake
on the outskirts of Rome.

847
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:10,499
Giving the alarm
were the maintenance men

848
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:13,082
charged with emptying the basin.

849
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:16,082
Police are investigating,
little news has leaked out,

850
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:19,624
but it seems it's the body
of a very young woman.

851
01:43:19,833 --> 01:43:21,790
At first examination

852
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:26,082
the body may have been
in the water for 3 or 4 days,

853
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:28,915
but autopsy results are needed.

854
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:31,915
The man-made pool of water

855
01:43:32,166 --> 01:43:34,624
is located in the outskirts
to the south of the capital.

856
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:37,457
It's hard to find eyewitnesses,

857
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:40,832
the entire area is abandoned...

858
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:49,332
I know, what we did was shit.

859
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:54,165
So, how do we fix it?

860
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:58,124
I made an agreement with Manfredi,
he's in the project now

861
01:43:58,333 --> 01:44:01,249
and to pay for the deaths you
caused, he'll take part of your cut.

862
01:44:01,458 --> 01:44:04,165
- No way, this isn't their turf!
- I've already decided.

863
01:44:04,375 --> 01:44:06,040
That's just great,

864
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:10,415
but I've been working my ass off for
a year getting villas and lands sold.

865
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:17,082
I'd say you can just go to Manfredi
and say the deal's off.

866
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:22,790
And the junkie...
you gotta give her to me.

867
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,832
Hands off Viola, she's my stuff.

868
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:47,707
And don't call her that,
it bothers me.

869
01:44:50,166 --> 01:44:53,707
So, no junkie
and no deal with Manfredi?

870
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:02,332
Exactly.

871
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:07,999
Anyway, you know nothing moves
in Ostia without my okay

872
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:14,332
and that I'm not like my father,

873
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:18,290
so I don't give a fuck who you are,
who you were, what you represent,

874
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,749
you're a total nobody to me.

875
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:26,832
You were...

876
01:45:28,541 --> 01:45:30,415
But this is today!

877
01:45:34,166 --> 01:45:35,790
You were

878
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:39,582
and I am.

879
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:57,040
Move!

880
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:58,582
Gettin' some sun?

881
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:25,999
Have you all voted?

882
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:27,457
Have you?

883
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:29,540
May I close?

884
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,624

885
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:37,540
In favor 380, against 26.

886
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:40,749
The Chamber approves.

887
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,457
It passed!

888
01:50:43,833 --> 01:50:45,540
It passed.

889
01:51:09,166 --> 01:51:10,249
Hello?

890
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:17,082
Hello?

891
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:20,707
Hello.

892
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:24,707
It passed, give me back the doll.

893
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:28,290
Where...

894
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:30,540
Hello?

895
01:51:47,041 --> 01:51:49,124
All okay,

896
01:51:49,333 --> 01:51:51,415
the kid's fine.

897
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:56,415
My work's done, right?

898
01:51:56,625 --> 01:52:00,999
Tell me tomorrow,
I gotta go now, my family is waiting.

899
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:02,832
About that promise...

900
01:52:03,083 --> 01:52:04,915
I told you I'm goin' now.

901
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:07,874
It's just a second,
all I need are the keys.

902
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:11,415
I'll decide when I have a second
and now I don't.

903
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:14,915
What's that mean?
You've got one now!

904
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,832
I'm asking you for what's mine!

905
01:52:18,083 --> 01:52:20,374
I did it all, everything!

906
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,665
Raising your voice in my house?

907
01:52:22,875 --> 01:52:25,165
What's yours?

908
01:52:25,375 --> 01:52:29,582
I need the villa to work,
understand? You owe me!

909
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:32,415
Most I can do is offer you a job.

910
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:34,832
I don't want it, I want what's mine!

911
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:36,999
You don't have a fucking thing.

912
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:41,124
How the fuck can you be this way?

913
01:52:41,333 --> 01:52:43,332
You piece of shit!

914
01:52:43,583 --> 01:52:45,415
You rat, you scum!

915
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:48,665
Want to die?

916
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:52,124
Want to die?

917
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:02,582
Throw him out!

918
01:53:12,458 --> 01:53:15,457
- Well, satisfied?
- In your opinion?

919
01:53:15,916 --> 01:53:18,999
I hope yours is the start
of a political change of heart.

920
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:20,999
Go slow, a step at a time.

921
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:24,999
You sign the contract tomorrow,
I got you what you asked for.

922
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:27,832
You won't be sorry
for the choice you made.

923
01:53:28,666 --> 01:53:30,332
Congratulations!

924
01:53:30,541 --> 01:53:32,999
I didn't think you could pull it off.

925
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:35,540
You're not the only one.

926
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:38,624
Now can we stop warring in the Party?

927
01:53:38,833 --> 01:53:42,665
From tomorrow we work side by side,
even in your nice foundation.

928
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:44,832
I await you with open arms!

929
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:46,915
Let's have something to eat.

930
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:52,999
How are you?

931
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:55,665
Thanks for coming,
I'm glad to have you here.

932
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:59,665
I'd rather not be here,
I don't have good news.

933
01:54:00,541 --> 01:54:03,665
I just received a tip about you
from the DA's office.

934
01:54:03,875 --> 01:54:05,540
The DA's office?

935
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:07,999
They want to issue an arrest warrant

936
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,624
to the presidential offices
of Parliament.

937
01:54:11,333 --> 01:54:13,415
An arrest warrant?

938
01:54:14,166 --> 01:54:15,582
That's absurd.

939
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,874
Well, it concerns a dead girl.

940
01:54:19,666 --> 01:54:23,499
I got mixed up in that by chance,
I didn't even know the girl.

941
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:26,499
I'm not the one to convince!

942
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:29,124
They're investigating a night
of drugs, and sex with a minor.

943
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:31,207
Listen,

944
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:33,082
you know what?

945
01:54:33,583 --> 01:54:36,290
As things stand, in this country,

946
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,999
a guy like me,
who's gotten where he is,

947
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:42,915
and arrived where I've arrived,

948
01:54:43,166 --> 01:54:45,832
can tell the Judiciary to fuck off!

949
01:54:46,083 --> 01:54:48,999
I'm a Member of the Parliament
of the Republic of Italy.

950
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,082
They can shove it up their ass!

951
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,999
- You know I'm always here for you.
- Thank you.

952
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:59,332
This is nothing personal.

953
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:33,374
This is the Norwegian salmon
that our friend orders.

954
01:55:34,833 --> 01:55:36,040
Fuck!

955
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:38,707
- Everything okay?
- Excuse me.

956
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:12,499
At 8:30, after the Chamber's final
approval of the Budget...

957
01:56:12,708 --> 01:56:14,540
Could you turn up the radio?

958
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:17,290
The Prime Minister will present his
resignation to President Napolitano.

959
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:20,999
The Budget
has received final approval,

960
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,665
we await the resignation,

961
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,374
then the Head of State
will begin consultations.

962
01:56:25,625 --> 01:56:28,624
For the outgoing Prime Minister,
many meetings,

963
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:31,457
starting with one
with his probable successor.

964
01:56:31,666 --> 01:56:34,374
Annamaria dear, this is Malgradi,
would you put the Prim...

965
01:56:34,583 --> 01:56:36,665
Filippo Malgradi.

966
01:56:36,875 --> 01:56:39,165
Put the Prime Minister on, please?

967
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:43,540
I have to speak to him
before he leaves.

968
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:51,457
Annamaria, if we go to elections,
he's not risking alone, we all are.

969
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:56,832
If we go to early elections,
my seat has to be secure.

970
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:59,749
Five minutes and I'll be...

971
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,999
Damned fucking slut!

972
01:57:08,291 --> 01:57:12,999
A small crowd has gathered before
Montecitorio and Palazzo Chigi....

973
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:18,499
Dirty crooks!

974
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:21,874
What's all this?

975
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:24,499
Piazza Colonna is closed off,
people are standing, waiting,

976
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,582
their eyes
on the entrance to Palazzo Chigi.

977
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:27,999
What's happening?

978
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:30,332
Good evening, it's all closed-off.

979
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,415
Look...

980
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,457
- The Prime Minister's waiting for me.
- Sorry, it's all blocked.

981
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:56,290
Sorry, excuse me.

982
01:57:59,875 --> 01:58:03,499
Resign, resign...

983
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:10,915
Excuse me, I must get through!

984
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,249
Excuse me, sorry!

985
01:58:14,458 --> 01:58:17,374
Malgradi, you crook!

986
01:58:17,583 --> 01:58:20,499
Go home, at your age.

987
01:58:21,916 --> 01:58:23,999
Let me through, please!

988
01:58:24,875 --> 01:58:26,082
Excuse me!

989
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:28,499
Don't shout, I can hear you!

990
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:31,165
No need to yell, I can hear you!

991
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:32,832
Go home!

992
01:58:33,041 --> 01:58:34,749
Excuse me, sorry.

993
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,999
Will you let me through?

994
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:48,582
The Prime Minister is waiting for me!

995
01:58:49,083 --> 01:58:52,249
Will you let me through?
I must see the Prime Minister!

996
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,707
Mr. Prime Minister!

997
01:58:54,916 --> 01:58:56,915
Mr. Prime Minister, we have to talk!

998
01:58:57,125 --> 01:58:58,999
They're attacking us!

999
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:01,374
Mr. President, you mustn't resign!

1000
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:03,707
The Judiciary, Mr. Prime Minister!

1001
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,290
I have to be re-elected!

1002
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,707
It doesn't matter.

1003
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,457
Anyway, he got the law passed,
didn't he?

1004
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:38,249
If there are new elections,

1005
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:40,457
we'll find a politician,

1006
02:03:42,083 --> 02:03:43,915
maybe on the other side.

1007
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:45,332
Yeah.

1008
02:03:59,458 --> 02:04:01,082
Are you leaving already?

1009
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:02,707
Yes.

1010
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:06,707
But I'll come by tomorrow.

1011
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:10,457
Mom, the cake?
You didn't even taste it,

1012
02:04:10,666 --> 02:04:13,165
I went all the way
to the Kosher shop to get it.

1013
02:04:13,791 --> 02:04:16,290
I don't like anything anymore.

1014
02:04:17,083 --> 02:04:18,790
You're tellin' me!

1015
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:22,915
I have to make such an effort.

1016
02:04:27,708 --> 02:04:29,624
It's raining so hard.

1017
02:04:30,541 --> 02:04:33,832
- Wait a while.
- I'm all covered up.

1018
02:04:34,583 --> 02:04:36,874
- Want me to eat some?
- Just a little.

1019
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:39,790
- How much? A lot or a little?
- A little.

1020
02:04:41,666 --> 02:04:43,165
Like this?

1021
02:04:45,041 --> 02:04:47,540
- Are you glad?
- Good girl.

1022
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:49,582
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

1023
02:05:31,666 --> 02:05:33,874
You're making a mistake.

1024
02:05:36,708 --> 02:05:38,124
Move.

1025
02:06:14,875 --> 02:06:17,499
I want to make a deal.

1026
02:06:17,916 --> 02:06:19,832
A deal?

1027
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,040
- With me?
- Yes, with you.

1028
02:06:27,125 --> 02:06:29,124
Next time.

1029
02:10:01,166 --> 02:10:03,374
For my father

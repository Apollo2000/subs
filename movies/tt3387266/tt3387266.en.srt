'My dear nephew...

3
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,511
'...as your uncle and guardian,

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,678

5
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,591
'that is now time for you

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,315
'To use the knowledge that you have
gained from your time in England

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,558

8
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,637

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,439
<i>'Pula.'</i>

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,792
Seretse, are you okay? Teach him a lesson.

14
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,354
You monkey!

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,439
You didn't see that coming.

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,759
- That was not a fair fight.
- You were too predictable.

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,272
Come on. We'll be late for class.

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,438
# I'm going nowhere, getting no place

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,717
# Making no time with nobody

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,115
# No, baby

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,436
# Nobody, but you...

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
Can you draw up my dress?

23
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,953
I saw Teddy at the bus stop.

24
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,316
He's been so down,
since you ended it with him.

25
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,717
Oh, well, he knows it's for the best.
We wanted different things.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,198
Is that what you're wearing tonight?

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,789
Muriel, I can't go
to the Missionary Society dance.

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,759
- They're your friends, not mine.
- Oh, come on.

29
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,918
'Indians will go to their beds
as subjects of the Queen,

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,440
'and awake to a new day.'

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,718
The next day they'll awake to wish
we were running the place again.

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,760
Bye.

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,318
- See you later.
- Are you going, Ruth?

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,112
- Yes, Dad.
- What for?

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,594
She's keeping me company.

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,113
- Well, mind yourselves.
- Hmm, don't come back a missionary.

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,999
Ah, Muriel! Thank you.
We are a little short this evening.

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,351
Oh, I've brought my sister, Ruth.

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,318
How nice of you to come.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,880
Oh!

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,595
- Would you like to dance with me?
- Of course, Ade.

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,399
It would never happen. It's futile.

43
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,045
So, there'll be bloodshed.

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,959
A fight doesn't always
have to be about violence.

45
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,237
Understand the imperialist mind,

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,880
and you can outmanoeuvre it.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,992
Isn't that why we are all here?

48
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,875
There is an Africa that doesn't have
to be about white or black exclusion.

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,310
An Africa that is about
unity, inclusion and equality.

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,236
That's the original idealist!

51
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,434
Would you like to dance?

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
Thank you very much.

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,192
What's this song supposed to be?

54
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,750
I don't know,
but they are utterly butchering it.

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,600
I've been trying to work out the melody
since they began.

56
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:01,916
Sorry. I...

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,437
I do love jazz, but I've never trusted
an Englishman to play it.

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,193
Would you like to dance?

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,671
Rather lively, wasn't it?

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,871
It was good fun. Where's he from?

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,957
Oh, everybody adores Seretse.

62
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,679
He's over from Bechuanaland.

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,395
- What's he studying?
- Law. Like the rest.

64
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,917
Just looking at this claim. A small error,
if you could just do it again...

65
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,514
Hmm.

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,917
Oh, there's a parcel for you over there.

67
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,993
Who is Mr Khama?

68
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,435
Oh, my goodness.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,390
# I'm gone buzzin'...

70
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,914
Ruth!

71
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,758
He's invited me to a dance.

72
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,756
He says he can get another ticket
if you'd like to take me.

73
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,111
I wouldn't like to take you.

74
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,551
I haven't danced like that
since I left home.

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,831
Well, then I'm so pleased
we're doing this.

76
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,590
I'm so pleased to have agreed to come to
a dance with a man I know nothing about!

77
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,559
Who are you, Mr Khama?

78
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,799
Well, I, uh...

79
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,837
I grew up with my little sister, Naledi.

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,874
Our mother and father died
when... I was three.

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,354
Oh, that's...

82
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,716
Oh, no, no, no.
We, we were raised by my uncle.

83
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,912
He's like a father to us.
We've been very fortunate.

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,357
How about you? If I...

85
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,116
If I were to ask you to tell me something
about you I couldn't possibly guess?

86
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,835
We were evacuated to the countryside,
Muriel and I,

87
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,600
but I couldn't bear the boredom.

88
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
So I asked them
to take me at Friston, the airfield.

89
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,439
I drove the crash ambulance for them.

90
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,871
Ferrying the injured fighter pilots.

91
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,592
I looked it up, you know, your country.

92
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,833
The size of France
and 121,000 inhabitants.

93
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,191
And one of the poorest countries
in the world.

94
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,674
Is that right?

95
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,431
We asked for the protection
of Queen Victoria.

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,195
And she agreed. Eventually.

97
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,950
It was that, or face invasion
from a racialist South Africa.

98
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,796
- Sounds like no choice at all.
- What is the saying?

99
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,630
"No man is free,
who is not master of himself."

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,753
I wish we could see the stars.

101
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,716
They take your breath away
back in Bechuanaland.

102
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,396
It never fails to astonish me.

103
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,432
You are cold.

104
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,913
We should stop here.

105
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,990
My father, he wouldn't approve.

106
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,672
I'm just two streets away.
Can we do this again?

107
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,554
I mean, meet?

108
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,239
Is that too forward of me?

109
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,714
No.

110
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,311
- No, it...
- What?

111
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,795
Queen Victoria...

112
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,751
The man who negotiated for
her protection of Bechuanaland...

113
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,074
he was my grandfather.

114
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,714
A king.

115
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,553
I am his heir.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,232
For more than 20 years, my uncle
has been on the throne as regent

117
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,352
preparing me to rule.

118
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,153
My education is now complete,

119
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,397
and it is time for me to return.

120
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,957
Oh. I see.

121
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,876
Thank you. Thank you for explaining.

122
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,313
Not simply disappearing.

123
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,919
I quite understand.

124
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,919
I have had a wonderful evening.

125
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,200
Ruth.

126
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,431
No, I-I-I don't think you do understand.

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,912
I don't know what happened tonight.

128
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,795
But I do know that I would hate to walk
away from you here in this moment,

129
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,957
knowing that I wouldn't see you again.

130
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,360
Well, then you must.

131
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,679
See me again, I mean.

132
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,191
Uh, Mr Khama?

133
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,240
Thank you.

134
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,755
Father will hate him on sight.

135
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,315
He's clever than him and he's black.

136
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,991
- Oh!
- Yes, yes, yes!

137
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,119
Have you ever been in love?

138
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,394
No.

139
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,109
And then Ruth Williams came along.

140
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,034
Look, it's a coon.

141
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,594
Out of the zoo for a night.

142
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,080
- Scum!
- Ignore him.

143
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,317
Look who's talking! Cheap slut!

144
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,159
- That's enough.
- Yeah?

145
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,556
- Seretse...
- Don't!

146
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,600
- Ruth...
- Oi! Get your black hands off what's ours!

147
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,074
I'm not yours!

148
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,717
Stop it! Get off him.

149
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,797
Seretse...

150
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,400
Black bastard!

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,914
Move back!

152
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,360
Savage!

153
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
Oh, Ruth.

154
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,869
They're yobs.
You can't let them get to you.

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,038
No, I'm not even giving them
a second thought.

156
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,360
Then what is it?

157
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,354
It scares me a bit.

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,719
The way he makes me feel.

159
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,195
Ruth, he has to go back
to his own country.

160
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,754
I know.

161
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,875
Just let me enjoy it while it lasts.

162
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,798
- Am I late?
- No. No, not at all.

163
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,274
Is something the matter?

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,120
I have been... thinking
about my responsibilities

165
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,391
back home in Bechuanaland.

166
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,880
There is so much that I need to do there.

167
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,640
But I know that I will never
achieve anything worthwhile...

168
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,630
...if I leave my heart here.

169
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,910
Uh, I'm not asking for an answer
this, this very second.

170
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,200
All I, all I ask of you is that you...

171
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,157
...go away and, and think about it,

172
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,274
because, uh, there...
there is a lot to think about.

173
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,832
And...

174
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,996
I don't need to think about it.

175
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
I know I love you.

176
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,193
And I know what you're asking.

177
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,519
What it means.

178
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,314
And yes.

179
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,079
Yes.

180
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,714
Yes, Seretse, I will marry you.

181
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,720
White? British? Oh, God.

182
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,513
And she's a salesman's daughter!

183
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,758
I don't care if her mother sells fish
in the market! I love her!

184
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
Aren't you supposed
to ask for your uncle's consent

185
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
before you ask for her hand?

186
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,514
And your people?

187
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,160
'Dear Uncle...

188
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,750
'...I realise this won't please you.

189
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,872
'You and the tribe won't like it.

190
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,234
'I have asked an Englishwoman to marry me.

191
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
'A white woman.'

192
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,435
It will not happen.

193
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,394
It will.

194
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,311
What in God's name is wrong with you?

195
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,316
At least Muriel
only wants to convert them!

196
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,390
I've said yes.

197
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,716
- She might change her mind, George.
- She won't!

198
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,916
Mum, I've met the man
I want to spend my life with.

199
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,760
And how many other wives
do you think he's already got, eh?

200
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,360
- You disgust me.
- George, don't.

201
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,352
You think about this, Ruth.

202
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,912
You marry a black,
you make it impossible for us.

203
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,072
For your mother, for Muriel.

204
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,434
You may choose
a life of insults and shame...

205
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,914
...but what about us?

206
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,034
We've only ever loved you.

207
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,520
Father...

208
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,919
I can't see you again.

209
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,434
Not if you choose him.

210
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,354
This... is not how I wanted it to be.

211
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,318
You separated from your family.

212
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,273
I have fears, Ruth.

213
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,790
Not just about this, but... my uncle.

214
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,754
You can't take us all this way
to tell me you have fears!

215
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,360
Not for me, for you!

216
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,955
For everything
I am asking you to sacrifice.

217
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,716
Can you... even imagine a life in Africa?

218
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,754
Yes.

219
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,358
We'll take it moment by moment, won't we?

220
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,920
Together.

221
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,875
Morning, ladies.

222
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,390
An early tea break for you all.

223
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,879
I need to speak to Miss Williams.

224
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,999
Ruth, uh, there's a gentleman to see you.

225
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,439
Good morning.

226
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,398
I'll leave you to it.

227
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,957
Sir Alistair Canning.

228
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,511
I am the British Government
representative in southern Africa.

229
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,235
And yet I find myself in London today.

230
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,839
Because it is my duty to inform you

231
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,395
that Mr Seretse Khama
has been gravely mistaken

232
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,598
in believing he may take you as his wife.

233
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,797
A marriage between you cannot take place.

234
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,432
A chief cannot simply come to London,

235
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,832
and pluck a girl out of a typing pool.

236
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
I'm not a typist.

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,153
Any union between you and Mr Khama
will have implications

238
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,036
for the not-insignificant neighbouring
countries of Bechuanaland.

239
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,429
Not least South Africa,

240
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,629
the prime minister of which is currently
enshrining into law the policy of...

241
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,639
The policy of apartheid.

242
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,194
Do you know this word?

243
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
No.

244
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,119
No. Well, it is this...

245
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,273
The black must live separately
from the white.

246
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,034
He must attend
his own school, hospital, church,

247
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,399
and he must never conjoin
with a white woman.

248
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,874
Your entry in Africa with him

249
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,756
would be seen as a flagrant disregard
for the current political climate.

250
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,437
It would be an act more powerful
than your limited experience

251
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,592
will allow you to comprehend.

252
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,275
We have already heard the presidents
of South Africa, southwest Africa

253
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,232
and the Rhodesias.

254
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,149
Yet all demanding that
this marriage not take place.

255
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,954
As a matter of diplomatic necessity.

256
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,794
I take it you need no more from me

257
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,230
to confirm that
you will not marry this man.

258
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,831
I will confirm nothing of the kind.

259
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,793
Have you no shame?

260
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,638
The British administration may dictate
many things in my country,

261
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,956
but they will not dictate who I marry.

262
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,680
They are trying to define us,
based on their rules,

263
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,031
their idea of the world,
and how they see it.

264
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,317
Seretse, do you hear yourself?

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,993
These men are at the very top
of government. They're powerful.

266
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,629
- Muriel, stop interfering.
- Stop it! Both of you!

267
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,234
Ruth...

268
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,277
Father won't talk to you.

269
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,040
You're called a whore in the street,
and now this.

270
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,116
You know how much I love Seretse.

271
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,196
But you don't have to do this.

272
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,520
Muriel, I've never wanted anything
like I want this.

273
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
Enter.

274
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,234
Sir.

275
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,920
Mr Khama.

276
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,680
Good morning.

277
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,434
Sir Alistair Canning.

278
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,829
How do you do?

279
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,636
I believe you've met my fiancée,
Ruth Williams.

280
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,160
- Indeed.
- Sir.

281
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,430
We are told you can provide us
with some information, Sir Alistair.

282
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,159
Well, if I can,

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,957
then I most certainly will.

284
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,118
Who exactly has asked you to
interfere with my wish to marry?

285
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,273
I will tell you... exactly.

286
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,711
I received advice
from the Archbishop of Canterbury,

287
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,834
who was instructed by the Secretary
of State for Commonwealth Affairs,

288
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,398
who was himself instructed
by the solicitor, Douglas Buchanan,

289
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,791
who was, in turn,
instructed by his client,

290
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,992
your uncle, Tshekedi Khama.

291
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,320
So, you see...

292
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,952
...everyone here, and in southern Africa,

293
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,232
is acting entirely according
to the wishes... of your uncle.

294
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,880
I knew he wouldn't take it well,
that he'd be angry with me,

295
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,310
but why is he allowing himself
to be used by them?

296
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,750
It's only you and I
who want us to be together.

297
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,280
No one else.

298
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,075
You are the only one
I want to spend my life with.

299
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,989
There's nothing in law
that says we cannot marry.

300
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,713
Have you got the rings?

301
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,839
It is with pleasure
I pronounce you man and wife.

302
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,837
May I offer you my congratulations?

303
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,918
Thank you so much.

304
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
Mrs Khama...

305
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,240
Mrs Khama, do you intend
to learn the native language?

306
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,313
- I will try, yes.
- And I will give her plenty of help.

307
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,594
Mr Khama, I hear your tribe are rebelling
against you bringing a white queen home,

308
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,598
according to South Africa this morning.

309
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,229
South Africa has her own agenda.

310
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,431
Perhaps you should report on that.

311
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,193
Thank you. That'll be all.

312
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,194
Rebelling?

313
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,080
It's exaggeration. It has to be.

314
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,194
'Bechuanaland chief from the southern
African British protectorate...'

315
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,358
'Office girl, Ruth Khama,
will travel to Africa...'

316
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,160
'Bechuanaland will meet
their new queen...'

317
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,070
Mrs Khama... welcome.

318
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,116
Will your family be coming to visit?

319
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:17,907
Sir.

320
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,237
Sir Alistair Canning
wants to meet before I see my uncle.

321
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Good afternoon, sir.

322
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,271
I have special dispensation as the king.

323
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,676
But we use a different entrance.

324
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,320
Mr and Mrs Khama.

325
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,431
Welcome, Mrs Khama.

326
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,353
Thank you.

327
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,672
We didn't want to leave it too long
before Ruth could see her new home.

328
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,711
What would you like to drink, Mrs Khama?

329
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,593
Gin and lime would be lovely.

330
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,837
We have lemonade for you, Mr Khama.

331
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,230
You are aware of the prohibition
of alcohol for blacks in Bechuanaland?

332
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,992
Well, if my husband is having lemonade,
then I will have lemonade.

333
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,992
Ah, here he is! It's our new district
commissioner, Mr Rufus Lancaster.

334
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,600
How do you do, Mr Khama?

335
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,074
A pleasure.

336
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,872
- Mrs Khama.
- How do you do?

337
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,112
Let me pour you that lemonade.

338
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,872
I've asked Mr Lancaster along

339
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,231
to give you an assessment of affairs
in Serowe,

340
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,240
in light of your meeting at the kgotla,
Mr Khama.

341
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,596
You would like to tell me
how my people are feeling?

342
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,509
80% of the people
support your uncle's refusal

343
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,235
to accept your wife
as queen of your tribe.

344
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,839
May I ask how you arrived
at that figure, Mr Lancaster?

345
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,271
We are recommending that you resign
any claim to the chieftainship,

346
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,313
and that you announce that fact
to your tribe with a meeting.

347
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,274
The kgotla, Sir Alistair,

348
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,120
is the place where
our tribal decisions are made,

349
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,677
where every man has his say.

350
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,397
There, and only there, can the support or
dissatisfaction of my people be measured.

351
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,031
Where they will decide whether
they wish for me to remain king.

352
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,671
I believe you call it democracy.

353
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,036
Mr Khama, you understand
the risks you're taking.

354
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,590
You're forcing the tribe to take sides.

355
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,757
This could cause a dangerous divide.

356
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,759
Make your country... ungovernable.

357
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,116
And it would open up South Africa's
claim to annex Bechuanaland.

358
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,270
Britain has long prevented it.

359
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,159
But for how much longer?

360
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,997
Lancaster just about got
through the evening

361
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,755
without calling me an ungrateful nigger.

362
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,559
Can they really hand over
an entire country just like that?

363
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,114
They wouldn't risk it.

364
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,518
Malan's regime has very little support
from the British public.

365
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,119
But you're worried.

366
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,710
You know, I've seen the news reels.
I know what's happening in South Africa.

367
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,793
It's poison,
and it's already affecting you here.

368
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,429
That sign outside.

369
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,239
You have those in England too.

370
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,635
I know.

371
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,795
No blacks, no Irish, no dogs.

372
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,871
But I didn't expect it
in your own country.

373
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,560
Come.

374
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,797
It's your first night in Bechuanaland.
I don't want you to be sad.

375
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,160
Let us not allow
the ugliness of this world

376
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,999
to take our joy away from us.

377
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,915
Another!

378
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,033
Oh...

379
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,431
- Shh, shh.
- What?

380
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,116
Can you hear that?
It's the music from the bar.

381
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,439
Dance with me.

382
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,237
Whoo! Oh!

383
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,314
What...? Ah!

384
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,034
My home.

385
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,360
Our home.

386
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,911
White woman.

387
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,353
Is that your mother?

388
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,720
Uh, no.
No, that is my Uncle Tshekedi's mother.

389
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,720
That is me on the day he became a regent.

390
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,357
Uncle... this is Ruth.

391
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,716
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

392
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,718
I will speak to my nephew alone.

393
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,679
Refreshments will be provided
for her in the house.

394
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,911
Over two decades of preparing you
to be our king,

395
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,912
and this is how you face me.

396
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,799
A white woman by your side.

397
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,191
- Uncle...
- Are you trying to tear us apart?

398
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,319
I am Naledi, Seretse's sister.

399
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,639
Naledi.

400
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,594
- Seretse's told me so much.
- Please don't.

401
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,279
Why would you do this to us?

402
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,193
To yourself?

403
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,757
Be somewhere and be something
that makes no sense to you?

404
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,598
Look at them.

405
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,598
They are fighting because of you.

406
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,440
I mean you no harm.

407
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,115
Do you understand what mother,
<i>mother,</i> of our nation means?

408
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,676
I married Seretse's uncle
knowing my responsibility.

409
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,437
That one day Seretse's wife
would be chosen from our nation,

410
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,432
and I would hand over to her.

411
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,279
We have waited years for the day
we would see her rule by his side.

412
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,315
Your first duty is to your people.

413
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
Your nation.

414
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,273
Seretse, you're a son to me.

415
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,592
Please... be my son.

416
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,560
I will entertain you in my home,
if that is my husband's wish.

417
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,516
But don't insult us.

418
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,199
It's...

419
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,198
...audacious of you to come here,

420
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,999
and present yourself married,

421
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,629
as if it were your right to be our queen.

422
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,358
Who do you think will accept you? The men?

423
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,278
- I...
- Us? The women?

424
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,590
To have a white woman who we must love

425
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,633
and trust and respect as our sovereign?

426
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,113
Whoo.

427
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,233
You belong to the whites,
but they won't want you, either.

428
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,873
You insult us all.

429
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,159
Let him go.

430
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,554
We need him more than you.

431
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,989
You will obey me,
and you will divorce her!

432
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,674
No, sir.

433
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,875
I will not.

434
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,238
Then listen to me, boy.

435
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,236
You will stand up
in the kgotla tomorrow...

436
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,836
...and you will renounce your birthright.

437
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,871
And any right to the throne.

438
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,238
We've misjudged this, haven't we?

439
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,513
Would the British have accepted it

440
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,556
if Princess Elizabeth had come here,
and taken one of us

441
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,512
as her husband?

442
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,839
A negro king of England. Can you imagine?

443
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,311
She would have been refused!

444
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,397
Every right on her claim to the throne
removed from her!

445
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,840
Just as we must refuse my nephew here!

446
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,077
If he does not divorce this white woman!

447
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,397
Seretse... honour your people.

448
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,276
Do not belittle your kingdom!

449
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,676
Over there in the royal burial
ground lies my father...

450
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,239
...his father and his father before him.

451
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,237
If I had married a woman
of my uncle's choosing,

452
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,189
he would, this day,
proudly be confirming me king,

453
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,232
and the line of royal succession,

454
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,714
centuries old,

455
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,911
would remain unbroken.

456
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,156
I am proud of my lineage,

457
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,670
and I respect my uncle.

458
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,351
But he does not have the right
to decide on my succession to the throne.

459
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,552
I believe the people, and only the people,

460
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,631
should have that right.

461
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,515
My commitment to you has never diminished.

462
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,112
But I am told that you no longer
wish for me to honour my duty

463
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,879
to serve you as your king

464
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,560
because of the colour of the wife
I have chosen.

465
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,916
South Africa's racialist disease

466
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,916
has infected
all our neighbouring countries and us.

467
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,434
Look around you.

468
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,073
Our schools, hospitals, churches

469
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,796
all segregated in practice, if not in law.

470
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,719
Are we now to uphold the abomination
that is apartheid in our own kgotla?

471
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,153
The very same abomination that
has been oppressing us for decades?

472
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,118
Is this to be the future for our Africa?

473
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,631
We should not be fighting for segregation.

474
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,434
We should be fighting for equality.

475
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,240
That is where we should be
focusing our minds,

476
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,673
not on the wife I have chosen,
who means you no harm,

477
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,713
whose only apparent crime

478
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,991
has been to fall in love with me!

479
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,835
And mine to fall in love with her.

480
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,159
I cannot serve you without her by my side.

481
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,516
But I cannot force you to accept this.

482
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,396
Africa can never be free,

483
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,270
until all those who live in her,
white and black,

484
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,192
recognise that race must have
no bearing on equality and justice.

485
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,517
I am ready to serve you

486
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,109
because I love my people.

487
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,438
I love this land!

488
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,558
But I love my wife.

489
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,754
And I shall respect your will.

490
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,030
Those who want Seretse as king,

491
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,719
raise your hand.

492
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,800
<i>Pula! Pula!</i>

493
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,597
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

494
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,999
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

495
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,152
<i>Pula, pula, pula, pula.</i>

496
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,549
Ma, what are they shouting?

497
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,600
<i>Pula.</i>

498
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,674
It means "rain".

499
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,831
They're celebrating.

500
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,112
<i>Pula, pula, pula!</i>

501
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,276
Accept the vote and conclude the meeting.

502
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,672
Uncle!

503
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,594
Uncle!

504
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,875
Uncle.

505
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,913
The British are not your allies.

506
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,677
I know exactly what I'm doing,
and why I'm doing it.

507
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,200
Do you, Seretse?

508
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,596
Do you think she is your ally?

509
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,600
Your grandfather had no option,
but to allow outsiders to rule us,

510
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,437
but you... you bring this one
to rule our tribe by choice.

511
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,035
What you are doing
is demeaning to your own people.

512
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,958
This has nothing to do with love!

513
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,592
So next time you look in the mirror,
ask yourself this:

514
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,198
Were you not a king,
would she ever even looked at you?

515
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,193
Now she knows there's
no Buckingham Palace in Serowe,

516
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,711
how long before the village dust
gets in her eyes?

517
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,358
Now you will see how an empire
defends itself, Mr Khama.

518
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,318
Where will he go?

519
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,357
He will start a new settlement somewhere.

520
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,352
It's our way to avoid conflict.

521
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,596
We stay apart, but we stay at peace.

522
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,275
'Let me show you the blood lilies.'

523
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,438
- Something to discuss?
- Indeed.

524
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,831
Come. We shall leave the men to it.

525
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,954
My wife is capable of hearing what the
commissioner has to say, Mrs Lancaster.

526
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,114
As you wish.

527
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,150
Though what I have to say
she may not want to hear.

528
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,600
Oh, but I do.

529
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,354
There is going to be a delay

530
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,592
in our acknowledgment
of your position as tribal chief.

531
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,679
Your uncle is questioning your legitimacy.

532
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,838
There is nothing to be questioned
in the decision of the kgotla.

533
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,840
The approval of the kgotla
was for your position as chief,

534
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,553
not the suitability of your wife.

535
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,230
I made it quite clear that a vote
for me was also a vote for my wife.

536
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,352
They knew what they were voting for.

537
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,000
Did they?

538
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,716
Mr Khama, Sir Alistair Canning
wants to be fair about this.

539
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,915
It should reassure you to know
that he has appointed

540
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,676
the Chief Justice of the High Commission
Territory, Sir Walter Harragin,

541
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,359
to conduct an enquiry.

542
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,234
Into what? My wife?

543
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,592
An enquiry that will prove that
our marriage has riled South Africa?

544
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,592
South Africa is not the issue.

545
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,350
Sir Alistair looked me square in the eye
in London and said that it was.

546
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,872
Well, then you clearly misunderstood.

547
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,798
Seretse, do I look like a fool to you?

548
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,274
Not in the slightest.

549
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,435
Commissioner,
to keep up this false pretence

550
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,116
that this is not about Great Britain's
fears of South Africa's discontent

551
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,199
and what that might mean for you
and your government...

552
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,120
...is very distasteful.

553
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,360
Mr Khama, neither you or I are privy
to discussions of the British Cabinet.

554
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,397
But one thing you can be sure of

555
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,280
are the conversations
that I am having with your uncle.

556
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,996
And it is he who demanded this enquiry.

557
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,351
Hey. Ooh.

558
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,758
Did I ever tell you I didn't
just marry you for your good looks?

559
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,320
Liar.

560
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,760
Malaria.

561
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,791
Six cattle died here ten days ago.

562
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,872
Then three white men came,
and started drilling with a machine.

563
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,439
We thought they had come here to
help us find water, but they ignored us.

564
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,798
I need help with some shopping.
Can you come?

565
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,400
It's okay.

566
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,551
Let's get you the things you need.

567
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,074
Um...

568
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,400
Cornflour.

569
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,833
Cornflour, <i>mma.</i>

570
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,320
I missed you.

571
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,590
Kwashiorkor, malnutrition, malaria.

572
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,195
The hospitals can't cope with the demands.

573
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,599
So what can we do?

574
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,839
We depend on the reports the district
commissioner sends to London.

575
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,000
And they do nothing.
There's no money left after the war.

576
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,394
They never gave us money before the war.

577
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,995
We pay the taxes they demand,
and we get nothing.

578
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,920
Mr Nash.

579
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,076
What is keeping you here so long?

580
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,596
It's a beautiful country.

581
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,752
I should be flattered,
but I don't believe you.

582
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,151
- The story?
- Oh, is that what I am? A story?

583
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,279
It's okay. I'm not offended.

584
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,153
I thought I'd catch the film.

585
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,920
Only whites allowed I hear.

586
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,072
And kings.

587
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,795
- Even black ones.
- Why do you come?

588
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,400
To something like this?

589
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,358
There's not a black face in sight
outside of the waiters and maids.

590
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,360
Defiance.

591
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,191
The knowledge that one day
things will change because they have to.

592
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,674
And it has to start somewhere.

593
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,399
Mrs Khama... how nice to see you again.

594
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,354
You too.

595
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,314
Thank you, my love.

596
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,155
I read something of yours
in "World Reporter".

597
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,714
An old copy.

598
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,590
About the Chinese civil war.
Was impressive.

599
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,436
Hmm, it's true,
I'm just a burnt-out war correspondent

600
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,319
trying to find another story.

601
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,872
Well, there's one, right there.

602
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,917
Drilling in the Naledi Valley.

603
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,120
Mineral testing.

604
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,272
What? Copper? Diamonds?

605
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,754
I don't know,

606
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,914
but I imagine it wouldn't be difficult
for someone like you to find out.

607
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,956
The valley stretches across
into South Africa.

608
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,597
It's been lucrative that side.
Now they've started exploring our side.

609
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,200
Without our permission.

610
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,839
But with the British Government's?

611
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,314
Presumably.

612
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,033
You know what a discovery
would mean to this country, to my people.

613
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,277
It would change everything.

614
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,232
But only if our interests are secured.

615
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,591
I can do that if I'm ahead of the game.

616
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,869
And if I have enough information.

617
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,194
Enjoy the film.

618
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,591
I have some rather good news for you.

619
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,160
A word after the film.

620
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,918
Mr Khama, don't you want
to hear the good news?

621
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,759
We have tickets for you.

622
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,034
Tickets?

623
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,120
For what?

624
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,678
The government want to rectify the matter
of your chieftainship face to face.

625
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,595
In London.

626
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,798
Dealing with such matters long distance,
it slows the process down,

627
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,594
which isn't good for you, and your people.

628
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,752
So we thought a month would suffice.

629
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,280
Oh.

630
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,551
It would give you, Mrs Khama,
an opportunity

631
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,592
to see your friends, see your family.

632
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,954
You shouldn't come.

633
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,715
They want me here and you in London.

634
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,991
That is why you must be here,
and me in London.

635
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,552
I have to go back to resolve this.
We don't have a choice in that.

636
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,593
But if you come with me,
they won't allow you back.

637
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,832
Why else would they purchase you
a trip to visit your family?

638
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,715
You can't just go.
Why would I be here by myself?

639
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,349
Seretse, I gave up everything
to be with you, but I can't do this alone.

640
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,157
I promise as long as I live
you will never be alone.

641
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,239
But if you leave with me...

642
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,995
...then I can never return because
they will force you to stay in England,

643
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,719
and I will not return without you.

644
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,194
What the devil is this?

645
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,593
My people have decided
that my wife should stay.

646
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,430
Tell your people to remove themselves
from this gate immediately.

647
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,434
Unfortunately, in the absence
of your decision

648
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,319
on my appointment as the king,

649
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,750
I don't have any power over them.

650
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,231
Mrs Khama, I strongly urge you
to reconsider and come with us.

651
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,873
My husband has told you. He's...

652
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,238
It's not within his power
to order these people to do anything,

653
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,714
and as a woman...

654
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,239
...well, I have no say
in the matter whatsoever.

655
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,711
So, alas, I'm powerless to help you.

656
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,274
- That was very good.
- Thank you.

657
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,880
I'm ready, Commissioner.

658
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,552
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

659
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,600
Enter.

660
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,431
Ah, Mr Khama. Good afternoon.

661
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,877
I'm grateful to you for returning
to London. Do please take a seat.

662
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,439
I'm intrigued to know
why you've brought me all this way.

663
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,239
The government summoned me here last week

664
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,431
upon receipt of the Harragin report.

665
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,514
They have reviewed it and considered
the conflict between you and your uncle.

666
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,837
And after taking all things into account,

667
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,758
we have concluded

668
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,958
that you should be exiled
from Bechuanaland

669
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,753
for a period of five years.

670
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,551
Call it a period of reflection.

671
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,276
After five years, we will, of course,
review the situation.

672
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,716
But in the meantime,

673
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,959
we are able to offer you a position
in the administration of Jamaica.

674
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,392
And we will, of course, make sure
we accommodate your dear wife.

675
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,237
Jamaica is not my country.

676
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,272
There are some similarities.

677
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,593
I belong with my people.

678
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,399
We will be imposing direct rule,

679
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,600
with the district commissioner, Rufus
Lancaster, acting as native authority.

680
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,315
There will, of course,
be a tribal council,

681
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,550
so your people will have some sort of say

682
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,232
in our running of your affairs.

683
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,556
I do understand
this is an awful lot to digest.

684
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,319
I want to see the Harragin report.

685
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,193
Not possible.

686
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,671
It was an advisory paper, so
the government's not obliged to publish,

687
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,076
but I can tell you this:

688
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,396
The conclusion was

689
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,430
you are not
a fit and proper person to rule.

690
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,193
Upon what basis?

691
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,152
That's confidential to the government.

692
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,431
I have a right to know.

693
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,717
Sir Walter has weighed the evidence.

694
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,394
And you chose to agree.

695
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:55,680
Mr Khama, I am the British Government's
representative in your country...

696
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,871
And yet you know nothing of it.

697
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,279
You don't even live there.
You are based somewhere else entirely.

698
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,598
Content with your government
to run our affairs from South Africa,

699
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,952
you move as closely with
Prime Minister Malan and his government,

700
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,436
as you do the British prime minster.

701
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:16,117
And, yes, Sir Alistair,
I am questioning your motives.

702
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,438
I do not make the decisions.

703
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,320
You advise.

704
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,592
And my advice... is always confidential.

705
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,356
It's six o'clock, Sir Alistair.
Might I suggest a glass of sherry?

706
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,514
Splendid idea.

707
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,796
The government
will release this white paper.

708
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,435
It explains the situation
and your succession.

709
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,831
It sets out in fairly plain English

710
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,034
that were it not for our intervention,
Bechuanaland would have been torn apart

711
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,396
by the rivalry between you and your uncle.

712
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,040
That is an utter fabrication!

713
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,432
We are merely documenting
what your uncle has told us.

714
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,999
Oh, gosh. Thanks very much.

715
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,114
Sherry, Mr Khama?

716
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,674
Hello, Ruth.

717
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,554
You're in hospital in Serowe.

718
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,720
You have diphtheria,
but it is being treated.

719
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,000
And, Ms Khama, the doctor here
has discovered you are with child.

720
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,438
- But...
- My husband and I are concerned

721
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,434
that you should now get
the very best treatment available.

722
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,116
So he is organising for you to go to
Cape Town and visit a gynaecologist.

723
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,959
Dr Wessels.

724
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,318
Oh, Ruth, you are awake.

725
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,560
This chap I'm talking about
is the top man in Africa.

726
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,799
It wouldn't be right
not to put my faith in the doctors here.

727
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,552
Without wanting to alarm you,

728
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,879
death rates in childbirth,
for both mother and baby, in Serowe

729
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,878
are dangerously high.

730
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,753
To stay here would be a serious risk.

731
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,713
We do urge you to go to Cape Town.

732
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,111
Well, perhaps Dr Wessels could come here.

733
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,880
Dr Wessels does not travel
to his patients.

734
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,600
Look, I know what you're doing.

735
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,951
- And I don't like it.
- Mrs Khama...

736
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,550
I will ask you now both,
will you please leave?

737
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,275
Whatever your opinion of my husband,

738
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,399
I am here only as a woman,
who is also a mother.

739
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,718
I'm thinking only of the survival
of yourself and that of your baby.

740
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,116
You must give yourself
the very best chance.

741
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,755
We know Africa, and you do not.

742
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,754
I appreciate your thoughtfulness,
but I want to decide.

743
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,111
- Mrs Khama, Ruth...
- That's enough!

744
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,878
Please... do as my sister asks.

745
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,429
How dare you, girl.

746
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,751
Who on earth do you think
you're addressing?

747
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,917
And who do you think <i>you're</i> addressing?

748
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,511
I am Naledi Khama,
from the royal family of the Bangwato.

749
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,352
Granddaughter of Khama the Great,

750
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,560
and sister to the present king,
who will never be dethroned.

751
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,795
Hello?

752
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,080
- My love?
- 'It's Ruth. Can you hear me?'

753
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,554
My love, I can hear you.

754
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,912
Best news in the world, I am pregnant.

755
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,799
- 'We are having a baby.'
- A baby.

756
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,596
'I've been to the hospital and
Dr Moikangao says everything's good.

757
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,154
'How about that?'

758
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,277
It's wo... it's wonderful news.

759
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,758
'I cannot wait for you to come home.'

760
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,680
When are you coming back?

761
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,234
Ruth, something's...
something has happened.

762
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,512
Uh... I-I had my meeting with Canning.

763
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,754
I have been banished.

764
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,553
'The Harragin report stated
that I am not fit to rule.

765
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,520
I-I cannot come back for five years.

766
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,520
This can't be happening.

767
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,118
They are determined that we will
not be together in Bechuanaland.

768
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,714
And if I return, they'll have
no reason to allow you back.

769
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,237
'We were never supposed to be apart!
You promised me!

770
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,955
'You promised me
that everything would be all right!'

771
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,679
I know.

772
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,000
I know. I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry.

773
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,996
Then find your way back to me, Seretse.

774
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,992
'Find your way back.'

775
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,400
- 'I promise you I will.'
- Seretse...

776
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,314
Ruth... Ruth? Ruth! Ruth...

777
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,840
Seretse?

778
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,390
Ruth! Ruth!

779
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,712
'In a countermove
to pressure the British Government,

780
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,232

783
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,591
I do not believe the British public
will tolerate such injustice to me,

01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,599
and, more importantly,
to my suffering people

who have always remained loyal
to the British crown.

Seretse, uh, Mr Benn is a friend of Joe's.

793
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,360
We want to help.

794
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,591
Fenner Brockway. May we?

795
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,719
Uh, yes. Please.

796
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,598
It's subterfuge. Propaganda.

797

It's completely unprincipled.

We are talking about an entire nation
who want their leader.

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,550
While your government are concealing
their reasons for keeping me here,

800
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,991
they are allowing our lands
to be explored for minerals.

801
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,597
- For diamonds.
- And you believe the two are connected.

802
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,958
I don't know, but what happens
if they make a find?

803
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,311
Mr Khama, you are a protectorate,

804
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,194
which differentiates you somewhat
from other colonies.

805
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,791
Meaning the mineral rights should be
vested with the people of my country.

806
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,392
Ordinarily, yes, but you have been
placed under direct rule.

807
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,836
Your situation may have become vulnerable.

808
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,920
My grandfather negotiated those rights.
I know they remain with us.

809
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,350
You are vulnerable.

810
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,160
What if the government acknowledged
our rights publicly in some way?

811
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,680
Or if I could get them on record

812
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,076
recognising the agreement
they have with us?

813
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,438
Well, that would be a great help,
and a miracle.

814
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,156
I will look into the legalities
of your country's change in status.

815
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,920
And the Harragin report?

816
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,952
We'll get a copy.

817
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,554
You have my word.

818
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,760
Seretse, please hold your people off.

819
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,799
If the election brings new blood,
it could change everything.

820
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,517
How long can we rely on the good nature
of our people to stand by peacefully?

821
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,840
Tomorrow, Sir Alistair Canning
will announce to my people

822
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,271
the appointment of one of his
administration as the new native authority

823
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,754
to govern my people.

824
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,996
Every district was alerted, sir.

825
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,990
We were expecting 10,000 at this meeting.

826
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,031
The tribe is refusing
to organise a council.

827
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,918
Until their king... is returned.

828
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,792
When a man tells a lie,

829
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,512
he loses his dignity.

830
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,598
And so it is with a country.

831
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,910
I'm calling
on the British Government today

832
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,720
to release the Harragin report.

833
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,513
What are they hiding?

834
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,559
'...they did so
with only the slightest of...

835
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,431
'In a bid to show his support
for the exiled chief of Bechuanaland...'

836
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,791
'The leader of the opposition,
Mr Churchill, addressed Parliament.

837
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,075
'Mr Churchill told the House
of his deeply held belief

838
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,318
'in the virtue of the Christian marriage,
which he described

839
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,229
'as a "scared bond
between a husband and his wife".

840
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,832
'Why are the Labour government keeping
this African chief and his woman apart?

841
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,391
'Putting his opposition
to Khama's banishment on the record,

842
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,598
'Mr Churchill went on to announce
to the House his full intention

843
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,360
'of returning to the chief
and his wife their kingdom,

844
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,957
'when his Conservative Party
wins the forthcoming general election.'

845
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,670
The honourable gentleman
for Eton and Slough.

846
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,117
We know these actions against Mr Khama

847
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:50,235
are effectively introducing the principle
of a colour bar to British politics,

848
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,591
separating black from white.

849
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,234
It is an utter betrayal,

850
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,398
both of myself, as your prime minister,
and of your government.

851
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,353
The betrayal is of the British people,

852
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,230
and anyone who believed the Labour Party
is on the side of what is right and just.

853
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,953
The world is watching.

854
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,511
The UN have a petition signed by
every prominent black leader in the US.

855
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,395
America is sending funds to Mr Khama,

856
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,155
so that he can defend himself against us.

857
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,754
It's... I mean, look at these.

858
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,396
Never has a Labour government been
criticised this way by the negro press.

859
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,593
We are on the eve of the election.
I am pleading with you.

860
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,911
Send him home before Churchill does.

861
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,999
It will be an almighty humiliation
if a Tory government

862
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,435
fulfils our responsibility!

863
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,435
I would like nothing more than to say to
hell with Malan and his damned apartheid,

864
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,435
but we need South Africa to protect us
from Stalin and his advance there.

865
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,592
We all do! Including the...

866
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,991
...hypocritical Americans with
their Jim Crow laws lauding this over us!

867
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:53,757
- They're pointing out the facts.
- These are the facts! There's a Cold War.

868
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,032
If I allow that chief,
or any black chief and his white queen,

869
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,793
to sleep in the same bed on African soil,

870
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,429
Malan will withdraw from the Commonwealth.

871
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,876
He will utilise any favour
we show that couple

872
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,720
to whip up nationalist support
for a separate republic.

873
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,151
- He'll withdraw his uranium...
- This is how we justify our actions?

874
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,317
- An atomic bomb programme?
- And his gold!

875
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,319
If you don't care about the uranium,
think about our economy.

876
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,432
How long can we sustain our currency

877
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,432
without Malan supplying our gold reserves?

878
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,434
Hmm? You count the months!

879
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,596
We have done a deal with the devil.

880
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,830
'Twenty-four hours have passed
since the polling stations closed,

881
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,191
'and the last vote was cast.

882
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,154
'The candidates stood by,
and police oversaw,

883
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,717
'as ballot boxes were removed,
so that counting could begin.

884
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,354
'Anxious crowds have gathered
in Piccadilly Circus,

885
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,673
'as, one by one, results have been
marked out and announced.

886
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:59,717
'And so it is that the voice of our people
has called upon Winston Churchill...'

887
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,152
Shh!

888
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,192
'...much uncertainty,

889
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,597
'the United Kingdom has placed
the responsibility of our future

01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,712
'in Mr Churchill's hands.

891
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,879
'In this closely fought election
saw the Conservatives

892
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,760
'triumphed by a tiny majority.

893
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,270
'Nevertheless, the majority it was.'

894
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,600
Mr Khama. Good morning.

895
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,160
Morning.

896
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,032
Sir Winston Churchill will be
making his announcement

897
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,750
about your return to Bechuanaland
in the House of Commons this afternoon.

898
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,872
He wished for me
to convey it to you first.

899
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,393
I appreciate that.

900
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,756
He's decided that five years' banishment

901
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,078
will cause unrest and uncertainty
in the protectorate,

902
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,999
and he wishes to bring an end
to such insecurity.

903
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,596
Consequently, he will be announcing
that your banishment...

904
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,354
...is for life.

905
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,955
I beg your pardon?

906
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,390
Yes, on the occasion of our previous
meeting I was able to offer you a career

907
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,517
in the administration of Jamaica.

908
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,197
Pity you did not accept. Under current
circumstances, I cannot repeat the offer.

909
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,755
Nor, indeed, a posting to any other land.

910
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,758
The prime minister
announced his intentions.

911
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,957
He clearly stated that
he would allow me back home.

912
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,596
Opposition is one thing, Mr Khama.

913
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,356
The realities of government
are quite another. Good day.

914
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,839
I want him to come back to me.

915
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,392
Churchill promised. He promised.

916
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,559
I believed him.

917
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,074
Seretse says he'll write to Tshekedi,
and try and reconcile, but...

918
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,398
You have to be strong.

919
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,511
You have a voice. Use it.

920
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,311
Mr Churchill,
10,000 of my husband's people

921
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,275
fought the war for you,
and for the freedom of Britain.

922
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,757
They answered your call
in your darkest hour.

923
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,920
'Mr Churchill,
you have betrayed my husband,

924
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,073
'and each and every one
of those 10,000 men.

925
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,831
'You have caused great hurt.

926
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,920
'You have caused great anger
amongst a peaceful people.

927
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,113
'And Mr Churchill...

928
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,272
'...I'm with them.

929
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,800
'And I will remain with them

930
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,991
'because this is my home.'

931
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,996
'A great event at Silverstone...'

932
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,432
'Uncle,

933
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:48,116
'our country is now completely
under the control of the British.

01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,594
'You taught me that the colonialist
strategy is to divide and rule,

935
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,276
'and that the only response
is to stand united.

936
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:02,036
'My exile leaves our country
divided and vulnerable.

if diamonds or other minerals are found.

939
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,232

for our people.

940

'I need to come home to fulfil the role
for which you raised me.

942
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,310
'But I cannot do it without you.

01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,831
'If I can find a way to come back,

'will you agree to hear my plan?'

945
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,318
Mr Khama will never return
to Bechuanaland.

946
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,789
The decision of my government
is absolute and final.

947
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,834
Control them, or I'll close the kgotla.

948
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,680
Sir, you have pushed
the patience of the people too far.

949
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,752
You can't close our kgotla

950
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,317
any more than I can close
your Houses of Parliament.

951
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,720
Hey!

952
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,760
Hey!

953
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,113
Shh, shh.

954
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,714
Hello?

955
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,197
Here is your daughter.

956
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,120
Can you hear her?

957
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,713
No.

958
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,039
'Hang on. Can you hear her?'

959
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,038
I-I can. I can hear her.

960
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,678
But... she sounds... Is she all right?

961
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,119
'She's beautiful.'

962
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,594
But she's crying.

963
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,996
Oh, I jabbed her, so she'd make a noise.

964
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,239
Isn't she beautiful?

965
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,553
She's, she's beautiful.

966
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,234
I wish you could see her.

967
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,033
You must come to me.

968
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,039
'Are we giving up?'

969
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,872
No. No, we are not.

970
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,677
'But we've been separated for too long.'

971
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,757
I can't do this alone any more.

972
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,872
And I need you.

973
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,591
'I need my family.'

974
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,719
'As soon as the baby's strong enough,
we'll come to you.'

975
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,557
My tickets have arrived.

976
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,558
Would it be all right if I joined you?

977
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,878
See, I don't know when I'll be back.

978
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,274
It's okay. Mmm.

979
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,120
There.

980
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,360
Why are they here?

981
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,595
They are thanking you
for walking the road with them.

982
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,793
This song is about you.

983
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,318
They are saying Seretse's wife
is as bright as the morning star.

984
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,753
This way, Mr Khama.

985
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,000
Oh... this is Daddy.

986
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,313
There's someone else here to see you.

987
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,198
Thank you for coming.

988
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,598
- Hello, Daddy.
- Ruth.

989
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,960
This is Jacqueline.

990
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:53,156
# Sometimes I'm happy

991
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:58,230
# Sometimes I'm blue

992
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:02,832
# My disposition... #

993
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,237
- Mr Nash...
- Thank you for coming.

994
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,191
The story on the mining companies.
I thought you'd like to know.

995
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,234
We need a bit more information,

996
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,920
but I'll say we'll be running with this
in about a week.

997
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,875
What?

998
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,995
Nash... he's doing a story.

999
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,320
It's not confirmed, it's too soon, but...

1000
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,200
...there has been a find.

1001
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,629
Diamonds?

1002
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,198
Yes.

1003
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,431
Just three diamonds, but...

1004
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,953
But yes.

1005
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,753
It's a beginning.

1006
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,114
It could mean everything.

1007
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,516
The British don't know about the find yet.

1008
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,597
If I can get ahead...

1009
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,593
...I know, I know I can get this right.

1010
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,909
The prime minister told this country

1011
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,800
that he would allow
the King of Bangwato to return home.

1012
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,595
After the election,
he banished him for life.

1013
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,234
For good.

1014
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,517
Having deprived
the Bangwato people of their king,

1015
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,236
can his Commonwealth
under-secretary, at the very least,

1016
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,434
assure us that the Bangwato people
will still have a say

1017
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,876
in the running of their own affairs?

1018
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,598
With particular reference to the use
of their land for mineral exploitation?

1019
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,356
Let me make it clear that the dispute

1020
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,280
is not between us and the Bangwato,

1021
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,596
it is between the chief and his uncle.

1022
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,350
We have a responsibility
to keep this warring family apart.

1023
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,350
With respect
to the Right Honourable Gentleman,

1024
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,070
his answer had nothing to do
with the question I just asked.

1025
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,756
Mr Chairman, the Honourable Gentleman
seems to be hounding me for an answer

1026
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,351
- that I'm quite prepared to give.
- Yes? Go on.

1027
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,759
Let me make an assurance

1028
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,918
that no leases will be given
to any mining companies,

1029
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,631
without the consent
of the Bangwato themselves.

1030
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,878
The report.

1031
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,754
How did you get it?

1032
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,834
Let's say not everyone is proud of what
their government does on their behalf.

1033
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,959
Harragin concludes
that you are a fit and proper person

1034
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,992
to succeed to the kingdom.

1035
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,434
And that you, Ruth,

1036
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,831
are acceptable to the Bangwato people.

1037
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,636
But that neither of you
are acceptable to South Africa.

1038
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,360
It's your proof.

1039
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,270
Because my exile is now permanent,

1040
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,838
I need to put our family affairs in order.

1041
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,151
As a consequence, I would like

1042
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,034
to arrange a meeting with my uncle

1043
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,277
in Bechuanaland,

1044
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,110
and so I'm requesting permission
to travel.

1045
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,634
Well, Mr Khama,
I have looked at your request.

1046
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,440
And as a gesture of goodwill,

1047
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,196
and to ensure that all can see
the sincerity of our efforts

1048
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,872
to keep peace within your tribe...
I will allow it.

1049
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,557
But only for a period of one week.

1050
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,993
By which point we expect you
to have dealt with whatever...

1051
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,430
...family concerns
you may need to address.

1052
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,960
Thank you.

1053
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,436
How kind of you, Mr Roberts.

1054
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,876
I hope you know how appreciative we are.

1055
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,991
We have a very difficult negotiation.

1056
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,993
Yes, Uncle.

1057
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,151
This is Jacqueline.

1058
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,160
She is a sweet one.

1059
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,833
I was going to put her down, but I...

1060
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,720
I think she'd rather be
in another mother's arms.

1061
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,638
Yes, she's a sweet one.

1062
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,714
I have read your letter.

1063
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,636
And what are your thoughts, Uncle?

1064
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,236
If we can agree now
to let go of our claims to the kingship,

1065
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,829
we will be equal private citizens.

1066
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,994
Then my marriage can be of no concern
to South Africa, Great Britain or anyone.

1067
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,437
Any disagreement between you and me
becomes a domestic squabble,

1068
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,273
not an affair of state.

1069
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,198
Then I will be allowed to return home.

1070
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,719
And we can start to rebuild.

1071
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:39,196
You're speaking of dismantling hundreds
and hundreds of years of tradition.

1072
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,871
Uncle... you should read this.

1073
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,637
You, me, our people...

1074
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,230
...we have been pawns
in somebody else's game.

1075
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,360
They are coming.

1076
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,156
You may have convinced me, Seretse...

1077
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,920
...but now you're going
to have to convince the people.

1078
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,795
I believe that two days ago, Mr Khama,

1079
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,593
you had a meeting with your uncle,

1080
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,992
authorised by Mr Roberts
in the Commonwealth Office.

1081
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:48,915
Mr Roberts will not be available
in the future to make such decisions.

1082
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,318
I also know you want to discuss
the outcome of that meeting with me

1083
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,909
for relay to the British Government.

1084
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,713
Before you begin, let me be clear.

1085
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,438
There can and will be no circumstance

1086
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,991
in which we will allow you
to return to Bechuanaland permanently.

1087
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,597
No... circumstance?

1088
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,160
Not even a hand-delivered copy
of the Harragin report to the press?

1089
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,949
"Government lies to British public
for fear of South Africa in Khama affair."

1090
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,959
There would be conditions.

1091
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,754
I would have to discuss them
with the government.

1092
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,036
You should know this, Mr Khama...

1093
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,320
I would personally demand that you
give up all claim to the chieftainship,

1094
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,591
and that your uncle do the same.

1095
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,320
Sir Alistair,

1096
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,276
I don't have to do anything anymore.

1097
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,349
But... I will agree to that.

1098
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,231
And... upon condition that
we continue direct rule from London.

1099
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,034
I will agree to this, also.

1100
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,990
Up to the point
where we will hold democratic elections,

1101
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,157
and declare our independence.

1102
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,596
Yes, well, an election process
is hardly on the agenda.

1103
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,598
I suspect your government

1104
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,754
may take a slightly more
respectful position moving forward.

1105
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:38,632
You will be aware of the recent
discovery of diamonds on our lands?

1106
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,514
Yes, well...

1107
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,514
Any resources Bechuanaland may have are...

1108
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,390
...hardly relevant
to this issue, Mr Khama.

1109
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:57,196
I hope you caught the news that
your Commonwealth under-secretary

1110
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,760
confirmed to Parliament that my people

1111
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,794
control all mineral resources
in Bechuanaland.

1112
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,755
You need my husband, Sir Alistair.

1113
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,875
May I offer you a sherry?

1114
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,032
My uncle and I

1115
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,634
are now at peace.

1116
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,831
The exile is over!

1117
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,636
I have a new vision for our nation.

1118
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,911
We are a people of tradition,
and rightly so.

1119
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,955
But we need a change in Africa.

1120
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,389
We need a change in Bechuanaland,
whether we like it or not.

1121
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,600
Whether the colonial powers that be
like it or not.

1122
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,318
It is time for us to take a step
beyond royal succession,

1123
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,830
and into a democratic Bechuanaland.

1124
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,118
To create a new nation,

1125
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,870
not to be ruled by royalty here,
or royalty in great Britain,

1126
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:13,954
but a country to be led
by those who you choose.

1127
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,398
No man is free...

1128
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,998
...who is not master of himself.

1129
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,632
Brother and sisters,
it is time for democracy,

1130
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,879
for independence,

1131
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,598
for us to be the masters of our own fate.

1132
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,999
A new Bechuanaland.

1133
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,038
A new Africa.

1134
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,754
It is time!

1135
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:04,591
<i>Pula, pula, pula, pula...</i>

1136
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,080
Ruth!

1136
01:44:07,305 --> 01:45:07,486

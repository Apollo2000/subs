1
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,461
Go ahead, run.

2
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,174
But when we catch you, we're going to
break those skinny legs of yours!

3
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,884
And stomp on your ugly face!

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,729
Leave him alone!
He didn't do anything to you!

5
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,032
Huh?

6
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,000
I said, leave him alone.

7
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,206
Bitch!

8
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,180
I'll hit you again, Dmitri Radmanovich.

9
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,305
If you weren't a girl...

10
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,395
Come on.

11
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,281
Are they gone?

12
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,907
I can't keep saving you like this,
<i>solnyshka.</i>

13
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,956
You have to stop running
and find the courage to face them.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,747
It's... It's not like that, Svetlana.

15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,124
I didn't run because I was afraid of them.

16
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,958
I ran because I was afraid to hurt them.

17
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,218
Have I ever lied to you, Svetlana?

18
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,439
How is this possible?

19
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,153
I don't know.

20
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,160
Something has been happening inside me
for weeks now.

21
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,920
Something incredible.

22
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,898
Such incredible powers, <i>solnyshka.</i>

23
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,782
You have to give them to the state.

24
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,234
The people need you.

25
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,982
<i>Extraordinary reports
coming out of the Soviet Union.</i>

26
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,730
<i>Tales of a being, allegedly alien in origin,</i>

27
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,439
<i>with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal men.</i>

28
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:50,280
<i>This footage released by the Russians
appears to show the Soviet Superman in action.</i>

29
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,374
<i>If true, this could be the beginning
of a new kind of arms race.</i>

30
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,807
<i>This is undoubtedly mere propaganda,
tailored to send ripples of fear into the West.</i>

31
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,561
<i>And in these treacherous times,
fear is something we must never surrender to.</i>

32
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,566
<i>This is George Taylor saying goodnight
and may your tomorrows all...</i>

33
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,524
<i>...Intelligence people
are saying that it isn't a hoax.</i>

34
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,576
As I said, Mr. President,
I anticipated this.

35
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,949
Of course I understand your concern,
but I assure you

36
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,577
the Luthor Company has
this under control.

37
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,533
We'll find out soon enough if he's real.

38
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,119
All I need is a hundred technicians,
20 million dollars,

39
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,671
and permission to drop
a satellite on Metropolis.

40
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,589
<i>Drop a satellite on Metropolis?</i>

41
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,759
<i>- Put eight million lives in jeopardy?</i>
- Eisenhower.

42
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,134
<i>Are you out of your damn mind?
I should lock you up for even suggesting it!</i>

43
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,304
I have to go, sir.

44
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,805
- Something more urgent just came up.
<i>- Don't you dare hang...</i>

45
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,261
I'd say extremely urgent.

46
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,607
We gather here today
to celebrate a glorious achievement.

47
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,782
The largest hydroelectric station
in the world.

48
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:14,616
Ten thousand of our bravest, strongest men
worked ceaselessly to construct it.

49
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,451
But even with their sweat and toil,

50
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,538
this dam would never have been completed
in so short a time

51
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:26,626
if not for the efforts
of a truly extraordinary young man.

52
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,718
A young man I have come to look upon
as both a great Soviet hero and a son.

53
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,518
Comrades, I give you...

54
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,062
Superman.

55
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,111
Can't I just smile and wave?

56
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,986
We all must make sacrifices
for the greater good, comrade.

57
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,363
But this display...

58
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,663
You are a symbol for all we aspire to be.

59
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,162
The people need to hear your voice.

60
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:06,007
Your words are extremely kind,
Premier Stalin.

61
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,583
Perhaps too kind.

62
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,467
I am no hero.

63
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,722
I am merely a servant of the State,
who seeks, as you do...

64
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,096
to better the lives of our citizens.

65
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,931
Yes, I work to protect them.

66
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,189
Perhaps inspire them in some small way.

67
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:30,490
But make no mistake, I didn't build this dam,
the Soviet people did.

68
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:35,286
And may it stand forever as an example
of what we, as a people, can achieve here,

69
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,613
and across the world,

70
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,700
so long as we remain united by our ideals.

71
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,493
Colonel Mazov!

72
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,120
- What is it?
- The Zenit satellite, sir. It's fallen out of orbit.

73
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,375
What? But that's...

74
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,331
What's the trajectory?

75
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,921
North America, sir.
The Eastern Seaboard of the United States.

76
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,103
Look! Up in the sky!

77
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:36,737
I don't blame those among you that fear me,
for you've been taught to fear all your lives.

78
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,245
But if you learn nothing else today,
learn this:

79
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,996
We in the Soviet Union do not oppose
the citizens of the United States.

80
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,500
We only oppose the government
that oppresses you.

81
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,708
Our sole desire is for peace and equality
among all men.

82
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,464
And what about women?

83
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,636
Lois Lane. Daily Planet.

84
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,257
Lois Lane Luthor.

85
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,717
I know of you...

86
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,224
and your capitalist husband.

87
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,061
If you're really serious
about us wanting to learn about you...

88
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,517
How about an interview?

89
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,945
The press is the enemy of the people.

90
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,990
Why would I let you twist my words
and use them against me?

91
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:24,280
So the great Soviet Superman
is afraid of the free expression of ideas?

92
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,036
- She's got him there.
- Yeah.

93
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,287
Makes sense.

94
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,850
You really shouldn't smoke, Mrs. Luthor.

95
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,519
This is the same brand my doctor smokes.

96
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,773
So you're not afraid of the American press.

97
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,863
I'm not afraid of anything.

98
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:08,874
Have you ever considered that a lack of fear
can lead to arrogance, recklessness?

99
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,873
Eisenhower's saying your people
sabotaged their own satellite.

100
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,957
- We did no such thing.
- So you could come flying in to save the day.

101
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,090
You have to admit
it is the perfect propaganda opportunity.

102
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,187
Is it propaganda to envision a world where
the poor and afflicted can be lifted out of misery,

103
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:34,518
where the working classes can rise together
and reshape humanity for generations?

104
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,571
You're a super-alien.
What could you possibly know about humanity?

105
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,157
Until I was 12 years old, Mrs. Luthor...

106
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,735
Lane. I'm not an appendage.

107
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:51,371
Until I was 12 years old, Miss Lane,
I was as human as you are.

108
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,295
This planet is the only home
I've ever known.

109
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,794
And I would sacrifice anything
to protect her.

110
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,174
The United States already is the protector
of the free world,

111
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,425
the bulwark of liberty and equality.

112
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,634
Your bulwark was built on the backs
of slaves and immigrants.

113
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,220
And it hasn't changed much, has it?

114
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,307
While you and your privileged kind live
in luxury,

115
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,143
all across your country people
are struggling,

116
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,604
suffering, dying.

117
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,485
I can't deny that there's a gap

118
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,158
between the American dream
and the American reality.

119
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:31,036
But there are some massive gaps in your
utopian vision that need addressing as well.

120
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,125
What is this?

121
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,870
Proof of the repression in the U.S.S.R.

122
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,250
The Gulags.

123
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,334
Mass executions of people
unfortunate enough to be labeled dissidents

124
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,885
by your beloved Premier Stalin.

125
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,339
Lies.

126
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,890
I would certainly know
if such things existed.

127
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,811
Would you?

128
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,170
Welcome, Superman.

129
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,373
We weren't expecting you.

130
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,504
I'm sure you weren't.

131
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,644
Shielded by lead to prevent me
from discovering it.

132
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,330
You are the Superman.

133
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,748
They say you can hear a leaf fall
a thousand miles away.

134
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,461
And you never heard our cries?

135
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,318
It is you.

136
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,152
At last.

137
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,114
Svetlana?

138
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,521
I... I could have died...

139
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,609
should have died long ago.

140
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,404
But I held on for you.

141
00:17:55,533 --> 00:18:00,904
I never stopped believing
that you would come one day to liberate us.

142
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,658
That we'd see each other one last time.

143
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,461
But what did you do
to deserve such a punishment?

144
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,632
I knew you...

145
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,635
before.

146
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,130
I'm so sorry, Lana.

147
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,965
I didn't know.

148
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,517
Don't blame yourself.

149
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,391
You are...

150
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,392
You have always been...

151
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,357
my hope.

152
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,855
My savior.

153
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,354
But I am no...

154
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,158
This is a world where the strong rule,

155
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,407
and you are the strongest of all of us.

156
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,751
Remember when we were small, <i>solnyshka?</i>

157
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,297
How I used to save you from those bullies?

158
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,964
Now you must save all of us.

159
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,143
Use your power to...

160
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,210
Millions of people dead.

161
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,886
Explain that to me, Premier Stalin.

162
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,422
Help me to understand how...

163
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,100
why you could do this.

164
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,476
I tried to protect you, my son.

165
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,902
To keep you untainted
by the grim realities of governance.

166
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,980
I asked you why.

167
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,368
Because, as much as it breaks my heart...

168
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,747
it is necessary.

169
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,164
How could such atrocities be necessary?

170
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,462
What you call atrocities...

171
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,625
I call terrible necessities.

172
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:25,010
For our vision of a better world to succeed,
we must weed out the insurgents.

173
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,135
The weak.

174
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,889
The ones whose minds
have been poisoned against the State.

175
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,891
They're human beings.

176
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,769
You're like a blind kitten, comrade.

177
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,229
So good, so pure, but you just can't see.

178
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,859
You must understand...

179
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,442
You must believe that everything I've done

180
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:50,372
has been for the ultimate good of the people
and the welfare of the Soviet State.

181
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,377
The State's welfare or your welfare?

182
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,705
They're one and the same.

183
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,048
We need to close the gap
between our highest communist ideals

184
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,755
and the cruel reality I saw today.

185
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,807
Then I urge you to try.

186
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,563
But you'll quickly find
that the only way to achieve that goal

187
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,480
is to follow my example.

188
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,893
The unpleasant truth, my son,

189
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:25,324
is that certain people must die
in order for the system to work.

190
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,785
Wise words.

191
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,851
What now?

192
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,990
Now?

193
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,363
Now I save the world.

194
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:21,380
You might consider cutting down
on those four course dinners, Lex.

195
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,299
You're getting a little thick
around the middle.

196
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,923
Vanity is more your style, my dear.

197
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,719
Unfortunately, darling,

198
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,141
we live in a world where people talk
as much about my looks as my work.

199
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:37,437
While a man can be fat or skinny,

200
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,765
short or tall,

201
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,816
hairy or bald,

202
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,110
and it doesn't matter one tiny bit.

203
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,403
Did you read Hedda Hopper's column today?
She claims you're pregnant.

204
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,865
Like I'm ever gonna end up some happy housewife
with a brood of annoying brats.

205
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,624
That's mine.

206
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,683
- Lois Lane.
<i>- Lane, where have you been?</i>

207
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:06,090
<i>- I need you here right away!</i>
- What? Slow down, Perry.

208
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,961
Right. Got it.

209
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,219
Stalin is dead.

210
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,850
Apparently, all hell's breaking loose
in Moscow.

211
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,773
As I knew it would
when I gave you that file.

212
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,775
I hope this isn't a mistake.

213
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,983
I don't make mistakes.

214
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,577
Morning, Mr. Luthor.

215
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,624
Special Agent Olsen.

216
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,704
How is my favorite G-man babysitter today?

217
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,129
Excellent, Mr. L.

218
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,582
And how's my most exhausting assignment?

219
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,676
The usual.

220
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,756
Burdened by your own brilliance?

221
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,509
Frustrated by the limitations
of everyone around you?

222
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,762
You know me too well, James.

223
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,471
I'll say it again,
this is extraordinary even for you.

224
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,480
True.

225
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,144
Technology curves stipulated

226
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,397
that none of this equipment would even
be invented for another five decades.

227
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,397
I guess the Man of Steel
makes your head work faster, huh?

228
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,543
Careful there!

229
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,373
The genetic information the alien left
on that satellite is essential.

230
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,460
Especially if Ike expects me to build him
a superman of his very own.

231
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,140
<i>We thought that the
bloody conflict was over four years ago.</i>

232
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,641
<i>That a fragile peace had finally come
to the war-torn Korean peninsula.</i>

233
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,225
<i>We didn't realize just how fragile it was.</i>

234
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,981
<i>It began 24 hours ago,</i>

235
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:56,907
<i>when the Soviet premier announced that he would
be liberating the South from American oppression</i>

236
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,330
<i>and reuniting the Korean people
under his rule.</i>

237
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,830
<i>The last war went on for three years.</i>

238
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,879
<i>This one was over in three hours.</i>

239
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,297
<i>We deeply regret the loss of life today.</i>

240
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,346
<i>Even a single death is a tragedy.</i>

241
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,094
<i>But a few thousand,</i>

242
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:23,178
<i>weighed against the nearly three million
who perished in the previous Korean conflict,</i>

243
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:27,858
<i>we believe that's a small price
to pay for peace.</i>

244
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,654
<i>And there will be peace, and prosperity,
for all Korean citizens.</i>

245
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,946
<i>I promise you that we are not here
to dominate you or trample your rights.</i>

246
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,653
<i>We are here to lift you up
and set you free.</i>

247
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,955
<i>To offer you a better life.</i>

248
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,000
<i>And what we offer
the people of Korea...</i>

249
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,247
<i>we offer to the entire world.</i>

250
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,962
<i>I hear congratulations are
in order.</i>

251
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,592
Thank you, Olsen.

252
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,049
The solar engine I conceived
in the shower this morning

253
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,851
will certainly revolutionize
the automobile industry.

254
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,017
- But how...?
- I wasn't talking about you, sir.

255
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,518
Perry White's retirement?

256
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,147
Your wife becoming editor-in-chief
of the Daily Planet?

257
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,480
If we'd seen each other for more than
a few hours these past four months,

258
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,315
maybe you wouldn't be so befuddled.

259
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,902
Sorry, my dear, I've been
understandably distracted with the project.

260
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,326
Oh, Christ, don't tell me...

261
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,204
Yep. You forgot our anniversary.

262
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,294
Again.

263
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,843
Impeccable taste.

264
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,966
As always.

265
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,676
I'll dispatch Miss Teschmacher
to get you something.

266
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,727
It will be delivered later today.

267
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,806
You're such a sentimentalist.

268
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,153
You're a woman of great patience, Miss Lane.

269
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,785
In other words, why do I put up with him?

270
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,081
Three reasons.

271
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,124
One, he supports my career.

272
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,544
Two, the sex is phenomenal.

273
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,371
Ahem. And, uh, three?

274
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,917
That man is gonna change the world.

275
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,009
With the emergence of the Soviet Superman,

276
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,011
the Cold War reached a freezing point.

277
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:28,095
Our nation reacted to this new threat
as it had to,

278
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,681
by doing everything in our power
to hold back the communist tide

279
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,064
through force of arms and force of will.

280
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,942
But as recent lessons
in Korea have taught us,

281
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:42,492
conventional weapons aren't enough
when one man, one alien,

282
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:46,197
has the power to bring entire nations
to their knees.

283
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,410
And so we turned to the only person
who could shift the balance of power.

284
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,584
Thank you, Mr. President,

285
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,638
for both your service to our great nation
and your confidence in me.

286
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:07,684
A confidence that, I believe,
has been rewarded today.

287
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:12,434
Many of our citizens have lived in fear
of the Soviet Superman, but no longer.

288
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,110
As of today,
the United States has its own living weapon.

289
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,610
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

290
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,907
Superior Man.

291
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,746
Faster, stronger,
and far deadlier than our Russian friend.

292
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,205
And once unleashed...

293
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:46,215
my creation will restore American superiority
and bring the Red Menace to its knees.

294
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,521
America first!

295
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,866
Questions?

296
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:09,867
- Mr. Luthor! Mr. Luthor!
- Mr. Luthor, I have a question!

297
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,870
One at a time, please. Mr. Troupe.

298
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,542
I'm confused, Mr. Luthor.

299
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,212
A project like this, wouldn't it be better
to keep it secret from the Russians?

300
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,336
Why reveal this new weapon to the world
in such a public way?

301
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:26,384
For one very good reason, I want our friend
in Moscow to know what's coming.

302
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,383
I want him to be afraid.

303
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:42,316
To say that I am honored to have you here,
ambassador, is a massive understatement.

304
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,864
Call me Diana, please.

305
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,614
On Themyscira,
we have little patience for formalities.

306
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,286
And what shall I call you?

307
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,456
Superman.

308
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,953
I had a name once, Diana.

309
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,960
Before I stopped being a man
and became a symbol.

310
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,042
Then Superman it is.

311
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,965
If only my mother had come.

312
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,389
If she could meet you,
see what you've accomplished here...

313
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,932
She's still resistant?

314
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:17,522
- Queen Hippolyta doesn't trust man's world.
- But you do?

315
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,315
I believe that the only chance for peace
in this world

316
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,769
is reaching out, forging alliances,

317
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,900
finding common ground.

318
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,700
The Amazons can't keep their heads
buried in the sand forever.

319
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,651
So you have hope?

320
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,284
You give me hope, Superman.

321
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,873
Stalin was a brute.

322
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:41,045
But you, I think,
actually embody the ideals you profess.

323
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,655
You're the first person I've met
with abilities like mine.

324
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,326
Each of us alone
has the power to change the world.

325
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,957
But together?

326
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,423
Forgive me.

327
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,750
I come from an island of all women.

328
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,507
Work it out for yourself.

329
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,214
Ah!

330
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,766
Right. Of course.

331
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,559
Hm.

332
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,433
Well, that's a relief.

333
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,524
Is it?

334
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,696
<i>I thought sex was
what you expected from me.</i>

335
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:55,950
It's certainly pleasant enough but, ultimately,
it's a diversion from the critical work at hand.

336
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,157
Nothing wrong with a good diversion.

337
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,288
With the right partner.

338
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,542
I don't need, or want, a mate, Diana.

339
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,461
But I could certainly use a friend.

340
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,636
I'd be proud to offer my friendship
and my assistance.

341
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:16,683
Perhaps, together,
we can change the world for the better.

342
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,735
<i>And what do you make
of this duplicate Superman</i>

343
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,904
the Americans have created?

344
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,573
If you're asking me if I'm worried, no.

345
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,654
Our intelligence reports indicate
that this so-called Superior Man is flawed.

346
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,283
Incomplete and inoperable.

347
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,866
A propaganda tool meant to frighten us.

348
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,493
We do not frighten easily.

349
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:50,084
So much fear, so much mistrust,
on both sides.

350
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,921
Perhaps I could be a bridge
between your nations.

351
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,883
I think you overestimate
the Americans' desire for peace.

352
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,790
Superman!

353
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:38,098
Come to me now, Russki, before I bring
this entire city down on your head!

354
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,222
Years ago, when Metropolis was threatened,

355
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:47,228
I put aside our countries' differences
and protected the lives of the innocent.

356
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:51,186
Yet you dare to come here as an invader?

357
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,612
Not an invader, a liberator.

358
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,905
I am truth.

359
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,277
I am justice.

360
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,655
I am the American way!

361
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,496
This violence is unnecessary.

362
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,750
You're not an enemy, you are
a victim of the capitalist machine.

363
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,502
- Surrender now and I will...
- I am an American,

364
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,176
and I will never surrender
to a commie dictator!

365
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,971
Very well.

366
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,889
You had your chance.

367
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,568
The sub-cutaneous camera you embedded
in him is working fine.

368
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,493
Unfortunately, he's not.

369
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,496
More power.

370
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,204
He's nearing overload now, sir.

371
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,250
Of course he is.
Now give him more juice.

372
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,974
More juice.

373
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,097
Superior Man hate you.

374
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,479
Superior Man kill you!

375
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,022
- Lex, for God's sake...
- More!

376
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,944
Me am truth...

377
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,867
Me am justice...

378
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,661
Me am America...

379
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,660
Americ...

380
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,159
Americ...

381
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,082
Americ... Americ...

382
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,418
Americ...

383
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,091
What's happening to you?

384
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,797
Not know.

385
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:51,430
Me feel strange.

386
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,600
Me...

387
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,111
Luthor.

388
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,414
Unfortunate.

389
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,541
But expected.

390
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,833
There was only a 12 percent chance
Superior Man could've killed Superman

391
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,635
before he disintegrated
from the strain to his systems.

392
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,597
What?

393
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,683
You deliberately put that poor creature
into a state of overload.

394
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,182
Knowingly sent him to his death. Why?

395
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,887
Not a "him", darling, an "it."

396
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,689
An inhuman construct
created from the alien's DNA.

397
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:40,776
Why?

398
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,483
To test Superman's limits. Unnerve him,
psychologically and emotionally.

399
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,404
For a moment there, I actually
saw fear in his eyes.

400
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,452
And that means...

401
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,493
You created that creature,
and then very consciously murdered it.

402
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,289
We're at war, Lois.

403
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,710
Your compassion, however admirable,
is misplaced.

404
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:00,796
Don't.

405
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,885
I'm sorry.

406
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,093
This is Jack Ryder
reporting from Checkpoint Charlie,

407
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,306
where the final reinforced section
of the Berlin Wall is being put in place.

408
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,815
This veritable Iron Curtain, a massive
undertaking of the Democratic Allies,

409
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,396
assures all freedom-loving people
of the West

410
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,983
that they are finally safe
from the cancerous spread of communism...

411
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,825
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but the sound of
what can only be described as a sonic boom

412
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,907
has shaken the ground here and...

413
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,627
Workers of the West,

414
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:49,176
too long have you been deceived
by the lies of America.

415
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,973
This pitiful wall was created
to prevent you from knowing the truth,

416
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:58,723
that you live your lives
enslaved to the capitalist elite.

417
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,475
In the name of peace,

418
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,354
in the name of equality
for the United States and Western Europe,

419
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,935
I open this gate.

420
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,646
I tear down this wall.

421
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,024
Go, go, go!

422
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
from what we've just seen here today,

423
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:28,086
it is only a matter of time, very little time,
until all of Western Europe is absorbed...

424
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,509
is taken by the Soviet Superman.

425
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:06,188
The attack on Stalingrad by the alien
artificial intelligence called Brainiac

426
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,062
has haunted the Soviet people for years.

427
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:12,065
The entire city remains miniaturized.

428
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,987
Secreted away in the Kremlin,

429
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:18,818
where our premier works tirelessly
to restore Stalingrad's population.

430
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,700
Over time, Superman was able
to reprogram Brainiac,

431
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,204
and the living computer
now serves the State.

432
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:32,086
Poverty, disease, and ignorance have been
virtually eliminated in the Warsaw Pact states,

433
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:36,169
and disobedience to the party
is now a thing of the past.

434
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,348
The glorious future
envisioned by Karl Marx is here.

435
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:46,975
<i>Really? When we're all his pets?
Animals in a carefully constructed cage?</i>

436
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,523
He may feed and shelter everyone.

437
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,319
But the only freedom we have
is to be exactly what he wants us to be.

438
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,442
<i>To do exactly as he wants us to do.</i>

439
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:01,118
The only answer to this world
of perfect order is chaos.

440
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,288
We have to blow the entire system apart,

441
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:10,119
which is why this museum
is going to explode in 10 minutes.

442
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,752
Everyone, please proceed to the exits
in an orderly fashion.

443
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,299
There's more than enough time for us...

444
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,139
Did I say 10 minutes? I meant 10 seconds.

445
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,746
- Where did he go?
<i>- He's on you, Petrovich!</i>

446
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,081
- There!
- Open fire!

447
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,420
You serve that terrorist bastard.

448
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,122
Plant his bombs.

449
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,421
Take lives in the Batman's name.

450
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,591
You don't deserve to live.

451
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,893
But it's not your fault, is it?

452
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,566
He's fed you lies, brainwashed you.
You're broken.

453
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,485
I can fix you.

454
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,429
What kind of human being would do this?

455
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,264
A soulless lunatic with no respect
for human life.

456
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,814
Men.

457
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,107
Not all men.

458
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:25,106
No powers to speak of, yet this
Batman eludes the police, the military.

459
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,199
You.

460
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,994
I swear to you, Diana, his day will come.

461
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,791
<i>The Army
retrieved it six weeks ago.</i>

462
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:41,918
As soon as I was informed, I brought
Mr. Luthor in to consult on the project.

463
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:45,877
Of course to Lex,
"consult" means "take over."

464
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,963
I do my best to serve my country,
Mr. President.

465
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,972
You know that.

466
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,763
You serve the pursuit of knowledge
above all else, Lex.

467
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,060
But I respect that.

468
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,307
If I may ask, sir,
what is it exactly that they retrieved?

469
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,937
See for yourself.

470
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,747
Christ on a cracker.

471
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,545
- Apologies, sir.
- That's all right, captain.

472
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,749
I just about shit a brick myself
first time I saw it.

473
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,800
The ship is made of
a fascinating alloy.

474
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,303
We haven't been able
to identify it yet.

475
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:38,103
Although we have been able to determine
the age and probable use of the vehicle.

476
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:43,605
But this, however spectacular, pales beside
what was found within the craft.

477
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:05,498
At first, we thought it was
a simple ornament, but now...

478
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:10,552
We're beginning to suspect that it's the doorway
to a power source as old as the universe itself.

479
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,931
- Why haven't you removed the ring?
- We've requested permission, Mr. Luthor.

480
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,885
But the brass is concerned
that it might be some kind of...

481
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,770
Problem solved.

482
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,567
Understand, it could take decades
to retro-engineer this weapon.

483
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,613
Why are you telling me this, sir?
Why did you bring me here?

484
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,908
Because, Captain Jordan, we're setting up
a new branch of the military.

485
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,494
And I want you to lead it.

486
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:51,919
It's finally completed, Diana,
and I wanted you to be the first to see it.

487
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:58,259
From here, I can be certain that the U.S.S.R.
ticks with the precision of a Swiss watch.

488
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,433
Brainiac.

489
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:11,113
- Summarize today's statistics please.
- Production is up eight percent.

490
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,032
Life expectancy has increased
to 97 Earth years

491
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:17,236
with greater increases predicted
over the next decade.

492
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:21,824
Suicides are down since I added
fluoxetine hydrochloride to the water supply.

493
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,331
- Birth rates are on the rise and...
- Thank you, Brainiac.

494
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:35,889
What is it?

495
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,598
My mother.

496
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,472
She wants to shut down
the Themysciran embassy.

497
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,350
What? After all I've achieved?

498
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,932
But how have you achieved it?

499
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,400
Better than the Gulags, isn't it?

500
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,528
Better than extermination.

501
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,578
A day will come when it won't be necessary,
Diana, but until then...

502
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,950
And what if that day doesn't come?

503
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:06,661
Is even one soul suffering like this
worth the price of your perfect world?

504
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,918
- On Paradise Island...
- Paradise Island is unique.

505
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,590
Human nature is dark, brutal.

506
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,089
It requires different methods.

507
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,593
Human nature or man's nature?

508
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:23,602
Would you prefer we were
like America? Brainiac.

509
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,646
A nation in decline, princess.
Economic depression.

510
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:32,399
Social unrest bordering on civil war.
Millions on the brink of starvation.

511
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,697
I had high hopes for Kennedy
when he was first elected.

512
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,901
But he's turned out
to be just like the rest of them.

513
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,578
Ranting about the Red Menace,
refusing all offers of aid.

514
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:46,079
Perhaps it would be more efficient, sir,
to invade their shores

515
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,252
and compel them to align
with the rest of the world?

516
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,829
Out of the question.

517
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:55,588
This global revolution has been,
with rare exceptions, bloodless.

518
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,638
America will eventually fall,
and we'll be there pick up the pieces.

519
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:04,097
Can't your mother see
that we're building a better world?

520
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,975
Queen Hippolyta believes
that freedom must spring from within,

521
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,649
that it can't be imposed from without,
no matter how high-minded the motives.

522
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,067
But...

523
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,736
I've told her to wait,
to give you more time.

524
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,734
I haven't given up on you yet.

525
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,270
- The dinner was wonderful, premier.
- What?

526
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,071
Yes. I'm glad you enjoyed it,
Mr. Ambassador.

527
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:02,276
It's been too long
since we spent an evening together.

528
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:07,114
We have missed your extraordinary hospitality
and your warm friendship.

529
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,826
As the representative of the People's Republic,
I have nothing but the greatest...

530
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,833
We've known each other for some years,
Ambassador Lee, have we not?

531
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,841
We have.

532
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:21,254
Then why are you still so cautious,
so tense, around me?

533
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,260
Tense? Ha, ha.

534
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,887
You are our savior.

535
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,766
The man who is bringing peace
and prosperity to a troubled world.

536
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,475
- Whose flag flies over my...
- The truth, ambassador.

537
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,854
You terrify me.

538
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,082
<i>Superman!</i>

539
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,212
Diana?

540
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,048
Ten seconds.

541
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:07,052
Batman said you have only 10 seconds
to find me before...

542
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,807
Eight seconds to track her voice here?

543
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,731
Heh. I expected you in six.

544
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,354
What have you done?

545
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,234
My Lasso of Truth...

546
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:26,534
its energy is part of me, of my very soul.

547
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,411
Batman used it to bind me psychically
and physically.

548
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,334
- And not even you have the power to...
- Shut up.

549
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,670
You see?

550
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:42,376
Now she's as obedient to me
as those poor mind-jacked dissidents are to you.

551
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:48,181
And she's under orders to kill herself
if you harm me in any way.

552
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,883
What do you want?

553
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:54,392
What I've wanted since I was a child,
to destroy you.

554
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:58,725
To break and utterly humiliate
the great Superman.

555
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:04,736
For all your powers, you've always
underestimated the greatest weapon of all,

556
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,566
the human mind.

557
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:12,998
I can see your brain from here, Batman,
and it's nothing to boast about.

558
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,790
And can you see...?

559
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,040
- You think you're going to stop me with that?
- No.

560
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,375
With this.

561
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,220
Sun lamps? Wonderful.

562
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,897
Let them burn for a few thousand years
and I might get...

563
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,732
Impossible.

564
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:48,317
These lamps were provided
by a mutual friend of ours from America,

565
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,743
who specializes in the impossible.

566
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:02,540
They simulate the conditions of a red sun.
The conditions of your home world.

567
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,167
Pain is a new sensation, yes?

568
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,370
Get used to it.

569
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,723
I saved you all.

570
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,227
Destroyed the Gulags.

571
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,980
Gave you paradise.

572
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,436
Did you?

573
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,068
You and Comrade Stalin
may have different methods,

574
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,992
but you're variations
on the same tiresome theme.

575
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,991
Narcissistic, power-hungry egomaniacs

576
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,791
bent on reshaping the world
in their own grotesque image.

577
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:32,136
But, in the end, all men like you
inevitably fall.

578
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:38,392
There you will stay
for the remainder of your wretched life

579
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:44,520
while my followers rise up
and finally take our country back.

580
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,704
You may speak freely.

581
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,127
You're a monster.

582
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,954
And he's not?

583
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,290
Men...

584
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,462
All of you alike in the end.

585
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,470
My mother was right!

586
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,330
No.

587
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,522
Game's over, Batman.

588
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:15,197
You don't understand at all, do you?

589
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,526
It may be a game to you, but not to me.

590
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,781
Never to me.

591
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:25,409
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you,
I'm going to help you.

592
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,290
Just a few hours of brain surgery,

593
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,090
and then, a nice job
in a Moscow laundry for you.

594
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,976
Diana, let me help you.

595
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,150
Like you were going to help Batman?

596
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,352
What?

597
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,108
No, of course not.

598
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,986
- I was just...
- I couldn't let you die, Superman.

599
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,952
But I can no longer call
myself your friend.

600
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,715
This is what all men
bring upon themselves in the end.

601
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:21,591
And this is what happens
to women foolish enough to trust them.

602
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:29,933
As it was with the Lasso of Truth,
it is now with us.

603
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:33,518
The bond has been broken.

604
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:53,914
<i>After years of unrest,
insurrection, and political assassinations,</i>

605
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,125
<i>the end of the American epoch
seemed assured.</i>

606
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:03,511
<i>The election of Alexander J. Luthor proved to be
a miraculous turning point for the United States.</i>

607
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,011
<i>President Luthor,</i>

608
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:10,643
<i>ably assisted by Vice President Olsen
and Press Secretary Lois Lane-Luthor,</i>

609
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,817
<i>slowly brought the country back
from decades of chaos.</i>

610
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,988
<i>Under his leadership,
a thriving democracy has been restored,</i>

611
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,908
<i>and America is on the rebound.</i>

612
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:27,113
<i>But the U.S. recovery has sent ripples
of unrest through the Soviet Empire</i>

613
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:33,795
<i>as people across the globe begin to realize
that you don't have to give one man all the power</i>

614
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,169
<i>in order for the world to be a better place.</i>

615
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,420
Turn it off.

616
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,554
I'll give Luthor one thing,
he's a master of propaganda.

617
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,478
A handful of unruly demonstrations,
and they call it an uprising.

618
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:53,978
The American resurgence is having
an impact, sir,

619
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,933
and not an advantageous one.

620
01:00:56,027 --> 01:01:00,192
I estimate that within three years, discontent
in the Warsaw Pact nations will reach critical...

621
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,615
I don't care about your estimations.

622
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,777
Sorry, Brainiac.

623
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:11,208
I am, as I often remind you,
an artificial life form void of emotion.

624
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,751
There is never a need to apologize.

625
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,164
May I speak freely, sir?

626
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,294
Of course.

627
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:24,846
Luthor has always been a danger,
yet, for years, you resisted direct action,

628
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:28,971
remaining firm in the belief
that America will consume itself.

629
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,302
Be the engine of its own destruction.

630
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,389
And it almost was. It will be.

631
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:39,648
It is my assessment that an invasion
of the United States is our only recourse.

632
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,651
Conquer the Americans. Capture Luthor.

633
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,528
Recondition him.

634
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:51,539
No. If I'd wanted to, I could have attacked
and brought America to its knees years ago.

635
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,663
But I want to achieve my goals
by winning the argument,

636
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,995
not beating my opponents into submission.

637
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:01,753
At the moment, sir,
President Luthor is the one who is winning.

638
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,883
America is like a cancer cell,
and it must be removed.

639
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:09,682
If we attack now, I estimate a total
of only six and a half million dead.

640
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,849
No!

641
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,773
That's a choice I will never make.

642
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:24,025
The choice may have
just been made for you, sir.

643
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,859
Missiles?

644
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,491
Those are not missiles.

645
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:49,631
Home base, this is Colonel Jordan.
ETA red bunker, 20 minutes.

646
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,805
<i>Copy, Jordan.</i>

647
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:54,101
<i>We're only gonna get one shot at this,
so knock it out of the park.</i>

648
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,187
Roger, home base.

649
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,814
Unidentified flying object approaching,
Colonel Jordan.

650
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,314
Approximate speed is really freaking fast.

651
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,771
- Nervous, captain?
- No, sir.

652
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,902
Given the stakes, fear is
a luxury we can't afford.

653
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,279
Damn right.

654
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,282
Look alive, Lanterns. We've got incoming.

655
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,903
Focus, Lanterns! Think!

656
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,605
Green thoughts!

657
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,876
That the best you've got?

658
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:18,686
- Oh, God, that freak is unstoppable!
- Keep it together, Gardner! Focus your will!

659
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,510
We've got him, colonel.

660
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,012
We sure as hell...

661
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,154
Diana.

662
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,867
I should have known
you'd come to back me up.

663
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,664
Back you up?

664
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,870
In the name of the friendship we once shared,
in the name of this planet we both love,

665
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:31,380
I have come to beg you, all of you,
to stop this now,

666
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:36,089
before the entire Earth is consumed
in your insane war.

667
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,423
Stop?

668
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,180
- But Luthor...
- Peace is the way, Superman.

669
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,886
Let me intercede.

670
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,269
- Let me speak to President Luthor and...
- That monster could manipulate you,

671
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,645
convince you to turn against me
in a matter of minutes.

672
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,227
Do you really think so little of me?

673
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,405
That's not what I meant, Diana,
but I can't stop now.

674
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,234
Don't you see? He's given me no choice.

675
01:05:56,327 --> 01:06:00,697
What I see
is that the man I once admired is long gone,

676
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,281
if he was ever there.

677
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,117
Then I am truly sorry.

678
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,920
You're just another pathetic man,
aren't you?

679
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:17,847
Diana.

680
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:22,139
As of this moment,
the Amazon Nation washes its hands of you.

681
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:27,606
Themyscira will remain hidden
to men's eyes for all eternity.

682
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,736
Farewell, Superman.

683
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,441
We will never see each other again.

684
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,251
Women, right?

685
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,422
Light him up!

686
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,107
You were right, Brainiac.

687
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:22,031
It's time to take this straight to Luthor.

688
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,888
Unexpected, sir. No soldiers.

689
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:25,887
No Secret Service.

690
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,602
No defense at all.

691
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,560
He's up to something.

692
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,030
Whatever the game is, Luthor,

693
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,860
whatever ultimate weapon
you're planning to unleash...

694
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,244
it's too late.

695
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,672
It's never too late.

696
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,269
How did you get that?

697
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,525
My husband is always 10 steps ahead of you.

698
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:24,368
Look at them.

699
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,953
Like specimens in a laboratory.

700
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,496
Like flies in amber.

701
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,455
Just the way you wanted it.

702
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,038
What are you saying?

703
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,623
I've spent decades trying to restore them.

704
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:43,336
You're telling me that Brainiac
couldn't have done it at any time?

705
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:48,220
No. Brainiac was damaged when I found him.
We tried and tried to undo this but...

706
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:52,599
Actually, sir, the restoration technology
was always available.

707
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,102
But you did not want me to utilize it.

708
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,441
I never said that.

709
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,894
Words were not necessary.

710
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:04,527
Stalingrad is a representation
of all you have worked for.

711
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,449
All you desire.

712
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,453
The perfect symbol for a dictator

713
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,329
who's spent his entire life
trying to put the whole world in a bottle.

714
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,416
You have to believe me...

715
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:28,510
all I wanted was to put
an end to human suffering.

716
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:55,367
Shut down your weapons systems, Brainiac.
We're going home.

717
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,042
Not recommended, sir.

718
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:01,919
Retreat now will give the Americans
the advantage, throw the U.S.S.R. into chaos.

719
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,215
I don't care.

720
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,801
Stalin once called me a blind kitten.

721
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:12,475
So pure in my beliefs, so walled in by my ideals,
that I was unable to see reality.

722
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,935
Maybe he was right.

723
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:23,319
But I finally do see that
this is humanity's world.

724
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:26,397
And they have to be free
to make their own mistakes,

725
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,073
chart their own course.

726
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,493
And your perfect world, your Utopia, sir?

727
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,530
It's in their hands.

728
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,872
That is an unacceptable response.

729
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,336
I urge you to reconsider.

730
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,552
Lois, get inside!

731
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,895
You were never reprogrammed, were you?
You wanted me to bring you to Moscow.

732
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,772
A superb strategy, was it not?

733
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,821
Expanding and consuming, nation by nation.

734
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:12,572
Why settle for a city in a bottle
when you can possess an entire world?

735
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:34,641
Lex?

736
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,352
What is this thing?

737
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,650
You know I'm always prepared, dear.

738
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:54,451
- Get down to the bunker and let me handle this.
- You could die out here.

739
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:58,372
Really, Lois, all these years together
and you have so little faith in me?

740
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,158
I've never lost faith.

741
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,140
We've gotta get through his force field.

742
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,731
My force fields have been
immeasurably improved since Stalingrad.

743
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,778
You barely pierced them then.

744
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:35,405
And only because I allowed it.

745
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:41,975
You used me, manipulated me
as if I were some brainless puppet.

746
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,807
My methods were not unlike yours,
only more efficient.

747
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,232
Until now.

748
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,715
This is illogical.

749
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:17,670
You are merely a thing of flesh,
while I am...

750
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,755
A useless machine.

751
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,942
Well done, Superman.

752
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:38,448
Now, having realized what a sociological
disaster you've been causing,

753
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,617
will you have the decency to leave Earth?

754
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:44,743
My only plan right now is to bury this ship
in the Sea of Tranquility.

755
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,585
Then, I'll decide whether or not
I can safely stay on Earth...

756
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,329
What the hell?

757
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:58,051
He must have had a self-destruct mechanism
encoded into the hard drive

758
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,719
in case he was defeated.

759
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,807
The six mini black holes that powered
his engines have been primed to go off,

760
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,726
and I can't stop it.

761
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,053
Then it's on me.

762
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:11,390
When it explodes, it's gonna wipe out
everything in a 15 million mile radius.

763
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,398
- Even you aren't fast enough to get it clear.
- Don't count on it.

764
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,229
Get out of here, Lex.

765
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,440
- But...
- Go. Now.

766
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,519
What's he doing?

767
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,067
Saving the world.

768
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,844
<i>Remember when we were small,</i> solnyshka?

769
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,340
<i>How I used to save you from those bullies?</i>

770
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:31,060
<i>Now you must save all of us.</i>

771
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,891
<i>Use your power to...</i>

772
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,290
<i>Superman gone.</i>

773
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,840
<i>Brainiac gone.</i>

774
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,262
One could be forgiven for thinking

775
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,012
that this had all been worked out
to the tenth decimal point 25 years ago.

776
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:27,905
Checkmate, Superman.

777
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:42,382
It is with no small amount of sorrow
and a vast amount of pride,

778
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:48,806
that I stand before you today to say farewell
to this sacred office and its sacred trust.

779
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:53,431
With the death of Superman, the collapse
of the Soviet Empire is inevitable.

780
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,261
We see it happening even now.

781
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:58,940
But it's not the American way
to leave an enemy gasping in the dust.

782
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:04,397
We will reach out. We will give aid
and comfort to the Russian people.

783
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,575
And with the determination and compassion
so unique to the spirit of this nation,

784
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:11,278
we will reinvigorate the Soviet economy.

785
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,080
A people that have lived too long
in the shadow of oppression

786
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:19,127
will awaken to the true power,
the shining glory, of democracy.

787
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:25,133
Be assured that, in time, all the Soviet nations
will gladly and willingly join us

788
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,508
in the formation of
a truly global United States.

789
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,804
The world we'll build
together won't be perfect,

790
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:36,227
but it will be one we can all be proud of

791
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:39,977
because it will be a reflection
of the very best of humanity.

792
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,325
My resignation has shocked many of you,

793
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:55,406
but a man has to know
when it's time to leave the stage.

794
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:58,116
I leave it in the capable hands
of a truly great man

795
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,874
who has worked beside me
for more years than I'd dare to count.

796
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:04,251
President James B. Olsen.

797
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:06,875
Jimmy!

798
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,174
Jimmy! Yeah!

799
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:14,929
I entrust that vision not just
to President Olsen but to all of you.

800
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:20,021
And with that, I bid you all
a truly heartfelt farewell.

801
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,909
Time to leave the stage, huh?

802
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:39,787
Well, time to leave that stage.

803
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,456
What are you gonna do now?

804
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,080
Oh, I don't know.

805
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:49,339
Write the great American novel maybe?
Find a cure for the common cold?

806
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,339
Or maybe I'll just retire to a desert island
with the smartest,

807
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:58,302
strongest, most challenging,
most beautiful woman I've ever known.

808
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,396
I kind of like that last option.

2
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,756
You ever think about dying?

3
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,231
Yeah. You?

4
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,908
Yeah. Some.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,199
You think there's a heaven?

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,951
Yeah. Don't you?

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,113
I don't know.

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,798
Yeah, maybe.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,828
Can you believe there's a heaven
if you don't believe in hell?

10
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,154
I guess you can believe
what you want to.

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,189
This ranch has been in my family
as long as anyone can remember.

12
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,673
My granddaddy used to tell me
this was heaven on earth.

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
Just like his granddaddy
used to tell him.

14
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,993
Everything's changed now
since he died.

15
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,791
Appreciate you lighting them candles.

16
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,919
It wasn't me. It was the lady.

17
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,229
My mother?

18
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,839
She was here?

19
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,637
She's left already?

20
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,268
All I ever wanted was to live
out there like him...

21
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,590
...and work my own spread.

22
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,353
Can't imagine no better life.

23
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,668
I've come to find out Mama
aims to sell it.

24
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,916
Says the oil company would pay
three times what is worth.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,390
Mama lives in San Antonio now
with her new husband.

26
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,588
She wants to be in the live theatre.

27
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,236
As your granddaddy's only child...

28
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,510
...your mother inherits outright.

29
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,073
Is her property.
She can do whatever she wants.

30
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,508
I don't have any say-so?

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,229
What about my father?

32
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,873
They're divorced.

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,233
You could talk to her.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,989
You're a lawyer.

35
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,509
Well, I have talked to her.

36
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,433
Is a sorry piece of business,
but, son...

37
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,758
...not everybody thinks life
on a cattle ranch in Texas...

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,349
...is the second-best thing
to going to heaven.

39
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,830
She don't want to live
out there, thas all.

40
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,230
If it was a paying proposition,
thad be one thing, but it ain't.

41
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,555
It could be.

42
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,598
I could run it.

43
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,031
Is his own damn fault.

44
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,153
Your father signed every
paper she set in front of him.

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,954
Never lifted a hand to save himself.

46
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,396
I begged him to get a lawyer.

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,555
Well...

48
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm sorry to have no better news...

49
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,678
...but some things in this world
can't be helped.

50
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,396
I believe this is probably
one of them.

51
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,835
She went back to San Antonio.

52
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,348
Don't call her "she."

53
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,993
Mama.

54
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,350
I thought the world of that old man.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,510
Yeah.

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,358
Don't go crying on me now.

57
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,830
I ain't.

58
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,678
- Well, don't.
- I ain't.

59
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,555
- What do you think I should do?
- I don't think there's much to do.

60
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,557
- Will you talk to her?
- I can't.

61
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,113
You could talk to her.

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,276
Last conversation I had with her...

63
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,309
...was in San Diego, California,
in 1942.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,638
It ain't her fault.

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,670
I ain't the same as I once was.

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,110
Like to think I am...

67
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,795
...but I ain't.

68
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,072
You are inside.

69
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,232
Inside you are.

70
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,953
Is hard to watch people you came
from waste away before your eyes.

71
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,557
When the land is gone too...

72
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,672
...there's nothing to stand on
or stand for either.

73
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,396
When do y'all have to be out?

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,910
Closing is the first of June.

75
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,271
You could wait till then.

76
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,599
What for?

77
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,637
Down in Mexico...

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,190
...they got ranches so big...

79
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,472
...you can't ride from one end
to the other in a week.

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,275
It ain't all fenced in
and sold off and played out.

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,072
Not down there.

82
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,792
You think they can't use
two more top hands?

83
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,270
Real cowboys, huh?

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,829
Just like the old-time waddies.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,274
If I don't go, will you go anyways?

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,472
I'm already gone.

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,439
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye.

88
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,916
May God go with you.

89
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,752
Be careful.

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,715
Is that you, bud?

91
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,512
I hope so.

92
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,073
- You ready?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,271
- They suspect anything?
- No.

94
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,233
- Les go.
- Hang on. Got to pile all this stuff.

95
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,237
- Yonder goes the light.
- Damn.

96
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,159
- Late for your own funeral.
- He could be getting milk.

97
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,151
He could just be loading a shotgun.

98
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,831
Shut up. Lacey, there's been
somebody following us.

99
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,389
- Somebody on horseback?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,669
Come on.

101
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,554
Some kid.

102
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,910
Thas a hell of a horse.

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,633
Ain't it, though?

104
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,912
You hunting us?

105
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,634
- I ain't hunting you.
- Why you following us?

106
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,037
I ain't. I'm going to Langtry.
I don't even know you.

107
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,356
- Where'd you get that horse?
- Is mine.

108
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,198
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

109
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,470
- Lying sack of shit!
- You don't know.

110
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,030
I know you ain't no goddamn 16.

111
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,231
- Whad you do, run off?
- What if I did?

112
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,957
We could sell his horse in Mexico.

113
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,799
- You want to?
- I ain't digging no grave this time.

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,959
Your idea. I was the one that said
just leave him for the buzzards.

115
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,675
Call it.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,989
Heads.

117
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,514
Damn.

118
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,713
Let me have your rifle.

119
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,233
It ain't fair.
You shot the last three.

120
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,829
You go on, then. You can owe me.

121
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,188
Hold his horse.
It might not be gun-broke.

122
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,116
Y'all ain't never shot nobody.

123
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,993
You could be a good somebody
to start with.

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
Y'all just funning.
I knowed it all along.

125
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,479
Who's hunting you?

126
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,230
Nobody.

127
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,829
They're hunting that horse,
though, right?

128
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,313
You ain't riding with us.
Get us in the jailhouse.

129
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,555
He belongs to me.

130
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,070
Son, I don't give a shit
who he belongs to.

131
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,834
But he damn sure don't belong to you.

132
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,314
Now, les go, bud.

133
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,955
I thought he'd put up more
of a argument.

134
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,633
We ain't seen the last
of his skinny ass.

135
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,229
Thas her, ain't it?
Thas the goddamn Rio Grande.

136
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,754
Just think. Over yonder's Old Mexico.

137
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,236
You reckon you want to cross now?

138
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,837
Yeah. You?

139
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,789
Yeah.

140
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,479
Maybe we'd better rest
these horses up first.

141
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,154
All right.

142
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,673
Shit.

143
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,833
I got a uneasy feeling
about that son of a bitch.

144
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,633
I do too.

145
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,190
He ain't as green as he looks,
neither.

146
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,028
There won't nobody
be hunting me in Mexico.

147
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,356
That all depends on what you done.

148
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,074
- Whas your name?
- Jimmy Blevins.

149
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,554
You got any grub?

150
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,029
No.

151
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,239
You got any money?

152
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,909
No.

153
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,832
You're just a deadhead.

154
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,832
Just tell me one thing.

155
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,069
What the hell would we want you
with us for?

156
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,312
Because I'm a American.

157
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,438
When did you eat last?

158
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,954
Other day.

159
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,437
Your name ain't Blivit, is it?

160
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,354
Is Blevins.

161
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,794
You know what a blivit is?

162
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,395
No. What?

163
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,034
Ten pounds of shit
in a five-pound sack.

164
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,876
Y'all ain't said y'all's names was.

165
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,796
I'm John Grady Cole.
This here's Lacey Rawlins.

166
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,158
We're from San Angelo.
Where you from?

167
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,272
Uvalde County.
Near the Sabinal River.

168
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,069
What made you light out for Mexico?

169
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,749
Same reason as you.

170
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,679
What reason is that?

171
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,990
Because they'd go bowlegged
and blind finding your ass down here.

172
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,315
Nobody's hunting me.

173
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,593
I told that son of a bitch
he wasn't whupping me again.

174
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,711
- Your daddy?
- No.

175
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,831
He never came back from the war.

176
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,439
Your stepdaddy.

177
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,996
I know what is like
to get a beating.

178
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,148
You didn't shoot him?

179
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,590
I woulןve. And he knowed it too.

180
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,796
Suppose we trade that horse off
for one less likely get us shot.

181
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,560
- I ain't trading horses.
- We ain't no wet nurses.

182
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,830
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

183
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,157
Hell, you're a regular
old desperado, ain't you?

184
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,990
I reckon you got your own gun and all.

185
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,349
Yeah, I got a gun.

186
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,629
What kind of a gun?

187
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,390
- 32-20 Colt.
- Bullshit.

188
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,471
Thas a rifle cartridge.

189
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,635
Les see it.

190
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,791
Where'd you get a gun like this?

191
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,228
At the getting place.

192
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,272
- You ever shot it?
- Yeah, I shot it.

193
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,590
- You hit anything?
- Anything you want.

194
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,028
Bullshit.

195
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,231
All right, les go, outlaw. Come on.

196
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,472
You ready, Annie Oakley?

197
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,153
Waiting on you.

198
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,033
Goddamn.

199
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,555
Let me see it.

200
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,790
- Let me see it.
- We'd better get going.

201
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,549
- Come on, give it to me.
- You know what my wallet looks like.

202
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,353
Look at this shit.

203
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,471
She got anything to drink?

204
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,519
What is that?

205
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,273
- Cider.
- All right.

206
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,238
Les have three of them.

207
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,439
How much is it?

208
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,868
Is like three cents.

209
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,230
Oh, let your old dad buy it.

210
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,279
He about dead-centred
your pocketbook, didn't he?

211
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,112
I want you to look at my
goddamn driver's license.

212
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,677
And my pool hall card.

213
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,711
You won't need them down here.

214
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,639
Look at this shit.

215
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,791
Shot Betty Ward between the eyes.

216
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,118
Whas she doing in there?
I didn't know you liked her.

217
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,436
What is this? Cactus juice?

218
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,868
I don't know.

219
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,915
- Got a little kick to it, though.
- I think it does.

220
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,511
Pretty doggone good.

221
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,991
Say it again. Say my name again.

222
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,349
Golly!

223
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,438
What am I doing leaving
my hat on the bed? Is not much.

224
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,835
You can't have no more cider.

225
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,153
Shit.

226
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,636
I'm drunker than shit.

227
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,432
Can you ride or not?

228
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,198
Hell, yeah, I can ride.

229
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,791
I was riding when I fell off.

230
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,309
I'm a regular buckaroo.

231
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,988
Certified damn bronc peeler.

232
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,953
Just leave him lay there.

233
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,630
Get on and quit assing around.
Is fixing to come a good one.

234
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,034
Come on.

235
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,598
I can't be out in this.

236
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,189
- Where do you think you'll go?
- Why can't you?

237
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,913
On account of the lightning.

238
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,839
Damn if you don't look
sober all of a sudden.

239
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,952
- Are you afraid of lightning?
- It runs in the family.

240
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,756
My grandpa, he was killed
in West Virginia in a mine bucket.

241
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,599
It run all the way down the hole
to get him, 180 feet.

242
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,351
A great-uncle on my mother's side...

243
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,315
...was killed off a horse. Horse's
hair wasn't singed, but it killed him.

244
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,755
I got a cousin not
four year older than me.

245
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,235
He was struck by lightning
coming back from his barn.

246
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,392
Melted the fillings in his teeth
and soldered his jaw shut.

247
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,909
He's gone completely dipshit.

248
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,309
I done been struck twice myself.

249
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,195
How come me be deaf in this one ear?

250
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,670
I'm born to death by fire, man.

251
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,679
You'd better get away from all metal.
You don't know what id get you.

252
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,110
Your boot spurs, shirt buttons...

253
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,878
What do you intend to do?

254
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,308
Outride it.

255
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,516
You can't outride a thunderstorm.
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,233
Is the only chance I got.

257
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,589
I knowed it from the first time that
son of a bitch had a loose nut.

258
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,471
What the hell are you doing?!

259
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,159
Just sitting here.

260
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,310
If this rain hits hard, there'll be
a river come down like a train.

261
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,788
You thought about that?

262
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,629
You've never been struck by lightning.
You don't know what is like.

263
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,876
You'll drown sitting there.

264
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,195
Thas all right. I ain't never
been drowned before.

265
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,235
Well...

266
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,189
...l'll say no more.

267
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,992
Your horse is gone.

268
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,958
Yeah, I know. I done been on foot
looking around this morning.

269
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,432
Where'd you find that boot?

270
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,439
On the ground.

271
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,951
Well, what do you aim to do?

272
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,039
I don't know.

273
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,515
Les get your ass up out of there.

274
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,470
Got a spare shirt in my saddlebag.
You put that on.

275
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,955
Appreciate it.

276
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,913
Rawlins will pitch a pure hissy
when he sees you.

277
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,314
I don't give a shit.

278
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,838
There's my damn pistol.

279
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,268
- Shit.
- Hold on.

280
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,195
Keep riding. Good God almighty.

281
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,436
I ain't leaving until I get my stuff.

282
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,596
- My gun too.
- Listen at that.

283
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,837
Get us all shot for horse-stealing
don't mean a thing.

284
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,600
- It ain't stealing. Is mine.
- Shit-for-brains!

285
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,119
Hush. Both of you.

286
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,998
Get over here and sit down.

287
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,352
We're going to stick here...

288
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,270
...till about a hour before daylight.

289
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,758
Now, you got to play this
exactly like we say.

290
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,760
If that don't satisfy,
you tell us right now.

291
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,632
Yeah. Okay.

292
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,029
All right.

293
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,591
You go on and get some sleep.

294
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,798
And no fire tonight.

295
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,678
Every dumb thing I ever done
in my life...

296
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,672
...there was a decision I made
before that got me into it.

297
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,791
It was never the dumb thing.

298
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,189
It was always some choice I'd
made before. You understand?

299
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,199
Yeah, I think so.

300
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,593
Meaning what?

301
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,552
Meaning this is it.

302
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,949
This is our last chance. Won't be
no other time, I guarantee it.

303
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,151
- Meaning just leave him?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,589
What if it was you?

305
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,155
I wouldn't leave you, or you me.

306
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,918
You realize the fix he's in?

307
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,115
I realize it. Is the fix
he's put himself in.

308
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,679
I can't do it.

309
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,231
Well, if you can't, you can't.

310
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,599
I guess I knew what you'd say anyways.

311
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,195
Oh, no. Damn it.

312
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,319
That little son of a bitch.

313
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,230
Hold up, hold up. Les listen.

314
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,596
You little son of a bitch.

315
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,153
- Boys, they're coming.
- Cars or horses?

316
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,113
Horses. And there ain't no way
y'all can keep up.

317
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,108
I'll take the road. They'll follow
the dust, since they're hunting me.

318
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,959
Get in the woods.
I'll see y'all down the road.

319
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,469
Les get off this damn road.

320
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,433
You think they caught him?

321
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,548
I don't know.

322
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,360
I'll say one thing for him anyways.

323
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,988
Whas that?

324
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,479
Son of a bitch wouldn't stand still
for nobody hijacking his horse.

325
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,119
You got your boots on?

326
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,311
- Yeah.
- All right.

327
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,671
You reckon they're friendly?

328
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,831
Shoot, I hope so.

329
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,993
Where are you going?

330
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,438
We're just passing through.

331
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,358
We're looking for work.

332
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,476
Oh, yeah?

333
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,716
We might have some work for you.

334
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,519
He said maybe.

335
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,155
Can we come with you?

336
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,709
Yes, of course.

337
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,790
Good.

338
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,710
Go that way.

339
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,550
Over there?

340
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,196
Did you see that little darling?

341
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,232
Watch it. Bring him over here.

342
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,794
Get in there.

343
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,434
How long you reckon
you'd like to stay here?

344
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,551
About a hundred years.

345
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,552
Now go to sleep.

346
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,874
There's Don Hector Rocha y Villareal.

347
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,312
Owns this whole shebang.

348
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,438
One of the last great ranches
in Mexico.

349
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,916
27,000 acres.

350
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,078
Flies his own plane
to Mexico City every week.

351
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,910
Manuel said this ranch been
in this family 170 years.

352
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,676
You reckon that was his daughter?

353
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,838
Yeah, I guess it was.

354
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,111
Let me go get my boots on.

355
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,359
Looks like there's
about 12 or 13 of them.

356
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,709
I make it 16.

357
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,472
Armando said the old man's got
like 400 mustangs up on that mesa.

358
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,715
Damn.

359
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,512
You think you and me can break
all 16 of them in four days?

360
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,878
- Why four days?
- You think we could do it?

361
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,958
You'd be about a wore-out sumbuck,
I'll tell you that.

362
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,633
I'll have a look at them.
Go talk to Armando.

363
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,913
How you doing?

364
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,553
I'm all right.

365
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,594
If we mess this up, bud, is gonna be
a long ride back to Texas.

366
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,109
Give it some slack.

367
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,153
Thas it. Thas it. Whoa, boy.

368
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,756
I'll put a saddle on you right now.

369
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,669
Your jackets.

370
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,753
You tired?

371
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,760
The horse is arriving, get ready.

372
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,279
Don't delay!

373
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,712
Hector de la Rocha y Villareal.

374
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,989
John Grady Cole.

375
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,428
Glad to meet you.

376
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,713
Alfonsa, you look like
an lmpressionist painting.

377
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,674
Armando says you know
a lot about horses.

378
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,677
I've been around them some.

379
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,510
Do you know what a criollo is?

380
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,512
Yes, sir. Is a Argentine horse.

381
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,199
You're from Texas?

382
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,634
Yes, sir.

383
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,753
San Angelo.

384
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,273
Why are you here?

385
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,709
I just wanted to see the country,
I reckon. Or we did.

386
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,031
- You and your friend.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,638
But you are the leader.

388
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,276
We don't have no leaders.
No, we're just buddies.

389
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,114
Of course.

390
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,194
I recently purchased a thoroughbred
stallion of excellent blood.

391
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,679
- You gonna raise racehorses?
- No. Quarter horses.

392
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,835
I'm thinking of breeding my stallion
with my mesteno mares.

393
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,599
Whas your opinion on that?

394
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,877
Well, I've known it done.

395
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,159
There's been good cow horses
sired out of thoroughbreds.

396
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,271
Of what importance is the mare?

397
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,552
Same as the sire. In my opinion.

398
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,473
Most breeders place more confidence
in the stallion.

399
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,795
Yes, sir, they do.

400
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,438
But I agree with you.

401
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,194
And you rode all the way here
from Texas?

402
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,829
Yes, sir.

403
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,110
- You and your friend?
- Yes, sir.

404
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,552
Just the two of you.

405
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,635
Yes, sir.

406
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,919
Just me and him.

407
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,953
Well, Mr. Cole, would you like
to see some horses?

408
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,876
Yes, sir.

409
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,637
- It ain't like you was going away.
- No. We'd still be working together.

410
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,230
Is a good opportunity for you.

411
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,352
Hell, I'd do it.

412
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
They told me to come bunk in here.

413
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,030
I was going to put my horse
in one of these stalls.

414
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,514
Can I put my horse in this stall?

415
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,791
Well, I guess we can talk later.

416
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,715
Thas your mare.

417
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,959
Look at the eye on her.

418
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,593
Bring this one here.

419
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,357
She's not as big as the other one,
but thas your mare.

420
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,192
Do you like this one?

421
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,429
She's a beauty.

422
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,313
Looks like some of them
got their hats on, bud.

423
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,794
I figure you just must be ready to cry
yourself to sleep every night.

424
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,312
She's probably used to dating guys got
their own airplanes, let alone cars.

425
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,874
You're probably right.

426
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,076
I'm glad to hear you say it.

427
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,350
It don't change nothing though.

428
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,671
My name's John Grady Cole.

429
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,672
My name is Alejandra.

430
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,429
I know.

431
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,117
I hoped that you would come.

432
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,713
I come because I thought
you'd be here.

433
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,508
I know.

434
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,791
My granddaddy lived
his whole life on that ranch.

435
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,276
Seventy-four years.

436
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,799
Seem there could hardly be one
without the other.

437
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,274
I guess...

438
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,309
...the country lasts forever,
and people ain't but for a while.

439
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,237
And how will you live now?

440
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,678
Where will your home be?

441
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,875
Whas wrong?

442
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,632
I dreamed about you last night.

443
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,518
What did you dream about?

444
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,678
Someday I may tell you.

445
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,919
But not tonight.

446
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,318
Do I have something in my nose?

447
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,869
No. I have something in my nose.

448
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,874
Do you like him?

449
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,479
A hell of a horse.

450
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,472
I want to ride him.

451
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,989
What?

452
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,638
I want to ride him.

453
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,875
When?

454
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,355
Now.

455
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,350
- I want to now.
- He don't have a saddle.

456
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,549
I know.

457
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,950
I don't think the patrףn would want me
to give him to you without a saddle.

458
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,758
Your father.

459
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,789
Get down.

460
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,831
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes!

461
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,349
Hurry.

462
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,592
Well, what do you aim to do
with your horse?

463
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,075
I want you to take him
back to the barn.

464
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,038
Somebody's gonna see me.

465
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,878
Fixing to get me in trouble.

466
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,952
You are in trouble.

467
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,269
I am Senorita Alfonsa.

468
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,637
I'm John Grady Cole.

469
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,070
I'm happy that you have come.

470
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,669
Alejandra will be in Mexico City
with her mother for two weeks.

471
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,235
Then she'll be here for the summer.

472
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,879
Alejandra and I disagree strongly.

473
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,914
In fact, I...

474
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,796
She's so much like me
at that age that l...

475
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,516
I seem, at times, to be struggling
with my own past self.

476
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,109
So you see, I cannot help but be
sympathetic to Alejandra.

477
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,669
But I won't have her unhappy.

478
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,756
I won't have her spoken ill of...

479
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,871
...or gossiped about.

480
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,476
I know what that is.

481
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,310
It is not proper for you to be seen
riding in campo together...

482
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,437
...without supervision.

483
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,753
I considered whether to speak
to my niece about it, but I...

484
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,997
I've decided not.

485
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,158
What do you want me to do?

486
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,870
I want you to be considerate
of a young girl's reputation.

487
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,513
I never meant not to be.

488
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,193
I believe you.

489
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,074
But you see...

490
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,910
...this is another country.

491
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,880
Here, a woman's reputation
is all she has.

492
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,198
There's no forgiveness...

493
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,788
...for women.

494
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,119
A man may lose his honour and regain
it again, but a woman cannot.

495
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,959
I guess I'd have to say
that don't seem right.

496
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,796
Is not a matter of right.

497
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,198
Is a matter of who must say.

498
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,359
And in this matter, I get to say.

499
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,994
What is it?

500
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,396
You're going to wake Esteban.

501
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,793
Then invite me in.

502
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,792
What did she say to you? My aunt?

503
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,315
You want to sit down?

504
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,389
Go on.

505
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,952
What did she say to you?

506
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,035
- Didn't she tell you what she said?
- Of course she did.

507
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,548
What did she say?

508
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,480
She said she didn't want me
being seen with you in the campo.

509
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,319
And you agreed?

510
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,950
- You are afraid of her.
- No.

511
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,156
Just like everyone else.

512
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,553
It ain't like that.

513
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,834
I hate the way she treats me.

514
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,712
I thought you were my friend.

515
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,159
You tell me what you want me to do.

516
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,317
I'll do anything you say.

517
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,993
How's it going, Esteban?

518
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,198
See you after a while.

519
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,872
I know the old man likes you...

520
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,197
...that don't mean he'll sit
for you courting his daughter.

521
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,068
Yeah, I know.

522
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,953
Well, I don't see you
holding no aces, bud.

523
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,349
I see you fixing to get us fired
and throwed off this place.

524
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,713
Take it easy, bud.

525
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,314
Get up!

526
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,633
Whas this all about?

527
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,795
No talking!

528
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,994
Yes, but I don't understand...

529
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,315
You understand "shut up"?

530
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,549
Les go.

531
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,640
I ain't above whipping your ass,
you know.

532
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,234
Don't you think if we're
gonna get out of this...

533
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,671
...we might think about how
to get out of it together?

534
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,032
Like the way we got in it?

535
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,037
You think it was Rocha?

536
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,870
You think he sold us down the river?

537
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,632
I tried to reason with you.
Tried many times.

538
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,068
I know.

539
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,956
Some things ain't reasonable.

540
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,553
Look, I'm the same man
you crossed that river with.

541
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,515
How I was is how I am.

542
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,955
And all I know to do is stick.

543
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,356
I don't believe in signing on
just till it quit suiting you.

544
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,190
You either stick or you quit.

545
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,354
I wouldn't quit you.
I don't care what you done.

546
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,551
Thas about all I got to say.

547
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,838
I never quit you.

548
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,594
All right.

549
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,834
Hey, y'all.

550
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,356
Oh, God help me.

551
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,353
How long you been in here?

552
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,549
I don't know.

553
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,194
A long time.

554
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,353
- At least a month.
- You told them to hunt us?

555
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,318
I wouldn't do nothing like it.

556
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,834
Bullshit.

557
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,590
They wouldn't hunt us if they got
that horse back. He done something.

558
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,631
It was my horse. My gun too.

559
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,673
- What did you do?
- Nothing nobody else wouldn't.

560
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,953
Did you come back here?

561
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,998
You're damn right I did.

562
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,157
Oh, Jesus, oh, God.

563
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,475
What did you do?

564
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,470
What are they accusing him of?

565
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,999
Murder.

566
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,871
He killed a man?

567
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,355
Three.

568
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,232
Said he killed three men.

569
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,311
Thas a damn lie.

570
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,672
Don't step in the bucket.

571
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,993
We're dead.

572
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,398
We're dead men.

573
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,234
I knew id come to this
from the first moment...

574
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,637
- Don't start. That won't help.
- Ain't but one of them died.

575
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,393
Tell me what happened.

576
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,470
Well, I got me a job on this farm.

577
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,637
Saved me up some money.

578
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,599
Then I rode back here
to get my pistol.

579
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,832
I seen it sticking in the son of a
bitch's belt, so I just grabbed it.

580
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,155
And shot him.

581
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,396
He come at me.
What choice did I have?

582
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,555
What choice...?

583
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,036
By the time I got back to the spring
where my horse was...

584
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,515
...they caught back up with me.

585
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,515
And the old boy, I shot off his horse.

586
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,350
He throwed down on me with a shotgun.

587
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,189
A rurales? Did you shoot a rurales?

588
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,836
- Yeah.
- Dead?

589
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,115
Yeah.

590
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,275
What do you think they mean to do?

591
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,151
- Send me to the penitentiary.
- You ain't gonna be that lucky.

592
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,112
Well, I'm too young to hang.

593
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,992
They'll lie about your age.

594
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,316
There's no capital punishment here.

595
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,830
- You knew they'd hunt us.
- Was I supposed to send a telegram?

596
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,478
- What happened to your feet?
- They busted them.

597
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,477
They didn't give you no bandages?

598
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,914
No.

599
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,549
Oh, shit.

600
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,157
Tell them whatever they want to hear.
It won't matter.

601
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,349
What did you say?

602
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,678
Told them we was murderers
and horse thieves. You will too.

603
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,151
Your friend told us everything.

604
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,672
Better that you do the same
to avoid some trouble.

605
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,869
You had no right to beat up
on that boy.

606
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,152
We know nothing about Blevins.
He asked to ride with us.

607
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,952
We know nothing about the horse.

608
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,038
It got away from him in the storm
and showed up here.

609
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,151
Thas when the trouble started.

610
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,313
We been working for Senor Rocha going
on three months down at La Purisima.

611
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,228
You went down there and told him lies.

612
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,112
Rawlins is as good a boy as ever
come out of Tom Green County.

613
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,038
Is that the criminal, Smith?

614
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,191
His name is Rawlins. He ain't
a criminal. I grew up with him.

615
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,631
The assassin Blevins,
he did not have any documents.

616
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,229
- He lost his clothes.
- He lost his clothes?

617
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,118
He has no feathers.

618
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,035
- He what?
- He has no feathers.

619
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,151
I wouldn't know anything about that.

620
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,558
That don't interest me.

621
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,195
Why does he come here
and steal horses?

622
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,277
- It was his horse.
- No, is not.

623
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,795
You have it your own ignorant way.

624
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,108
As far as I know, that horse is his.

625
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,553
He had it in Texas and I saw him
bring it to Mexico across a river.

626
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,591
That is not the facts.

627
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,710
We can make the truth here.
Or we can lose it here.

628
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,997
But in three days, you're going
to be going to Saltillo.

629
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,710
Then ill be too late for the truth.

630
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,034
Too late.

631
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,553
Because you'll be in the hands
of other peoples...

632
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,240
...and who's to say
what the truth will be then?

633
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,680
And then you'll think
about this day...

634
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,671
...and you'll blame yourself.

635
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,957
There ain't but one truth.

636
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,952
Truth is not what come out
of somebody's mouth.

637
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,999
The people in this town
are very quiet people.

638
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,515
Very quiet people all the time.

639
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,709
And then comes this
assassin Blevins...

640
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,589
...and he kills everybody
and steals their horses.

641
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,911
Why does he do this?

642
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,233
Was he a good, quiet boy
that never did no harm?

643
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,558
Then he comes here and does something
like that? Is that what happened?

644
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,154
No. No, thas not what happened.
Thas not the truth.

645
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,678
Truth is he was always
the other kind of boy.

646
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,996
He was never a quiet boy.

647
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,077
He was always the other kind.

648
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,153
What happened?

649
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,309
Nothing.

650
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,875
I think we're going to Saltillo.

651
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,790
Whas in Saltillo?

652
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,910
The penitentiary.

653
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,354
I think he wants to make
a deal with us.

654
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,992
What kind of a deal?

655
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,793
To keep quiet.

656
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,232
That kind of a deal.

657
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,757
Keep quiet about what?

658
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,638
About Blevins.

659
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,675
About what about Blevins?

660
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,517
I think they aim to kill him.

661
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,510
I think they aim to kill Blevins.

662
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,554
Boys...

663
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,916
...this is going to be a long trip.

664
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,834
The old man said
it would take all day.

665
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,918
I asked him. He said it was
going to take all day.

666
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,194
Whas here?

667
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,953
Unload the prisoners, boys.

668
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,799
- What do we do here?
- Take a leak, I reckon.

669
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,039
Unload the prisoners.

670
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,839
Put them against the wall.
Sit them down.

671
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,989
Les go.

672
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,318
What are they going to do?

673
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,109
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Let go of me.

674
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,709
Wait a minute.

675
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,032
Wait a minute. Let go of me.

676
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,031
This man came to me.

677
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,872
I don't go to this man.

678
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,918
He came to me to talk
with me about justice...

679
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,953
...and how his own brother had died
at the hands of the assassin Blevins.

680
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,594
Then when it came time
to do justice...

681
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,193
...he could not shoot.

682
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,392
He was like a woman.

683
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,200
A man cannot go out to do something...

684
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,912
...and then not do it.

685
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,590
No, a man does not change his mind.

686
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,274
Thas always been my way
in this world.

687
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,398
You didn't have to kill him.

688
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,349
Coulןve just walked him
back to the truck.

689
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,192
You don't know nothing.

690
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,157
See, in my country, we don't
have death for criminals.

691
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,790
Monies have to be paid...

692
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,476
...and arrangements have to be made.

693
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,471
I tell you this because...

694
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,638
...you'll have to make arrangements
with these peoples.

695
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,358
We don't have no money.

696
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,232
In here we have a boss, a jefe.

697
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,392
Everybody pays him.
Everybody does what he says.

698
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,709
I don't have any money. We ain't
fixing to make any arrangements.

699
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,717
Oh, excuse me, but you will.

700
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,789
I'm telling you this
because I like you.

701
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,997
You cannot stay here.

702
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,917
You stay here, you're gonna die.

703
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,156
And then comes other problems.

704
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,229
The paperwork is lost.
People cannot be found.

705
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,310
Who's to say you were even here?

706
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,471
Some crazy people can say
that God is here.

707
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,551
But God is not here.

708
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,470
Everybody knows that God is not here.

709
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,792
I never dreamed there was
such a place as this.

710
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,992
There's probably every
kind of place you can think of.

711
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,274
They're gonna kill us.

712
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,554
Don't let them think
they ain't gonna have to.

713
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,150
They either kill us or let us be.

714
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,998
Only way to get by in a place
like this is go about your business.

715
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,278
Don't act scared.

716
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,314
Where are you going?

717
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,592
I don't know, bud.

718
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,919
Got a match?

719
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,669
What is it?

720
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,235
A knife. A good one.

721
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,351
Whas it like to be dead?

722
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,956
It ain't like nothing at all.

723
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,831
Whas it like to be dead?

724
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,636
It ain't like nothing at all.

725
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,277
Yes, sir, you're a good healer. Fast.

726
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,315
You been doing any doctoring
on a boy named Lacey Rawlins?

727
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,069
Send you some soap, some towels...

728
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,515
...so you can wash up.

729
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,956
You don't know a Lacey Rawlins?

730
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,752
You are fortunate boys.

731
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,958
Fortunate boys.

732
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,878
Where's Rawlins?

733
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,993
He wait outside for you.

734
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,828
Right now?

735
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,272
Yes, now.

736
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,313
Where are we going?

737
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,760
You're going away.
You're going to your house.

738
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,714
Now?

739
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,509
Now.

740
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,318
I thought you'd died.

741
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,559
I thought you had.

742
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,238
Why ain't we dead?

743
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,558
She paid us out.

744
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,039
The old senora?

745
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,309
The aunt.

746
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,789
Why?

747
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,314
I don't know.

748
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,756
Is got to do with that girl.

749
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,632
I expect it does.

750
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,392
You going back down there?

751
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,998
Yeah, I guess I am.

752
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,759
On account of the girl.

753
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,958
But what about the horses?

754
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,912
The girl and the horses.

755
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,468
What about Rocha?

756
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,075
He'll have to do whatever
he has to do.

757
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,475
Don't go down there.

758
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,035
- I ain't asking you to go with me.
- I know.

759
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,679
They put Mexican blood in me
in that hospital.

760
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,029
So?

761
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,833
So, what does that mean?

762
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,029
About what?

763
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,716
Well, does that mean I'm part Mexican?

764
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,273
How much they put in you?

765
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,516
They said it was over a litre.

766
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,231
A liter would make you a half-breed.

767
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,516
- It don't, does it?
- No.

768
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,711
No, it don't mean nothing.

769
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,551
Is just blood.
It don't know where it come from.

770
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,755
You heard about what happened,
didn't you?

771
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,279
In the mess hall?

772
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,149
Yeah.

773
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,556
I never thought I'd do that.

774
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,432
You didn't have no choice.

775
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,792
He'd have done it to you.

776
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,511
You don't got to try to make it right.
It is what it is.

777
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,112
- Shit.
- What?

778
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,992
Nothing. Just shit.

779
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,794
What is it?

780
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,634
I keep thinking about old Blevins.

781
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,031
About how scared he was.

782
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,350
You'll feel better when you get home.

783
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,273
I don't think so.

784
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,913
I ain't Blevins.

785
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,399
I know you ain't.

786
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,392
I was wondering how much better off
you are than him.

787
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,554
I reckon I'll see you
one of these days.

788
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,074
You take care.

789
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,512
You take care too.

790
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,871
I think I'm owed an explanation.

791
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,075
I think the accounts have been settled
quite in your favour.

792
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,354
You have been a disappointment
to my nephew...

793
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,790
...and a considerable expense to me.

794
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,152
No offense, ma'am, but I've been
some inconvenienced myself.

795
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,150
Sit down, please.

796
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,278
The officers were here once before,
you know.

797
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,760
My nephew sent them away until
he conducted his own investigation.

798
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,148
He wanted so much to go on
believing in you.

799
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:26,353
- Why didn't he say something to me?
- He gave his word to the commandante.

800
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,596
He shoulןve let me
tell my side of it.

801
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,998
You had already lied to him once. Why
shouldn't he assume you'd do so again?

802
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,753
I never lied to him.

803
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,714
The affair of the stolen horse was
known here even before you arrived.

804
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,512
The thieves were Americans.

805
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:45,156
When he questioned you about this,
you denied everything.

806
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,036
Why'd you buy me out of jail?

807
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,673
I think you know why.

808
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,199
Because of Alejandra.

809
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,389
Yes.

810
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,238
What did she give in return?

811
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,319
I think you know that also.

812
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,033
That she won't see me again.

813
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,673
Yes.

814
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,398
You didn't have the right.

815
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,958
You shoulןve left me there.

816
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,230
- You woulןve died.
- Then I'd have died.

817
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,037
We're willing that
you should have a horse.

818
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,352
I'll trust Esteban
to supervise the selection.

819
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,758
Do you have enough money?

820
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,472
Do you have enough money?

821
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,314
I aim to see her.

822
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,716
Am I supposed to be surprised?

823
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,235
I'll even give you my permission.

824
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,875
Although that doesn't seem to be
a thing you have ever required.

825
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,238
Her telephone number.

826
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,393
In the end, Mr. Cole...

827
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,077
...we all get cured of our sentiments.

828
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,038
Those whom life doesn't cure...

829
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,837
...death will.

830
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,556
She will not break her word to me.

831
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,119
You will see.

832
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,868
Yes, ma'am.

833
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,229
We will.

834
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,639
I knew it would be you.

835
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,713
I have to see you.

836
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,559
I can't.

837
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,473
You have to. I'm coming.

838
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,669
No, you can't.

839
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,592
I won't be here.
I go to La Purisima in two days.

840
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,270
- I'll meet you at the train.
- No, my father will have men there.

841
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,071
Alejandra, I love you.

842
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,919
I love you.

843
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,793
You didn't have no right to make
that promise, even if they killed me.

844
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,310
I ain't gonna leave until I see you.

845
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,633
Even if is the last time,
I don't care.

846
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,712
Even if they kill me now.

847
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,110
I will leave a day early.

848
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,078
Tomorrow morning.

849
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,957
I'll say that my aunt is ill.

850
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,276
Meet me in Zacatecas.

851
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,515
I will be there.

852
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,756
My God, you're beautiful.

853
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,153
- Is all my fault.
- No. You couldn't have saved us.

854
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,471
You couldn't have saved Blevins.

855
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,436
I told my father we were lovers.

856
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,749
Why?

857
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,190
Because she threatened me. My aunt.

858
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,313
She said I must stop seeing you
or she'd tell him.

859
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,874
I couldn't stand for her
to have that power.

860
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,638
She left me no choice.

861
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,838
I told him myself.

862
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,317
I love you so much, I thought
I could make him understand.

863
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,072
I was so foolish.
It was her arrogance.

864
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,635
I told her I would not be blackmailed.

865
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,752
She made me crazy.

866
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,351
But I broke my father's heart.

867
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,791
I broke his heart.

868
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,592
I put you in danger,
and you almost died.

869
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,675
He had Armando lock me into my room
so that I couldn't warn you.

870
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,479
The next morning,
he flew me back to the city.

871
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,679
I thought I would never,
never see you again.

872
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,954
Don't cry.

873
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,919
Don't cry.

874
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,913
Don't cry.

875
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,797
I destroyed everything.

876
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,232
I'm going to make it right.

877
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,069
You can't.

878
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,078
Well, I will make it right.

879
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,512
Somehow, I will.

880
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,399
You don't understand.

881
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,999
What don't I understand?

882
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,470
I didn't know that my father
could stop loving me.

883
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,637
I didn't know he could.

884
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,359
Now I know.

885
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,119
What are you doing?

886
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,512
I saw you dead in a dream.

887
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,715
Just like the dream I had the night
before we danced together.

888
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,792
It was dawn.

889
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,468
Men in serapes stood over you.

890
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,478
And you were dying.

891
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,037
All because of your whore.

892
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,753
Don't say that.

893
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,349
I want you to marry me
and come to Texas.

894
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,949
When I found out you were in prison
I made a promise.

895
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,628
I know. For my life.

896
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,034
Yes.

897
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,629
I love you.

898
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,230
I'll love you till the day I die.

899
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,592
I believe you.

900
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,557
I swear to God.

901
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,193
I believe you.

902
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,874
No.

903
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,835
I cannot do what you ask.

904
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,195
I love you very much.

905
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,238
But I cannot.

906
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,958
I have no honour except my promise.

907
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,950
If I lose that too...

908
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,391
...then what am I?

909
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,639
Shut the door.

910
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,189
What do you want?

911
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,152
I come for my horse.

912
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,317
- Rawlins' and Blevins' horses too.
- I don't have your horses.

913
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,511
You by God know where they're at.

914
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,438
You make trouble for yourself.

915
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,915
I got trouble you never even heard of.

916
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,676
Are you still here, old man?

917
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,598
Yes, yes of course.

918
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,239
You're free to go.

919
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:25,999
You're free to go.

920
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,673
Thank you, partner.

921
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,228
Go with God.

922
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,752
You son of the unlucky...

923
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,316
Go with God.

924
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,595
Go with God, my friend.

925
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,352
Get down. Go inside.

926
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,718
Come here. Sit down.

927
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,950
Hey, who's there?

928
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,911
Raul, the Captain.

929
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,030
I want to see a horse.

930
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,749
I want to see a horse.

931
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:02,995
What horse?

932
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,076
American.

933
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,837
The American horse.

934
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,270
Whas going on?

935
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,629
Nothing.

936
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,355
Nothing.

937
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,474
Carlos! The gringo
has taken me prisoner!

938
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,628
Don't shoot!

939
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,988
If you follow us, I'll kill them.

940
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,075
Stop!

941
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,637
Goodbye, get out of here!

942
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,395
If you come back,
I'll kill the Captain.

943
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,710
You're going to die.

944
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,795
Yeah, you can just keep talking.
When I die, you die.

945
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,872
- Why don't you let me go?
- Because you're my hostage.

946
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:21,030
Stay close, or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you. Go on.

947
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,469
I'll shoot you.

948
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,875
Have to come back to my town?

949
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,071
I told you. For my horse.

950
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,430
My head is sick.
I can't ride no more.

951
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,756
You'd be surprised at what you can do.

952
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,674
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

953
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,348
We'll let God decide about that.

954
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,479
You're not afraid of God?

955
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,558
I'm not afraid of God.
I got no reason to be afraid.

956
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,915
I even got a bone or two
to pick with Him.

957
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,832
Where are the keys?

958
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,958
Where are the keys!

959
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,759
Goddamn you!

960
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,631
Die, you son of a bitch!

961
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,997
Give me your goddamn hand.

962
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,353
I'm not going to kill you.

963
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,072
I'm not like you.

964
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,194
Go on.

965
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,159
You're free to go.

966
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,153
Far as you can...

967
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,828
...tote that saddle.

968
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,316
Hey, give me the keys.

969
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,835
Go over to the Captain.

970
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,310
Don't let him get up. The keys.

971
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,749
Beans...

972
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,278
...and a rabbit.

973
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,356
How is your wound?

974
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,919
You doing okay?

975
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:50,748
Thank you.

976
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,109
Thank you.

977
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,718
Pants...

978
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,788
...a serape.

979
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,678
Go with God, my son.

980
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:10,713
- Howdy.
- Howdy. How you doing?

981
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,155
Could you tell me what day it is?

982
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,229
Is Thursday.

983
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,033
I mean the date.

984
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,628
Is Thanksgiving.

985
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,795
Do either of you want to buy a rifle?

986
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,832
No. I'm not interested.

987
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:43,870
So I come back across
and was riding on the road...

988
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:49,395
...and I run into this man, and he
told me I had to come see a judge.

989
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,831
There's a problem with the horses.

990
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,393
Your Honour...

991
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:57,190
...the fact of the matter is this boy
ain't got a lick of proof.

992
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,597
Three different horses
and different brands on them.

993
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:06,868
Deputy Smith, you know what
the trouble with a liar is?

994
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:11,029
Trouble with a liar is,
he can't remember what he said.

995
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,958
I know thas right.

996
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,948
I ain't a liar.

997
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,912
I know that, son.

998
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,908
I know that.

999
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:24,155
I can't believe anybody would make up
a story like the one you just told.

1000
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,509
Can I ask you a personal question?

1001
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,755
Yes, sir.

1002
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,035
You mind showing the court
them bullet holes in your leg?

1003
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,348
Oh, all right.

1004
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,358
Thas where it come out.

1005
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,392
Thas fine, son. Thank you.

1006
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:55,318
- You didn't have no medical attention?
- No, sir.

1007
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:57,398
Wasn't none to be had.

1008
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:03,994
Deputy Smith?

1009
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,474
Your Honour?

1010
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:09,475
I want you to see that this boy
gets his horses back.

1011
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,839
Son, you're free to go.

1012
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,479
Thank you.

1013
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,035
The court thanks you
for your testimony.

1014
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,195
In all the years I've sat
on this bench...

1015
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:28,030
...I heard lots of things that give me
grave doubts about the human race.

1016
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,713
This ain't one of them.

1017
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:33,669
All right.

1018
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,998
You can go, boy.

1019
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,754
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1020
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,514
I don't like to bother you. But they
told me this is where you live.

1021
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,512
Thas all right. They were right.
Come on in.

1022
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,953
- Thank you.
- Pleased to have you.

1023
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:16,508
When I was in the penitentiary...

1024
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,592
...I killed somebody.

1025
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,919
I'm sorry to hear that.

1026
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,271
He come at me with a knife.

1027
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,389
So...

1028
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,956
I just happened
to get the best of him.

1029
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,034
But that keeps bothering me somehow.

1030
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,031
Something else, ain't there?

1031
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,389
Yes, sir.

1032
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,958
But later, I wanted to kill
that other one too.

1033
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,597
That Mexican captain.

1034
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,318
Why do you suppose that is?

1035
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:06,556
Because I sat there, and he walked
the boy out to the trees and shot him.

1036
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,157
I didn't say nothing.

1037
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,631
I didn't say a word.

1038
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,872
Would it have done any good?

1039
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,599
No, sir.

1040
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,198
That don't make it right.

1041
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,312
And it never will.

1042
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,190
Bothered me that you might think
that I'm something special.

1043
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,469
I ain't.

1044
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,553
You know what you strike me as?

1045
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,917
One of them people
that has a tendency...

1046
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,994
...to be a little tough on themselves.

1047
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,709
There's nothing wrong with you, son.

1048
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,076
You'll get it sorted out.

1049
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,548
I hope so.

1050
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,999
If I live.

1051
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,551
You'll live, all right.

1052
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:20,915
Lacey once asked me if I thought
God looks out for people.

1053
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,952
I guess He does.

1054
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,035
I say He's just about got to.

1055
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,119
I don't believe we'd make it
a day otherwise.

1056
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,674
I thought you might want
your old horse back.

1057
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,472
Damn, bud.

1058
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,669

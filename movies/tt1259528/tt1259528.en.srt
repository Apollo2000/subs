00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,935
No, no, no, bro! We're not here for you!
Don't even think about it!

4
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,637
Don't you move,
motherfucker!

5
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,008
Hands away from the weapon, bro!
Fucking relax!

6
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,477
3170. We're being held up.

7
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,513
Armor piercing rounds
are chambered in this firearm!

8
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:52,483
Please don't be the asshole
who forces me to use it.

9
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,618
Take your foot off the gas,

10
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,856
press the unlock button,
and step out of the vehicle,

11
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,823
or we will forcibly
remove you!

12
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:03,131
Fucking do it! Now!

13
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,500
Your choice! Go!

14
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,184
What the fuck?

15
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:28,220
He fucking went for his gun.

16
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:30,391
He spilled his fucking coffee.

17
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,197
Shit.

18
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,202
Gardena, 30 seconds out.

19
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:43,334
Copy.

20
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,871
Thirty out. Hustle!

21
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:50,010
- Pop it.
- Ready.

22
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:02,720
Man on!

23
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:08,892
Out of fucking time.

24
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:10,561
Prepare to engage.

25
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,096
Contact right!

26
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:15,033
Range 100. Suppressive fire.

27
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,380
Contact left!

28
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:32,919
Dispatch, 10-97.
LAPD is on scene.

29
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:47,734
We are under heavy fire!

30
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:10,924
Fuck!

31
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:19,166
Motherfucker!

32
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:30,011
Whoa, whoa.
I got you. I got you.

33
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,196
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

34
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:11,850
What the fuck was that?

35
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,318
Did you see him
go for his gun?

36
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,524
I don't know.
I just saw Bosco lit him up.

37
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,330
Take the second left
into the tunnel.

38
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,201
Hug the airport.
Take the tunnel.

39
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:47,886
Go right on Doty.

40
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:49,090
<i>Right on Doty.</i>

41
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,256
Make sure you take care
of those weapons.

42
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:01,294
I don't want any
accidental discharges.

43
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,095
- What are you looking at him for?
- Ray.

44
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:06,331
I'm not talking to him.
I'm talking to you.

45
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,635
What the fuck was that?

46
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,509
What else
did you fuck up, huh?

47
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:21,448
You sure you were clean
all the way home?

48
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:23,350
Catch any tails?

49
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,492
Where did Marcus
take those rounds?

50
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,832
Femoral artery.
He's done.

51
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,667
Well, we knew the risks.

52
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,672
Shit popped off.
We handled it. That's it.

53
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,014
Hey, B.

54
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,181
Get back over there.

55
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,317
See who responded.
It was probably LASD.

56
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,852
They'll supersede Gardena,

57
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:04,358
but if it's Major Crimes,
we've got a problem.

58
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,997
All clear? No GPS?

59
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,035
It's one of the old models, man.
We good.

60
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,505
We've got to
get this patched up.

61
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:21,709
We need this clean.

62
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,682
You good?

63
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:34,053
We're cop killers now.

64
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:04,143
Come on.

65
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:14,846
Jesus Christ!

66
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:17,685
You scared the shit out of me, babe.
Can't do that.

67
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,220
What are you doing
right now?

68
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,061
You erasing
your recent calls?

69
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:33,064
My phone?
What do you mean?

70
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,067
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

71
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,269
"I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that."

72
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,406
Come on.

73
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:44,407
Babe, we really have
to go through this right now?

74
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,445
Where you been?

75
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,085
It's 6:00 a.m.
Where have you been?

76
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,452
Been at work?

77
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:57,921
Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers?
Because you smell like a stripper.

78
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,425
Of course, I was at work.

79
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:05,733
It's funny
'cause I got this text.

80
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,603
What was so hot, then?

81
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:11,638
Is that a work text?

82
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:13,740
Huh?

83
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,812
You fucked up.
You text me instead.

84
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:24,785
Who does that?

85
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,958
It's street theater, babe.
It's not what it looks like.

86
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,994
I'm sorry.

87
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,130
Me, too.

88
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,648
Fuck.

89
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,115
We're going
to go to Auntie's house

90
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,517
because Daddy's got to do
a little work on the house.

91
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,986
And we have
something else to do.

92
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,323
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

93
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,957
Hey, yo.

94
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,791
It's gonna be too loud
for you guys, okay?

95
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,328
- Hey. Deb? Deb?
- Will you put this on?

96
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,495
- Can you help me with that?
- What are you doing, Deb?

97
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,798
What the fuck are you doing?

98
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,299
- It will be too loud for you guys.
- Wifey, wifey.

99
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,300
Seriously, what are you doing?

100
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:19,303
Is Daddy coming with us?

101
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,038
No, Daddy does not have
enough time for us right now.

102
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,506
- Seriously... That's nice. That's nice.
- Can you put this on here?

103
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:25,508
Hey, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

104
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,478
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

105
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,818
She didn't mean that, okay?
Sweetie, you okay?

106
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:34,517
Yeah, great. Great.

107
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,853
Hey. Come here, honey.

108
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,322
I'm not going to be able
to make it right now,

109
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,524
but I'm gonna come a little
later, okay?

110
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,025
All right. Come here.
Give me a hug.

111
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,895
- Time to go right now.
- Christ sake.

112
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,529
Will you slow it down
a second?

113
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,863
Daddy's a mess.
He's real tired.

114
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:48,531
- Right, hon?
- What...

115
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,705
Deb. Deb. Deb, will you
slow it down a second?

116
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,372
- We're going to walk this way...
- Deb.

117
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,573
Okay, watch your step.
Here we go.

118
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,008
Deb, can you slow it...

119
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,377
Okay. Come on.

120
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,179
Let's go. We're going to
put your sister in first.

121
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:04,515
Here we go.
Okay, baby, ready?

122
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,516
Sweetie, it's going to be
okay, sweetie. Okay?

123
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:08,352
Let's go.

124
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,521
Okay, put your bags in there. You
wanna put your sister in the seat?

125
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:12,558
Where's the pink bag?

126
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,425
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

127
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,895
Oh, great language
right in front of my daughter.

128
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,362
Great fathering!

129
00:15:19,364 --> 00:15:21,198
Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs
in front of my daughters.

130
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
- "My kids"? "My kids"?
- Great fathering!

131
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:27,240
Gonna find a guy whose cock
actually gets hard for me.

132
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,377
Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop!

133
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,546
Please don't do this.

134
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,915
Please.

135
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:51,896
This is a little hard. You're just
scared right now, okay? You're confused.

136
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:52,899
Okay...

137
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,771
Out of the way, Nick.
Get out of the way, Nick.

138
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,272
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucker!

139
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:03,808
You motherfucker!

140
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,978
You get back! You understand
me, you motherfucker?

141
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,450
- Stay away from us!
- Nice. Nice.

142
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,418
Good. Good.

143
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,628
Okay. Mommy's okay.

144
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,306
See you later.

145
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,025
Morning.

146
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,478
Yup.

147
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,388
Yeah.

148
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:30,664
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

149
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,687
Well, that looks
like it hurt.

150
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,357
No?

151
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,890
Good morning,
fellow officers.

152
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,225
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

153
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:03,359
Yeah?

154
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,261
I take it
he's a bad guy.

155
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,931
You mean the guy
with the black body armor,

156
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,066
shotgun, and gas mask?

157
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,702
That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?

158
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:12,705
Rough night?

159
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,371
Yes. Next subject?

160
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,074
You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.

161
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,042
I think
he looks amazing.

162
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:22,078
I've got enough toxins in me to turn the
Gaza Strip into a Gay Pride parade.

163
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,216
You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.

164
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,051
Thursday.

165
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,087
What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?

166
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,555
Please.

167
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:33,089
You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.

168
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,591
Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.

169
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,930
I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.

170
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,732
That's some real donut.

171
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,567
Those are horrendous, dude.

172
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,604
Hey. You guys push
back the perimeter.

173
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:49,440
Need to extend the crime scene, okay?
Too goddamn small.

174
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,575
- You got it.
- What's the tally?

175
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,078
We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.

176
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,913
- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.

177
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:58,648
Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.

178
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,317
Surrounded the truck.

179
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,087
This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.

180
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:06,423
AP rounds blasted through the
windshield took him out.

181
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:10,261
They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.

182
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:11,595
They knew the route.

183
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:14,498
Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,

184
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,003
knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.

185
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,973
We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.

186
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,309
Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?

187
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,944
They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.

188
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:28,948
But there was nothing
in the truck.

189
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:30,951
Nothing in the truck?

190
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,955
They stole a fucking empty
armored truck?

191
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,486
Yup.

192
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,357
Why the fireworks?

193
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,295
One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.

194
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:45,695
Genius.

195
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,798
Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?

196
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,867
That's a cold car.

197
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:54,171
VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it. They bleach-bombed it.

198
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:59,876
Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.

199
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:11,355
Fuck. I can't deal with this
retard factory this early.

200
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,492
One of you guys handle it?

201
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:14,194
It's all you, bro.

202
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,328
Thank you.

203
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,863
All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?

204
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,531
He saw them, and they
looked right at him,

205
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,235
but, for some reason,
they left him alone.

206
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:30,007
Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.

207
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,341
Talk to DOT, okay?

208
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:34,544
Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.

209
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,515
And find me
that fucking truck.

210
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,355
Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.

211
00:20:44,357 --> 00:20:46,557
Lobbin' Bob. Huh?

212
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,360
How's that
mean tennis game?

213
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,265
Look at you, man.

214
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,100
Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.

215
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:00,537
Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.

216
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,040
I mean,
how does a county sheriff

217
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,608
pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?

218
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,245
You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage. Look at you.

219
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,248
This thing's tits!

220
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,717
You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?

221
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,753
Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.

222
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:20,557
It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.

223
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,792
You just threw a donut
in the hot zone.

224
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:24,595
- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

225
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,629
I did?
That was fucking wrong.

226
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,965
It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...

227
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,769
What's up with that?

228
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,136
I like you.

229
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,271
Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.

230
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,907
Vegan! I'm a vegan.

231
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,943
- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

232
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,078
What are you
doing here anyway, huh?

233
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,752
No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.

234
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:48,088
Yet.

235
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:51,791
You're pausing
for dramatic effect?

236
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,162
You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.

237
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,297
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

238
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,003
Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.

239
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:12,608
So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,

240
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,646
and then these clowns
took over.

241
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,280
Who are they, LASD?

242
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:20,184
Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.

243
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:21,487
He seemed to be in charge.

244
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,469
You recognize him?

245
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,636
He played football
at South.

246
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,874
Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?

247
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:45,341
Yeah.

248
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:47,344
That's the cop
who blasted him.

249
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:49,312
Runs Major Crimes.

250
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:51,150
Get to know your enemy, boys.

251
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:02,859
Who's running this crew?

252
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,495
Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.

253
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:10,501
Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?

254
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:12,569
Bad tip,
they probably botched it.

255
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,003
Why didn't they
dump it, then?

256
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:16,205
- I'll take the salvage yards.
- All of them.

257
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:20,511
And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,

258
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:24,882
especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?

259
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:27,518
It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.

260
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,354
Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.

261
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:33,022
Okay, inside job, but where?

262
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:36,862
Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?

263
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,398
What about Merrimen?

264
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:44,534
When did he parole again?

265
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,239
- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?

266
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:51,774
We need to find
that fucking truck.

267
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,911
Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?

268
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,245
- Yeah.
- The one who was hanging out with Merrimen?

269
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:57,880
What bar did he work in?

270
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,783
- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.

271
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,221
Let's pay him a visit.

272
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,734
...some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.

273
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:19,805
- Thanks.
- All right.

274
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,572
Wolfgang, talk to me.

275
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,575
- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.

276
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:26,242
Put it on my tab, all right?

277
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:27,778
- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.

278
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,982
Have a good night.

279
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,291
Are we doing this?

280
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,929
Yeah, man. All right, man.

281
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:46,762
To money and women.

282
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:47,934
That we don't have.

283
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:53,770
How do you remember
everybody's order like that?

284
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,272
I can't remember
the last four of my social.

285
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:58,008
Lots of reps, man.

286
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,810
I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.

287
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,815
- Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.

288
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,950
Wrap it up.

289
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:09,152
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

290
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,491
- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.

291
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,626
A gift.

292
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:16,492
How about a tip?

293
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:18,127
We got you last time.

294
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:19,796
Oh, yeah, you got me last...

295
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,167
That's not how it works.

296
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:27,840
Okay, really? Zoo animals.

297
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:34,513
Need change?

298
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:37,317
That's for you, <i>Fraulein.</i>

299
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:40,552
Thanks.

300
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:44,820
Are there always
so many cops in here?

301
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:47,190
Last place
I'd think they'd be.

302
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,193
Yeah, this their spot.
You know, cheap liquor.

303
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,194
Right.

304
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:55,200
Yeah, there also is a lot of
shady cats in here, huh?

305
00:25:56,702 --> 00:26:00,503
Yeah, it's kind of neutral
grounds, you know?

306
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:02,841
Rick's in <i>Casablanca</i>
type shit.

307
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:07,543
You must've heard
some stories in this place.

308
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:10,880
You know, give them a couple
of drinks, steak on his plate,

309
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:12,715
some nice women around him,

310
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:15,085
he'll tell you
his darkest secrets.

311
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,190
Loose lips sink ships.

312
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,359
Ain't that the truth.

313
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,395
Mmm, what about you?

314
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,697
Pull a lot of pussy in here?
Yeah?

315
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:28,732
Come on.

316
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,537
- I do well for myself.
- Yeah.

317
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:32,772
I'd fuck you.

318
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:36,909
Kidding.

319
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,248
All right.

320
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,753
I'm out.

321
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:52,055
See you later, man.

322
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:53,426
Yeah.

323
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,229
Look forward to it.

324
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:25,925
- <i>Fraulein.</i>
- Dude, what the fuck are you...

325
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:49,181
Fraulein, you're up. Yeah.

326
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,324
What the fuck?

327
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,194
What's up, gangster?

328
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:38,196
Oh, Peaches.

329
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,204
Sit down.
You sit right there.

330
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:50,206
What you walking
so slow for, nigga?

331
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,744
I want you to sit right there.
That's you right there.

332
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,516
- Look here. There's cigarettes.
- Yeah.

333
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,751
Borracho!

334
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:03,889
I think y'all got me
confused with somebody.

335
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,859
Hey, Sporto.

336
00:29:08,526 --> 00:29:09,861
You want a blow job?

337
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:15,866
Why my pants wet?

338
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,870
Come on, man, if you and
your Uncle Tom over here

339
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:22,905
are into some homo shit,
I'm good.

340
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:24,243
Y'all just kill me now.

341
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,579
You pissed yourself,
bubba.

342
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:29,578
It happens.

343
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,915
I had one of the girls here
clean you up, so you're good.

344
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:35,251
But y'all got the wrong dude.

345
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,587
You got me confused
with someone.

346
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,123
But I'm going to let you know
now, I ain't the one.

347
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,758
What'd you say?

348
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,726
Dude something?

349
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:46,631
No, we're not mistaking you for anybody.
Don't be a fucking smartass.

350
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,800
Arrested at 17 for GTA.

351
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:53,270
Tried and convicted
as an adult.

352
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:54,637
We know exactly who you are.

353
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,772
Did a stint at county
for attempted manslaughter.

354
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:59,742
Fastest speeding ticket
in California history.

355
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:00,911
That's nice.

356
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:02,949
Fucking genius, man.
How fast were you going?

357
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:07,751
178.

358
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,922
Speed demon!

359
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:15,157
What did you say to the cop
who pulled you over?

360
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,161
What reason did you give him?

361
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:19,965
Told him they'd
just paved the road.

362
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:22,933
- I like him.
- Ballsy.

363
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:24,334
<i>Me gusta.</i>

364
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:26,603
You may have a little pecker
for a black dude.

365
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:30,473
You may be a bed-wetter, but you've
got some fucking style, buddy.

366
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:34,610
All right, girls, time to go.

367
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:36,946
Grab your shoes. Grab your shit.
Let's go.

368
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,147
Time to go home
to your babies.

369
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:39,685
- All right, thanks for stopping by.
- Excuse me.

370
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:51,293
You check this out, hot rod.
You're a two-striker.

371
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,963
You need to fucking look at
me when I'm talking to you.

372
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:58,534
You're one mistake away from getting
sex in the ass every time you shower.

373
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:02,038
Some of them niggas
got gas pumps.

374
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,976
Now, personally, that shit don't
sound like a lot of fun to me.

375
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:08,880
What you think?
How you feel about that?

376
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:14,317
Look, the dude in that picture
is not even a regular at my bar.

377
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,989
Like, I've seen him a few times, but,
you know, I don't associate myself...

378
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,065
Do you know what this means?

379
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:31,501
It means I am
a member of a clique.

380
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,502
It's kind of like
being in a gang.

381
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:37,072
Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,

382
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:40,011
which means you are done.

383
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,514
He ain't lying.

384
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,351
Let me ask you this.

385
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:52,688
Okay, do we look like
the types who will arrest you?

386
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,393
Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?

387
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:57,196
Hmm?

388
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,930
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

389
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:02,031
No. Not at all.

390
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,567
Right, exactly.

391
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,773
We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.

392
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:11,577
So tell me,

393
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:17,082
what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?

394
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,049
Hmm?

395
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,582
You're a pussy.

396
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,786
Those dudes are bad dudes.

397
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:26,889
Great thieves
but straight convicts.

398
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:29,792
What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?

399
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,394
Talk shop?

400
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,229
You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?

401
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:36,066
Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?

402
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:37,434
Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.

403
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,105
No, it fucking isn't.

404
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:43,572
I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.

405
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:45,442
This dude just comes
to my bar where I work...

406
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:48,580
Stop. Shut up.

407
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:57,921
Come on, man. This is some weird shit.
Just...

408
00:32:57,923 --> 00:33:00,423
You listen to me, fuckface.

409
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:02,291
We don't give
a shit about you.

410
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,663
You in Merrimen's crew?

411
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:07,800
Hmm?

412
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:10,666
Huh? You hit the stadium?

413
00:33:12,503 --> 00:33:14,303
You talky-talky now?

414
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,938
Yes, please.

415
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:22,948
Fuck!

416
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:32,321
I'm just the driver!

417
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:34,957
I'm just the driver!

418
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,694
They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.

419
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:40,129
They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.

420
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,665
That's it. Fuck!

421
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,635
Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?

422
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,169
I don't know, all right?

423
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,138
They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.

424
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,339
If the cops come down on me,

425
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:52,341
I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.

426
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,676
Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,

427
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:56,980
a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.

428
00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:59,982
I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.

429
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:01,853
Please, just let me
the fuck go.

430
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:07,192
Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.

431
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:11,363
Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing.

432
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,499
Good stuff.

433
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,569
All right,
when did you meet him?

434
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,202
What do I get out of this?

435
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:23,209
What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.

436
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,012
Two,

437
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:29,881
you're not the bad guys.

438
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:31,884
We are.

439
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:40,723
Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,

440
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,058
<i>and I served them
a few drinks.</i>

441
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,027
<i>We started talking.</i>

442
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,232
Hey, Donnie, come here, man.

443
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:52,067
This is my boy, Bosco.

444
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:54,539
My brother for life.
We deployed together.

445
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,709
Hey, the kid can drive.

446
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,076
Okay.

447
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,712
Donnie, tell him about
the Trans Am Series.

448
00:35:03,714 --> 00:35:06,918
Drove Trans Am Series, like
he said, for about a season.

449
00:35:08,752 --> 00:35:10,221
What were their names?

450
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:13,058
Hawaiian dude,

451
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:16,262
he had a homie,
Bosco, white boy.

452
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:21,431
He was in the military,
and he worked for DWP.

453
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,469
I told him I needed
some extra money,

454
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,402
so he gave me a job.

455
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,741
Who's that? Merrimen?

456
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,310
Merrimen.

457
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,277
<i>Ray Merrimen.</i>

458
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,786
So what's up
with this dude?

459
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,123
It's Marcus' boy.

460
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:50,092
Worked with him
over at the Hofbrau.

461
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,661
Say he did some time
with him at Wayside.

462
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:53,932
He was a Marine for a minute.

463
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,971
Say the nigga can drive.
He be cool.

464
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,143
All right,
let's check him out.

465
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,777
<i>Real smart dude.</i>

466
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,116
<i>He had just got out of prison
from what I could tell.</i>

467
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:17,689
You ready to roll, Ray?

468
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:19,357
514!

469
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,134
Come on,
let's cuff them up.

470
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:37,976
You want any of your shit?

471
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:40,011
No.

472
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,181
Let's go.

473
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,167
See you soon, Ray.

474
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:08,540
No, you won't.

475
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,224
You look great, baby.

476
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:29,695
All right. Come on.

477
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,762
For real.

478
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:35,197
Bring any sunglasses for me?

479
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,233
Baby, I'm sorry.
I forgot.

480
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:39,936
Here, take mine.
Take mine.

481
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:41,740
Come on.

482
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:44,540
They're good. They are.

483
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,608
They look great on you.
Look at that.

484
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,411
Where'd you meet him?

485
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,116
<i>It was in Carson,
at the Hawaiian dude's house.</i>

486
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,572
Through your body.

487
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,775
- What up? What up? What up?
- Fucking nice.

488
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,246
Yeah. Fool's in back.

489
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:25,150
You're mine!

490
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,125
- Donnie, what's good, man?
- What's up?

491
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:37,929
- Come on, man. Follow me.
- Yeah, yeah.

492
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:41,800
Hey.

493
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,967
Oh, shit.
What's up?

494
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:47,139
- Donnie, beer?
- Yeah, yeah.

495
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,308
Thank you.
Thank you.

496
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:00,185
So you spent
some time at Wayside?

497
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,288
Yeah, a little bit.

498
00:39:03,987 --> 00:39:06,157
What do they serve
for breakfast on Fridays?

499
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:13,663
Silver dollar pancakes.

500
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:14,833
Three of them.

501
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,002
Where you from?

502
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:19,538
Hawthorne.

503
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,042
So you can drive, huh?

504
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:26,141
Oh, I can drive.

505
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:34,217
Drive.

506
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,188
You might want to
put that seat belt on.

507
00:40:00,677 --> 00:40:01,714
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

508
00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:22,734
He liked how I drove, so, a
week later, I did my first gig.

509
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,571
<i>We hit this rave at a stadium.</i>

510
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:56,901
Got one.

511
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,492
Minus the dye pack,
is the count all good?

512
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:24,630
The count is on.

513
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,634
That's a lot of money
right there, bro.

514
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:34,637
Why don't we just
call it a day?

515
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,505
Really?

516
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:38,940
You want three
in hot bills,

517
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:41,978
you looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life,

518
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,016
or would you rather
have 30 clean?

519
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,618
I'm just saying.

520
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:50,322
Let's just call it quits
while we're ahead.

521
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:54,159
Put it away.

522
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,361
We're trading up.

523
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,835
All right. Fuck it.
Let's do it.

524
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,867
What happened to the cash?

525
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:07,837
I don't know.

526
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,308
They don't tell me.

527
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,844
They don't talk much.

528
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:17,348
Yeah, people with things to
hide never have much to say.

529
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,554
So am I under arrest,
or can I leave?

530
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,891
Nah, you just keep
doing your thing.

531
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:30,195
We'll be in touch.

532
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:49,512
Yeah?

533
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:52,851
<i>Horsepower, be at 1st and
Central at 0800. Don't be late.</i>

534
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:17,540
You always
pick the same one.

535
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:20,612
Just go for it. I'm here.
Do whatever you want.

536
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,099
Woo-hoo!

537
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:08,757
Ran the prints on CAL-ID.

538
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:11,159
Got a hit on our dead guy
from Angel City.

539
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:14,764
- Check your e-mail.
- All right.

540
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:17,833
Name's Marcus Rhodes,
from Oakland.

541
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:20,770
ATF was looking for him
for gun charges.

542
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:22,971
And more to the point
that you were making before,

543
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:26,775
he was stationed at 29 Palms the
same time Merrimen was there.

544
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:28,446
This is good.
Give me the book on Merrimen.

545
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:33,618
Look to your right.

546
00:44:34,618 --> 00:44:36,152
You know what that is?

547
00:44:36,154 --> 00:44:38,688
It's the bank for banks.

548
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,157
Los Angeles branch of the
Federal Reserve.

549
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,295
It's the only bank
that's never been robbed.

550
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:54,637
All the surrounding streets
are wired for sound and image.

551
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,639
Stand across the street and stare
at the building for two minutes,

552
00:44:57,641 --> 00:45:00,476
you'll have security on your ass
asking you politely to leave.

553
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:02,344
If they see your face again,

554
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:05,514
every Secret Service agent in the
country is going to be looking for you.

555
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:06,518
The place is case-proof.

556
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:13,154
There have been 53
break-in attempts.

557
00:45:13,156 --> 00:45:14,992
Not one has got past
the lobby.

558
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:19,998
That's why we're
going to rob it.

559
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:23,331
Okay, here we go.

560
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,567
Laguna Niguel was in '06.

561
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:29,170
Got caught for that, get sent
up to USP Victorville SHU

562
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:32,041
until June of '16.
Now give me the unsolved book.

563
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:34,076
<i>As soon
s you enter the lobby,</i>

564
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:36,679
<i>computers run you through every law
enforcement database in the country.</i>

565
00:45:36,681 --> 00:45:38,713
If you've got outstanding
parking tickets,

566
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:41,717
they're going to know about it before you
get through the first level of security.

567
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,186
All the employees wear
security swipe cards

568
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:46,387
that grant them access through
the first set of man-traps.

569
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:49,391
<i>Access is severely restricted.</i>

570
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,694
<i>Two stories below street
level is the vault floor.</i>

571
00:45:51,696 --> 00:45:52,864
By the way,

572
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:55,396
uh, his crimey...

573
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:57,366
- Levoux?
- Levoux.

574
00:45:57,368 --> 00:45:59,268
He serve with Merrimen?

575
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,538
Not only that, but they played football
in high school at Long Beach Poly.

576
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,940
- You've got to be shitting me.
- No.

577
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:08,543
<i>Central Security, it's
the nerve center for the Fed.</i>

578
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:12,413
<i>This is where the armored cars
come in, drop off the money tubs.</i>

579
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:14,717
<i>Money tubs are handed off
to the Fed employees.</i>

580
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:20,088
<i>At any one time, there's anywhere between
500 and 800 billion dollars in there,</i>

581
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,793
<i>every millimeter of it covered by
cameras, sensors, and motion detectors.</i>

582
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:25,594
Yeah. What did they
specialize in?

583
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:29,230
I got this from the HR desk
at 29 Palms.

584
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:32,802
Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both
saw combat in the Middle East.

585
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:37,239
Levoux specializes in explosives, where
Merrimen specializes in soldiering,

586
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:40,074
both MARSOC fast Marines.

587
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,911
But there's a hitch.

588
00:46:41,913 --> 00:46:45,280
The serial number of every bill is
recorded in the Fed's database.

589
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:46,748
<i>So, if a note goes missing,</i>

590
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,250
<i>they're going to know
exactly which one it is.</i>

591
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:50,920
They're going to flag it.
If that bill comes up again,

592
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:53,922
whoever recirculates that cash, no
matter where they are in the world,

593
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:55,123
that person can be tracked.

594
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,425
Okay. Bosco,
the Peckerwood?

595
00:46:57,427 --> 00:47:00,596
He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.

596
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:03,299
He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.

597
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:05,433
But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.

598
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:08,103
He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.

599
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:10,105
That's where they linked up.

600
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:13,808
Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharge.

601
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,511
So, the way I see it,

602
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:17,279
that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.

603
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:20,482
There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.

604
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:23,152
Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,

605
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:26,487
<i>first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.</i>

606
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:28,489
<i>They run the notes
through the counting machines.</i>

607
00:47:28,491 --> 00:47:30,291
<i>They're accomplishing
two things here.</i>

608
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:32,828
<i>First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.</i>

609
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,362
<i>If the bank is off at all,</i>

610
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:36,165
they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.

611
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:42,003
Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.

612
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:44,639
But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers

613
00:47:44,641 --> 00:47:46,976
of the old bills
from the Fed system.

614
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:50,846
Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,

615
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:53,148
that money
has ceased to exist.

616
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,884
Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.

617
00:47:54,886 --> 00:47:59,154
In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?

618
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:00,822
They tunneled through
the sewer system.

619
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:04,893
Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.

620
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:08,563
Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.

621
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:10,666
Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.

622
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:12,668
In the $100 count room alone,

623
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,338
an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.

624
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,840
Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

625
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:21,844
<i>all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.</i>

626
00:48:21,846 --> 00:48:23,014
It's all destroyed.

627
00:48:24,382 --> 00:48:30,251
$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.

628
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,554
It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company

629
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:33,925
and brought out to the dump.

630
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:37,592
If we can get
to those unfit bills

631
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:40,895
before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...

632
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:43,699
You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.

633
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:44,766
Bingo.

634
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,235
In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.

635
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:50,905
Same thing, only this time, Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.

636
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:55,911
Goes to prison till 2016. Now, in
that time, while he was in prison,

637
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:59,047
how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?

638
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:00,748
None, but you're on a roll.
Keep going.

639
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,719
The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.

640
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:05,756
They left him. Why?

641
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:12,226
Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.

642
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:13,964
Exactly what
they were trained to do.

643
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:16,567
Gangbangers, these are not.

644
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:21,971
Okay, these are our guys.

645
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:25,944
We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.

646
00:49:26,743 --> 00:49:28,913
This is the crew.

647
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:33,652
You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.

648
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:36,955
We're not
going in this way.

649
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:41,426
We're going in that way.

650
00:49:51,134 --> 00:49:52,634
What's going on
with <i>Fraulein?</i>

651
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,973
We can move on him
anytime we want.

652
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:59,007
- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.

653
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:02,143
Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.

654
00:50:02,145 --> 00:50:04,279
You start Wednesday, 11:00.

655
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:05,947
Thank you.

656
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:07,983
I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,

657
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:10,119
- but you've got to pay this time.
- I'm not paying it.

658
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:11,520
What?

659
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:14,188
- I pay every fucking time.
- What?

660
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,523
Get off
your wallet, buddy.

661
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:17,192
No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.

662
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:18,994
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

663
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:20,362
Got an alligator arm.

664
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:23,632
I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.

665
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,302
Nicholas O'Brien?

666
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:28,302
Yeah?

667
00:50:28,304 --> 00:50:30,308
I suggest you take these.

668
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:32,877
You're being served.

669
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:35,344
You kidding me?

670
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:36,681
I'm afraid not.

671
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:39,984
What's going on?

672
00:50:41,152 --> 00:50:43,184
You all right, bro?

673
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:44,656
Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.

674
00:50:45,855 --> 00:50:47,324
He say "divorced"?

675
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,328
Yo.

676
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:54,029
Welcome to the fucking club.

677
00:50:54,031 --> 00:50:55,866
Now, go handle your business,
big man.

678
00:51:04,407 --> 00:51:05,710
Gas the jet.

679
00:51:09,712 --> 00:51:10,714
Fuck.

680
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,951
There's a closer view.

681
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,587
There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.

682
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:54,556
Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.

683
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,224
Okay.

684
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:58,626
They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.

685
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:01,896
- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.

686
00:52:01,898 --> 00:52:04,733
Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.

687
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,636
But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,

688
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:10,739
shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.

689
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:14,275
To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.

690
00:52:14,277 --> 00:52:17,079
- So you want to simulate it?
- Can we?

691
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:19,114
Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.

692
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:22,284
I'd say yes, but I'd like to
have data to be sure.

693
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:23,819
Great.

694
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:26,288
Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.

695
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,123
They run on their own
power supply,

696
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,659
so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.

697
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:34,295
The solve here is we run
an EMP burst.

698
00:52:34,297 --> 00:52:37,766
Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.

699
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,804
Where you get all this
information from?

700
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,771
You don't have to
worry about that.

701
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:45,476
Just trust me
when I say it's solid.

702
00:52:47,143 --> 00:52:48,944
How we doing
with the Telecal hook?

703
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:51,616
Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.

704
00:52:53,616 --> 00:52:54,985
<i>How many handlers do you need?</i>

705
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:02,659
<i>Uh, gate B right now.</i>

706
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:07,498
Strolling right into
the Federal Reserve.

707
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:15,473
<i>Force leaving loading dock B.</i>

708
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:29,487
ID?

709
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,030
Sign in, please.

710
00:53:49,038 --> 00:53:51,005
Keep this on you
at all times.

711
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,710
Second bay of elevators.
Cafeteria's level 2.

712
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:58,716
Buzz him in. He's good.

713
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,718
Smells good.

714
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:04,389
He's good. Let him in.

715
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:26,741
- Sharon?
- Mmm-hmm. That's me.

716
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:29,244
- How you all doing?
- Good. How you are doing today?

717
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:32,413
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

718
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:33,915
She ain't getting none.

719
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:36,384
Shut up. Really?

720
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:38,719
Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.

721
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:40,922
- We will now.
- You have a wonderful day.

722
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:44,293
Lunch. Desert.
Lunch. Desert.

723
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:45,296
Bye, sunshine.

724
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:18,796
There he goes.

725
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:29,103
Fed's got 82.

726
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:30,941
Maybe it's part of his
regular route.

727
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,842
Delivering Chinese
to the Fed,

728
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:35,844
my left nut.

729
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:39,114
No. They're casing the joint
from the inside.

730
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:40,451
Okay, go back.

731
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:43,951
Other than cash,

732
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:46,657
what else do they take from
the casino in the stadium?

733
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:48,824
Fed deposit slips.

734
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:51,659
- But those were probably in with the cash.
- Or not.

735
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:53,661
Listen, what if they were
taking the cash

736
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:57,165
to disguise the fact that they were
really there for something else?

737
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,469
And then they take down an armored
car that's empty. Come on, guys.

738
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:02,804
Look, remember
what Donnie said.

739
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,505
It's trading up.
They're going big.

740
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:06,974
Hey, Nick, you can't
take down the Fed, man.

741
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:09,311
I'm sorry, Merrimen's no dummy.
It's impossible.

742
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:13,318
The Fed is the Olympics, and
Merrimen is Carl fucking Lewis.

743
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:15,851
I'm telling you,

744
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:17,522
<i>Fraulein's</i> holding out on us.

745
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:25,326
My gosh.

746
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:26,897
Aw!

747
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:37,841
- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.

748
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,884
Damn, girl looking fine.

749
00:56:48,886 --> 00:56:51,386
Thank you.
You look amazing.

750
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:53,554
How are you?

751
00:56:53,556 --> 00:56:55,389
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

752
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:57,425
- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.

753
00:56:57,427 --> 00:56:59,561
- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.

754
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:02,396
- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.

755
00:57:04,902 --> 00:57:06,067
Thank you.

756
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,570
- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

757
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:12,239
Um, Rolando,
this is my dad.

758
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:15,545
What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.

759
00:57:18,382 --> 00:57:20,752
Let me holler at him
for a second.

760
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:24,422
Let me talk to you, bruh.

761
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:35,432
Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.

762
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:45,407
So here's what's up.

763
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:47,308
For the past 16 years,

764
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,978
my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility

765
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,246
and my responsibility only.

766
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:56,420
Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.

767
00:57:57,587 --> 00:57:58,920
Don't fuck up,

768
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:00,588
or your mama
will weep as she has

769
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,493
to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.

770
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:10,297
Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.

771
00:58:10,299 --> 00:58:11,301
Do you understand?

772
00:58:11,802 --> 00:58:14,134
Yeah. Yes, sir.

773
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,442
It's all right.
It's all right.

774
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:23,277
Listen. Listen.

775
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:25,846
All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,

776
00:58:25,848 --> 00:58:27,984
and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.

777
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:31,188
I'll see you at 11:30.

778
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:33,454
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:36,194
- 11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
- Good choice.

780
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,636
I think he got
the picture, bro.

781
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:52,310
Psst.

782
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:26,074
Beers and sake,
let's go.

783
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:28,545
- Have wine.
- What the fuck?

784
01:00:02,712 --> 01:00:03,747
Hey.

785
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:06,082
Buddy.

786
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:08,949
Donnie, right?

787
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:10,918
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

788
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,753
Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?

789
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:14,389
Yeah, man. How you doing?

790
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,927
What's up, fellows?

791
01:00:19,228 --> 01:00:20,630
You play football
at Long Beach Poly?

792
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:22,465
You look familiar.

793
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,136
No, I'm not from
around here.

794
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:30,440
What are you doing here?
You work around here?

795
01:00:32,308 --> 01:00:34,476
Enjoying my dinner, man.

796
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:35,909
- Really?
- Yeah.

797
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:36,913
Food here sucks.

798
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:42,752
Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.

799
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,460
So I'll see you
at the gym, man.

800
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:57,165
Yeah. Definitely.

801
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,603
Have a good night.

802
01:01:05,676 --> 01:01:09,277
Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.

803
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:11,349
We wore the same number,
55, right?

804
01:01:12,114 --> 01:01:13,648
I went to South Torrance.

805
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,518
Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.

806
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,186
You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.

807
01:01:19,188 --> 01:01:22,623
Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.

808
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,027
Probably all that Spam.

809
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:27,996
Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.

810
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:31,002
Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.

811
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:33,304
Still crushing you guys.

812
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:37,871
We've got family here, bro.

813
01:01:37,873 --> 01:01:39,840
Don't really appreciate
you popping off.

814
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:42,811
All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.

815
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,547
Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?

816
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:46,848
Huh?

817
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,150
- What?
- Let's go order, bro.

818
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:50,985
Hey, look, man, listen.

819
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:54,492
You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.

820
01:01:58,027 --> 01:01:59,062
<i>Kampai.</i>

821
01:02:00,397 --> 01:02:01,831
See you at the gym, Donnie.

822
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:04,567
Have a good night, ladies.

823
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,065
You a cop?

824
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:38,069
No. Are you?

825
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,744
Get out of the car.

826
01:02:56,886 --> 01:02:57,888
Go!

827
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:18,973
- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.

828
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:20,444
I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.

829
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:24,279
Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.

830
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:30,921
Get up.

831
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:42,496
How does he know you?

832
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:44,334
Don't tell me it's
from the fucking gym.

833
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:47,768
Look, I don't know him.

834
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,772
Smoke this punk.

835
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:55,777
Talk, motherfucker.

836
01:03:55,779 --> 01:03:57,645
I'm no cop, all right?

837
01:03:57,647 --> 01:03:59,813
Now he came to me.
He know you.

838
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:02,784
He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.

839
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,351
He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.

840
01:04:04,353 --> 01:04:06,654
I thought he'd
leave us alone.

841
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:15,633
So how much do they know?

842
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:18,469
Nothing.

843
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:21,469
I ain't tell them shit.

844
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:23,971
I don't know nothing anyway.

845
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:26,810
And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.

846
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:30,980
Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.

847
01:04:32,147 --> 01:04:33,817
But I know
I ain't tell them shit.

848
01:04:57,406 --> 01:05:00,510
Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.

849
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:30,070
So good.

850
01:05:30,072 --> 01:05:32,909
It's true, though.
It's true.

851
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:34,945
Okay.

852
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:36,714
Okay.

853
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:47,956
How you doing, Nick?

854
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,226
Hmm.

855
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,094
- I'm Nick.
- Hello.

856
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,266
- How are you?
- Good.

857
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:01,402
What's for...

858
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:03,938
- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.

859
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,075
Hmm?

860
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:09,913
Relax.

861
01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:12,749
I already ate.

862
01:06:19,456 --> 01:06:21,456
Give me a pen, stud.

863
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,623
Nick, I was gonna call you.

864
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,159
I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.

865
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:27,164
Just give me a fucking pen.

866
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:46,516
Thanks, Ruud.

867
01:06:48,784 --> 01:06:51,522
- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.

868
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,964
How's the wine?

869
01:07:02,464 --> 01:07:03,800
Good?

870
01:07:07,536 --> 01:07:09,672
That's pretty fucking good.

871
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:13,174
So I imagine I just, uh...

872
01:07:13,176 --> 01:07:17,014
What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?

873
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:19,313
Okay.

874
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:22,884
And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever

875
01:07:22,886 --> 01:07:26,820
to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them

876
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:28,692
or, you know,
even look at them,

877
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:33,360
I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?

878
01:07:33,362 --> 01:07:34,862
But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?

879
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:37,697
There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?

880
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:39,002
- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...

881
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:46,509
Can you please go, Nick?

882
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,679
- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.

883
01:07:54,683 --> 01:07:55,718
Come on.

884
01:07:57,252 --> 01:07:59,719
Come here.
Give me a hug.

885
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:02,225
Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.

886
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:06,397
Hmm?

887
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:09,032
Come on.
Give me a hug.

888
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:13,867
There you go, huh, hoss?

889
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:16,770
You've just always got to make
a spectacle out of everything.

890
01:08:16,772 --> 01:08:18,572
There you go.

891
01:08:18,574 --> 01:08:20,043
Yeah, pretty much.

892
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:23,780
All right, Nick.
I think it's time to go.

893
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:26,380
Come on, Nick,
let's go.

894
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:27,584
Hey...

895
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:31,918
- Call the fucking cops.
- That's what I'm saying.

896
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,422
- Call the fucking cops.
- I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go.

897
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:35,755
Call the cops.

898
01:08:35,757 --> 01:08:38,391
- I'm sorry...
- Don't fucking touch me.

899
01:08:38,393 --> 01:08:41,061
- I'm sorry.
- Do not fucking touch me.

900
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:43,066
- Come on, Nick.
- Just, please go.

901
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:55,443
By the way...

902
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:58,078
- What do you want?
- You hitting that from behind,

903
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,280
and you're wondering
what that thing is on her ass?

904
01:09:00,282 --> 01:09:02,617
- It's a tattoo of my name.
- Nick, please...

905
01:09:02,619 --> 01:09:04,254
"Big Nick O'Brien."

906
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:06,623
Just a heads-up.

907
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:09,760
Psst.

908
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,463
Call me.

909
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:27,811
Take your time.

910
01:09:34,284 --> 01:09:35,853
What happened to you?

911
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,130
Borracho,
what do you think?

912
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:50,163
What the fuck was that?

913
01:09:50,165 --> 01:09:51,465
You spotted me
at the gym?

914
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,137
<i>Tranquillo.</i> All right?

915
01:09:55,504 --> 01:09:57,173
Sit down.

916
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:02,542
I'll take it, Freddy.

917
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:04,514
Just give us
a minute, okay?

918
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,521
Look, they're not going to off
you with this much heat, okay?

919
01:10:12,521 --> 01:10:13,990
When's this happening?

920
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:15,692
Friday.

921
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:18,359
Where?

922
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:20,531
I don't know yet.
All I can tell you is Friday.

923
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:23,029
TGIF, huh?

924
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:24,834
You're protecting me on this.

925
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,670
<i>Fraulein,</i>

926
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:29,505
we got your back, bro.

927
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:32,342
Don't worry about a thing.

928
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:36,346
Fuck.

929
01:10:38,513 --> 01:10:40,350
Better wear your vest.

930
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:42,518
We're in.

931
01:16:02,237 --> 01:16:05,038
Z?

932
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,741
Pico Rivera Savings,
Montebello Town Center.

933
01:16:07,743 --> 01:16:09,411
<i>Copy that, boss.
See you at 0800.</i>

934
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:11,214
Tell the crew.

935
01:16:15,918 --> 01:16:18,021
I did what you
told me to.

936
01:18:10,633 --> 01:18:11,635
You have fun?

937
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:18,842
He treat you right?

938
01:18:36,157 --> 01:18:37,192
Maloa.

939
01:18:43,331 --> 01:18:44,864
You know I love you, right?

940
01:18:44,866 --> 01:18:46,035
I love you, too.

941
01:18:47,203 --> 01:18:48,705
Come on, go to school.

942
01:19:34,282 --> 01:19:35,785
There you go.
Good job there.

943
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:44,761
McKenna!

944
01:19:52,234 --> 01:19:55,935
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie.

945
01:19:55,937 --> 01:19:58,407
How are you? Good?

946
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:01,408
What are you doing?

947
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:04,077
Well, you know,
I was on my way to work

948
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:07,113
and thought I'd come by and say
hello to my little monkey.

949
01:20:07,115 --> 01:20:09,649
Is that okay?

950
01:20:09,651 --> 01:20:11,784
How's everything
at school? Okay?

951
01:20:11,786 --> 01:20:13,623
- Yes, it's good.
- Yeah?

952
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:17,457
And what about
Auntie's house?

953
01:20:17,459 --> 01:20:19,295
Mommy and Cassady,
are they good?

954
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:27,935
What about the honey-bear?
Honey-bear good?

955
01:20:27,937 --> 01:20:29,939
Yeah? You miss me?

956
01:20:34,977 --> 01:20:38,010
All right, Pookie,
better get back to class.

957
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:40,012
When am I going to
see you again?

958
01:20:40,014 --> 01:20:43,686
Soon, sweetheart.
I'm gonna see you soon.

959
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:47,357
I want to come home.

960
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:51,628
Me, too.

961
01:20:53,128 --> 01:20:55,831
All right, you better
get back to class, okay?

962
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:58,200
But I'm gonna see you later.

963
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:00,303
Promise?

964
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:04,641
I promise.

965
01:21:06,674 --> 01:21:08,511
Come on.

966
01:21:11,646 --> 01:21:15,317
Recess is over.
Come on, kids. Come line up.

967
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:17,987
Go on, Pookie.

968
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,019
Bye, Daddy.

969
01:21:20,021 --> 01:21:21,356
Come on, McKenna.

970
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:25,161
Come on, honey.

971
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:41,804
Jock up.

972
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:51,247
Tac up, brother.

973
01:22:54,415 --> 01:22:56,449
No Fed?

974
01:22:56,451 --> 01:22:58,120
Change of plans.

975
01:22:59,788 --> 01:23:01,755
Pay attention.

976
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:03,625
Always keep your finger off the trigger
until you're going to shoot somebody.

977
01:23:05,259 --> 01:23:08,595
If and when that happens,
safety selector switch.

978
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:10,433
One for semi,
two for full auto.

979
01:23:29,817 --> 01:23:31,150
Mag release.

980
01:23:31,152 --> 01:23:33,286
Out with the old,
in with the new.

981
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:35,488
Tug it. Make sure
it's in there good.

982
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,125
Slap the bolt home,
you're ready for round two.

983
01:23:38,127 --> 01:23:41,161
Other than that, keep this thing
pointed at the fucking floor.

984
01:23:41,163 --> 01:23:42,665
- You understand?
- Got it.

985
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:45,201
Go put your shit on.

986
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:09,324
- Magazine, Borracho?
- Yeah.

987
01:24:40,588 --> 01:24:42,859
- You good?
- I'm good.

988
01:25:18,893 --> 01:25:20,961
Suspects arriving on location.

989
01:25:20,963 --> 01:25:23,229
We've got nothing for the DA. They
haven't committed a crime yet.

990
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:25,297
<i>They clear the bank,
we take them down.</i>

991
01:25:25,299 --> 01:25:27,102
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Roger that.

992
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:39,412
Broad fucking daylight.

993
01:25:39,414 --> 01:25:40,616
They're packing big.

994
01:25:42,618 --> 01:25:46,588
Ooh, shit. Look at
these motherfuckers.

995
01:25:51,927 --> 01:25:53,993
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

996
01:25:53,995 --> 01:25:56,462
Down on the ground! Get
down on the fucking ground!

997
01:25:56,464 --> 01:25:57,631
Freeze!

998
01:25:57,633 --> 01:25:59,099
Freeze! Don't move!
Stay right there!

999
01:25:59,101 --> 01:26:00,103
Freeze!

1000
01:26:00,802 --> 01:26:02,335
Freeze!

1001
01:26:02,337 --> 01:26:04,436
- You two! Move! Get over there!
- Get over here!

1002
01:26:04,438 --> 01:26:06,174
Hurry up!

1003
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:09,943
Get out here, now!

1004
01:26:09,945 --> 01:26:13,182
Move there now!
Go! Go! Go!

1005
01:26:14,348 --> 01:26:17,152
Move back!
Stay right there! Now!

1006
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:20,156
Eyes to the floor!

1007
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:24,823
Listen up!

1008
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:26,960
Everybody pay the fuck
attention!

1009
01:26:26,962 --> 01:26:28,461
Eyes to the ground!

1010
01:26:28,463 --> 01:26:30,663
'Cause I'm only
going to say this once!

1011
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:33,800
If you cooperate,
if you follow directions,

1012
01:26:33,802 --> 01:26:37,871
you will not be hurt. We are
here for money, not for you.

1013
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:40,006
I want everybody lined up
on the counter. Let's go!

1014
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:41,310
Move down!

1015
01:26:42,009 --> 01:26:43,542
Move down! Let's go!

1016
01:26:43,544 --> 01:26:46,378
Everybody behind the counter,
come out front! Let's go!

1017
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,185
Keep your eyes down
and your mouths shut.

1018
01:26:50,017 --> 01:26:52,152
On my command,

1019
01:26:52,154 --> 01:26:56,189
reach inside your pockets,
remove your cell phones,

1020
01:26:56,191 --> 01:26:58,992
and put your hands in the air.

1021
01:26:58,994 --> 01:27:01,496
Everybody take
two steps forward.

1022
01:27:03,164 --> 01:27:05,167
Now go down on your knees.

1023
01:27:08,035 --> 01:27:10,336
All right! Cell phones
right in here.

1024
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:11,371
On me.

1025
01:27:11,373 --> 01:27:12,738
Let's go.
Put them in the box.

1026
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,075
Tie them up.

1027
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:18,577
Go! Go! Go!

1028
01:27:18,579 --> 01:27:20,747
There will be
no heroics today.

1029
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:23,350
You guys go ahead
and get comfortable.

1030
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:25,217
We're going to be here
for a while.

1031
01:27:25,219 --> 01:27:27,389
Anybody need to
use the bathroom?

1032
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:30,857
Take a piss on yourself.

1033
01:27:38,566 --> 01:27:39,601
Hey.

1034
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,611
You. Get up.

1035
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:50,947
Stop.

1036
01:27:55,249 --> 01:27:56,585
Sit down.

1037
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:03,723
All right, I need you
to calm down right now.

1038
01:28:03,725 --> 01:28:06,094
Hey! Look at me.

1039
01:28:07,462 --> 01:28:08,563
Take a deep breath.

1040
01:28:11,732 --> 01:28:13,233
Good.

1041
01:28:13,235 --> 01:28:15,902
I know you already triggered
the silent alarms.

1042
01:28:15,904 --> 01:28:17,737
So I need you to
pick up the phone,

1043
01:28:17,739 --> 01:28:21,640
dial 911 dispatch,
and explain the following.

1044
01:28:21,642 --> 01:28:23,311
Go ahead
and write this down.

1045
01:28:25,112 --> 01:28:29,616
There's a 211 in progress,
and we have hostages.

1046
01:28:29,618 --> 01:28:32,418
Within one hour, they need
to deliver $10 million

1047
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:35,654
in unmarked small denomination
bills to this bank

1048
01:28:35,656 --> 01:28:38,757
inside a department helicopter
loaded with fuel.

1049
01:28:38,759 --> 01:28:43,296
Tell them we plan on killing one hostage
every hour until our demands are met.

1050
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:45,465
No cops are to
approach the bank.

1051
01:28:45,467 --> 01:28:48,768
And if a negotiator
even tries to contact us,

1052
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:50,839
we will automatically kill
another hostage.

1053
01:28:52,273 --> 01:28:54,677
Is that clear?
You got it all?

1054
01:28:57,812 --> 01:28:59,315
Go ahead and
pick up the phone.

1055
01:29:04,953 --> 01:29:07,319
<i>Any available units,
we have a bank 211 in progress...</i>

1056
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:08,488
Shit.

1057
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:09,823
<i>...at the Pico Rivera Savings
in Montebello</i>

1058
01:29:09,825 --> 01:29:13,193
<i>at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic.</i>

1059
01:29:13,195 --> 01:29:14,827
- <i>Suspects are armed...</i>
- What the fuck?

1060
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:16,962
<i>...and have taken hostages
and are refusing a negotiator.</i>

1061
01:29:16,964 --> 01:29:19,332
What the fuck is going on?
That's not their MO.

1062
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:22,801
Call in, tell them we're on scene,
have suspects under surveillance,

1063
01:29:22,803 --> 01:29:24,336
and to back the fuck off.

1064
01:29:24,338 --> 01:29:27,640
This is LASD, we have surveillance
on the bank. Stand down.

1065
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:30,844
I repeat, have all units
stand down.

1066
01:29:30,846 --> 01:29:32,679
It's bullshit.
I can hear them already.

1067
01:29:34,182 --> 01:29:35,318
What the fuck are they doing?

1068
01:29:41,188 --> 01:29:42,354
Stop!

1069
01:29:42,356 --> 01:29:43,692
Get out!

1070
01:29:55,536 --> 01:29:57,572
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

1071
01:29:59,206 --> 01:30:00,506
Asshole!

1072
01:30:00,508 --> 01:30:02,207
What the fuck are you doing?
What's going on?

1073
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:04,176
You were running surveillance,
and you let this shit go down?

1074
01:30:04,178 --> 01:30:07,514
It's our fucking case. We've been
surveilling these guys for weeks.

1075
01:30:07,516 --> 01:30:08,747
That's what surveillance is!

1076
01:30:08,749 --> 01:30:11,417
They commit a crime,
and then we stop them.

1077
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:12,754
Go. Go to the vault.

1078
01:30:13,687 --> 01:30:14,723
Open it.

1079
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:31,072
Let's go. Come.

1080
01:30:34,409 --> 01:30:35,745
Sit. Sit down.

1081
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:45,417
I'm going to put this
on speaker phone.

1082
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:47,287
You're going to answer,
but don't use any names.

1083
01:30:47,289 --> 01:30:48,590
You understand?

1084
01:30:52,393 --> 01:30:53,792
Hello?

1085
01:30:53,794 --> 01:30:55,961
<i>Hello, this is the Los
Angeles Police Department.</i>

1086
01:30:55,963 --> 01:30:57,764
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

1087
01:30:57,766 --> 01:30:59,232
This is the branch manager.

1088
01:30:59,234 --> 01:31:01,234
<i>Sir, I need to speak
with the person in charge.</i>

1089
01:31:01,236 --> 01:31:03,101
You are.

1090
01:31:03,103 --> 01:31:06,271
<i>Okay, good. Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm Officer Parada...</i>

1091
01:31:06,273 --> 01:31:11,310
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Are our demands being met?

1092
01:31:11,312 --> 01:31:12,444
<i>Who am I talking with now?</i>

1093
01:31:12,446 --> 01:31:14,079
Answer the question.

1094
01:31:14,081 --> 01:31:15,747
It's being worked on
as we speak.

1095
01:31:15,749 --> 01:31:16,949
<i>But you need to understand...</i>

1096
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:18,253
You just killed a hostage.

1097
01:31:19,588 --> 01:31:20,990
Goddammit!

1098
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:30,462
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No! No!

1099
01:31:30,464 --> 01:31:32,165
Come on, move!

1100
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,600
I didn't do anything. Please.
What are you doing?

1101
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:39,007
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

1102
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:44,443
Fuck!

1103
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:46,345
- You were on it, huh?
- Shit!

1104
01:31:46,347 --> 01:31:47,814
You're so full of shit,
O'Brien...

1105
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:49,782
You heard the demands,
you stupid motherfucker!

1106
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:52,952
- Yeah.
- You put a negotiator on? Christ!

1107
01:31:52,954 --> 01:31:54,354
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

1108
01:31:54,356 --> 01:31:55,521
Yeah, fuck you!

1109
01:31:55,523 --> 01:31:57,489
Fucking nice haircut,
you fucking idiot.

1110
01:31:57,491 --> 01:31:58,992
Who are you fucking
pushing now?

1111
01:31:58,994 --> 01:32:00,493
Are you fucking kidding?

1112
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:02,494
- Get SWAT rolling right now!
- You stupid fucking pussy.

1113
01:32:02,496 --> 01:32:04,197
Fucking Lobbi''
Bob is angry!

1114
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,632
- All right, boss, let's go. Let's go.
- Shitheads!

1115
01:32:06,634 --> 01:32:08,667
- Let's go.
- Fuck!

1116
01:32:08,669 --> 01:32:10,302
We've got a situation
going on...

1117
01:32:10,304 --> 01:32:11,307
Shit!

1118
01:32:13,475 --> 01:32:15,311
What the fuck
are you doing, Merrimen?

1119
01:32:26,387 --> 01:32:27,819
Yeah?

1120
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:30,223
This is the Police Department.
Please don't hang up.

1121
01:32:30,225 --> 01:32:31,890
My name's Danny.

1122
01:32:31,892 --> 01:32:34,394
I'll be your only contact. Nobody
else is going to call you.

1123
01:32:34,396 --> 01:32:36,496
<i>Is this the person in charge?</i>

1124
01:32:36,498 --> 01:32:38,197
This is the branch manager.

1125
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:41,734
I'm speaking on
the man in charge's behalf.

1126
01:32:41,736 --> 01:32:43,670
<i>Do you have a name,
branch manager?</i>

1127
01:32:45,373 --> 01:32:48,878
Listen. They've already killed
one of the hostages. A woman.

1128
01:32:50,078 --> 01:32:52,077
They will not
speak to you again.

1129
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:55,681
If you call back again before their
demands are met, they'll kill another.

1130
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:57,583
Just send what they want.

1131
01:32:57,585 --> 01:32:59,551
<i>The money and the chopper
are en route,</i>

1132
01:32:59,553 --> 01:33:01,253
<i>but it's going to take
a little bit of time.</i>

1133
01:33:01,255 --> 01:33:04,526
<i>You need to give me at least 90 minutes.
Is this doable?</i>

1134
01:33:06,727 --> 01:33:08,730
Okay. Don't call back.

1135
01:33:34,054 --> 01:33:35,253
What's the prefix here?

1136
01:33:35,255 --> 01:33:36,592
562. It's Long Beach.

1137
01:33:43,597 --> 01:33:45,297
Hello?

1138
01:33:45,299 --> 01:33:46,569
You watching?

1139
01:33:51,138 --> 01:33:52,141
Yup.

1140
01:33:57,312 --> 01:33:59,281
So how the hell are you going
to get out of this one?

1141
01:34:00,949 --> 01:34:02,451
Not sure yet.

1142
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,790
Did you get my number
from her cell?

1143
01:34:15,629 --> 01:34:17,266
I ain't cuffing up.

1144
01:34:19,801 --> 01:34:21,469
That's okay.

1145
01:34:22,837 --> 01:34:25,441
I didn't bring
my cuffs anyway.

1146
01:34:27,142 --> 01:34:28,844
Yeah, I can see that.

1147
01:34:49,297 --> 01:34:50,799
Was that who I think it was?

1148
01:34:51,465 --> 01:34:52,634
Yup.

1149
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,306
We've got a chopper
that's gonna come down.

1150
01:35:01,308 --> 01:35:02,977
The chopper is going to land
right over here.

1151
01:35:10,852 --> 01:35:15,523
I've got two-door entry on one.
One-door entry on two.

1152
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:17,993
Breaching!

1153
01:35:24,999 --> 01:35:26,669
Well, they just
blew the vault.

1154
01:35:27,235 --> 01:35:28,670
What the fuck?

1155
01:35:38,913 --> 01:35:40,345
<i>Federal Reserve,
accounts receiving.</i>

1156
01:35:40,347 --> 01:35:42,180
Hey, it's Al at Alameda.

1157
01:35:42,182 --> 01:35:44,850
We have a drop at Pico Rivera
we need to schedule.

1158
01:35:44,852 --> 01:35:46,752
<i>How's Wednesday at 2:00?</i>

1159
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:49,188
<i>That works. You're
confirmed for 2:00 p.m. the 18th.</i>

1160
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:51,390
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

1161
01:35:51,392 --> 01:35:52,895
- We're here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's us.

1162
01:35:54,195 --> 01:35:55,563
So what is this?

1163
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:58,064
This is the sewer line,

1164
01:35:58,066 --> 01:36:00,769
and according to this map right
here, it's all cemented up.

1165
01:36:21,088 --> 01:36:22,423
Hey, where are we
with the chopper?

1166
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:25,457
We're waiting on clearance.

1167
01:36:25,459 --> 01:36:27,426
Relax, they're not
going anywhere.

1168
01:36:27,428 --> 01:36:30,796
To hell with clearance.
We've got to move.

1169
01:36:30,798 --> 01:36:32,234
O'Brien, hey!

1170
01:36:33,601 --> 01:36:36,301
Is he off his meds?

1171
01:36:36,303 --> 01:36:38,270
Tell him to get
the fuck back here!

1172
01:36:38,272 --> 01:36:39,572
Will you shut
the fuck up?

1173
01:36:39,574 --> 01:36:40,976
Oh, fuck you.

1174
01:36:51,084 --> 01:36:53,752
We better go
back him up.

1175
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:55,253
Nick's heading to the front.
We're on the move.

1176
01:36:55,255 --> 01:36:56,258
Here we go.

1177
01:37:01,963 --> 01:37:03,932
- Fuck!
- Is he serious?

1178
01:37:27,187 --> 01:37:28,487
Everybody okay?

1179
01:37:28,489 --> 01:37:29,857
Yes.

1180
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:40,002
Please, Lord, please,
let me see my family again.

1181
01:37:55,383 --> 01:37:56,885
- Nick!
- Sheriff's Department.

1182
01:37:57,852 --> 01:37:59,051
Nick!

1183
01:37:59,053 --> 01:38:00,155
Clear!

1184
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:04,692
Clear!

1185
01:38:12,366 --> 01:38:14,535
- The fuck?
- Nick, what's your location?

1186
01:38:18,338 --> 01:38:19,740
<i>What's your location?</i>

1187
01:38:28,215 --> 01:38:30,382
Hey, this is Al
at Alameda again.

1188
01:38:30,384 --> 01:38:33,019
I forgot to schedule a drop
at Pico Rivera Savings.

1189
01:38:33,021 --> 01:38:34,556
What do you have open today?

1190
01:38:42,195 --> 01:38:44,697
<i>Ghetto Bird, this is Silverback.
We confirmed?</i>

1191
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:48,103
Check. Appointment's at 2:45.
That's in two minutes.

1192
01:39:02,049 --> 01:39:03,252
Pico Rivera.

1193
01:39:11,926 --> 01:39:13,759
Horsepower all set?

1194
01:39:13,761 --> 01:39:15,297
<i>Yeah, I'm ready to go.</i>

1195
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:31,109
They got you
on a new route?

1196
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:34,079
Yeah. Yeah, they just
switched us over this week.

1197
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:37,750
All right. Let me get
you guys' IDs, man.

1198
01:39:37,752 --> 01:39:40,489
Yeah, sure. There you go.

1199
01:39:48,329 --> 01:39:49,498
All right.

1200
01:39:50,298 --> 01:39:51,796
You're good to go.

1201
01:39:51,798 --> 01:39:54,101
- All right, thank you.
- Open the gate. Have a good one.

1202
01:40:07,115 --> 01:40:08,116
Alameda's coming down.

1203
01:40:35,509 --> 01:40:36,511
Oh, fuck.

1204
01:40:46,687 --> 01:40:49,020
Pico Rivera Savings? 2.2?

1205
01:40:49,022 --> 01:40:50,523
Yup, that's us.

1206
01:40:50,525 --> 01:40:51,991
Bring her up.

1207
01:40:51,993 --> 01:40:53,861
All right, ready.
One, two, three.

1208
01:41:01,201 --> 01:41:03,204
- Sign here.
- You got it.

1209
01:41:04,539 --> 01:41:05,874
You're new here, Mark?

1210
01:41:06,874 --> 01:41:08,176
Yes, sir.

1211
01:41:10,343 --> 01:41:11,844
You guys running
a little bit late.

1212
01:41:11,846 --> 01:41:14,883
Yeah, we ran into
some traffic, so...

1213
01:41:16,584 --> 01:41:18,216
I don't know where they had
you guys routed before,

1214
01:41:18,218 --> 01:41:20,519
but we run a tight,
tight ship around here,

1215
01:41:20,521 --> 01:41:22,887
so, if you're going to be
late, have base call it in.

1216
01:41:22,889 --> 01:41:24,390
Yeah, no problem.
That's my fault. I just...

1217
01:41:24,392 --> 01:41:26,728
Just have them call.

1218
01:41:27,762 --> 01:41:28,897
On me.

1219
01:42:07,735 --> 01:42:10,435
Hey, Luigi. Alameda's on deck.
Check them in.

1220
01:42:10,437 --> 01:42:11,639
Copy that.

1221
01:42:12,139 --> 01:42:13,441
New guys.

1222
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:16,277
I'm going to step out
for a minute.

1223
01:42:43,637 --> 01:42:44,970
How you guys doing today?

1224
01:42:44,972 --> 01:42:46,808
- Good. All right.
- Good.

1225
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:53,945
How you doing?

1226
01:42:53,947 --> 01:42:56,515
- All right, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

1227
01:42:56,517 --> 01:42:58,120
Sign that for me, please.

1228
01:43:00,655 --> 01:43:02,688
All hundreds?

1229
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:05,494
The first one's all hundreds.
The second one is mixed.

1230
01:43:06,494 --> 01:43:07,960
We're a little backed up.

1231
01:43:07,962 --> 01:43:09,528
All right,
do what you can.

1232
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:11,796
Guys want to hang out, get a Coke
or something? Appreciate you.

1233
01:43:11,798 --> 01:43:12,801
Thank you.

1234
01:43:23,377 --> 01:43:25,677
We're going to need access
to the recording off-site.

1235
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,378
Can you get that to us?

1236
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:29,383
- Understood.
- You need professional help.

1237
01:43:30,151 --> 01:43:31,317
Desperately.

1238
01:43:31,319 --> 01:43:33,855
My bad last time.
Your crime scene.

1239
01:44:01,048 --> 01:44:04,183
Silverback,
this is Horsepower. I'm in.

1240
01:44:04,185 --> 01:44:07,722
Greenpeace, this is Silverback.
Horsepower is in.

1241
01:44:09,389 --> 01:44:11,726
Roger that, Silverback.
Lights out.

1242
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:21,536
Okay, here we go.

1243
01:44:24,571 --> 01:44:26,904
Johnny, we're fucking
brown again, man.

1244
01:44:26,906 --> 01:44:29,043
Got to shut down. Pull them
out of the count rooms.

1245
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:32,411
We're going brown.

1246
01:44:32,413 --> 01:44:35,049
We've got to shut down for a bit.
All teams go ahead and take 10.

1247
01:44:45,226 --> 01:44:46,292
Luigi, come on.

1248
01:44:46,294 --> 01:44:48,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1249
01:45:01,275 --> 01:45:03,277
They went to brown.
They're clearing out.

1250
01:45:05,478 --> 01:45:07,249
- Let's lock it down.
- Copy.

1251
01:45:12,786 --> 01:45:14,121
Get ready to go.

1252
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,136
<i>Powering up EMP now.</i>

1253
01:45:34,508 --> 01:45:35,808
All clear here.

1254
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:36,811
Good to go.

1255
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,282
You're clear. Go.

1256
01:45:49,289 --> 01:45:50,956
Shit.
Check something out.

1257
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:52,491
What do you think it is?

1258
01:45:52,493 --> 01:45:54,161
Are the cameras
up in the 100 room?

1259
01:45:55,695 --> 01:45:56,697
Uh, negative.

1260
01:46:02,303 --> 01:46:04,336
555-0143.

1261
01:46:04,338 --> 01:46:05,639
It's taking too long.

1262
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:07,840
Tasty Orders.

1263
01:46:07,842 --> 01:46:09,207
<i>This is Sharon at the Fed.</i>

1264
01:46:09,209 --> 01:46:11,476
<i>Now, we ordered almost
an hour and a half ago.</i>

1265
01:46:11,478 --> 01:46:13,345
<i>Now, I only have so much
time on my lunch break.</i>

1266
01:46:13,347 --> 01:46:15,514
It coming!
Be there in a few minute!

1267
01:46:15,516 --> 01:46:17,149
They just called
for the Chinese.

1268
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:18,320
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

1269
01:46:21,688 --> 01:46:23,488
Motion is out in there, too?

1270
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:24,725
Yeah, man, we're still brown.

1271
01:46:26,826 --> 01:46:29,360
You know, we better override.
Power it up.

1272
01:46:29,362 --> 01:46:30,365
All right.

1273
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:33,866
Done.

1274
01:46:33,868 --> 01:46:35,503
Okay. Better get
that count, too.

1275
01:46:47,347 --> 01:46:50,015
Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.

1276
01:46:50,017 --> 01:46:52,587
Hey, man, got to check this 100 count.
Motion went off.

1277
01:47:01,361 --> 01:47:03,230
- Luigi.
- Step on it. Step on it, quick.

1278
01:47:05,566 --> 01:47:06,698
Yeah?

1279
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,199
- Luigi.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1280
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:11,403
Damn, dude! Luigi, you're
stepping on the line, man!

1281
01:47:11,405 --> 01:47:13,104
Say again? Russell?

1282
01:47:13,106 --> 01:47:15,743
Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.

1283
01:47:18,579 --> 01:47:20,415
What the hell is
going on here today?

1284
01:47:23,918 --> 01:47:25,250
<i>Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.</i>

1285
01:47:25,252 --> 01:47:26,752
<i>He's hot like a motherfucker.</i>

1286
01:47:26,754 --> 01:47:29,387
He's in the cafeteria.
Go ahead and get him.

1287
01:47:29,389 --> 01:47:31,258
<i>All right. Roger that.
I'm stepping out.</i>

1288
01:47:40,066 --> 01:47:41,235
You're clear. Go.

1289
01:47:49,442 --> 01:47:50,578
Holy shit.

1290
01:48:28,115 --> 01:48:29,848
Luigi, you're hot-micing.

1291
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:31,783
You've got to let go of the talk button.
You're stepping on the line.

1292
01:48:31,785 --> 01:48:33,784
Dude, it's not me.

1293
01:48:33,786 --> 01:48:36,287
Come on, we've got to check the 100 count.
Let's go. Get Junior. Let's go.

1294
01:48:36,289 --> 01:48:37,956
<i>Switch to line five.</i>

1295
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:39,861
You got about a minute and a
half, two minutes. Let's go.

1296
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:09,824
They're back. Get out.

1297
01:49:49,362 --> 01:49:51,363
Luigi, you see
anything, man?

1298
01:49:51,365 --> 01:49:53,364
Yeah, we're good. There's
nothing back there but dust.

1299
01:49:53,366 --> 01:49:55,100
What am I looking for?

1300
01:49:55,102 --> 01:49:56,768
Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room, run the count,

1301
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:58,873
- <i>and make sure we're good, all right?</i>
- Copy that.

1302
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,939
Where are you?

1303
01:50:01,941 --> 01:50:03,877
This is Horsepower.
I'm in the vents.

1304
01:50:10,883 --> 01:50:12,587
Greenpeace, you're done.
Cut out.

1305
01:50:16,056 --> 01:50:18,724
We are back up, brother.

1306
01:50:18,726 --> 01:50:20,895
All teams,
back to the count room.

1307
01:50:23,297 --> 01:50:24,930
Get on with LAPD Central.

1308
01:50:24,932 --> 01:50:28,065
Tell them we're running
surveillance at 8th and Grand.

1309
01:50:28,067 --> 01:50:31,403
<i>Request a Code 5. We do not
wanna spook the suspects.</i>

1310
01:50:31,405 --> 01:50:32,974
<i>Copy that.
Putting in a Code 5.</i>

1311
01:50:35,142 --> 01:50:38,109
Am I tripping or
was this full before?

1312
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:39,480
Let's just
check the count.

1313
01:51:09,442 --> 01:51:10,611
$712,200.

1314
01:51:12,612 --> 01:51:13,981
$712,200.

1315
01:51:15,014 --> 01:51:17,285
Russell, the count is on.

1316
01:51:18,852 --> 01:51:21,118
All right, roger that. Go
ahead and clock out Alameda.

1317
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,522
Take Alameda out.

1318
01:51:44,712 --> 01:51:46,510
The count was good.

1319
01:51:46,512 --> 01:51:48,680
But both of your bins
were half-full.

1320
01:51:48,682 --> 01:51:50,348
Sorry?

1321
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:52,219
Your bins,
they were half-full.

1322
01:51:53,654 --> 01:51:55,019
That's how we got them.

1323
01:51:55,021 --> 01:51:58,823
Next time,
just put it in a cash sack.

1324
01:51:58,825 --> 01:52:00,524
Makes things a lot easier.

1325
01:52:00,526 --> 01:52:02,827
Try and work smart,
not hard.

1326
01:52:02,829 --> 01:52:04,064
Okay, sounds good.
Thanks for the advice.

1327
01:53:52,306 --> 01:53:56,174
We would tip you, honey, but that
just took too damn long, okay?

1328
01:53:56,176 --> 01:53:58,178
I'm the only guy they've got
delivering today. I'm sorry.

1329
01:54:24,704 --> 01:54:27,140
Sorry, guys, let me see
your drop confirmation again.

1330
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,177
- All right.
- There you go.

1331
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,229
Chinese food guy?

1332
01:54:48,995 --> 01:54:50,498
Go on. Buzz him in.

1333
01:54:55,835 --> 01:54:56,870
Hold him there.

1334
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,375
2-4-5.

1335
01:55:08,214 --> 01:55:09,549
Yeah, send him through.

1336
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:13,888
Come here for a sec, buddy.

1337
01:55:17,557 --> 01:55:19,393
Yeah, man, I don't
have you signed in.

1338
01:55:21,061 --> 01:55:23,360
I just started
my shift, but, uh...

1339
01:55:23,362 --> 01:55:25,195
Where's your name?

1340
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:28,265
Come on, man, I signed my name with
a dude from the last shift, man.

1341
01:55:28,267 --> 01:55:29,536
I don't know
what to tell you.

1342
01:55:33,373 --> 01:55:34,439
Mmm-mmm.

1343
01:55:34,441 --> 01:55:36,110
Damn you finicky.

1344
01:55:37,244 --> 01:55:38,710
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1345
01:55:38,712 --> 01:55:40,577
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1346
01:55:40,579 --> 01:55:41,748
That's all I need.

1347
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:49,119
All right, you boys
are good to go.

1348
01:55:49,121 --> 01:55:50,721
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Take it easy.

1349
01:55:50,723 --> 01:55:52,226
- You have a good day.
- All right.

1350
01:55:58,898 --> 01:56:01,134
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

1351
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:06,607
Yes, security
in the lobby, please.

1352
01:56:15,915 --> 01:56:16,982
Lobby.

1353
01:56:16,984 --> 01:56:18,984
Yeah, did you see
a delivery guy?

1354
01:56:18,986 --> 01:56:21,455
Red shirt, light skin.
About 6 foot.

1355
01:56:22,789 --> 01:56:24,926
- Wait, what?
- Stop him.

1356
01:56:29,262 --> 01:56:32,166
You got eyes on the 1-2 side?
We'll cover the 3-4 corner.

1357
01:56:33,165 --> 01:56:34,634
Copy that.

1358
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:49,180
Got held up at security.
What's your location?

1359
01:56:49,182 --> 01:56:52,149
South on Grand,
just past Vernon.

1360
01:56:52,151 --> 01:56:54,685
<i>Go right on Gage.
Right on Gage.</i>

1361
01:56:54,687 --> 01:56:55,789
Copy that.

1362
01:57:16,977 --> 01:57:18,877
Move! Let's go! Get out!

1363
01:57:18,879 --> 01:57:21,345
- Come on, move! Move! Here we go!
- It's cool.

1364
01:57:21,347 --> 01:57:23,648
- Come on, get down! Go! Go! Go!
- It's cool. I'm cool, man.

1365
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:24,986
Be cool, bro. Cool.

1366
01:57:26,652 --> 01:57:28,054
Fuck.

1367
01:57:47,507 --> 01:57:49,207
There he is. There he is.
Red shirt. Two blocks ahead.

1368
01:57:49,209 --> 01:57:51,009
Eyes on suspect.

1369
01:57:51,011 --> 01:57:55,012
Walking eastbound on 9th, approaching
Hill, south side of street.

1370
01:57:55,014 --> 01:57:57,549
Pull up in front of him,
in front of him.

1371
01:57:57,551 --> 01:57:59,184
Let's get this motherfucker.

1372
01:57:59,186 --> 01:58:00,855
Let's ram his bitch-ass
into the gate first.

1373
01:58:03,557 --> 01:58:06,060
Get in the fucking car!
Come on. Get in.

1374
01:58:07,861 --> 01:58:09,527
Fuck.

1375
01:58:09,529 --> 01:58:10,531
Hit him!

1376
01:58:19,705 --> 01:58:21,708
Motherfucker.

1377
01:58:38,391 --> 01:58:40,928
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's
get it done as quick as we can.

1378
01:58:45,965 --> 01:58:47,899
What the fuck.

1379
01:58:47,901 --> 01:58:50,404
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he, asshole?

1380
01:58:51,271 --> 01:58:52,273
Fuck.

1381
01:58:54,941 --> 01:58:56,911
<i>Fucking... Fucker!</i>

1382
01:58:58,911 --> 01:59:01,949
Give me the burner phone.
Where the fuck is he?

1383
01:59:05,919 --> 01:59:08,086
Pacific Horizon Salvage.

1384
01:59:08,088 --> 01:59:10,758
In South Gate.
That's the rally point.

1385
01:59:19,932 --> 01:59:21,799
Silverback, go.

1386
01:59:21,801 --> 01:59:23,303
<i>Horsepower's burned.</i>

1387
01:59:25,304 --> 01:59:26,671
Repeat that.
I can't hear you.

1388
01:59:26,673 --> 01:59:29,006
Horsepower is burned.

1389
01:59:29,008 --> 01:59:30,643
<i>He's done.</i>

1390
01:59:31,945 --> 01:59:33,848
I'm still clean.
Where am I going, bro?

1391
01:59:53,465 --> 01:59:55,300
Fuck!

1392
01:59:55,302 --> 01:59:57,301
Let's go. Let's go.
You guys got it all?

1393
01:59:57,303 --> 01:59:58,836
- Yes, it's all in.
- Pick it up.

1394
01:59:58,838 --> 01:59:59,840
It's good.

1395
02:00:01,975 --> 02:00:05,976
Pacific Horizon Salvage.
South Gate, Alameda Corridor.

1396
02:00:05,978 --> 02:00:07,481
10-4. Headed to you.

1397
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,688
What happened
to the other two?

1398
02:00:19,825 --> 02:00:21,395
They got burned.

1399
02:00:47,053 --> 02:00:48,418
Eyes on suspects.

1400
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,191
Black, four-door Suburban!

1401
02:00:55,695 --> 02:00:57,764
Heading southbound on Alameda.

1402
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:04,538
Approaching Slauson Avenue. I need
you to parallel me on Santa Fe.

1403
02:01:14,213 --> 02:01:16,049
We got some traffic up ahead.
What's going on?

1404
02:01:17,249 --> 02:01:18,551
Corridor's backed up.

1405
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:28,094
We just turned down Alameda Corridor, heading south.

1406
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:38,739
Shit.

1407
02:01:47,746 --> 02:01:49,747
Coming up on suspect,
6 o'clock.

1408
02:01:49,749 --> 02:01:51,149
Shit.

1409
02:01:51,151 --> 02:01:53,318
Right lane is
closed up ahead.

1410
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:56,456
<i>I repeat, right lane is
closed up ahead.</i>

1411
02:02:01,294 --> 02:02:03,594
You guys see that?

1412
02:02:03,596 --> 02:02:05,665
Twenty, 30 cars back.
What is that?

1413
02:02:09,669 --> 02:02:10,938
Is that...

1414
02:02:15,808 --> 02:02:17,844
Okay, we're at
a stop, stop, stop.

1415
02:02:20,012 --> 02:02:21,681
Fuck backup.
We've got to move.

1416
02:02:22,816 --> 02:02:24,151
Fuck.

1417
02:02:31,324 --> 02:02:32,459
Yup.

1418
02:02:38,365 --> 02:02:39,697
That's them.

1419
02:02:45,472 --> 02:02:47,637
- Give me my vest.
- Yeah.

1420
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:49,209
Yeah, here we go.

1421
02:02:53,045 --> 02:02:55,380
Okay, we've got them pinched in. We've
got to move before it opens up.

1422
02:02:55,382 --> 02:02:56,683
Cuff him up.

1423
02:03:06,659 --> 02:03:09,226
Be advised, suspects
wearing body armor.

1424
02:03:09,228 --> 02:03:12,162
No center mass shots.
Limb and head shots only.

1425
02:03:12,164 --> 02:03:13,333
Copy that.
Go around right here.

1426
02:03:18,004 --> 02:03:19,506
It's jammed up.

1427
02:03:26,678 --> 02:03:28,681
Good? Okay, let's go.

1428
02:03:39,526 --> 02:03:41,426
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1429
02:03:41,428 --> 02:03:42,696
They're getting
out of the car.

1430
02:03:48,767 --> 02:03:50,100
Z, go down the right.

1431
02:03:50,102 --> 02:03:53,069
Gus, Borracho,
center with me.

1432
02:03:53,071 --> 02:03:56,573
Murph, stay on the left.
Don't come in.

1433
02:03:56,575 --> 02:03:58,212
- Pass me the saw.
- Fuck.

1434
02:04:00,547 --> 02:04:01,749
Let's go.

1435
02:04:03,115 --> 02:04:04,283
Stay down. Stay down.

1436
02:04:31,744 --> 02:04:33,112
Get down. Get down.

1437
02:04:37,282 --> 02:04:39,419
- Sheriff's Department. Stay down.
- Get down. Get down.

1438
02:04:46,926 --> 02:04:49,096
- Get down.
- Sheriff's Department, stay down.

1439
02:04:52,264 --> 02:04:54,634
Get down. Get down.
Stay by the engine block.

1440
02:04:57,770 --> 02:04:59,306
Get down
behind the wheel.

1441
02:05:06,846 --> 02:05:08,449
Sheriff's Department.
Lady, get in the car.

1442
02:05:14,454 --> 02:05:15,489
Oh, shit.

1443
02:05:18,191 --> 02:05:19,460
Borracho!

1444
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:26,967
Moving!

1445
02:05:49,556 --> 02:05:53,390
Gus, Murph, you two go across
and cut them off, okay?

1446
02:05:53,392 --> 02:05:55,828
Tony Z, you ready?

1447
02:05:56,562 --> 02:05:57,864
Let's go.

1448
02:06:07,955 --> 02:06:09,092
Moving!

1449
02:06:20,669 --> 02:06:21,671
Moving!

1450
02:06:25,173 --> 02:06:26,174
Moving!

1451
02:06:26,642 --> 02:06:27,644
Move!

1452
02:06:32,981 --> 02:06:35,151
Moving. Moving.

1453
02:06:40,289 --> 02:06:41,657
Mag change!

1454
02:06:48,196 --> 02:06:49,197
Moving.

1455
02:06:53,968 --> 02:06:54,971
Mag change.

1456
02:07:07,548 --> 02:07:08,551
Moving!

1457
02:07:13,489 --> 02:07:15,157
Go! Go! Peel off!

1458
02:07:25,366 --> 02:07:26,500
Tony, you okay?

1459
02:07:26,502 --> 02:07:28,204
- Yeah, go! Go!
- You okay?

1460
02:07:29,237 --> 02:07:30,239
Fuck!

1461
02:07:35,343 --> 02:07:36,346
Go!

1462
02:07:44,386 --> 02:07:45,388
Cover!

1463
02:07:50,392 --> 02:07:51,394
Move.

1464
02:08:01,236 --> 02:08:02,238
Fuck!

1465
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:20,921
Brick wall! Brick wall!

1466
02:08:20,923 --> 02:08:22,392
Behind the brick building!

1467
02:10:10,164 --> 02:10:11,665
My kid...

1468
02:10:13,035 --> 02:10:14,537
You're in His hands now.

1469
02:10:15,704 --> 02:10:17,005
You hear me?

1470
02:11:06,588 --> 02:11:07,590
Fuck!

1471
02:12:49,825 --> 02:12:51,027
Don't do it.

1472
02:13:18,186 --> 02:13:19,522
Told you.

1473
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:36,739
Yeah. You did.

1474
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,469
What the fuck?

1475
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:53,982
You see this?

1476
02:14:55,115 --> 02:14:56,451
Here. Do those.

1477
02:15:01,623 --> 02:15:02,625
Oh, shit.

1478
02:15:09,297 --> 02:15:12,634
So what? They were going to
make fucking snow globes?

1479
02:15:13,802 --> 02:15:15,638
Like 10,000 of them?

1480
02:15:24,846 --> 02:15:26,679
You check on the boys?

1481
02:15:26,681 --> 02:15:28,817
Yeah, I'm going to
roll to the hospital.

1482
02:15:33,487 --> 02:15:35,691
You gonna call
Borracho's wife?

1483
02:15:44,365 --> 02:15:45,533
Yeah.

1484
02:15:48,703 --> 02:15:50,172
All right.

1485
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:53,843
This won't go to Harbor.

1486
02:16:12,727 --> 02:16:14,563
I'm sorry you lost
one of your guys.

1487
02:16:16,364 --> 02:16:17,430
Thanks.

1488
02:16:17,432 --> 02:16:19,265
You all right?

1489
02:16:19,267 --> 02:16:20,703
Yeah, I'm okay.

1490
02:16:22,036 --> 02:16:23,403
Yeah.

1491
02:16:23,405 --> 02:16:26,575
Nick, you've got to stop
smoking, man.

1492
02:16:27,374 --> 02:16:28,377
Here.

1493
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:31,579
It's organic.

1494
02:16:40,054 --> 02:16:42,624
You know everything was accounted
for at the Fed, right?

1495
02:16:45,093 --> 02:16:46,428
Apparently so.

1496
02:18:17,017 --> 02:18:18,186
Hey, is Donnie around?

1497
02:18:20,354 --> 02:18:21,489
He quit.

1498
02:18:23,991 --> 02:18:25,526
So you haven't
seen him anywhere?

1499
02:18:26,861 --> 02:18:28,497
I said he quit.

1500
02:18:29,329 --> 02:18:30,531
Two days ago.

1501
02:18:46,181 --> 02:18:47,515
You want a beer?

1502
02:18:48,215 --> 02:18:51,049
Very much so. Like 50.

1503
02:18:57,524 --> 02:18:59,227
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1504
02:19:13,874 --> 02:19:16,876
Did you see that new chick?
Little fat-ass?

1505
02:19:16,878 --> 02:19:18,914
The new girl who works
down the hall?

1506
02:19:20,548 --> 02:19:22,914
What's going on, gentlemen?

1507
02:19:22,916 --> 02:19:26,218
- Gentlemen, good to see you.
- Yo!

1508
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:29,223
- Good to see you.
- Your wife know where you are?

1509
02:19:44,571 --> 02:19:45,938
How did you get that job?

1510
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:47,241
Can you actually count?

1511
02:19:48,943 --> 02:19:51,076
<i>I'm in complete
control of my environment.</i>

1512
02:19:51,078 --> 02:19:52,146
People don't even know.

1513
02:20:21,141 --> 02:20:22,810
Fucking <i>Fraulein.</i>

1514
02:20:33,154 --> 02:20:34,486
What's going on, boys?

1515
02:20:34,488 --> 02:20:35,823
How you doing?
You good?

1516
02:20:36,791 --> 02:20:37,960
Some beers?

1517
02:20:38,459 --> 02:20:39,992
Hey, guv.

1518
02:20:39,994 --> 02:20:41,530
A round of beers
for my mates.

1519
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:44,297
And for you?

1520
02:20:44,299 --> 02:20:45,300
I'm easy.

1521
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:51,472
I don't know.

1522
02:20:52,006 --> 02:20:53,008
Surprise me.

1523
02:20:56,143 --> 02:20:57,513
I can do that.

1524
02:20:58,812 --> 02:21:00,481
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1525
02:21:01,481 --> 02:21:03,014
So why you come to me?

1526
02:21:03,016 --> 02:21:04,683
You're a beast, man.

1527
02:21:04,685 --> 02:21:06,184
Plus, you're the only one
that can pull this off.

1528
02:21:06,186 --> 02:21:08,186
Listen.

1529
02:21:08,188 --> 02:21:10,156
We do this,
I call the shots.

1530
02:21:10,158 --> 02:21:11,860
My crew, my job,
not yours.

1531
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:14,659
Got it?

1532
02:21:14,661 --> 02:21:16,831
- Completely understand.
- That's the way it has to be.

1533
02:21:17,998 --> 02:21:19,332
That's it.

1534
02:21:19,334 --> 02:21:20,866
It's my baby.

1535
02:21:20,868 --> 02:21:21,870
That's what I've got.

1536
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:25,504
How did you get
a hold of all this stuff?

1537
02:21:25,506 --> 02:21:27,176
You got this all
at that bar?

1538
02:21:28,243 --> 02:21:29,378
Collected it over time.

1539
02:21:31,845 --> 02:21:32,880
Wow.

1540
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:44,059
Job for Superman.

1541
02:21:57,372 --> 02:21:59,438
Cheers.

1542
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:01,707
Thank you. I love when
you call me Princess.

1543
02:22:03,043 --> 02:22:04,579
You work across the street?

1544
02:22:04,911 --> 02:22:05,914
Yeah.

1545
02:22:06,747 --> 02:22:08,246
Diamond exchange?

1546
02:22:08,248 --> 02:22:09,250
That's right.

1547
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:14,422
Beer's on me.

1548
02:22:15,351 --> 02:22:20,351

00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,617
Hmm.

3
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,098
No!

4
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,435
No!

5
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,963
He took my hand.

6
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,599
He took my hand!

7
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,012
Talulah, stop.

8
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:05,185
Honey?

9
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,667
Is he early?

10
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,036
Yeah.

11
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,706
It's only the 22nd.

12
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,342
He couldn't wait, John.

13
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,718
- Honey.
- Huh?

14
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,555
I think you might need these.

15
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:44,390
You okay?

16
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,025
- Me?
- Yeah.

17
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:49,097
Good, yeah. Yeah, seriously.

18
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:50,899
I'm good.

19
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,338
Aw.

20
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,273
You'll never believe it.

21
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,410
We're gonna bring you home
a little brother.

22
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,679
Finally.

23
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:52,092
You want to try
Dr. Lee again?

24
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:54,662
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay. Just a sec, okay?

25
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,732
Looks good, right?
Everything looks good?

26
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:03,671
You okay?

27
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:05,074
- Mmm.
- Good.

28
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,077
Okay?

29
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:17,952
Listen.

30
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:18,512
- Good.
- Breathe, baby, breathe.

31
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:19,848
Good, good.

32
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,383
- Good.
- Breathe.

33
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,420
Take a breath.
Ready? Push.

34
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:29,157
Push, push, push.

35
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,692
- Good. Push.
- Push, breathe, breathe.

36
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:34,663
Great, good, good.
Okay...

37
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,064
Here he comes!

38
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,498
Police!
Get down on your knees!

39
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,667
You heard him! Get down!

40
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,734
Stay where you are!

41
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:41,770
Get down on your knees!

42
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,006
He's got something
behind his back!

43
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:48,745
- What the hell was that?
- Get a light on him.

44
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:52,747
Go through the house.

45
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:53,882
Make sure nobody's inside.

46
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,550
Bravo team, let's go inside.

47
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,426
Oh, you're perfect.

48
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:39,397
He's perfect.

49
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,780
Are his eyes different colors?

50
00:07:57,782 --> 00:08:00,750
Yeah, it's called
heterochromia.

51
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:03,488
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's a genetic trait.

52
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:08,623
Oh, whoa.
He's like David Bowie.

53
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,426
He is.

54
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:12,962
He is my little glam rocker.

55
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:15,164
We tried so long to have you.

56
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,834
We weren't sure
you'd ever come.

57
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:22,640
It's gonna be...

58
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,541
Okay.

59
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:26,976
There we go.

60
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:29,378
Isn't he supposed to cry?

61
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,614
Well, most do,
but it's not required.

62
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:32,882
Is everything all right?

63
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:35,217
Nothing wrong
with this little guy.

64
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,321
- He is very aware.
- Yes.

65
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,955
Mama.

66
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,857
Did he really just say that?

67
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,162
<i>You know, he's even
been using some words.</i>

68
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:46,962
That's quite early.

69
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:48,498
Usually,
language doesn't come on

70
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,300
for about a year or so.

71
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,835
There's nothing wrong.

72
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,504
Your son's
just developing early.

73
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:57,039
He's what we call
a smarty-pants.

74
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,544
Smarty-pants.

75
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,948
Good job, honey.
Can you show me again?

76
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,750
Put him inside the castle?

77
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,023
What are you reading?

78
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,958
Oh. <i>Nurturing Genius.</i>

79
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,127
Yes.

80
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,431
<i>A Gifted Life.</i>

81
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,499
I'm preparing.

82
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,733
For what?

83
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,070
<i>Miles' brain
isn't wired like other kids.</i>

84
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,106
Oh, oh, oh! Yes!

85
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,240
<i>He's special.</i>

86
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:31,607
Good job!

87
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,609
And I was thinking, we should
really start thinking

88
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,178
about preschool, seriously.

89
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,514
Preschools? He's two.

90
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:38,815
Isn't that a bit early?

91
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,919
These aren't regular
preschools. They're special.

92
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,919
It's a preschool.

93
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:45,055
We need
a letter of recommendation?

94
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:49,228
Honey,
it's a very good preschool.

95
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:18,855
Are we going to Dr. Collins?

96
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:21,091
No, Mom's taking you
to see a different doctor.

97
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,529
Go.

98
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:26,999
Good. Very fast.

99
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,333
Go.

100
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,601
<i>You were right
to bring him in.</i>

101
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,836
<i>Miles' intelligence
is off the charts.</i>

102
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:35,672
<i>I don't have an exact score,
but it'll be very high.</i>

103
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:36,973
How about his behavior?

104
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,343
Is he adjusting well
to preschool?

105
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:42,480
He's been having a very
difficult time making friends.

106
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:43,847
Well, Miles' brain is

107
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:45,949
extremely well-developed
in certain regions,

108
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:48,452
but there are other areas
that appear to be delayed.

109
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,454
I'm not sure why
he wouldn't be as developed

110
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:53,324
in those areas,
but we need to watch it.

111
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:54,991
And you and your husband
should really consider

112
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,627
a dedicated education plan.

113
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,063
There's this excellent school,
it's called Penmark.

114
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,464
It's a little bit
more expensive

115
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,765
than the school
you have him at now,

116
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,000
but they're just outstanding

117
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:05,169
with kids
with specialized needs,

118
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,171
just like Miles.

119
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:08,807
I can call ahead for you,
if you like.

120
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:20,284
Here. Finish your homework
after you eat.

121
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:23,854
That's not homework,
by the way.

122
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,691
We don't have homework.

123
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,959
Yeah? How come I had homework
when I was a kid?

124
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:29,896
Because you're not
as smart as me.

125
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,896
Excuse me?

126
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:32,997
Yeah?

127
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,032
Do you have any paprika?

128
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:37,134
Paprika? How do you even know
what that is?

129
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:39,203
I don't know. Just want some.

130
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:41,573
I am so ready
to go out tonight.

131
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,177
Here.
Knock yourself out.

132
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:45,878
Ah.

133
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,014
Excuse me.

134
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,583
When did you start using that?

135
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,654
- I don't know.
- Hey.

136
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,491
Can you please do
that eye thing for me?

137
00:11:58,392 --> 00:11:59,426
Um...

138
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:02,994
There it is!

139
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,230
Do you wanna do
a staring contest?

140
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,701
No, you have to finish
your dinner.

141
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:10,803
Okay, all right.

142
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,343
Are you ready?

143
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:19,480
Oh, I'm ready.

144
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:22,383
One,

145
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:24,485
two,

146
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:26,553
three.

147
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,958
- You just blinked!
- I did!

148
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,127
I did, I did, I did!
You win.

149
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,062
- You win! You win!
- Yes!

150
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:38,230
- Finish.
- No.

151
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:39,364
- Yes.
- Because that means

152
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,066
you guys are gonna leave me
with Zoe.

153
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,601
But you love Zoe.

154
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:43,637
I know.

155
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,406
Hey.

156
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:49,043
Anytime you need a kiss
from me...

157
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:52,980
Yes.

158
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:59,720
You want a regular beer
or a fancy beer?

159
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:01,922
Fancy.

160
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,290
All right, drink up.

161
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,294
We're not leaving
till these are gone.

162
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,633
I still can't believe

163
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:15,936
we actually live
in the suburbs.

164
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,272
Really?

165
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:23,676
Doesn't it seem like yesterday
that we were kid-free?

166
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,014
We were drunk all the time
and everything was so fun.

167
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:32,184
Baby, now we're
totally normal.

168
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,987
But we're still drunk
all the time.

169
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,023
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

170
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,525
When I picked up Miles
from school today,

171
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,960
Mr. Schub said that he didn't
wanna join the science club.

172
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:44,262
Why doesn't he ever wanna do
activities with other kids?

173
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:46,033
You know what? New rule.

174
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,670
No kid talk on date night.

175
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:52,137
- Okay.
- Seriously.

176
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,240
- We have a super smart kid.
- Mmm-hmm.

177
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:55,475
- Is that a bad thing?
- Mmm-mmm.

178
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,542
You want him

179
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,677
- to be like everyone else?
- Mmm-mmm.

180
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,010
- Are we like everyone else?
- No.

181
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,112
No.

182
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:01,647
I mean, look,

183
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,282
this is our date night.

184
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:05,286
Yeah, because we're cool.

185
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:15,894
Your mom said
only two episodes.

186
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,233
Tell you what.

187
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,072
What if we play one game
before bedtime?

188
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,074
Just one.

189
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,175
Hide-and-seek.

190
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:31,210
Okay. You want me
to count or hide?

191
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:32,880
You count.

192
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,082
Cool.

193
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:44,559
One, two, three, four,

194
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,298
five, six, seven, eight,

195
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,267
nine, ten!

196
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,271
Ready or not, here I come!

197
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,246
What're you doing?
You're supposed to hide.

198
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:10,786
Miles, are you okay?

199
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:15,458
You want more time?

200
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,962
Okay, cool.

201
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:28,602
One, two, three, four,

202
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:33,807
five, six, seven, eight,

203
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,210
nine, ten...

204
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:41,484
11, 12, 13, 14...

205
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,484
15...

206
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,124
...17, 18...

207
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,058
19...

208
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,161
20.

209
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,971
Okay. Ready or not,
here I come!

210
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,239
Okay, I got you.

211
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,145
Okay, I give up.
You can come up now.

212
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,449
Miles!

213
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,263
Miles?

214
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,803
Miles!

215
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,106
Miles!

216
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,110
I want you to tell me
everything that you remember.

217
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,382
Um, me and Zoe
were watching TV,

218
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:56,087
then she was hurt.

219
00:17:57,587 --> 00:18:00,423
Then...
Then she started screaming.

220
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,691
And then I saw blood.

221
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:06,563
Miles, you must remember
something else.

222
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:10,101
When did Zoe go
into the basement?

223
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,804
I don't know.

224
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,505
She was counting
and then she was hurt.

225
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:19,307
There was blood everywhere

226
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,475
- and I didn't know what to do.
- Okay.

227
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,410
It's okay, sweetie.

228
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,713
I don't remember anything.

229
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:27,016
It's okay. It was an accident.

230
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,821
It was just an accident

231
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:33,718
Talulah.

232
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,820
What's up?

233
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:39,858
Hey!

234
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,929
What are you doing here?

235
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,866
I heard you talking
in your sleep.

236
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:57,869
You were having a bad dream.

237
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,240
No, I wasn't.

238
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:07,612
I mean, it wasn't a bad dream,
it was a good dream.

239
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,413
I wanna work with Hailey.

240
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,685
Sorry, we already made
our plan.

241
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,094
Yeah, go ahead
and use the bathroom, Miles.

242
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:18,784
Dash.

243
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:20,953
Dash!

244
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:25,858
Help him!

245
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,732
What do you see in this one?

246
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:36,569
A face.

247
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:39,672
Whose face?

248
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:42,175
I don't know.

249
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,080
And what do you see
in that one?

250
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:50,150
Hands.

251
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,054
Whose hands?

252
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:58,058
The hands of a nice lady.

253
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:04,829
When you hit that boy
at school,

254
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,867
can you remember
what you were feeling?

255
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:13,674
You can tell me how you felt.

256
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:19,512
I thought if I did it,
I wouldn't get hurt anymore.

257
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,249
Get hurt?

258
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,052
Has someone hurt you?

259
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm afraid to tell you.

260
00:23:29,022 --> 00:23:30,958
I don't want anyone
to get in trouble.

261
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,161
Who?
Get who in trouble?

262
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,765
The person
who's been hurting me.

263
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:41,766
<i>I want to consider</i>

264
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,702
<i>a course of medication
for Miles</i>

265
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,770
and he may need a specialist.

266
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:48,374
A behavioral interventionist,
someone who can help him

267
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:49,943
- with his anger issues.
- Okay.

268
00:23:51,044 --> 00:23:52,311
What's wrong with him?

269
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,045
At first, I thought
it might be a deficit

270
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,881
in his cognitive morality
or maybe ODD...

271
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:59,220
Oppositional defiance
disorder, but honestly...

272
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,388
I'm not sure.

273
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,457
Maybe you should listen
to this.

274
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,427
I recorded this
while he was sleeping.

275
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:08,495
Yeah, okay.

276
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,165
Sarah, I hate to ask this.

277
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,598
Is there any possibility

278
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,335
that Miles has suffered
some kind of abuse

279
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:18,039
from someone in your family?

280
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:21,506
What the hell
are you accusing me of?

281
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:23,476
I am not accusing you
of anything, John.

282
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:24,909
I'm telling you what she said.

283
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:26,580
I never touched our son.

284
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:28,749
Is this about my dad?

285
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:33,953
My dad was a piece of shit.

286
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:36,688
I have processed all of that.
You know that.

287
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,258
That was part of us
deciding to have kids.

288
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,628
I would never hit Miles.
I love that kid.

289
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,463
<i>Maybe Strasser's wrong.</i>

290
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:45,998
<i>You've always said
he's wired differently.</i>

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,333
<i>What if this is
just the way he is?</i>

292
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:48,533
<i>This is not the way
that he is.</i>

293
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:49,835
<i>All right.</i>

294
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:52,138
<i>I don't understand
what's happening, John.</i>

295
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,206
<i>I don't understand
what's going on.</i>

296
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,885
I just checked on him.

297
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,989
That medication
really knocked him out.

298
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:11,724
You okay?

299
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:13,661
Mmm.

300
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:23,838
I'm sorry.

301
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,242
We're gonna
figure this out, all right?

302
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:37,319
Yeah.

303
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:45,227
Hey, I'm worried
about you, too.

304
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:48,894
I feel like
I'm going crazy.

305
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:50,199
It's gonna be okay.

306
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,068
We just have to keep strong.

307
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:55,770
Okay?

308
00:25:58,574 --> 00:25:59,707
Okay.

309
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:07,174
Go fuck yourself.

310
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,798
What is it?

311
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,301
What happened? What happened?

312
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,468
There's someone in here.

313
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,636
Where?

314
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:36,937
He's in here.

315
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,606
Honey, it sounds like you
were having a bad dream.

316
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:40,308
- No. No.
- There's no one in here.

317
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,513
No. He's in here.

318
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,981
He's inside here.

319
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:49,686
- He's inside here.
- Okay, come here. Oh, baby.

320
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:21,384
Arthur, hi. Elaine Strasser.

321
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:26,055
Yeah, do you...
Do you have a minute?

322
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:36,330
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.

323
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:37,735
They lock it up
on the weekends.

324
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:42,071
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

325
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:48,410
Arthur Jacobson.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

326
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:49,613
Hello.

327
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:54,716
Has Elaine explained anything

328
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:56,185
about the type
of research I do?

329
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:59,053
Good.

330
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:00,389
I'd like to start
with a few questions

331
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,725
before we get into that.

332
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,058
Okay.

333
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,294
Does anyone in your family

334
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:06,563
speak a foreign language,
Sarah?

335
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,131
John and I both took Spanish

336
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,532
in high school
but neither of us

337
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:11,966
remember more than
a few words.

338
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:14,169
And what about
the boy's grandparents?

339
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,271
Any recent immigrants
in your family?

340
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:17,807
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

341
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:20,778
Is this your son's voice?

342
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,659
Yes. Yes, that's Miles.

343
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:41,063
It's just some gibberish
from a dream.

344
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:43,632
Actually, it's not gibberish.

345
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:46,103
I had the words translated
by a colleague of mine.

346
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:47,638
What is it?

347
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:49,838
Hungarian.

348
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,441
Specifically,
a rare dialect of Hungarian

349
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:54,478
only spoken
near the Romanian border.

350
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,579
Listen to what
happens next, Sarah.

351
00:29:57,581 --> 00:29:58,980
This is equally important.

352
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:01,151
<i>I heard you
talking in your sleep.</i>

353
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,021
<i>You were having a bad dream.</i>

354
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:07,324
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

355
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:14,797
<i>I mean, it wasn't a bad dream,
it was a good dream.</i>

356
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,433
Miles says
it was a good dream.

357
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:18,801
Why is that important?

358
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:21,506
The words, Sarah.
What Miles said.

359
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,442
"Shut up, you filthy whore.

360
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:28,877
"Stop crying
or I'll cut your eyes out.

361
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,446
"I'm going to watch you die."

362
00:30:30,448 --> 00:30:32,315
No. No, Miles did not
say that.

363
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:34,049
But he did.

364
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:35,718
And he did it in a dialect

365
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,689
spoken by less than
400,000 people in the world.

366
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:41,393
Does Miles get along well
with children his age?

367
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:46,197
Has he ever mentioned
feeling displaced in his body?

368
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,964
Yes.

369
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,167
What about his taste in food?

370
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:52,537
Have you noticed
any change in his palate?

371
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,971
These are indicators.

372
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:57,375
Indicators of what?

373
00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:05,248
Half the people on earth,
billions of them,

374
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,917
believe that consciousness
and energy,

375
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,520
what we often
refer to as our souls,

376
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:12,422
are capable of returning

377
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:15,057
to this physical realm
to live new lives.

378
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,727
It's only foreign
to Western minds.

379
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:19,863
In most of the world,

380
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:22,567
reincarnation is an accepted
part of life.

381
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,503
Reincarnation?

382
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:33,376
What are we talking about?

383
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:36,412
Let me tell you about a boy
I met when I was in India.

384
00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:39,048
His name was Padman,
around six years old.

385
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,685
But his family claimed
he was much older.

386
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:45,455
He could remember every detail
from a previous life.

387
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:47,891
The bakery he owned,
his siblings,

388
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:50,694
his mother's favorite song.

389
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:52,463
He even described
his death in detail,

390
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:54,865
what it felt like
when he was drowning.

391
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,033
I found the town he described

392
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,535
about 100 miles
from his village,

393
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:00,604
and I took Padman there.

394
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:03,607
He showed me directly to
the house where he was born.

395
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,642
Introduced me
to his brothers and sisters

396
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:08,312
who were by now
over 50 years old.

397
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,113
We stayed there
for three weeks

398
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:13,417
with an old woman
he claimed to be his mother,

399
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:15,955
singing to her
as she passed away.

400
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,957
Now, I believe

401
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,593
that the soul inside Padman

402
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:26,365
drowned before he had a chance
to say goodbye to his mother.

403
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,633
And when we allowed
this entity

404
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:32,001
to finish what it had
left undone,

405
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:33,670
Padman returned
to being a little boy.

406
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:35,839
In an instant,
he was back,

407
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:38,475
with very little memory
of what had happened.

408
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:40,777
This would explain so much.

409
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,779
The crucial thing
to understand here

410
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:45,984
is that these souls
return for a reason.

411
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,085
To complete something
left unfinished,

412
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,653
to find closure.

413
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,154
So, you're saying
that my son is possessed?

414
00:32:51,156 --> 00:32:53,790
No. Possession refers to
a non-human entity

415
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:56,126
taking control
of a human host.

416
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:58,764
So the invading soul
in my son

417
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,164
was another human?

418
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,970
Yes. And from what I heard
on that tape,

419
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:06,873
that person is dangerous.

420
00:33:08,975 --> 00:33:12,777
Sarah, there's a battle
being waged inside your son.

421
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:17,984
A war between his natural soul
and this older one.

422
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:21,218
These two entities
cannot exist

423
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,120
in the same body forever.

424
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:25,857
One will become dominant

425
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:27,727
and the other
will be absorbed.

426
00:33:28,795 --> 00:33:31,061
This is what
we're trying to avoid.

427
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:32,532
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

428
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:36,366
Sarah. Sarah, wait.

429
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:39,069
Just, please...
Just watch this.

430
00:33:39,071 --> 00:33:41,573
I know how hard
this is for you.

431
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:43,577
I thought that you were
gonna help my son.

432
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:46,880
Miles may have
developmental issues,

433
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,649
but he is still my son.

434
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:53,553
And I am not going
to subject him to this.

435
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:22,115
Hey, Mom,
wanna do a staring contest?

436
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:26,720
I'm not in the mood
right now, Miles.

437
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,292
Okay.

438
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:43,503
One, two,

439
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:45,238
three.

440
00:35:20,474 --> 00:35:23,142
I don't like it when you
touch me like that, Miles.

441
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,082
What is that song?

442
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:30,685
What?

443
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:33,921
That song
you were just humming.

444
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:36,822
I've heard you
singing it before.

445
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,123
Where did you learn it?

446
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,025
- From you.
- No, you didn't.

447
00:35:40,027 --> 00:35:41,429
I would've remembered.

448
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:45,631
You used to sing it to me
when I was a baby.

449
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,101
While I was sleeping.

450
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:51,439
No, I didn't.

451
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:57,342
Excuse me.

452
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,612
I'm sorry.

453
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:10,890
<i>Andrea and Bruce</i>

454
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,125
<i>of Lafayette, Louisiana,</i>

455
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,226
<i>are a highly educated
modern couple.</i>

456
00:36:14,228 --> 00:36:17,229
<i>To them, the possibility that
their little son, James,</i>

457
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:19,799
<i>was manifesting signs
of a former life</i>

458
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:22,202
<i>was, well, a little out there.</i>

459
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,037
<i>Between the ages
of two and four,</i>

460
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,405
<i>James would reveal
extraordinary details</i>

461
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,875
<i>about the life
of a former fighter pilot.</i>

462
00:36:28,877 --> 00:36:30,509
<i>I believe
that he had a past life</i>

463
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,411
<i>and he came back</i>

464
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,480
<i>because he wasn't finished
with something.</i>

465
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:35,547
<i>We are taught
at a very early age...</i>

466
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:37,249
What is that?

467
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,384
<i>...that reincarnation
doesn't exist.</i>

468
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,820
A colleague of Dr. Strasser's

469
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:42,454
gave it to me.

470
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:44,256
You went to see
another doctor?

471
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:46,993
His name is Arthur Jacobson

472
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:49,164
and he studies reincarnation.

473
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:52,832
Reincarnation?

474
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,033
Mmm-hmm.

475
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:55,235
- Past lives?
- Yes.

476
00:36:55,237 --> 00:36:57,269
Oh, come on, Sarah.

477
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:58,705
This is the oldest trick
in the book.

478
00:36:58,707 --> 00:36:59,773
He knows from Strasser

479
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:01,107
that we're having trouble
with Miles.

480
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:03,143
Just look at this.

481
00:37:03,145 --> 00:37:05,712
Just look at this little boy.
He...

482
00:37:05,714 --> 00:37:07,547
It's incredible.

483
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:10,083
Please. Hey.

484
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:12,387
Please don't tell me
you believe in any of this.

485
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:17,224
I don't know what I believe.

486
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:19,125
Miles is sick.

487
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:20,695
This isn't about past lives.

488
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,533
This is hard.

489
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,734
But we can get through this.

490
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:29,435
We can help Miles.

491
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,606
Just not with
this kind of craziness.

492
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:36,376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

493
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:37,479
You're right.

494
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:39,815
Not with this.

495
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,418
This is nuts.

496
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,165
Hey, Miles?

497
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:59,332
Five minutes, then PJs, okay?

498
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:03,037
Talulah! Get!

499
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,140
What did you say, Mommy?

500
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:27,763
What?

501
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:38,539
Who can tell me
the difference between

502
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,177
the denominator
and the numerator?

503
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:44,180
Anyone?

504
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:47,982
Okay,
I have a better question.

505
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:49,216
Who likes pizza?

506
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:50,551
Me! Me! Me!

507
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:53,222
Oh, yes. So,
how many slices on a pizza?

508
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:25,987
<i>Kill him, take his weapon!</i>

509
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:28,524
<i>Good job, soldier!</i>

510
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:33,627
<i>I need a medic!</i>

511
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:35,032
<i>Take cover! Take cover!</i>

512
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,567
Talulah!

513
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,441
Sarah?

514
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,510
You seen Talulah?

515
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,513
No.

516
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,048
The back gate's open.

517
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,050
I'm gonna go look for her.

518
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:57,285
- <i>Take him down!</i>
- Miles.

519
00:39:57,287 --> 00:40:00,121
Honey, go help your dad
look for the dog.

520
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:01,389
<i>Double kill!</i>

521
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,757
Miles?

522
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:05,527
<i>Finish him off, soldier!</i>

523
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:06,797
<i>Head shot!</i>

524
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:10,801
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

525
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:14,137
<i>Move, move, soldier!
Move!</i>

526
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:17,741
Let's go.

527
00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:36,159
She never goes this far away
from the house.

528
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:39,397
Maybe she got hit by a car.

529
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:42,300
Why would you say that?

530
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:45,600
When a dog knows
it's gonna die,

531
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:47,669
it doesn't come home.

532
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:50,172
They drag themselves
under a house.

533
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:51,742
They like to die alone.

534
00:40:53,478 --> 00:40:55,480
We all have to go sometime.

535
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:57,514
Even you.

536
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:00,351
You're gonna die.

537
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:04,652
I'm your father, Miles,

538
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,688
you do not talk to me
like that.

539
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,357
Or what?

540
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:10,292
Are you gonna hit me?

541
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:12,662
Like your father
used to do to you?

542
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,099
What are you talking about?

543
00:41:16,134 --> 00:41:18,334
He was such a piece of shit.

544
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,671
And now,
you're such a great dad to me.

545
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,673
<i>You never told him
anything about my dad?</i>

546
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:28,077
Never, honey, I've never said
anything to him.

547
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,644
He was saying
all this creepy shit.

548
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:31,180
Like what?
John, what was he saying?

549
00:41:31,182 --> 00:41:32,715
How would he know?

550
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:34,185
Know what?

551
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:37,288
What the hell is that?

552
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:44,226
It's a camera.

553
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:45,531
What?

554
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:47,797
Oh, my God.

555
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,700
He used
the baby monitor.

556
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:52,504
He's been spying on us.

557
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,007
Hey!

558
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:00,376
How long have you been
watching us? Hmm?

559
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,011
- Look at me. Where's Talulah?
- I don't know.

560
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:03,112
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

561
00:42:03,114 --> 00:42:04,180
- Where is she?
- John, stop it!

562
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:05,183
What the hell's wrong
with you?

563
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:15,224
Where's Daddy?

564
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:17,728
Daddy needed
a little bit of space.

565
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:21,597
He's at Uncle Tommy's house.

566
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,001
Just until he cools down
a little bit.

567
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:27,406
Mommy?

568
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:34,246
What's wrong with me?

569
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:41,953
Miles,

570
00:42:43,754 --> 00:42:44,957
you're sick.

571
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:48,693
You're just sick, honey.

572
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,103
Sometimes I leave my body
when I'm lying in bed.

573
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,477
Sometimes dreams
can feel real.

574
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:10,315
They're not dreams,
I do it when I'm awake.

575
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:15,654
I do it to make room.

576
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,660
Make room for what?

577
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:23,795
Things.

578
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:29,935
How often does this happen?

579
00:43:32,804 --> 00:43:34,306
Every night.

580
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:21,221
Miles?

581
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,694
Miles, what's wrong?

582
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,332
Mommy, I'm scared.

583
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:37,337
Come here, baby.

584
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:40,338
- Come here.
- Mommy!

585
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:50,149
Were you having a dream?

586
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:57,023
Yes.

587
00:45:02,996 --> 00:45:05,498
Can I sleep with you tonight?

588
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:43,936
Mommy?

589
00:45:50,744 --> 00:45:52,146
Yes, baby?

590
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:57,484
Will you always love me

591
00:45:58,918 --> 00:46:01,088
no matter what I do?

592
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,162
Yes, Miles.

593
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:13,233
I will always love you.

594
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:19,406
I'm your mother.

595
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:50,437
What... What is it?

596
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:36,779
Mommy?

597
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:40,783
Use this.

598
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:46,988
Miles,

599
00:48:47,957 --> 00:48:49,290
what did you do?

600
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,760
Sometimes
when I leave my body,

601
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:55,063
bad things happen.

602
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:15,084
Mommy!

603
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:16,852
Miles,

604
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:19,355
be quiet.

605
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:46,181
It was my fault.

606
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:48,317
It was me.

607
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,235
Listen to me.

608
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,374
I'm gonna take you to somebody
who can help you get better.

609
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,684
Sarah. I was so relieved
when you called.

610
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,283
So you must be Miles.

611
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,424
Watch the silver eye.

612
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,059
Just watch.

613
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,094
The regression won't work
if you're in the room.

614
00:50:34,096 --> 00:50:35,398
Is this going to hurt him?

615
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,399
No. It's hypnosis.

616
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:41,168
Miles goes out of body when
the invading soul is present.

617
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,237
He won't even remember
the experience.

618
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:46,708
The goal here is to identify
the person who has returned

619
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,376
and, this is important...

620
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,778
Find out what they want.

621
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,749
I'm going to be candid
with you, Sarah.

622
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,618
This may be your last chance.

623
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,054
<i>Miles is eight now.</i>

624
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,858
Soon the invading soul
will have control

625
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,427
and Miles will be gone.

626
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,699
Watch the silver eye
on top of the arm.

627
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,767
Every time it swings,

628
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:16,304
let's pretend we're unraveling
a piece of string

629
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,741
little by little.

630
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:22,878
Let's pretend
that piece of string

631
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,545
is time.

632
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:27,482
Unraveling minute by minute,

633
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,317
second by second,

634
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,955
going backwards.

635
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:34,457
Time slipping away.

636
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,827
Everything around you...

637
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,828
This house,

638
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,730
my voice,

639
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,832
your mother...

640
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:47,836
All these things
are getting further away.

641
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,306
We're going back
through your life,

642
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,344
back to when
you started school,

643
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:58,482
when you first learned
to walk,

644
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,586
when you were just a baby.

645
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,992
Back to the day you were born.

646
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:16,267
Back to the time
before this body.

647
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:25,974
I'm no longer speaking
to Miles.

648
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,342
I'm speaking to the person

649
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,947
who has taken residence
inside his body.

650
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,382
You came uninvited.

651
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,953
Tell me
if you can hear my voice.

652
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:48,831
You speak Hungarian.

653
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:52,735
I learned a few words

654
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,805
in anticipation
of meeting you.

655
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,009
I prefer English.

656
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,213
But you were born in Hungary?

657
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,148
My parents were
Hungarian farmers

658
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,752
that moved to Ohio.

659
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,222
Simple people.

660
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:14,425
Just happy
to own the piece of land.

661
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:18,864
I was driven to more

662
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:22,768
creative things.

663
00:53:26,238 --> 00:53:28,738
I would like you
to tell me your name

664
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,709
and why you've come back here.

665
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:34,913
What is your name?

666
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,117
I am Miles now.

667
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:44,387
Miles, if you can hear
my voice,

668
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:46,958
tell me the name of the person
inside you.

669
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,029
Tell me the name.

670
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:56,101
Tell me the name.

671
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:00,472
Tell me the name.

672
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:04,109
Miles, tell me the name.

673
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:07,779
No!

674
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,627
You have quite a collection
of medication

675
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:25,931
in your bathroom.

676
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:30,301
Everything there is legal.

677
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:33,471
Not if you give it
to a minor against his will.

678
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:37,642
Did you take my pills?

679
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,477
What would Sarah think

680
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,647
if I told her
I fell asleep in here

681
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:47,485
and woke up with your cock
in my mouth?

682
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:52,790
Then the police find drugs
in my blood.

683
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:56,361
The same drugs
from your medicine cabinet.

684
00:54:57,864 --> 00:55:00,831
Not to mention
the pubic hairs with your DNA

685
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:03,033
that I found
on the rim of your toilet

686
00:55:03,035 --> 00:55:05,104
and placed in my teeth.

687
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,275
You're insane.

688
00:55:10,776 --> 00:55:12,011
Mmm.

689
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:15,346
Who will they believe?

690
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:18,618
An aging hippie living off
his family's fortune?

691
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:22,188
Or an innocent little boy?

692
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,192
When I snap my fingers,

693
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:30,527
Miles will return

694
00:55:30,529 --> 00:55:35,399
and you will tell Sarah that
you have failed to regress him

695
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:38,070
because there isn't anyone
inside her son.

696
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,339
Then you will leave

697
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:45,210
and that will be the last time
you will ever see us.

698
00:55:46,913 --> 00:55:49,147
One,

699
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,249
two,

700
00:55:51,251 --> 00:55:52,652
three.

701
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,925
How did it go?

702
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:03,494
It didn't.
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

703
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,865
It was a mistake
to ask you to come here.

704
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:07,933
What happened?

705
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,935
Nothing.
The regression didn't work.

706
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,269
- What?
- I'm sorry.

707
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,206
- What?
- Christopher will see you out.

708
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,176
This way, please.

709
00:57:09,997 --> 00:57:11,332
Miles.

710
00:57:11,898 --> 00:57:13,332
Go inside.

711
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:15,836
I need to talk to your father.

712
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:35,156
I don't feel safe with him
in the house.

713
00:57:37,824 --> 00:57:39,860
I made some calls
while I was at Tommy's.

714
00:57:42,196 --> 00:57:44,198
There's a place
called Summit Hill.

715
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,601
I think Miles
would be a good fit.

716
00:57:49,504 --> 00:57:51,805
He would have
round-the-clock supervision.

717
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,876
It's less than an hour
from here.

718
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:03,115
We're talking
about locking up our son?

719
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:07,221
What else can we do?

720
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:10,191
This is tearing us apart,
Sarah.

721
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:29,543
- Hello?
- <i>Sarah.</i>

722
00:58:29,545 --> 00:58:31,744
It's Arthur Jacobson.

723
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:33,345
Arthur, it's 2:00 a.m.

724
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:35,081
<i>I know.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.</i>

725
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,485
<i>Is Miles near you?</i>

726
00:58:38,086 --> 00:58:39,819
Yes, he's in his room.

727
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:41,353
<i>Sarah,</i>

728
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:43,355
<i>go to your computer.</i>

729
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,492
Arthur, I'm gonna hang up
the phone.

730
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:46,892
<i>Sarah, wait.</i>

731
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:48,227
Your family's in danger.

732
00:58:48,229 --> 00:58:50,499
Go to a computer where Miles
won't be able to see you.

733
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,032
Hang on.

734
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:54,434
<i>Listen to me.</i>

735
00:58:54,436 --> 00:58:58,170
<i>The person inside your son
is an exceptional liar.</i>

736
00:58:58,172 --> 00:59:01,241
<i>He'll pretend he's sleeping,
he'll pretend he's your son.</i>

737
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:04,279
<i>You can't trust
anything Miles says.</i>

738
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:09,849
<i>I couldn't talk
when Miles was here.</i>

739
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:11,684
<i>During our session,
there was a struggle,</i>

740
00:59:11,686 --> 00:59:13,220
<i>but I think your son heard me.</i>

741
00:59:13,222 --> 00:59:15,288
<i>It just took a moment
to figure it out.</i>

742
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,925
<i>He scratched what I realized
was a message, the name.</i>

743
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:22,129
<i>He gave me the name, Sarah.</i>

744
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:25,031
<i>Type "Edward Scarka"
into your computer.</i>

745
00:59:25,033 --> 00:59:28,937
<i>S-C-A-R-K-A.</i>

746
00:59:31,974 --> 00:59:33,739
The Thrush Creek Killer.

747
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:36,278
<i>That's him. Look at the eyes.</i>

748
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,948
They're two different colors,
just like Miles.

749
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,583
<i>When's Miles' birthday?</i>

750
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:45,718
August 22nd, 2010.

751
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,390
<i>That's the day Edward Scarka
was killed in a police raid.</i>

752
00:59:49,558 --> 00:59:51,393
<i>He died just after 4:00 a.m.</i>

753
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:56,163
Miles was born at 4:15 a.m.

754
00:59:56,165 --> 00:59:59,599
<i>He killed nine women
over a span of five years.</i>

755
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,501
<i>The last victim,
the tenth one,</i>

756
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,271
<i>managed to get away, but not
before he cut off her hand.</i>

757
01:00:04,273 --> 01:00:06,239
<i>They all had
their hands removed.</i>

758
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:07,575
<i>That was his trademark.</i>

759
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:09,809
<i>He would cut off their hands,
then kill them.</i>

760
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:12,412
<i>Cut off their hands,
then kill them.</i>

761
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:13,747
<i>The survivor,</i>

762
01:00:13,749 --> 01:00:16,783
<i>Margaret St. James,
wrote a book about her ordeal.</i>

763
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:20,189
<i>She led the police to him,
where they gunned him down.</i>

764
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:22,492
So now we know.

765
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:24,925
Right?

766
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:28,295
<i>Yes, but we still need to know
the reason why he's come back.</i>

767
01:00:28,297 --> 01:00:29,664
<i>What Scarka wants.</i>

768
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,932
<i>That's what
will free your son.</i>

769
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:37,206
Wait.

770
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,177
Arthur, I have to go now.

771
01:01:15,744 --> 01:01:16,911
John.

772
01:01:16,913 --> 01:01:17,981
What's going on?

773
01:01:25,355 --> 01:01:27,724
We have to do something
about Miles.

774
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,327
We have to do something
about Miles right away.

775
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:35,431
But he absolutely cannot know.

776
01:02:17,741 --> 01:02:19,042
Wait an hour.

777
01:02:20,977 --> 01:02:23,547
I'll pack some of his clothes
and meet you there.

778
01:02:40,297 --> 01:02:43,233
Is there another fraction
that is equal to two-eighths?

779
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:45,902
So can we simplify to...

780
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:49,638
Mr. Blume. Is everything okay?

781
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,674
Uh, yeah. I'm here
to pick up Miles.

782
01:02:52,676 --> 01:02:53,841
Well, we're almost
finished our lesson,

783
01:02:53,843 --> 01:02:55,277
I can bring him out
in just a second.

784
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:57,612
No, I'm sorry,
we gotta go now.

785
01:02:57,614 --> 01:02:59,450
It's a family emergency.

786
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:03,786
Right. Do you need to sign out
in the office?

787
01:03:03,788 --> 01:03:05,987
No, Sarah just called over.

788
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,257
Spoke with them.

789
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,559
Hey, Miles, come on.

790
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,796
Let's go.

791
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:19,269
Miles?

792
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:25,943
Let's go, buddy.

793
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:30,548
Miles!

794
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:44,355
Oh, my God.

795
01:05:06,077 --> 01:05:07,947
He came back for you.

796
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:13,886
He wants you dead.

797
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:27,232
Miles, your mother and I
had to make a decision.

798
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:32,638
You're gonna go and live
somewhere for a while.

799
01:05:34,507 --> 01:05:35,508
And, uh...

800
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,475
The place where we're going

801
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:40,412
has people who can help you
get better.

802
01:05:41,947 --> 01:05:43,415
Really good doctors.

803
01:05:46,585 --> 01:05:48,919
It's gonna be tough
for a while, but I think

804
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:50,654
as you get older,
you'll understand

805
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,356
that sometimes...

806
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:53,524
Sometimes what's best for us

807
01:05:53,526 --> 01:05:55,427
is the hardest thing
for us to do.

808
01:06:01,467 --> 01:06:04,169
We just want you to know
that we love you very much.

809
01:06:05,804 --> 01:06:07,007
More than anything
in the world.

810
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:12,977
Miles...

811
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:13,980
Miles!

812
01:06:53,152 --> 01:06:56,153
He's fighting
very hard right now.

813
01:06:56,155 --> 01:06:57,889
We'll have to
keep him unconscious

814
01:06:57,891 --> 01:06:59,424
for three or four weeks.

815
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:01,059
When the swelling
in his brain goes down,

816
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:03,262
we'll determine
the extent of his injury.

817
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:06,231
Your husband's strong.

818
01:07:08,602 --> 01:07:10,403
What he needs is time.

819
01:07:13,272 --> 01:07:14,774
Where is my son?

820
01:07:17,577 --> 01:07:18,845
He's across the hall.

821
01:07:29,522 --> 01:07:30,724
I'm so sorry.

822
01:07:40,101 --> 01:07:41,401
I love you.

823
01:07:46,406 --> 01:07:48,274
I love you. I'm so sorry.

824
01:07:49,977 --> 01:07:51,711
I'm so sorry.

825
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:10,831
I think I know
how to stop this.

826
01:08:14,802 --> 01:08:16,804
I think I can save him.

827
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,675
If I do this,

828
01:08:22,275 --> 01:08:23,611
maybe...

829
01:08:27,014 --> 01:08:29,984
Maybe we could all be
back together again.

830
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:43,497
I'll leave you two alone.

831
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:11,959
Miles, what happened
in the car?

832
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:15,561
I don't know.

833
01:09:15,563 --> 01:09:18,032
I don't remember anything.

834
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,543
I know how I can help you.

835
01:09:33,014 --> 01:09:34,749
But I need you to trust me.

836
01:09:37,752 --> 01:09:40,088
I need you to trust me,
whatever I do.

837
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:43,557
Can you do that?

838
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:45,952
Do you remember those pills

839
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,257
I gave you so you didn't
get car sick?

840
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:51,459
You remember
how it made you sleepy?

841
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:53,229
Yeah.

842
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:01,103
I need you to sleep.

843
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:04,539
But why?

844
01:11:05,907 --> 01:11:08,808
Because I can't trust you

845
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:10,910
until you're all better.

846
01:11:10,912 --> 01:11:13,182
I want to see you
take it, Miles.

847
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:28,030
Where are we going?

848
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:32,835
Shut your eyes.

849
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:04,531
I'm gonna take care
of what you came back for.

850
01:14:00,318 --> 01:14:02,150
Can I help you?

851
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:03,954
Are you Margaret St. James?

852
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:06,923
What do you want?

853
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:09,993
My name is Sarah Blume.

854
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:14,998
I recently had an experience,
and your book, it...

855
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,202
It helped me.

856
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:23,707
I was wondering
if you had a moment.

857
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:29,313
I have a rule of not
seeing people in my home.

858
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:33,015
Just five minutes.

859
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:35,819
Please?
I have nowhere else to go.

860
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:48,064
I'll make some tea.

861
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,801
You can grab a seat.

862
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:02,044
Oh, Pickles, you're just gonna
wanna come back inside

863
01:15:02,046 --> 01:15:04,346
as soon as you see
how cold it is.

864
01:15:04,348 --> 01:15:05,883
Yeah, okay.

865
01:15:06,918 --> 01:15:09,020
Here you go. Go on.

866
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,166
Peppermint or lemon?

867
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:25,571
Either one.

868
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,546
This thing's not pretty,

869
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:10,781
but it can tear
a piece of toilet paper.

870
01:16:12,384 --> 01:16:13,919
I'm so sorry.

871
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,525
Was it recent,
what happened to you?

872
01:16:21,759 --> 01:16:23,795
It's been going on
for a while.

873
01:16:25,063 --> 01:16:26,365
It's my son.

874
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:31,401
This is about your son?

875
01:16:31,403 --> 01:16:33,172
Mmm. Yes, Miles.

876
01:16:35,107 --> 01:16:36,408
How old is he?

877
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,245
He's eight.

878
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:43,982
That's a wonderful age.

879
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:48,687
My David was so sweet
at that age.

880
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:51,924
I didn't know
that you had children.

881
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:57,528
I've made a choice
to keep my family private.

882
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:01,166
David's father and I got
divorced before I met Scarka.

883
01:17:02,669 --> 01:17:06,169
But I didn't feel it was fair
to link them

884
01:17:06,171 --> 01:17:08,173
to all that pain and hate.

885
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,479
Where is your son now?

886
01:17:14,813 --> 01:17:18,016
Starting sophomore year
at Michigan State.

887
01:17:19,652 --> 01:17:22,821
And from what I hear,
he has a new girlfriend, too.

888
01:17:28,927 --> 01:17:30,230
It's okay.

889
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,663
You'll get through this.

890
01:17:32,665 --> 01:17:34,334
I shouldn't have come here.

891
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,837
May I use your restroom?

892
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:42,475
Yeah, it's just down the hall.

893
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:47,877
I'll make you that cup of tea.

894
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:09,569
I'm sorry.

895
01:18:10,738 --> 01:18:12,038
I'm so sorry.

896
01:18:49,242 --> 01:18:50,444
Pickles.

897
01:18:51,545 --> 01:18:53,412
How'd you get back inside?

898
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:01,120
What are you doing?

899
01:19:02,623 --> 01:19:04,458
What are you doing? Stop.

900
01:19:05,426 --> 01:19:06,593
Stop.

901
01:19:08,462 --> 01:19:09,996
Please don't...

902
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:14,802
No.

903
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:18,472
I can't.

904
01:19:21,475 --> 01:19:23,442
I can't.

905
01:19:23,444 --> 01:19:25,677
I'm so sorry.

906
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:26,680
Hey!

907
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:31,085
Which one you like better?

908
01:19:32,486 --> 01:19:33,654
Blue

909
01:19:34,488 --> 01:19:35,823
or hazel?

910
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,023
Blue

911
01:19:38,025 --> 01:19:39,293
or hazel?

912
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,426
Blue

913
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:42,661
or hazel?

914
01:19:42,663 --> 01:19:43,931
How do you...

915
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:47,534
That's what he said
the night I met him.

916
01:19:52,707 --> 01:19:53,708
Miles!

917
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:58,543
No, don't!

918
01:19:58,545 --> 01:20:00,479
Miles, no!

919
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:06,453
No.

920
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:23,503
You should never have left me,

921
01:20:23,505 --> 01:20:24,905
Margaret.

922
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:32,574
Miles!

923
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:40,783
Miles, it's over!

924
01:21:45,386 --> 01:21:47,288
Miles!

925
01:21:51,727 --> 01:21:52,928
Miles!

926
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:57,631
Miles!

927
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:04,005
Miles!

928
01:22:16,352 --> 01:22:17,651
Miles.

929
01:22:23,459 --> 01:22:24,894
Baby...

930
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:32,468
Miles...

931
01:22:37,773 --> 01:22:39,308
It's too late.

932
01:22:54,156 --> 01:22:55,959
You got what you came for.

933
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:01,295
Let me have my son.

934
01:23:01,297 --> 01:23:04,700
You still believe
Miles is alive?

935
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,703
Did he sound like this?

936
01:23:09,705 --> 01:23:11,206
Mommy?

937
01:23:13,475 --> 01:23:16,343
Will you always love me

938
01:23:16,345 --> 01:23:18,213
no matter what I do?

939
01:23:19,883 --> 01:23:22,082
You were easy.

940
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:24,988
I knew you would
bring me to her.

941
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:27,857
How long has he been gone?

942
01:23:30,026 --> 01:23:32,860
The night you promised
you would always love him...

943
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:36,700
...that was the last time
he ever spoke to you.

944
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:40,570
He's gone now.

945
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:43,006
You

946
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:47,744
are a monster.

947
01:23:48,578 --> 01:23:50,878
You took my son's soul?

948
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,081
You will not...

949
01:23:56,052 --> 01:23:57,887
You cannot have his body!

950
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:27,617
Jesus!

951
01:24:46,436 --> 01:24:48,806
She was trying to kill me.

952
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:55,112
You're safe now.

953
01:24:57,447 --> 01:24:59,616
You're safe.

954
01:25:02,086 --> 01:25:03,253
No.

955
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:07,625
No.

956
01:25:33,718 --> 01:25:34,719
Sorry, we're running behind.

957
01:25:35,319 --> 01:25:36,520
It's fine.

958
01:25:48,699 --> 01:25:51,500
It's great
to see you again, Miles.

959
01:25:51,502 --> 01:25:53,136
We're excited
you'll be staying with us

960
01:25:53,138 --> 01:25:54,472
while your dad gets better.

961
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,842
Wanna see your room?

962
01:26:47,476 --> 01:26:52,476

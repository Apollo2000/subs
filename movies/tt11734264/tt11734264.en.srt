00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Where is he hiding?

4
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,250
Your husband is a wanted man.

5
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,291
We have orders to bring him in.

6
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,250
I want to ask you again.
Where is he now?

7
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,958
Colonel, let me talk to her alone.

8
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,916
Look at her.
She's terrified.

9
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,250
Believe me, she'll talk,
but not like this.

10
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,166
You got five minutes.

11
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,791
Listen, madam.

12
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,750
We're not here to kill your husband,

13
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,333
but to arrest him.

14
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,291
I'm afraid for my son.

15
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,708
I promise we won't hurt him.

16
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,500
When your husband is in custody,
we'll release him to you.

17
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,958
Your son isn't to blame
for his dad's actions.

18
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,000
Think of your son. Just your son.

19
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,208
He's all that matters now.

20
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,041
He should be in one of
these buildings. Second floor, she said.

21
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,625
All right, move out.

22
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,916
Let's stay alert.

23
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,833
B Team heading up
east stairwell.

24
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,750
Alpha Team in position.

25
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,583
Copy that, Alpha Team.

26
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,166
Found the target!
Get down now! On the ground!

27
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,250
Do it!

28
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,666
I said get down!
On the ground! Hands up now!

29
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,833
Do it.

30
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,958
Don't look at me!
Turn around!

31
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Get the kid against the wall.
The kid! Get him somewhere safe!

32
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,583
Get that kid out of there!

33
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,916
Dad, what should I do?
I'm really scared.

34
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,833
Something's wrong.

35
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,208
Answer me when I talk to you.

36
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,958
Are there weapons here?

37
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,708
Hey! Any weapons here?

38
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,625
Ask if there are weapons.

39
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,750
Do you have weapons?

40
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,166
Get down! Take cover!

41
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,791
Get down now! Retreat!

42
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,333
We need backup!

43
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,416
Get down now! Where are they?

44
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,166
Two o'clock! You see them?
In front!

45
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,583
Target right! Target right!

46
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,625
Go! Go!

47
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,708
Go, go!

48
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,291
<i>Target eliminated.</i>
<i>All clear.</i>

49
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,083
Do it, son.
You'll make me proud.

50
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,291
God will reward you.

51
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,250
Do it!

52
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,708
- Shut up! Move it!
- Do it, son!

53
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,541
Do it, son!

54

Mom's going to lose it!

64
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,083
- Sweetie!
- Good flight, huh?

65
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,375
Oh, I'm so happy!

66
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,500
You back for long?

67
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,916
I'm back for good.

68
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,875
I'm not on leave,
I've been transferred.

69
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,791
That's great.

70
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,125
I'm not thrilled about it.

71
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,458
I mean, look, I graduated
at the top of my class.

72
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,416
I speak five languages.

73
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,625
And all of that just to
pound pavement for Operation Sentinel.

74
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,916
I mean, that wasn't part of my plan.

75
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,250
I know it wasn't.

76
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,291
But you're here now.
That's what matters, right?

77
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,541
So is that asshole still living up here
on the sixth floor?

78
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,458
- Yeah.
- Still bothering Mom?

79
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,125
Not as much anymore.

80
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,000
- Let's eat. I'm starving.
- Shh!

81
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,875
Shh!

82
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,041
You're finally here.

83
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,500
Mom, you're smothering her.

84
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,083
All right.

85
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,208
I used to make this for your father.

86
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,416
It reminded him of his homeland.

87
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
- No!
- No way. Is that true?

88
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,125
Now, please dig in.

89
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,500
You're nothing but skin and bones, hmm?

90
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,791
Here, have mine. I'm good.

91
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,791
Don't want it?

92
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,708
Maybe later.

93
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,958
Pa-pa-pa. Ah!

94
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,041
Mom!

95
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,875
- Mom, want some?
- No, I'll eat later.

96
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,708
Well, more for me.

97
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,083
Oh, yeah.

98
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,458
One, two, three.

99
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,791
One, two, three. Not bad.
One, two, three.

100
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,791
One, two, three.
Keep going, come on.

101
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,416
One, two, three.
Pick it up!

102
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,208
<i>I see that you were prescribed</i>

103
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,416
<i>a pretty strong opioid
for your migraines,</i>

104
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,708
<i>as well as some sedatives
and beta-blockers.</i>

105
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,875
<i>That's quite a cocktail.
Wouldn't be hard to get hooked.</i>

106
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,541
How about we strike a deal?

107
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,250
I'll refill your prescription,

108
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,583
but only after
you've met with a therapist.

109
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,500
This is for your own good.

110
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Do we have a deal?

111
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,000
- All right.
- Here's the number of a colleague of mine.

112
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:32,958
Thank you.

113
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,541
- Good morning, officer.
- Sir.

114
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm Lieutenant Jaubert. Éric.

115
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,916
You're patrolling under my command.

116
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,708
Allow me.
Please, go ahead.

117
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,583
I'll wait. But thanks.

118
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,791
Lieutenant.

119
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,791
- Hello.
- Good morning.

120
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,166
So we'll start with the harbor,

121
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,625
then we'll head to the canal.

122
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,708
- After that, we'll circle back...
- Excuse me, sir.

123
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,958
I'm a little lost.

124
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,541
Could you direct me
to the Negresco Hotel?

125
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,458
There.

126
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,708
You'll get used to it. That's the gig.

128
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,958
Anyway, as I was saying,

129
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,541
we'll patrol the harbor,
then head to Garibaldi Plaza.

130
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,625
- Who's this guy, huh?
- I don't know!

131
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,833
I swear, I don't know!

132
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,166
- Help! Please help!
- Stop!

133
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,083
What the hell?

134
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,750
God, help!
Quickly, please hurry!

135
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,583
- Look at me!
- Requesting backup. Assault in progress.

136
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,916
Hurry! Please hurry!

137
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,625
Poor girl's getting beaten.
He's completely lost it. Hurry.

138
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,541
He's totally wasted.
I swear, he's going to kill her.

139
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,416
Mister, you have to calm down!
Look, the police have been notified.

140
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,875
I'm going to fucking kill you!

141
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,166
Oh, shut the fuck up!

142
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,083
Hey, don't!

143
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,583
Officer!

144
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,958
Officer!

145
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,458
Hey! We can't do that!

146
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
Are you okay, my love?

147
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,625
Everything's all right,
sweetie.

148
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,708
You're here with us.

149
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,833
We'll take care of you now.

150
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:18,750
Hey!

151
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,166
We're still on for Saturday, right?
Don't leave me hanging.

152
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,833
Hey! How are you doing, handsome?

153
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,041
- How are you?
- Super.

154
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,375
Can I get you boys some coffee?

155
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,083
Please.

156
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,208
Let me get that for you.

157
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,916
Officer?

158
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,666
What's wrong?

159
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,750
You got any Oxy or codeine?

160
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,666
You a narc?

161
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,708
- Codeine is 50.
- Okay.

162
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,750
Wait here.

163
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,291
Hey, what's that? Is it new?

164
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,291
Yeah. You approve?

165
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:24,750
I like it.

166
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,041
Cool.

167
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
What's up with that face?

168
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,958
- Nothing. I'm fine. Let's go.
- No. Look at me.

169
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,791
- No, don't.
- Come on.

170
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,250
Smile.

171
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,333
All right, that's enough.

172
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,416
What am I, a matryoshka<i>?</i>

173
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,333
My beautiful girls!

174
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,416
Yes, beautiful girls.

175
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,458
My two beautiful girls together.

176
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,416
- Let's take a photo.
- Okay.

177
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,125
Oh, perfect. A photo op.

178
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,916
Hey, girls!

179
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,750
Hey!

180
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,666
What's up?

181
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,583
Oh, hey!

182
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,500
- How are you?
- This is my sister, Klara.

183
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,166
- Oh, the soldier.
- Yeah. How are you?

184
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,500
- Yeah, totally.
- Later.

185
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,333
- Who was that?
- No one.

186
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,208
- Come on!
- What? I'm dancing.

187
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh, snap.

188
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,291
Tania! Hey!

189
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,375
- Tania!
- Hey!

190
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,041
- What's up?
- What's up, beautiful?

191
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,750
I'm good.
Hey, this is my sister.

192
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,958
- What's up?
- Hi.

193
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,125
- Aurélien.
- Klara.

194
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,375
Who are those guys?

195
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,458
Oh! Whoa!

196
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,208
- Russians.
- Introduce me?

197
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,250
Tania.

198
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,458
- Oh, come on!
- All right, fine.

199
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,333
I'll be right back, okay?

200
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,000
- What? Where are you going?
- She's with me, don't worry.

201
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,000
Tania!

202
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,250
TANIA

203
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,875
YOU ALL RIGHT???

204
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:45,791
WHERE ARE YOU????

205
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,541
Good morning.

206
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,583
Oh. Morning.

207
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,666
I've got to go.

208
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,833
Call me later?

209
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,791
Of course.

210
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,708
Open that up.

211
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,791
Can't you see the bag's empty?

212
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,875
I have to check.
We're conducting a search.

213
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,625
- What's this box?
- It's just a box.

214
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,708
Tiffany's? You got a hot date?

215
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,875
- Open it.
- It's just a box!

216
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,458
Open the box.

217
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,875
Give me that bag.

218
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,333
- What's all this? What is this?
- Papers. Just papers.

219
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,833
Just hand it over.

220
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,666
- Why are you hassling me?
- Do what you're told.

221
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,041
Spread your arms.

222
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,208
- Anything dangerous on your person?
- No, man!

223
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,208
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

224
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,458
Just hanging out with some friends.
See?

225
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,458
Let it go! Let it go!

226
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,416
Not a cop then, huh?

227
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,416
Get lost.

228
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,125
Go.

229
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,875
Fuck.

230
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,333
He get away?

231
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,625
- I'm sorry.
- Go. Go.

232
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,166
- Here.
- Thanks.

233
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,458
Hello?

234
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,333
Excuse me, nurse.
Where is my sister?

235
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:04,583
Your sister's in a
stage-three coma caused by cerebral edema.

236
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:07,208
It's inoperable.
We're attempting resorption.

237
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,041
I'm very sorry.

238
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,166
Hello.

239
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,791
Captain Muller.

240
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,208
Are you Tania's sister?

241
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,750
Can I have a word?

242
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,541
Your sister was found this morning.

243
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,416
Well, a passerby found her
by chance on the beach, and…

244
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,875
Our preliminary examination shows
that she might have been raped as well.

245
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,125
Do you know her whereabouts last night?

246
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:11,166
I was with her… at Millennium.

247
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,458
Club Millennium?

248
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,291
With friends, or…

249
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,625
No, just the two of us.

250
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,208
But she left before me
with people I didn't know.

251
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:04,208
Did you see that shot, though?
The sergeant couldn't believe…

252
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,791
You got it.

253
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,625
You all right?

254
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,166
I heard about your sister.

255
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:31,958
I'm so sorry.

256
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,333
I just need five minutes.

257
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,416
Right.

258
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,208
Let's just pump up the capacity
by 50 people.

259
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:05,083
- That could work.
- And from there we…

260
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,625
Are you the owner?

261
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,375
Yes, can I help you?

262
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,125
I'm here for this club's
security footage.

263
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,125
I'm sorry, for what?
Under whose authority?

264
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,291
Anti-terror squad.

265
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,875
What exactly are you looking for?

266
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,500
How can I see that angle?

267
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,666
Him. There.
Do you know him?

268
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,291
- He was right over there.
- Of course I know him. He's a regular.

269
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,708
Who are you?
What are you doing?

270
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,375
Look, the police already went over
all of this.

271
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,625
Now, please leave
or I'm calling them back.

272
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,875
Officer?

273
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,458
- You good?
- Fine. Come on.

274
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,583
You hold your breath when you shoot.
You shouldn't.

275
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,500
Try exhaling next time instead.

276
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,541
Coffee?

277
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,625
He's the one there.
He is the man my sister left with.

278
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,166
He's the one I have to find.

279
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,875
How did you get a hold
of these images?

280
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,416
Let me remind you,
this is an active police investigation.

281
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,916
I apologize.
I couldn't help myself.

282
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,333
His name's Yvan Kadnikov.

283
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,375
In addition to the nightclub footage,

284
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,833
we were also able to find
your sister's mobile phone,

285
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,625
and there were photos
of that night on it.

286
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,666
- Have you questioned him?
- Not yet.

287
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,833
- The request's been made.
- What are you saying?

288
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,291
Yvan Kadnikov is the son
of Leonid Kadnikov.

289
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,083
A tech genius who's made
quite a fortune.

290
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:08,375
He's a pretty influential man now
who some say is protected.

291
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,333
Since what happened, Yvan's been hiding
in his father's villa.

292
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,708
Problem is,
they have diplomatic passports.

293
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:16,791
Father and son.

294
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,125
And the villa itself
has consulate status.

295
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,458
They're bulletproof.

296
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,583
Shit. I have to go.

297
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,500
Listen, I'll be honest with you.

298
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,916
Cases like this are complicated.

299
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,041
All we can do is hope
she wakes up,

300
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,750
and maybe she'll remember
what happened.

301
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:35,791
Let's go.

302
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,083
I'll keep you posted.

303
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,583
<i>You only think of food.</i>

304
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,000
What the hell are you doing?

305
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,791
Have you completely lost it?

306
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,791
Come on, let's go.

307
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,666
Your weapon.

308
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:55,458
Understood.

309
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,416
Yeah.

310
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,541
I assumed a soldier with your experience
would want to set an example.

311
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:16,250
You need to stop getting stoned at work,
officer.

312
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,500
This is the girl's locker room, sir.

313
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,291
- What are you drinking?
- Vodka tonic.

314
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,208
You got it.

315
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,125
My sister's in a coma!

316
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,458
You left with her. What happened?

317
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,625
Oh, fuck.

318
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,708
I'll cut you
unless you tell me.

319
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,375
Stop, please. I did nothing.

320
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,833
- Tell me what you did!
- It wasn't me!

321
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,125
- Tell me.
- Yvan?

322
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,000
Let him go.

323
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

324
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,750
What the fuck is this?

325
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:21,500
Hold on, I know you.

326
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,875
Get this bitch out of here now.

327
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,208
And you are?

328
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,208
What are you doing in my house?

329
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,041
Your son raped my sister.

330
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,833
It's you.

331
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:41,791
Yvan told me
about your exploits at the club.

332
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,083
Well done!

333
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:49,208
You are the one
I should be hiring as my bodyguard, huh?

334
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,291
You just missed Yvan.

335
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,708
He's far away now.

336
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,541
Well, in any case,

337
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:58,708
he hasn't much to do
with what happened anyway.

338
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,541
Much to my disappointment…

339
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,375
My son Yvan…

340
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,458
Has never been one for women.

341
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,541
Your sister was here.

342
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,625
She was with Yvan
and some friends.

343
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:23,583
She drank my vodka.

344
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,083
Danced in my living room.

345
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,958
Hell, she even swam in my pool,
practically naked.

346
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:31,458
In front of everyone.

347
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,000
And, well…

348
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:35,583
let's just say…

349
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,750
I don't have my son's affliction.

350
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,791
Mmm, that pretty little
tattoo shaped like a diamond, well…

351
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:49,666
What a memorable feast.

352
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,333
I'm sorry, my dear.
I must take this call.

353
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,916
I'll leave you in
the company of these lovely gentlemen.

354
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,833
Hello?

355
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Shit!

356
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:34,083
I WANT TO BE THE NEW WIND
AFTER THE STORM

357
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,083
Hello?

358
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:20,500
The young Russian,
he didn't do anything.

359
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:22,375
I know.

360
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,333
I just want to forget.

361
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,666
I'd been drinking.
I went to his house.

362
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,375
People will say I asked for it.

363
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,208
It's my word against his.

364
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:41,625
You don't mean that.

365
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,750
If you press charges,
they'll investigate and prove it.

366
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,291
They'll have a trial.

367
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,500
And Kadnikov will be put
behind bars.

368
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,375
Leonid Kadnikov.

369
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,208
I know everything.

370
00:53:58,416 --> 00:53:59,916
I don't want to press charges.

371
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,208
I don't want my life
on display like that.

372
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,416
I won't do that to Mom,
do you get it?

373
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,083
He can't get away with this.

374
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,625
What he's done to you,
he'll do to others.

375
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:20,500
And he will keep doing it.

376
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:23,583
Do you get that?

377
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:29,250
Look, I'm tired.
Please just leave now.

378
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,875
<i>Live from Nice,</i>
<i>the Kadnikov situation…</i>

379
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,833
<i>Mr. Kadnikov!</i>

380
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,458
<i>Will you go back to Russia?</i>

381
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,125
<i>Business is calling me away,</i>

382
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:10,458
<i>but I could never leave the city
without seeing this magnificent church</i>

383
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,000
<i>that was completely renovated</i>

384
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,750
<i>thanks to the great generosity
of our Russian donors.</i>

385
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:17,000

387
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,125
<i>My son, Yvan,
has nothing to do with any of that.</i>

388
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,291
<i>Clearly some individual was
just trying to make some money.</i>

389

393

395
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,041

<i>Thank you.</i>

397
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,916
<i>Live from Nice,
the Kadnikov situation is still unfolding.</i>

398
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,125
What happened?

399
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,125
It's an embolism.

400
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,083
Tania!

401
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,333
Miss, you need to leave.
Please, she'll be fine.

402
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,833
Oxygen.
Five liters, continuous, on a mask.

403
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:17,333
- Oh, my God.
- Get a heparin pump ready.

404
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,000
Please leave now.
We'll take care of her.

405
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:57,625
Bitch.

406
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,291
Police!

407
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,375
Come on. Let's go.

408
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:24,541
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

409
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:58,333
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

410
01:00:58,416 --> 01:00:59,875
I was hoping we could talk.

411
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:01,083
Yeah. Sure.

412
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,583
- How are you?
- Uh, I'm good.

413
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,541
- What the hell are you doing?
- That bag.

414
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:24,625
Quickly.

415
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,208
I need two Glocks.

416
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:29,625
And ammo.

417
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:31,708
Shit.

418
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,166
- And two FAMAS.
- Uh, well…

419
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:38,666
- Oh, fuck.
- With loaded magazines.

420
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,625
Okay.

421
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,708
Shit.

422
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:46,250
Close the bag now.

423
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,166
You've really lost it.

424
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,041
Put the bag down.

425
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:54,250
On your knees.

426
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:58,833
Tie yourself up!
Tie yourself up!

427
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,750
Now, hurry up. Go on.

428
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:09,458
Don't move.

429
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:16,750
Hello!

430
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,833
- Help! In here!
- What the hell?

431
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,291
The armory!

432
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:24,041
Sir.

433
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,750
Listen, I'll call you back.

434
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,375
All right?

435
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,583
- Somebody help!
- Yeah.

436
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:31,958
- Hello?
<i>- Sweetie…</i>

437
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:33,541
You okay, Mom?

438
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:37,416
I'd be better if you were here.

439
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:39,708
<i>Where are you?</i>

440
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:41,875
I had to leave.

441
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,458
<i>Come back.</i>

442
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,666
Come back, please.

443
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,958
<i>It's too late, Mom.</i>

444
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,250
<i>Are the police with you?</i>

445
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:55,625
Klara?

446
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,416
<i>You're making a huge mistake.</i>

447
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,000
<i>Do what your mother says.
Come back.</i>

448
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,041
The woman who tried
to kill your sister,

449
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:02,958
<i>she's alive</i>.

450
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,375
<i>She works for Kadnikov.</i>

451
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,541
He'll be arrested.
I promise that.

452
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:10,666
No.

453
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,291
He has to pay for what he did.

454
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:15,291
Now.

455
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:15,708
<i>I'm on the third floor. It's clear.</i>

456
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,125
<i>Coming down to the second.</i>

457
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,583
Understood. Coming your way.

458
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:02,750
The police have
closed all the exits.

459
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:04,916
I want something to eat.

460
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,875
<i>All you want to do is eat.</i>

461
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:09,041
<i>Okay, I'll bring you something.</i>

462
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:24,791
Hey, listen.

463
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,916
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, I do.

464
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,041
Did you see
the car I bought last week?

465
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:32,375
Why do you need that?

466
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:35,083
For driving women around.

467
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,500
I prefer to walk.

468
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:53,083
<i>Dima? Sasha?</i>

469
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:54,333
<i>What's happening?</i>

470
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:57,958
<i>Dima? Sasha?</i>

471
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,333
<i>Are you there?</i>

472
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:54,250
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

473
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:56,666
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

474
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,375
What do you want?

475
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:29,791
Money?

476
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,000
- Bitch!
- Ahh!

477
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,916
We need a doctor!
Get the medic up here!

478
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:37,875
{\an8}DUBAI, THREE MONTHS LATER

479
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,125
Have a fruit basket
sent up my room, please.

480
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,083
Right away.

481
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:26,791
Yes, of course. Yes.

482
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,666
I need his support.

483
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,166
Understand? It's important.

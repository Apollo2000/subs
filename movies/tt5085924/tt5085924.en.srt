1
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:39,222
<i>Do you want to hear a story?</i>

2
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:48,598
Do you want me to tell you
about the Wildling?

3
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:56,739
His teeth are long...

4
00:00:57,507 --> 00:01:00,744
...and sharp like this.

5
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,015
<i>And so are his nails.</i>

6
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:09,206
Long and sharp...

7
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,208
...like this.

8
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,185
And his hair...

9
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:16,266
...is long and black.

10
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,429
<i>All over his whole body.</i>

11
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,036
Do you wanna hear more?

12
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,439
No.

13
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,424
Okay.

14
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:38,415
You're my special little berry.

15
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,955
- Good morning, Anna.
- Good morning, Daddy.

16
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,945
I'm gonna listen to your heart
and I'm gonna tell you to breathe.

17
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,488
Okay, now.

18
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,183
Breathe in.

19
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,665
Okay.

20
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,350
The men are getting worried.
They don't see you around anymore.

21
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,186
Hunt's over.

22
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,480
Sure, but that don't mean
you can just disappear.

23
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,025
Roger, I'm retired.

24
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:18,286
Alright. I'll see yo...

25
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,023
I'm sorry the door gave you a sting.

26
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,218
I told you about that.

27
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:30,209
It's made so that the Wildling
will get hurt if he tries to get in.

28
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,433
Why does he wanna get in?

29
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,105
Because you're the last one left.

30
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,919
He ate all the other children.

31
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,517
Who was that today?

32
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,133
I heard someone talking.

33
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,941
There is no one.

34
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:19,173
There is only Anna and Daddy.

35
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:23,050
Anna and Daddy.

36
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,955
There is only Anna and Daddy.

37
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:32,135
But only Daddy can go outside...

38
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,905
...because Anna is too small.

39
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:39,299
Anna must always stay inside.

40
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:45,573
Anna must stay inside.

41
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:03,466
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

42
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:08,738
<i># Happy birthday, dear Anna ##</i>

43
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:12,433
Close your eyes. Okay, now open.

44
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:16,704
I plucked him from the berry-bush.

45
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,152
"Was evident...

46
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:27,457
"...that the youngster had become so accus...

47
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,626
- Accustomed.
- "Accustomed...

48
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,785
...to the marvelous..."

49
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,460
One, two, three, four...

50
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,668
...five, six, seven, eight...

51
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:41,595
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

52
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:14,828
He's in a better place.

53
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,571
I'm gonna take him to where I plucked him...

54
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,208
...and I'm going to bury him there...

55
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,701
...and then after a while...

56
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,991
...a bush will grow out of him...

57
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,860
...and then when the spring comes...

58
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,153
...it'll grow new berries.

59
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,856
And Dusty will grow back?

60
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,934
Yes...

61
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:49,129
...but it will be a new Dusty.

62
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,396
What's wrong with me?

63
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,099
You're sick.

64
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,636
Anna, this is medicine...

65
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:34,817
...and Daddy needs to see your tummy.

66
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,451
Good girl. Now Daddy is gonna
put the medicine in your tummy...

67
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:44,521
...and it's gonna sting, okay?

68
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,014
Anna, close your eyes. Now, one...

69
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,383
...two...

70
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,980
...three.

71
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,795
Good girl.

72
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,284
We're gonna have to do this every day.

73
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:19,940
Hey, Anna. Anna.

74
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,388
It's your birthday.

75
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,248
Don't you wanna count your bears?

76
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,830
Daddy...

77
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,311
...can...

78
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,945
...can you take me to the better place?

79
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:53,417
Maybe a bush will grow out of me.

80
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,520
You'll close your eyes...

81
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,440
...and you'll go to sleep.

82
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,293
Then there will be nothing.

83
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,780
No.

84
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:46,295
Very good, we're pushing 1000 milligrams.

85
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,353
Hi.

86
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,223
It's okay.

87
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,176
I'm here to help you.

88
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,572
I'm the one who found you.

89
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,499
Your neighbors called me to report a gunshot.

90
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,437
Sheriff Ellen Cooper.

91
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,612
I have a few questions to ask you.
Would that be okay?

92
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,516
Yeah?

93
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,185
What's your name?

94
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,494
Anna.

95
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:36,038
Anna. It's nice to meet you, Anna.

96
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,364
What's your last name?

97
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,233
Anna.

98
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,401
Officer...

99
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,911
...can I talk with you for a minute?

100
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,691
You sit tight.

101
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:58,795
We detected a high concentration
of Leuprorelin in her system.

102
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,562
One more day and we probably
would've lost her.

103
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:02,610
- What's that?
- It's typically used to treat...

104
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,235
...endometriosis uterine fibroids
or conditions such as paraphilia.

105
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,905
Thing is, she's got none of those.

106
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,791
In fact, we couldn't find anything
to justify this kind of treatment.

107
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,682
Do you think he was poisoning her?

108
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:16,746
Uh, it's a pretty heavy drug...

109
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:20,754
...with a wide range of drastic side
effects, but it is very efficient...

110
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:25,287
...at down-regulating the secretion
of estrogen in a woman's body.

111
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:29,649
There is no evidence
of any menstrual cycle at all.

112
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:34,874
I think whoever did this to her
wants to slow down her maturity.

113
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:39,702
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah, I'll leave you to it.

114
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:42,181
- Thank you, doctor.
- Yeah.

115
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,241
Anna...

116
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:58,945
...I'm gonna undo these straps for you, okay?

117
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,982
It's okay.

118
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:05,585
Just gonna undo these straps.

119
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,085
Like that.

120
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,063
It's okay.

121
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,120
There you go.

122
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,080
Where's Daddy?

123
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,968
Is he in the better place?

124
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,536
Good morning, everyone.

125
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:24,561
So the doctors have told me
what a bright young girl you are...

126
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:29,611
...and how well you've responded over
the past week to all their crazy tests.

127
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,081
I bet you're just about ready
to get out of here, huh?

128
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:35,051
Well, we think you're ready to move on too.

129
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:38,454
So the Belington House is a wonderful place.

130
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,423
They have a wide variety
of special therapeutic programs...

131
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:45,707
...designed for girls just like you
and it's a lot more fun than a hospital.

132
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:48,194
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt...

133
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:52,168
...but I gotta say, locking her up again
doesn't really sound like the right strategy.

134
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:55,304
With all due respect, Sheriff,
I think we can trust Dr. Rooney's expertise.

135
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,021
We haven't even received the DNA results yet.

136
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:01,377
I was just explaining to our patient,
the Belington House is...

137
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,470
I'm gonna go with her!

138
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,673
Well, uh...

139
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:09,118
...we'll see about that.

140
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,515
So you're gonna be with me
until your DNA results come in.

141
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:21,221
DNA is something that we use to identify
any relatives that you might have.

142
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,662
Until then I'm gonna be responsible for you.

143
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,501
You okay with that?

144
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,806
You don't like my driving?

145
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:44,311
We're going less
than 20 miles an hour. It's safe.

146
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,722
I mean, not in... in general.

147
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:51,083
If, you know, for example if you're
driving under the influence but...

148
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:54,053
...I don't drink so no need
to worry about that.

149
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:57,450
- You don't drink?
- Not anymore.

150
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,902
You must be very thirsty.

151
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:24,217
Not many vegetarians in this town.

152
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:35,271
Little shit.

153
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:38,507
- What are you thinking?
- Come on, let's go.

154
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,042
You wanna stay away from guys like that.

155
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,662
You hungry?

156
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,336
I'm not a great cook,
but I know what goes with ketchup.

157
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,449
Pretty good, huh?

158
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,702
- Who's this?
- Anna, this is Ray.

159
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:44,907
Ray, this is Anna, the girl that I was
telling you about from the hospital.

160
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,243
Why is she wearing my clothes?

161
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:51,113
Because she's our guest and because
she needed something to wear.

162
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,815
You never wear that shirt anyway,
so why do you care?

163
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,652
- What happened to your head?
- It's none of your fuckin' business.

164
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,812
Excuse me, language, young man.

165
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,826
Are you his Daddy?

166
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,965
No, I'm not his daddy. I'm his sister.

167
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:12,668
Only men can be daddies and women are moms.

168
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,503
Everyone has them.

169
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,596
Whether you like it or not.

170
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,978
I'm sorry it smells a bit musty in here...

171
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,505
...because we don't use this room very often.

172
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,674
Okay, here you go.

173
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:40,853
Well if you, uh, you need anything,
I'm just across the hall, okay?

174
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,622
Okay?

175
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,560
- Can we close it?
- Are you cold?

176
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,660
The Wildling.

177
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,835
What's the Wildling?

178
00:22:57,993 --> 00:22:59,839
He eats children.

179
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:01,953
Oh.

180
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,104
Did your daddy tell you that?

181
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:10,282
Have you ever seen him, a Wildling?

182
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,539
In my dreams.

183
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:20,001
Listen, Anna, I've been to a lot of places...

184
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:22,729
...and I've never seen a Wildling before.

185
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,553
It's okay, you're safe here.

186
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,258
You get some rest. You've had a long day.

187
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:37,825
Goodnight.

188
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,915
Hey.

189
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,041
Good morning.

190
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,143
You okay in there?

191
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,636
It's 7:00, time for breakfast.

192
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,150
Whoa!

193
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:51,019
<i>We only moved here for Ellen's job.
Right after our parents died.</i>

194
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,955
If we were still in the city,
we'd be taking the subway.

195
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:56,325
No subway sucks.

196
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:59,661
No cell phone signal anywhere, ever. Sucks.

197
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:04,390
Only one single chain restaurant
and that's Dairy Queen. Sucks.

198
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:09,971
I told you.

199
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:13,532
They're not hamsters.
And they're not babies either.

200
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:15,261
No?

201
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:20,439
Do you wanna see where you really come from?

202
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,445
Well, this should give you the general idea.

203
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,336
Got a little something for you.

204
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:13,895
You know, that's what you use
when you're bleeding down there.

205
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:17,990
- So it's medicine?
- No. No, no, you're not sick.

206
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,476
You're a woman.

207
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:43,559
Whoo, go Lady Grizzlies!

208
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,868
- Do you know where the library is?
- Yeah, I'll show you.

209
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,667
The party is this Saturday.

210
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,792
It's at my house.

211
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,540
So you should definitely come
'cause you'll get to meet everyone.

212
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,441
- Gonna be super fun.
- Thank you.

213
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,010
Bye.

214
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,635
Bye.

215
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,303
Oh, God, really?

216
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,939
Yeah, I mean probably.

217
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:43,954
She's barefoot.

218
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,322
You think she's the girl
who was kept in her father's attic?

219
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:50,943
- Oh, my God, really, like a sex slave?
- Yeah.

220
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:54,887
She must be retarded.

221
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:08,162
Uh, hi. Excuse me, miss. Hi.
You lookin' for something?

222
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:12,581
I'm looking for Ray. He was supposed
to meet me at the library after school...

223
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:17,118
You know, you should really be more careful,
there's like broken glass and shit.

224
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,000
We might be able to help you out.

225
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,327
- Come on, let me out!
- What you think?

226
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,128
Sure.

227
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:43,311
- You guys are so hilarious.
- Ray, you never told us you had a girlfriend.

228
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,615
- I don't.
- Then what are you, fuck-buddies?

229
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,483
- Leave her out of this.
- Hey, buddy.

230
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,279
You forgot something.

231
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,701
- Who's smokin' pot?
- No one.

232
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,991
Oh, good boy. That's a good boy.

233
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,760
- Make sure he remembers that.
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:06,435
Hey, that was very impressive.

235
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,127
What's your name?

236
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:11,931
You're not doing me any favors.

237
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,518
You always go up like this against the grain.

238
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,026
My dad taught me how to do this.

239
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:04,580
He used to shave
every single day of his life.

240
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,339
Not his legs. His face.

241
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:17,583
Anna, there is something
that I need to talk to you about.

242
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:21,487
Those DNA tests came back.

243
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:26,057
They show that Gabriel Hanson
is not your real father.

244
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,761
He's not your Daddy.

245
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:33,999
What?

246
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,436
Do you remember what I said
about moms and dads?

247
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,839
- Everyone has 'em.
- Yeah.

248
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:45,554
We're still not sure
who your real mom and dad are.

249
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:49,481
I don't think the state's gonna
let you stay with me forever.

250
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:54,019
We're gonna have to find you
a more permanent home.

251
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,838
You can't escape so easily.

252
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:19,511
The test is Monday and you've only
gone through half of your stuff.

253
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:22,791
So?

254
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:25,737
What do you know about
the Declaration of Independence?

255
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:35,494
Come on, if you flunk this
Ellen is gonna kill me.

256
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:40,432
Have you ever been to the Northern Lights?

257
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,513
- No, you can't see them from here.
- Why?

258
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:48,807
'Cause they're really, really far north
where there's no more people.

259
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,958
I'd actually like to see
the Northern Lights too.

260
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:12,097
My mom...

261
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:16,240
...she showed me pictures when I was like...

262
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,721
...this.

263
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,919
Uh... what are you doing?

264
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:25,811
You smell.

265
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,056
I smell?

266
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,192
Like a hamburger.

267
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,652
I've never got that one before.

268
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,795
What's that?

269
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:45,731
What?

270
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,475
There.

271
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:50,402
I think Jen is having a party.

272
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:53,171
I know Jen.

273
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,273
How do you know her?

274
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,655
She's my friend.

275
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,158
- Hey, where you guys goin'?
- To a party.

276
00:37:03,238 --> 00:37:07,262
Uh, you don't wanna party with me?
I thought we were gonna fire up the grill.

277
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,797
Yeah, but couldn't we do that tomorrow?

278
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,766
- Yeah, sure.
- Why don't you come to the party?

279
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,801
I don't think Ellen would wanna
come to this kinda party.

280
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:16,671
- What kind of party is "This kinda party?"
- It's at Jen's house.

281
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,964
Yeah, were gonna be home before midnight.

282
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,223
Hi. Who are you again?

283
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:36,624
Anna.

284
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:40,185
- Anna. Come on in.
- Thank you.

285
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:44,156
You're with a girl. Good for you.

286
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:12,584
Hey, buddy.

287
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:16,464
- Why didn't you bring your mommy?
- She's my sister, asshole.

288
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,400
Oh, wow, I didn't know
you could fart out of your mouth.

289
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,513
Hidden talents, man. Hidden talents.

290
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,796
Here. Don't drink it too fast.

291
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:47,453
That's great.

292
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:47,613
Anna. Anna, what's the matter?

293
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,156
Anna, I can take you home.

294
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,001
Come out and let's go.

295
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,655
Anna?

296
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,345
Anna. Anna, can you please open the door?

297
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:18,158
<i>It's made...</i>

298
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,920
<i>...so that the Wildling
will get hurt if he tries to get in.</i>

299
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,932
<i>Why does he wanna get in?</i>

300
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:27,326
<i>Because you're the last one left.</i>

301
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:37,302
<i>He ate all the other children.</i>

302
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:26,017
Anna!

303
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,668
Are you okay? Where have you been?

304
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:36,662
Anna, did someone hurt you?

305
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:42,567
Come.

306
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:47,839
Ray and I have been looking
for you everywhere.

307
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,386
Anna, listen, I...

308
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:55,089
...I want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

309
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,348
You can tell me anything.

310
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:01,095
I really need to know
what happened last night.

311
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,656
Where you've been
and what happened to your dress.

312
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:10,738
Did someone try and hurt you
or touch you in any way?

313
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,857
- Roger.
- You need any help with her?

314
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:32,960
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Well, here's the thing.

315
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,764
Richard Fuller just called
and his 18-year-old son Lawrence...

316
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:40,525
...was also at that party
and he didn't come home either.

317
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:45,072
He was last seen around 11:00 p.m.

318
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:48,475
Tom and I asked the kids,
but no one seems to see him leave, so...

319
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:52,603
- Well, I thought maybe we should ask her.
- I think you should let me handle that.

320
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,477
Anna, you need to talk to me.

321
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:19,277
Anna, you need to tell me
what happened at that party last night.

322
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:24,178
You don't wanna be painting your nails
right now. I'm trying to help you.

323
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,904
- I can't help you if you won't talk to me.
- Ellen.

324
00:47:27,962 --> 00:47:30,551
What's going on? Are you okay?

325
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:32,807
Ray, what do you know about Lawrence Fuller?

326
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:37,357
- You mean besides being an asshole?
- Well, that asshole is missing.

327
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,428
You think that Anna has something to do
with this? Is that what's going on here?

328
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:43,488
I want her to tell me where
she was last night. She won't talk.

329
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:46,766
Ellen, I think it would be better
if I talk to her.

330
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:49,904
- Oh, you do? Yeah?
- Yes, alone. Yeah.

331
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:52,329
Thank you.

332
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:01,272
Don't worry, I won't tell her
about the blood.

333
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,954
Anna, you can't do stuff like this.

334
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:09,480
How am I supposed to protect you?

335
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:16,621
Let me see.

336
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:31,249
Ellen!

337
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,685
- Ellen!
- Yeah?

338
00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:37,942
We need to take her to the hospital.

339
00:51:05,912 --> 00:51:07,758
Thought so.

340
00:51:10,184 --> 00:51:12,397
You're looking for the others...

341
00:51:12,975 --> 00:51:14,778
...like you.

342
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:20,514
I haven't seen
one of your kind in 16 years...

343
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:23,273
...since the last purge.

344
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,303
Yeah.

345
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,522
I remember that night.

346
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:30,231
I'll never forget it.

347
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:37,722
Men from the town said
they got every last one of them.

348
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:44,469
But that isn't quite true, is it?

349
00:51:57,821 --> 00:52:00,111
Do you wanna know where your mother is?

350
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:04,251
Gabe, you okay?

351
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:06,177
I'm fine!

352
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:24,039
Any more of them bastards back there?

353
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:27,499
No, we got 'em all.

354
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:34,512
Every last one of them.

355
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,524
<i>You're my special little berry.</i>

356
00:55:08,529 --> 00:55:11,736
- What's going on?
- We found Lawrence...

357
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,205
...and her dress by his body.

358
00:55:39,453 --> 00:55:41,341
I'm sorry, Anna.

359
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:44,235
I really wanna understand.

360
00:55:48,895 --> 00:55:50,775
I'll be back.

361
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:54,914
- Goodnight, Roger.
- Goodnight.

362
00:57:36,603 --> 00:57:38,890
Before I got you...

363
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:41,900
...I had a dog.

364
00:57:43,142 --> 00:57:46,033
His name was Jasper. Good dog.

365
00:57:46,513 --> 00:57:48,246
Always a bit of a rebel.

366
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:55,174
But then after the night I got you...

367
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:59,003
...Jasper got crazier and crazier.

368
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:03,774
And then finally one day he snapped.

369
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:09,154
So I had to send him to the better place...

370
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,017
...you know.

371
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:19,957
I swore an oath, Anna.

372
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:24,028
That I would kill the Wildlings.

373
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:28,198
If I had been...

374
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,902
...half the true hunter Jasper was...

375
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:34,915
...there would be no Anna...

376
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,476
...and Jasper would still be at my side.

377
00:58:46,205 --> 00:58:48,453
There's a better place for you.

378
00:58:59,218 --> 00:59:01,025
Lift up your shirt.

379
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:09,380
Find the place...

380
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,011
...and put it in.

381
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:21,004
Now, push it in. Push it all the way in.

382
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:22,745
Daddy...

383
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:26,691
...why didn't you tell me
that I'm a Wildling?

384
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,730
I wanted to spare you.

385
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:36,292
Why?

386
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,938
Why did you spare me?

387
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:50,648
Anna was a mistake...

388
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,255
...and so is Daddy.

389
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:04,738
Roger.

390
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:43,848
Good morning, Anna.

391
01:00:54,834 --> 01:00:56,714
You okay under there?

392
01:00:58,037 --> 01:01:01,359
Come on, get up, I need
to take you to the district...

393
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:04,745
Ah! No! No!

394
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:06,426
Anna!

395
01:01:10,116 --> 01:01:11,564
Anna?

396
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:13,180
Drive!

397
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:17,777
- Anna, seriously...
- Can you go a bit quicker, please?

398
01:01:17,857 --> 01:01:20,784
- Where are we even going?
- To the Northern Light.

399
01:01:20,864 --> 01:01:23,923
Seriously? This is crazy.
I mean, you're a fugitive.

400
01:01:24,003 --> 01:01:26,543
No, I'm a Wildling.

401
01:01:27,634 --> 01:01:29,523
Why are you slowing down?

402
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:32,158
Why are we stopping?

403
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,697
- What is it, a Wildling?
- Keep driving!

404
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:37,418
What is a Wildling, Anna? I wanna help you...

405
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:40,534
...but you can't honestly think that
we can just steal a cop car like this.

406
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,627
They can trace this thing!

407
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:54,565
Hey. Hey, Wildling!

408
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:43,888
Aw, fuck, that's cold.

409
01:03:11,104 --> 01:03:13,350
You're gonna get sick in those wet clothes.

410
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:21,393
Hey.

411
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:24,862
Come on, Anna. Get up.

412
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,566
Raise your arms.

413
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:07,071
I won't bite you.

414
01:05:43,056 --> 01:05:45,068
You track her down?

415
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:48,214
Get the men.

416
01:05:48,294 --> 01:05:50,083
I can't do that, Gabe.

417
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,219
Not if she's with the kid.

418
01:05:52,899 --> 01:05:55,112
I ran into Cooper this mornin'.

419
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,725
I tell ya she's asking too many questions.

420
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,646
I'm not going to jail for this, Gabe.
Not for your mist...

421
01:06:03,576 --> 01:06:05,590
You let her get away!

422
01:06:33,672 --> 01:06:35,486
It's not that bad, really.

423
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,660
It won't stay like this.

424
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:17,406
What is it?

425
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:22,186
- Run.
- What?

426
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:37,614
Ray, stay down.

427
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:52,839
Come.

428
01:08:06,365 --> 01:08:08,312
- You gotta jump!
- What?

429
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:25,438
If we follow the river, it's probably
gonna take us back to the lake.

430
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:29,166
From there, we can find our way back
to the car and find Ellen.

431
01:08:40,599 --> 01:08:42,479
Come on, let's go.

432
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:16,489
Ellen.

433
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,392
Ray!

434
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:20,850
Oh, my God.

435
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:25,978
- Who did this to you?
- No fucking idea.

436
01:09:30,716 --> 01:09:32,596
Where is Anna?

437
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:35,308
Gone.

438
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,410
Over there.

439
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,599
Let's head over this way.

440
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,699
<i>...the lead suspect in the murder
of fellow high school class mate...</i>

441
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:04,757
<i>...Lawrence Fuller. Fuller was found
dead at a party three months ago...</i>

442
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:07,560
<i>...and his killer is still at large.</i>

443
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:12,231
<i>Anna was arrested shortly after the murder
but escaped and is still missing...</i>

444
01:12:12,311 --> 01:12:14,967
<i>...several months into the investigation.</i>

445
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,603
<i>An important warning,
authorities are urging residents...</i>

446
01:12:17,683 --> 01:12:20,406
<i>...not to take matters
into their own hands...</i>

447
01:12:20,486 --> 01:12:24,274
<i>...as they fear this female
suspect may be dangerous.</i>

448
01:12:24,357 --> 01:12:26,203
<i>She has been linked to...</i>

449
01:13:24,383 --> 01:13:26,805
- Watch where you're going.
- I'm sorry.

450
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:46,014
We gotta go.

451
01:13:48,374 --> 01:13:49,962
Now.

452
01:13:55,814 --> 01:13:57,627
Go, go, go!

453
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:00,806
- <i>Ray?</i>
- Ellen, where are you?

454
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:05,277
- <i>Fern Creek. Why?</i>
- Listen, listen, they're on the move.

455
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,313
And Roger's with them.

456
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:41,489
Whoa!

457
01:14:59,452 --> 01:15:01,284
She killed him.

458
01:15:02,448 --> 01:15:04,694
Come on. Move! Move!

459
01:16:12,585 --> 01:16:14,431
Watch your step, Sheriff.

460
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,186
Put it down.

461
01:16:21,394 --> 01:16:23,442
Put it down!

462
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,290
You shouldn't have been snoopin' around
and you should've never taken that girl.

463
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,897
You're never gonna get...

464
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:46,956
This is 185 to dispatch. I need backup.

465
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,968
Copy please.

466
01:20:48,827 --> 01:20:50,874
You got a new little berry.

467
01:20:59,204 --> 01:21:02,218
It's almost ripe.

468
01:21:05,343 --> 01:21:07,761
Soon you will be in the better place.

469
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:13,029
It's okay.

470
01:21:15,988 --> 01:21:17,866
It's okay.

471
01:21:19,157 --> 01:21:21,978
Alright. Almost, almost.

472
01:21:29,902 --> 01:21:32,959
Alright, come on.

473
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:35,308
Come on.

474
01:21:36,008 --> 01:21:38,196
Come on, that's it.

475
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:39,989
That's it.

476
01:21:41,346 --> 01:21:42,422
There.

477
01:21:45,217 --> 01:21:47,265
It's alright.

478
01:21:47,345 --> 01:21:49,192
That's it.

479
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,207
I promise ya...

480
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:55,380
...if it's a girl...

481
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,740
...I'll name it Anna.

482
01:24:03,721 --> 01:24:05,268
Ellen.

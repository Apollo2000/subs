3
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,841
<i>Good morning Mom.</i>

4
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,456
Yeah!

5
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:16,994
I can't believe this is the
fifth time this morning!

6
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:18,228
No! No!

7
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:24,601
Shit.

8
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:25,502
No!

9
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,739
Oh, oh yeah!

10
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:35,813
Hey!

11
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,915
No, wait, wait!

12
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:39,516
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

13
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,517
Please!

14
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,518
Hey!

15
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:42,619
Oh my God!

16
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:43,888
Hey man, what are you doing?

17
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,757
You know, it's a funny
thing about cars lady,

18
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,491
you actually have
to pay for them.

19
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,726
Please don't do this.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,927
I really need my
car to get to work.

21
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,528
I don't know what to tell you.

22
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,764
Oh, come on.

23
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,564
I'm sure we can
work something out.

24
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:55,867
Look, I have two.

25
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,570
I can show you my boobs!

26
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,906
Yes you could,

27
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,909
but unless there's $1,000
attached to each nipple,

28
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,744
I'm still gonna have
to take your car.

29
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,746
Move it out!

30
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:21,926
Shit!

31
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,899
Hey Marnie, sorry I'm late.

32
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:28,966
It's okay.

33
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,936
Oh, did you walk here?

34
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:33,671
Yeah.

35
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,741
Way better for the environment.

36
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:37,775
You drive a Prius.

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,778
Yeah, not anymore.

38
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:50,855
Officer: Hey, stop!

39
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:56,894
Please!

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,898
Bam!

41
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:01,933
Ha!

42
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,634
Got your drugs!

43
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:05,535
Where you been?

44
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:07,939
You need to work out more.

45
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,941
Out of respect to your
family I warned you

46
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:11,108
not to sell drugs on my beet,

47
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,010
and now I hear you're dealing
in a goddamn middle school!

48
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:13,878
I was just a little money,

49
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:16,613
who are you, Mother Teresa?

50
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:17,949
Mother Teresa
would pistol whip

51
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,917
the shit out of you right now!

52
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,751
My Mom's gonna
hear about this!

53
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,754
Oh, well you can
tell ugly Betty,

54
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,622
if she has an issue with it,

55
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,825
she knows what a find me!

56
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,026
Coffee?

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,028
I'm not asking you.

58
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:33,597
Just pondering out loud
to see if I want some.

59
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,866
And I think I do.

60
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,038
Oh man.

61
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:44,041
My last quarter was way
worse than I thought.

62
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,944
Ooh, ooh, ooh, there's
this one in Chile.

63
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,980
Listen, it's like
regular bungee jumping,

64
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:52,984
except you jump out of a
helicopter into an active volcano.

65
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,020
Red pens, I'm gonna
need a lot more red pens.

66
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:57,621
What do you think?

67
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,488
Anna!

68
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,456
What?

69
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,659
What do I think about
volcano bungee jumping?

70
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:02,894
Yeah.

71
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,061
I think it's literally the
worst idea I've ever heard of.

72
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,864
Well, you gotta do something
to get out of this funk.

73
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:14,138
That's right, undress
him with your eyes.

74
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,973
Peel off that spandex.

75
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,208
Slap that-

76
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,608
- Stop, that's not
what I'm doing.

77
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:21,444
I'm just shocked
we have a customer.

78
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,682
Oh my goodness.

79
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:28,819
Lance humpstrong totally
wants to toy your friends.

80
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,888
Girl, that man
shorts are so tight,

81
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,123
you can see that his little dude

82
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:35,026
is also wearing a
tiny bike helmet.

83
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,962
Girl, he's still looking at you.

84
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,731
Look over your right
shoulder, casually.

85
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,767
- Yeah.
- Casual, casual.

86
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:45,937
He could be
the one to end

87
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,505
your epic streak
of sexual futility.

88
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,007
It's self-imposed abstinence.

89
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,508
Mm-hm.

90
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,145
What happened to the
old self-confidence?

91
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:55,146
I mean, look at me.

92
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,480
I'm a six, seven
and a half tops.

93
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,784
And I'm up to my vagina in pussy

94
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,153
because of self-confidence!

95
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,620
Case in point.

96
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,588
Your new barista, Marnie.

97
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:06,891
Mm-hm.

98
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,591
I'm going to have her.

99
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,827
I don't know anything about it.

100
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,262
I don't even know if
she's straight or not,

101
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,165
but I'm gonna make
that girl yell so loud,

102
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,267
only dogs are gonna
be able to hear it.

103
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,702
You're sick.

104
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:18,669
Look, you see how fast
I was with my tongue?

105
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,105
Charleen, put that thing away.

106
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:22,807
It's hard enough to lure
customers in as it is.

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,275
I'm like the Flash
with this thing!

108
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,110
I'm gonna set her pubes on fire.

109
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,245
Oh my God.

110
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,647
All right, crime's
not gonna find itself!

111
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,249
Ain't that right girlie?

112
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:41,959
Ha!

113
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:43,127
<i>Hey sweetie.</i>

114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,627
<i>Hey Dad, I'm
passing by your place,</i>

115
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,629
<i>so I'm gonna come check on you.</i>

116
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:49,667
<i>Okay, why don't you
meet me in the backyard.</i>

117
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,169
Here we go.

118
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,072
Bottoms up.

119
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,107
Thanks.

120
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,047
I went by Mom's grave
tonight before coming here.

121
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,116
Saw your flowers.

122
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,317
Yeah.

123
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,719
Nine months today,
hard to believe, huh?

124
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,288
You do remember that
Mom hated Gerberas, right?

125
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:13,824
Yeah, but I love 'em.

126
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,128
To Mary, to your Mom.

127
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,195
To Mom.

128
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,568
Why don't we take
this inside, Dad?

129
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,604
I feel like I'm
being eaten alive.

130
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,305
Um.

131
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,640
It's such a gorgeous night,

132
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:31,876
why don't we just stay out here?

133
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,244
Gorgeous?

134
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,178
Who are you?

135
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,013
More importantly, how are you?

136
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:40,885
Oh, well, my business
is in the toilet.

137
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,620
I can barely pay my bills.

138
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,189
Today my car got repossessed,

139
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:48,659
but other than
that, I'm amazing.

140
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,897
I just feel like
I'm failing her.

141
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:57,301
Like I'm failing her memory.

142
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:00,738
Is there someone inside?

143
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,139
A cat.

144
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,307
- A cat?
- Cat.

145
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,209
When did you get a cat?

146
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,077
You hate cats.

147
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,977
Oh, I love cats.

148
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,082
You have a woman in there!

149
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,683
No, no, it's a cat.

150
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,018
You have a date tonight.

151
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:17,121
At least one of us
has a social life.

152
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:17,988
I wanna meet her.

153
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:18,956
Oh no, no, no.

154
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,058
No Anna, it's too soon.

155
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:24,195
Can I just introduce
you at my own pace?

156
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,162
Seriously?

157
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,964
Yeah, the timing is horrible.

158
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,266
I understand.

159
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,068
All right.

160
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,410
Dad, what is the big deal?

161
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,212
- Oh, hi.
- Oh Jesus!

162
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,213
Who you are?

163
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,781
He's the plumber.

164
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,149
He's here to clean my pipes.

165
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,952
Honey.

166
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,654
That did not come out the
way it sounded in your head.

167
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,194
Did Mom
know you were gay?

168
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,197
Well, I mean
bisexual, pansexual.

169
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,199
He likes a lot of things.

170
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,134
Sexually fluid.

171
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,702
Sexually fluid.

172
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,369
Wow.

173
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,737
Yeah.

174
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,105
When she passed away,

175
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,874
I felt comfortable enough to-

176
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,108
- Move about the cabin.

177
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,245
Okay, I'm confused.

178
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,313
I'm getting old.

179
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,215
Anna, I was depressed.

180
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,683
Tired of being alone,

181
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:20,951
then I met Chuck.

182
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:23,020
I tell you, I haven't
been this happy since,

183
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,189
well since Mom.

184
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:27,291
This is great.

185
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,293
I'm happy for you.

186
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,029
And I look forward to getting
to know you better Chuck.

187
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,164
Call me Mom.

188
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,232
Okay, don't push it.

189
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,700
Chuck is good too.

190
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,836
I'm gonna head out

191
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,337
and let you two get back to

192
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,207
whatever it is you
guys were doing.

193
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,279
What is so funny?

194
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,982
How does this even work?

195
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,083
Oh honey,

196
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:56,253
it's like a Great Dane
trying to mount a chihuahua.

197
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,354
Woof.

198
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,255
Oh.

199
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:04,195
<i>Hey,
what's up Anna?</i>

200
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,230
Coffee shop, now.

201
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:07,198
<i>But I'm chillin'!</i>

202
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,399
<i>What's going on?</i>

203
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:12,903
Just trust me.

204
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,478
Oh, that wasn't too pathetic.

205
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,781
Holy shit, that's potent.

206
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:26,150
Where'd you get it?

207
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,384
Evidence room.

208
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,986
You're like the
worst cop ever.

209
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,853
Nah.

210
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,288
So, pitcher or catcher?

211
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,890
What?

212
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,458
Big gay Ed, is he a
pitcher or is he the catcher?

213
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,427
Oh my God, I don't know.

214
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:39,163
Knuckle baller for sure!

215
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,030
Ha!

216
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,198
To your Dad!

217
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,399
Welcome to the team.

218
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:46,870
What is this?

219
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:47,538
Moonshine?

220
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:48,539
Private blend.

221
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,974
Try it.

222
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,842
It'll put a little
fire in your belly.

223
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:55,779
Oh my God!

224
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:58,082
That tastes like turpentine!

225
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,383
Oh, excuse me, Princess.

226
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,253
Wanna go next door and
get you some Vodka!

227
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,153
Vodka.

228
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:05,990
No, no, I'm fine.

229
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,158
I should probably just go home.

230
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,927
I know you're hurting.

231
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,429
You're drowning in red
ink, you miss your Mom,

232
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,398
and your Dad's probably
swallowing the length

233
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:16,066
of some guy named
Chuck as we speak.

234
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,103
But, you're my best friend,

235
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:21,772
we're gonna get
through this together.

236
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:25,409
Are you stoned?

237
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,344
Like totally ripped!

238
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,913
Yeah, that's what I thought.

239
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:32,983
Okay, let's get out of here.

240
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:36,186
All right, let me get
my lithium and my drugs.

241
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,454
<i>♪ Look at the drugs ♪</i>

242
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:40,824
<i>♪ Look at them drugs ♪</i>

243
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:23,567
Miss,

244
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,270
I have to send the report
to the insurance company.

245
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,039
Do you have their
contact information?

246
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,141
I don't have it.

247
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:32,076
You know what,
don't worry about it,

248
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,510
you can send that to us later.

249
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,347
Hey man, you're in
for a big payday, huh?

250
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,083
No, I don't have insurance.

251
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:39,983
Oh.

252
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,586
Well that's not good.

253
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,490
All right boys,
let's wrap this up!

254
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,993
All right,
I think it's time-

255
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:50,961
- To kill myself?

256
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:51,628
What?

257
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:52,563
No!

258
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,198
To show you something, okay.

259
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,600
Your place tomorrow
night, 7:00 PM.

260
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,001
Bring a pillowcase.

261
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,937
What?

262
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,604
Do you trust me?

263
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,439
Of course not.

264
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,340
Good instincts.

265
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:09,179
Shit.

266
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,548
Oh my God.

267
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:13,450
Are those
flowers or vomit?

268
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,052
Look, it's the only
one that was clean.

269
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,086
Now what's this all about?

270
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,954
Put it on.

271
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,655
What?

272
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,156
Pull it over your head, now!

273
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:21,058
If you're planning on
taking advantage of me

274
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,460
at my lowest eb, that
is totally uncool.

275
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,428
You wish!

276
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,429
Put it on.

277
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,133
Now follow me.

278
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,501
- Come on.
- This is crazy.

279
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,136
Yeah, yeah,
I'm trying to help you out

280
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,203
so you get your
confidence back right.

281
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:34,104
Anna: Ow!

282
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,239
Sorry, that was on me.

283
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:36,273
Come on, come on,

284
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,541
- come on.
- Course it's on you.

285
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,644
I'm wearing a
pillowcase on my head!

286
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:17,114
Enough of this cloak and
dagger shit, what's going on?

287
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:19,082
What's going on is you
need a strong medicine

288
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:21,051
to snap you out of this
funk that you're in.

289
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,320
It's time for you
to come face to face

290
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,622
with who you are and
what you're capable of.

291
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:28,025
Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

292
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,359
I can't stop shaking!

293
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,563
That's adrenaline, baby.

294
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:33,698
It's totally normal.

295
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,033
You got lots of it and it's
good to get some fresh air

296
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,067
after your first time.

297
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,135
Come on.

298
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:39,002
Here?

299
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:39,704
Get out of the car!

300
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,171
Is that my blood?

301
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:42,740
Well it's sure as
shit ain't ketchup.

302
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,577
You think that you'll come back?

303
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,513
Hell yeah, that
was better than sex.

304
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,048
You know what, go home,

305
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,051
take an Epsom salt
bath, some ibuprofen,

306
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,520
you'll wake up tip
top in the morning.

307
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:57,387
Okay, cool.

308
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,622
- Bye.
- Bye.

309
00:13:58,656 --> 00:13:59,523
There's
my big Care Bear!

310
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:00,658
What up baby!

311
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,459
Hey!

312
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,360
Good to see bud.

313
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:07,431
Bear, this is Anna, Anna bear.

314
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:08,599
Hi.

315
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,602
I have been waiting
for this moment.

316
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,637
It's so good to
have you here, Anna.

317
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:14,571
Come on in.

318
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,340
Okay, I like your nickname.

319
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:17,541
Oh, no nickname.

320
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:18,609
When I was born,
my parents took one

321
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:19,711
look at me and thought Bear.

322
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:23,447
At least I lost most of
that hair the first year.

323
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,451
What is this place?

324
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:30,621
The answer
to all your problems.

325
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,421
Here you go.

326
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,660
Oh, okay.

327
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:36,593
Hey ladies.

328
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,696
Am I about to get murdered?

329
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,405
Ta-da!

330
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:49,573
What the fuck?

331
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:50,641
Ah shit!

332
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,710
Olivia's gone up.

333
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:53,644
Oh shit.

334
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,714
Do yourself a favor, okay.

335
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:59,283
Stay off Olivia's radar.

336
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,585
Oh, okay yeah, sure, great.

337
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,687
Who's Olivia?

338
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,755
Her.

339
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:07,725
Fight, fight!

340
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:16,834
Are you kidding me?

341
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:18,101
Woo!

342
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:18,770
Yup, yup!

343
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:19,671
Yup, yup!

344
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,204
You know the rules Olivia!

345
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:22,840
No fights without a ref!

346
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:25,576
No bill on the wall
for this fight, okay!

347
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,410
Blow me, Bear!

348
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,612
Oh, I'd fucking
break your fingers.

349
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:29,714
Noel, you're up!

350
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:33,685
Cool, huh?

351
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,185
Bear and I run this place.

352
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:36,553
We're here most weekends.

353
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,689
Okay ladies!

354
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,356
If you are not familiar
with the rules,

355
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,660
you can strike with your
fist, elbows, knees, feet,

356
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,595
even your head if you so fancy.

357
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,163
Who'd use their
head in a fight?

358
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,532
Choke holds and submissions
are totally welcome,

359
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:51,335
but please, no hair pulling,
biting, eye gouging.

360
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,636
'Cause then you're
being a bitch,

361
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,404
and that shit ain't cool!

362
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,340
To the center, fighters!

363
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,744
Fight!

364
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:08,886
Ah, her arm!

365
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,787
Oh my God, stop it!

366
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,358
Come on girl, yeah!

367
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,296
Winner!

368
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,197
Yes!

369
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:22,734
What?

370
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,670
Oh, look.

371
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:26,738
Check this out.

372
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,810
That's the tradition.

373
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,912
The winner gets to put a
dollar bill on the wall.

374
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:36,179
Seriously?

375
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:37,581
You know all about my problems

376
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:40,350
and you thought a fight
club was the solution?

377
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:43,453
This isn't just a fight
club, Anna, this is a shelter.

378
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,455
A safe haven for women to come

379
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:48,660
to lift the lid off the
fucking pressure cooker of life

380
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,695
without societal judgment.

381
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:52,797
By beating the shit
out of each other?

382
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,564
By respecting each other.

383
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,702
You fucked with the
wrong family, Charleen!

384
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,772
Oh, I warned you and
your goofy ass son.

385
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:03,240
If you wanna sell a
little weed, that's fine.

386
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,508
Anything harder than that,

387
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,810
especially in the school,

388
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:06,744
we're gonna have a problem.

389
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,812
Yeah, we do have a problem,

390
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:09,681
and we're gonna
solve it, tomorrow.

391
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,816
Me, you, in the ring.

392
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,450
You better bring some Charmin

393
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,485
'cause I'm going to wipe
your ass all over this place.

394
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,621
- Oh really?
- Yeah, really.

395
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:18,823
Well you can cancel
your hysterectomy,

396
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:19,489
'cause I'm gonna
hit you so hard,

397
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:20,925
your vagina's gonna pop out.

398
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,325
Yeah, we'll see about that.

399
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,595
What we'll see is your
cobweb ridden vagina

400
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,798
bouncing across the floor.

401
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:29,332
Whatever, you better get
used to disappointment, bitch.

402
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:30,001
Cause it's coming.

403
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:31,401
You know what?

404
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:32,937
How 'bout we raised
the stakes, okay.

405
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,840
The loser has to leave
the club for good.

406
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,809
Well, it looks like you're
gonna be getting your weekends

407
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,277
and every other
Thursday back bitch.

408
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,445
I'm coming for you.

409
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,748
That's a very
specific insult bitch.

410
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:46,951
And that's you guys
respecting each other, how?

411
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,654
Ah, she's just pissed I
arrested her son yesterday.

412
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:50,722
We'll work it out.

413
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:51,856
By fighting each other?

414
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,257
Listen, we have rules, okay.

415
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,795
Usually we draw names, but
somebody can challenge you.

416
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:58,696
And if you don't accept it,

417
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,530
you're kicked out of
the club for good.

418
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:01,733
I think I've heard enough.

419
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm going home for good now.

420
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:03,935
Later.

421
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:04,869
Ip, ip, ip, ip.

422
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:06,804
What, you can't make me stay.

423
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,538
Nope, but Bear can.

424
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:12,375
Like Charleen said,
Anna, we have rules.

425
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,511
And one of them is the
first time you show up,

426
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:15,747
you have to fight.

427
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,848
So you have two choices.

428
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:20,617
You can either fight one
of our other first timers,

429
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:25,489
or you can fight your
way out the door past me.

430
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:27,692
It's totally up to you.

431
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:28,592
Mm-hm.

432
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,427
Mm.

433
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:34,397
Mm.

434
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:44,041
I've never been in a fight
before Charleen, I hate fights!

435
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,843
That's exactly
why you're here.

436
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:46,778
Come on.

437
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:47,712
You know what this broad does?

438
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,479
She's a school librarian.

439
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:51,783
I mean, do they even
have libraries anymore?

440
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:53,416
Hasn't she heard
of the internet?

441
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,986
Come on man, look at her.

442
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,022
A strong breeze
could knock her down.

443
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,991
Take it to her, come on!

444
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:02,693
Center stage ladies!

445
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:03,895
Let's go, some on.

446
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:07,999
Hi.

447
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:10,701
I'm Anna.

448
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,402
Carol, nice to meet you.

449
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:13,104
You too.

450
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,906
Oh, so sweet.

451
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,440
Maybe you guys could
be friends later?

452
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,943
All right, you heard the rules.

453
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:21,112
You go with that.

454
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,345
Good luck.

455
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,414
- Yeah, you too Anna.
- Okay.

456
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,918
Okay,
fighters, are you ready?

457
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,953
And fight!

458
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:33,691
Make a fist!

459
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,327
Swing!

460
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:40,064
At her!

461
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,034
Make a fist!

462
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:46,070
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

463
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,571
Hey, what's that?

464
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,538
What?

465
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:56,646
- Oh no!
- Ooh!

466
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,483
Tap out!

467
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,418
Are you gonna tap out?

468
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,020
What does tap out mean?

469
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:18,035
Anna!

470
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,403
Anna!

471
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,139
My name is Dr. Park.

472
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,674
Do you know where you are?

473
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,143
Hell.

474
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,946
I'm in hell.

475
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,148
I'm guessing I lost, huh?

476
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:33,684
Poland put up a bigger
fight in World War II.

477
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:34,952
Yeah, but at least you fought.

478
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,888
It took a lot of courage.

479
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:38,990
I guess I can cross
that off my bucket list.

480
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,059
And then puke in that bucket.

481
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,865
I thought only women
were allowed in here?

482
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,034
Dr. Roy is a special case,

483
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,936
and he's Bear's brother.

484
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:54,705
Your sister's name is Bear Park?

485
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:56,707
Trust me, no one's
ever teased her about it.

486
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,607
Roy!

487
00:20:58,242 --> 00:20:59,609
Roy!

488
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:00,477
We got a girl
that's got a little

489
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,212
problem with her ear.

490
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:02,646
What kind of problem?

491
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,581
It was just
removed from her head.

492
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:22,099
Still don't understand why
you'd bring me to this place.

493
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,669
Dude, just show her.

494
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:29,006
Show me what?

495
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,574
Welcome to the Bear cave.

496
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,110
Wow!

497
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:36,147
Well this is much cozier than
the Roman Coliseum out there.

498
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,584
What?

499
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:43,453
Is that?

500
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,125
Is that, that's Mom.

501
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:51,796
Yup, she was a goddamn legend.

502
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,066
Legend?

503
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:58,836
What the hell is going on?

504
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,671
This
might help explain.

505
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,674
Come on, sit down.

506
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:17,989
Mom fought here?

507
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:19,556
She didn't just fight here,

508
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,093
she was the founder
of this whole club.

509
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,865
This is Mary's last fight.

510
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,767
The cancer took her
six months later.

511
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,238
I made this as a tribute,

512
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,107
so Mary could know how
much she meant to us.

513
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,075
<i>When I needed an
emotional release,</i>

514
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,377
<i>I used to scream into my pillow.</i>

515
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,047
<i>This club is my new way of
screaming real fucking loud!</i>

516
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,884
<i>This club truly gives me
a place to express my rage.</i>

517
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,818
<i>Thanks Mary.</i>

518
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:49,186
<i>Everything scared me in life.</i>

519
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,023
<i>But now that I face down real
hurt and pain in this ring,</i>

520
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:55,092
<i>nothing in the real world
remotely scares me anymore.</i>

521
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,828
<i>I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.</i>

522
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,897
<i>So, here we go.</i>

523
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,833
<i>Mama Mayor, ah!</i>

524
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:07,171
<i>Here they come.</i>

525
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:11,275
<i>This club has allowed
us to share our stories,</i>

526
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,145
<i>to fight it out and
then hug it out.</i>

527
00:23:14,178 --> 00:23:18,082
<i>So thank you for allowing
me to let go of my anger</i>

528
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:20,684
<i>by letting go of my fist.</i>

529
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:23,187
<i>But also thank you
for showing me that</i>

530
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,157
<i>underneath this
big, hairy chest,</i>

531
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:29,226
<i>is an even bigger heart.</i>

532
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:31,762
<i>Stop looking at me!</i>

533
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,066
<i>Fuck.</i>

534
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:37,068
<i>When men punch each
other, it's normal.</i>

535
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:39,170
<i>We women feel the same way,</i>

536
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:42,173
<i>but society has house trained
us to cry our shit out.</i>

537
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:43,207
<i>But thanks to you, Mary,</i>

538
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,309
<i>we get to say, fuck that.</i>

539
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,311
<i>You've helped me and
a lot of other women</i>

540
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,780
<i>to find the strength
to live our truth.</i>

541
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:52,216
<i>And don't worry, I'll take
care of your baby girl.</i>

542
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,885
<i>And if you learn to fight,</i>

543
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,921
<i>and you never give
up in the ring,</i>

544
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:59,190
<i>you will always beat
the shit out of life.</i>

545
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:04,662
<i>And girls, never back
down from anything.</i>

546
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:12,169
Oh.

547
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:16,907
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

548
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:20,111
How did she not
tell me about this?

549
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,115
Therapist-patient
confidentiality.

550
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:26,083
All of us were your
Mom's patients,

551
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:28,285
and she was our therapist.

552
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,221
No one was meant to
know about this place.

553
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:33,290
And sure, there's the new breed

554
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:35,926
like Olivia who discovered us

555
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,194
and wants to change our ethos,

556
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:39,964
but Bear and I try
to run this club

557
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,266
like your mother
would have wanted.

558
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,902
And that's why I
brought you here friend,

559
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:47,304
'cause you need this place
just as much as her patients.

560
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:51,275
Oh, you guys, this is crazy.

561
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:53,310
I think you owe it to
her to give this a shot.

562
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:55,980
She created a place
that helped a lot of us.

563
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,086
I don't even
know how to fight.

564
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,188
It would take a miracle
worker to help me.

565
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,359
I think I may
know just the guy.

566
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,128
Eh?

567
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,000
Ooh!

568
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:29,113
So embarrassing, God.

569
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:41,392
Seriously, that's who
you want to train me?

570
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:42,293
Mm-hm.

571
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,397
This is like the
worst lip-syncing ever.

572
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,336
How do you know that guy?

573
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,971
Oh, I arrested
him a few times.

574
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,406
You know, drunk and disorderly,

575
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:57,374
public nudity,
that sort of thing.

576
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:58,342
Oh!

577
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,245
One time he ate
his own underwear

578
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,313
'cause he thought the
cotton fabric would absorb

579
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,348
the alcohol before he
took a breathalyzer test.

580
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:05,216
And did it work?

581
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:06,116
No!

582
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,324
Murphy trained
Sugar Ray, you know.

583
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:16,160
Who was a world champion in
like five different divisions.

584
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:17,895
I mean if the man
who trained Sugar Ray

585
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:19,263
isn't good enough for you,

586
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,098
maybe you should quit
before you begin.

587
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:21,966
Oh, okay.

588
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,133
So you're telling me,

589
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,902
I shouldn't judge this
particular book by

590
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:26,937
its very rum soaked cover?

591
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:28,038
Exactly.

592
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:29,873
I mean, look at you princess.

593
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:31,508
You are a book that
I wanna take to bed

594
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,044
and read all night long.

595
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,346
- Oh.
- But then you find out

596
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:38,048
The books
like dark and depressing,

597
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,417
and currently lacking
a shot at redemption.

598
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:44,355
So maybe this man could be the
one to change the narrative.

599
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:47,891
Hey man, show us your tits!

600
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:48,792
I got $1!

601
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,929
Come on, unbutton that!

602
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:53,530
Oh my God, he's doing it!

603
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:55,199
He's doing it!

604
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,133
- He's fucking doing it!
- Keep going, keep going!

605
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,268
Keep going, keep going!

606
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:58,435
He's going, he's going!

607
00:26:58,469 --> 00:27:00,170
Oh my God, he's
fucking doing it!

608
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,338
He's doing it!

609
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:03,073
- Yeah, woo!
- Keep going man!

610
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:05,542
Oh!

611
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:10,214
Shouldn't you call an
ambulance or something?

612
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:11,348
Too soon.

613
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:13,417
That will happen at least
three more times tonight.

614
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,485
Mm-hm.

615
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:21,392
Woo!

616
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:53,424
<i>If you learn to fight and
you never give up in the ring,</i>

617
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:56,527

618

<i>And girls, never back

621
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,015
Another one out.

622
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,049
Thank You.

623
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,490
You made quite the
display last night.

624
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:28,158
I don't think I've
ever seen anyone

625
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,393
take a dive from that height

626
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:31,295
and not spill a single
drop of their drink.

627
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:35,899
Well, my drinking
does defy gravity.

628
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,135
Have we met, I'm-

629
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:39,136
- Murphy.

630
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,437
Yeah, I know who you are.

631
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,040
They tell me you're a legend.

632
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,976
And so I'm gonna take
their word on that

633
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,645
and ask you to train me.

634
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,613
Train you to do what?

635
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,547
Ride a bike?

636
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:51,982
To fight.

637
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:54,084
I want you to train me to fight.

638
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:57,054
It looks like he might need.

639
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:01,358
Your expired visa secret
is still safe with me.

640
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,363
I don't mean to be rude,

641
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:08,298
but aren't you a little
old to be going pro?

642
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,234
I don't wanna go pro.

643
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,135
It's for...

644
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:16,173
I'm part of a fight club.

645
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:17,508
I'm sorry, you're in a what?

646
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,176
Yeah, a fight club.

647
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:20,310
A fight club.

648
00:29:23,614 --> 00:29:25,015
I'm sorry, did you
hear that Chloe?

649
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:29,219
A fight club, that
sounds so dangerous.

650
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:30,688
I know I'm not
sugar Ray, all right,

651
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:32,389
but I am in desperate
need of a coach

652
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:37,428
and short of any other
options, well, tag, you're it.

653
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:39,731
I got a news flash
for you Twiggy,

654
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:42,599
there are a lot easier ways
to make a buck than fighting.

655
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,268
My runs the Booby Trap

656
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:45,636
and you're not half bad
looking for your age

657
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,570
if you wanna get-

658
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:47,504
- This is not about money.

659
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:48,439
Everything is about the money.

660
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:49,373
Oh really?

661
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:50,507
Well not by the looks of you.

662
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:56,313
There are a lot less
bruising hobbies than fighting,

663
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:58,148
like crocheting.

664
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:01,552
So if it isn't about
money, what is it about?

665
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:07,725
Well, apparently
if you fight someone

666
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,526
who is also trained to hurt you,

667
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,063
then your fears seem a
lot smaller in comparison.

668
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:17,167
It's like once you face
that kind of potential pain,

669
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:20,070
you build some sort
of mental fortitude

670
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:22,439
to face anything that
life has to throw at you.

671
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:26,610
Or something like that.

672
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:27,679
If.

673
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:28,612
Yeah.

674
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:29,747
If you had your boobs done.

675
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:31,381
No!

676
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,050
I am sick and tired of my
demons getting the better of me

677
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,619
and I wanna punch them
square in the fucking face!

678
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,755
So, sorry.

679
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:39,490
Are you in or are you not?

680
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:40,658
Hey, hey!

681
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:42,059
It's show us your tits guy!

682
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:42,760
Oh no way!

683
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:45,395
No way!

684
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,231
Epically wasted last night.

685
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,432
I was.

686
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:49,333
I was.

687
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,269
I'm so glad you
enjoyed the show,

688
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:54,137
and don't forget to tip
your waitress please.

689
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:55,506
Okay, move along now kids.

690
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,207
We're trying to have a
little adult time here.

691
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,309
- Oh!
- Okay, okay.

692
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:03,046
Well, our adult time
would be rated R for raunchy.

693
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:06,718
How about R for repugnance?

694
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,151
- Ooh!
- Bitch!

695
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:11,054
Whoa! Whoa!

696
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,690
- No, no, no, no!
- What?

697
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,695
Your turn,
your turn, your turn.

698
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:21,766
Carter! Carter!

699
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,367
I'm all right!

700
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,669
Carter.

701
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:27,538
My Dad's gonna hear about this!

702
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,242
Yeah!

703
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:34,411
Hey, I like you, Heidi.

704
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:35,345
Anna.

705
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,280
Okay, let's go with that.

706
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,648
Now, I'm gonna give you a test.

707
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,449
If you pass that test,

708
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,685
I'm gonna train you.

709
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:41,819
Ugh, you're gonna go
all Mr. Miyagi on me

710
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:44,588
and make me paint your house
or something like that?.

711
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:45,657
Can I have that please?

712
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:48,458
Let me have this
please, thank you.

713
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:54,699
All you gotta do is
open up this watermelon.

714
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:58,602
Strength and balance.

715
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:00,604
This test has both.

716
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:01,638
Now, without holding it down,

717
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,273
I want you to punch
this watermelon

718
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:05,777
in it's smug little
face until it pops.

719
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,079
Oh wait, no punching down.

720
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:13,650
Okay.

721
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:18,790
Ah! Ah!

722
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:22,459
This is ridiculous!

723
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:23,761
It's just gonna keep
moving out of the way!

724
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:26,530
Yes it is, like all
of your opponents,

725
00:32:26,563 --> 00:32:28,432
this watermelon does
not wanna get opened up.

726
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,867
That's why it's got
such a thick skin.

727
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,669
It's gonna require
a lot of force.

728
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:32,770
But like most of your opponents,

729
00:32:32,804 --> 00:32:35,639
it also has a weak spot,
and you're gonna find it.

730
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:38,776
One more time.

731
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,678
Oh, and take your shoes off.

732
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:43,146
Are you kidding?

733
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,381
The sand is like 100 degrees.

734
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:46,617
Fighting also requires
exceptional footwork.

735
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:49,252
Let's go.

736
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:33,798
I did it!

737
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,667
Murph, I did it!

738
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,467
Oh, I did it Murph.

739
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,704
You did it?

740
00:33:39,737 --> 00:33:41,538
- Yeah,
- Oh, excellent.

741
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:42,539
Okay.

742
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:44,776
We start at seven
o'clock tomorrow morning.

743
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:48,880
Is that some sort
of old school training

744
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,281
you did with Sugar Ray?

745
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:54,752
No, I saw it on YouTube.

746
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:16,841
Saw you at the
club last night.

747
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,777
Oh right.

748
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,979
I'm sorry, we never
had the chance to meet.

749
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:22,847
I'm-

750
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,848
- Dead to me.

751
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:24,716
Excuse me?

752
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:25,917
You're dead to me.

753
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,654
You and all the other head cases
that come in in that place.

754
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,556
You know, maybe you should
replace that green shit

755
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,727
with something stronger,
you seem a little uptight.

756
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:39,496
What?

757
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:43,433
What did she just say?

758
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:44,902
Who knows.

759
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:47,404
Probably something about
putting you in the hospital.

760
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:49,473
Either way, you're
not gonna be welcomed

761
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:50,574
at the club pretty soon,

762
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,977
because we're bringing in
a fresh breed of women,

763
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,813
a place like that should
be about real competition.

764
00:34:55,847 --> 00:35:00,852
Real fighters, not a support
group for basic bitches.

765
00:35:02,452 --> 00:35:04,621
You don't get to decide
who comes to the club.

766
00:35:04,655 --> 00:35:09,660
Well, maybe not, but if you
do decide to keep showing up,

767
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:11,696
then one day you're
gonna find yourself

768
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:12,830
standing across from me.

769
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:14,866
And when that day comes,

770
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:17,634
I'm gonna hurt you so badly.

771
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:19,937
Think it over, make the
smart decision, cheers.

772
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:21,973
I'm not afraid
of you Cobra Kai.

773
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:25,009
And I am not gonna
back down from anyone,

774
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,444
and especially not you.

775
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:31,015
You're so cute.

776
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,852
So I challenge you!

777
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:37,621
What?

778
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:38,890
What did she say?

779
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:41,826
I

780
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,895
challenge you.

781
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,734
And I accept, pick a time.

782
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:55,372
- In two decades.
- Months.

783
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,040
Decades.

784
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,407
Two months.

785
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,878
You have to get ready
and then we fight.

786
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:07,018
You know what Abu,
I challenge you too.

787
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,920
Yeah, and you as
well, both of you,

788
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:10,620
I challenge both of you.

789
00:36:10,655 --> 00:36:12,824
You guys can be the warmup
to the main event, okay?

790
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:14,859
The appetizer to
the main course,

791
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:15,827
a little

792
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,595
before the all you can
eat buffet, kapeesh?

793
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,832
You better watch your back.

794
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:26,871
Yeah, well you better
watch your front parts.

795
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:28,673
Punch your boobs.

796
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,475
Shit.

797
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:35,012
Shit.

798
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:53,965
Are you out of your damn mind?

799
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,868
I brought you here to be a
better person, not die as one.

800
00:36:56,901 --> 00:37:00,771
Let's make this crystal,
you are a dead person, okay?

801
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:01,973
You challenged Olivia?

802
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:05,109
What monumental brain fart
caused this level of stupidity?

803
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,078
This is your fault, Charleen.

804
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:08,545
How?

805
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:10,447
You showed me that
video of my Mom.

806
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,517
Well, for the record,
it's a bad idea.

807
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:15,720
A really bad one.

808
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:17,989
Like using the bathroom
in a Home Depot bad.

809
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:21,025
What?

810
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:21,926
What's going on?

811
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:24,561
Do me a favor.

812
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:26,496
Casually look over
your left shoulder.

813
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:29,967
God, you were so bad at that.

814
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,837
You see that woman standing
up against the wall?

815
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,071
I thought she was the wall.

816
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:35,773
Her name is Naomi.

817
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,540
She's a total bad-ass.

818
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:39,509
She was a regular, but
she stopped showing up.

819
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:42,046
Only ever lost one fight.

820
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,580
And guess who beat her?

821
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:44,682
Godzilla.

822
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:45,850
Close.

823
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:46,751
Your Mom.

824
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:48,853
Why is she back?

825
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:51,088
And why is she staring
at me like that?

826
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:53,456
Probably for revenge.

827
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,927
See, your Mother was the
only person that beat her.

828
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,063
So she has to kill you to
restore families honor.

829
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:00,765
Great.

830
00:38:00,798 --> 00:38:02,800
Second time here and already
two people wanna kill me.

831
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,101
Three.

832
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,070
I heard you challenged
Noel as well.

833
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,241
Oh yeah.

834
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:11,742
- Idiot!
- Mm-hm.

835
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:13,878
Ah, this pretty face.

836
00:38:15,112 --> 00:38:16,847
You're gonna lose it.

837
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:28,926
Girls ready!

838
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,626
And fight!

839
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:49,013
Come on, choke her out!

840
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:49,947
Get her!

841
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:57,021
Yeah!

842
00:38:57,054 --> 00:38:57,922
Winner!

843
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:27,318
She moves like
Neo in "The Matrix".

844
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:28,219
Mm-hm.

845
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:41,598
Why's she looking at you?

846
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,569
Nope, I didn't challenge her.

847
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:47,271
Winner!

848
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,157
We got a grudge match!

849
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,927
Girls, are you ready?

850
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,895
And, fight!

851
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,164
Come on bitch.

852
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:14,131
What you got Lizzo?

853
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:15,800
- Come on Sarah McLachlan.
- Come on bitch.

854
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,034
Same as
them puppies, bitch.

855
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:19,636
Hey, don't fuck with
my puppies, bitch.

856
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:33,984
Oh!

857
00:40:35,286 --> 00:40:37,054
Oh!

858
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,156
One, two, three!

859
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,991
She's out, she's out, she's out!

860
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:43,094
Winner, right here!

861
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:44,962
- You were down!
- This ain't fucking over!

862
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:46,063
- Hey!
- This ain't over, Bear!

863
00:40:46,097 --> 00:40:47,665
I wasn't down!

864
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:48,732
Do something!

865
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,167
You're out of the club!

866
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,268
- Fuck this shit!
- Yeah, you fucking move!

867
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:53,037
- Fuck this shit!
- Get out of here!

868
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,205
I'm gonna tell
the cops about this place!

869
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:55,873
That's right, it's my cage!

870
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,308
Get the fuck out!

871
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:58,309
Bye!

872
00:40:58,342 --> 00:40:59,310
See ya!

873
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:01,378
Oh my God.

874
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:02,279
Well,

875
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:04,982
you're up next, Rocky.

876
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:06,817
I think I'm just gonna...

877
00:41:08,686 --> 00:41:09,954
Just give me a second.

878
00:41:13,924 --> 00:41:15,359
That's who I'm fighting?

879
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,027
She's got a broken arm.

880
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:18,863
Do I go easy on her
or what do I do?

881
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:21,265
Your second fight and
you're Sarah Connor now?

882
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:22,399
It just doesn't seem fair.

883
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,201
On you or her?

884
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:25,302
Look at the bright side,

885
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:27,771
afterwards, you can say
something cool and ironic,

886
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,907
like, "That fight
was disarming."

887
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,275
I'm not gonna say that.

888
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:32,910
You'll miss an
opportunity of a lifetime.

889
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,411
Fighters ready!

890
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:36,780
Oh, watch
out for her right.

891
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:38,015
That's not even funny.

892
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:40,284
And, fight!

893
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:46,891
Go, go, go!

894
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:00,271
Foot, her right foot.

895
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:01,939
I should have been
more specific.

896
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:02,840
I'm sorry.

897
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:05,176
Anna?

898
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:06,243
Anna.

899
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:11,215
Hello again.

900
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,017
Oh.

901
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,885
Oh, wow.

902
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:19,256
That fight was, disarming.

903
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,491
Yeah, well my opinion,

904
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:21,425
it probably would
have been better

905
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,093
to keep her in arms length.

906
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:27,198
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where ya going?

907
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:29,133
Well, to look for my dignity.

908
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,368
I know it's around
here somewhere.

909
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,370
Seriously, I'm fine.

910
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:36,273
I appreciate you
taking care of me too.

911
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:38,375
Thank you.

912
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,311
Well that's okay.

913
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:41,512
I'm a lousy doctor anyway.

914
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:42,947
I went to Ohio state.

915
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,381
I was drunk half the time.

916
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:45,382
Ah.

917
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,251
I thought I sensed incompetence.

918
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:50,187
Hey Roy.

919
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:51,488
And evil.

920
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:54,425
I also sense the presence
of evil among us.

921
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,360
Hi.

922
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:58,062
You, you ready to go?

923
00:42:58,095 --> 00:42:59,430
Ready to go where?

924
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:03,867
Olivia and I were gonna have
some drinks, a couple drinks.

925
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:06,136
Hmm, that's wonderful.

926
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,239
Yeah, have you had a
chance to meet Anna yet?

927
00:43:08,272 --> 00:43:10,307
Yeah, actually we had a,

928
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:13,444
a delightful little
chat earlier today.

929
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:15,346
We sure did, and oh,

930
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:17,314
I thought I overheard her
ask someone about the best

931
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:19,216
medication was for syphilis.

932
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,085
So maybe you can
pick Dr. Roy's brain

933
00:43:21,118 --> 00:43:22,920
about that over drinks tonight.

934
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:27,358
- Anyway,
- Anyway.

935
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:29,093
I shouldn't
keep you two.

936
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:34,431
Syphilis, yep!

937
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:36,166
It's a real thing, you know!

938
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,302
Took down Hitler when
half the world couldn't.

939
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:44,908
Murphy: You're late.

940
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:46,143
It's 7:00 AM like you said.

941
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:47,378
If you're early,
you're on time,

942
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:48,946
and if you're on
time, you're late.

943
00:43:48,979 --> 00:43:50,147
That's very confusing.

944
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,282
Don't let it
happen again, okay.

945
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:53,417
And if you do, I'm gone.

946
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,485
Put that on.

947
00:43:55,486 --> 00:43:56,553
From what I hear, if you
get punched in the head,

948
00:43:56,587 --> 00:43:58,889
you fall down, makes it
kind of hard to win a fight.

949
00:43:58,922 --> 00:43:59,957
So how are we gonna fix that?

950
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,191
I don't know.

951
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,593
Chloe here is going to punch
you in the head a few times.

952
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:03,560
What?

953
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:06,030
How does that feel?

954
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,364
Really uncomfortable!

955
00:44:08,432 --> 00:44:09,333
Yeah, it's an
uncomfortable thing

956
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:10,501
to get punched in the head.

957
00:44:10,534 --> 00:44:12,002
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

958
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:13,237
What?

959
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,438
Isn't it better if I
try to fight her back?

960
00:44:14,471 --> 00:44:15,506
No, you need to learn
how to take a punch.

961
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:16,874
- Let's go.
- What?

962
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:19,977
Oh Jesus, that hurts!

963
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,279
Yes it does, because
it's painful to train,

964
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:23,547
it's painful to compete,

965
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,316
but there's nothing
more pleasurable

966
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:26,450
than the thrill of victory.

967
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:29,086
Isn't it you that
wanted this celebration

968
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,355
of the human spirit both
in and out of the ring?

969
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:33,390
Huh?

970
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:34,892
This is only gonna help you.

971
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,528
Oh, this is bullshit!

972
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:38,962
How much longer am I
gonna have to take this?

973
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:40,931
Until you can't
take it anymore.

974
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:45,369
But I can't take it anymore!

975
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,041
What am I missing?

976
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,177
Drink?

977
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,078
Yeah.

978
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,246
Yeah.

979
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,401
Hi.

980
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:19,069
We're not open.

981
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:21,238
Oh, the door was
open so I just thought-

982
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:22,639
- We have an opening tonight.

983
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:26,377
The artist was bumping in.

984
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:30,481
You look familiar, do I
know you from somewhere?

985
00:45:31,482 --> 00:45:33,384
Oh, at that coffee shop!

986
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,219
I challenged you to a
fight at the Fight Club.

987
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:37,221
Are we even allowed to
talk about the Fight Club?

988
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:38,522
What can I do for you?

989
00:45:38,555 --> 00:45:39,590
Oh, right.

990
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:42,459
I'm actually looking for a job.

991
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:44,228
I have lots of cafe experience.

992
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:46,563
I'm not the one you
should be speaking with.

993
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:48,499
Oh, who might that be?

994
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:51,635
In there.

995
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:53,504
Oh.

996
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:56,173
Okay, thanks.

997
00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:06,383
Shit.

998
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:07,351
Hi, Anna.

999
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:11,422
What are you doing here,
you little peeping Tom?

1000
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,358
I mean, I think my ass
looks great in these pants,

1001
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:15,959
but damn.

1002
00:46:15,993 --> 00:46:17,194
Hey Olivia.

1003
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:18,228
No, no.

1004
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:22,065
I am actually a huge art lover.

1005
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,470
- And so the art drew me in.
- Oh, yes.

1006
00:46:26,503 --> 00:46:29,440
- Larry is incredible, right?
- Yeah.

1007
00:46:29,473 --> 00:46:30,407
Yeah, I know.

1008
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:32,476
It was a real coup to
get him to open here.

1009
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:33,310
I bet.

1010
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:35,646
And do you work
out in a gallery.

1011
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,215
Yeah, you can work
out anywhere you want

1012
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:40,184
when you own the space.

1013
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,618
You own the gallery?

1014
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:42,419
Mm-hm.

1015
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:44,656
Actually, I own
the whole building.

1016
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:47,759
Oh wow, that's-

1017
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:49,326
- Super baller.

1018
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,562
Yeah, ballers, great.

1019
00:46:51,595 --> 00:46:53,497
Anna, you're a liar.

1020
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,699
What?

1021
00:46:54,732 --> 00:46:56,266
Yeah, you don't
give a shit about art.

1022
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,601
You don't care about Larry.

1023
00:46:57,634 --> 00:46:58,703
But I love Larry.

1024
00:46:58,736 --> 00:47:00,604
You don't even
know who he is, do you?

1025
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:01,505
I sure do.

1026
00:47:01,538 --> 00:47:05,509
You came here because
you wanted to get

1027
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:09,046
the low down on my date with
the good doctor, didn't you?

1028
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,515
Uh-huh, you filthy
little Minx, you!

1029
00:47:11,548 --> 00:47:13,050
No, no, I did not.

1030
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,618
- So picture this.
- No.

1031
00:47:14,651 --> 00:47:17,521
- Two perfect naked bodies
- I don't want to.

1032
00:47:17,554 --> 00:47:19,523
Coming
together as one flesh

1033
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:23,494
for hours of pure unadulterated,

1034
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:26,497
- in carnal, pleasure.
- Yeah, I just, no.

1035
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,499
- Over.
- I don't care.

1036
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:31,602
I love Larry,
Larry's mixed media.

1037
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:32,569
My favorite.

1038
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:34,271
The more mixed up the better!

1039
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:36,173
You should have seen us.

1040
00:47:36,206 --> 00:47:38,676
Oh, actually you totally can,

1041
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,644
because we recorded
the whole thing.

1042
00:47:40,678 --> 00:47:42,145
I'll just pop it on over to you,

1043
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:43,748
now that I have your email.

1044
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,116
Oh right, no, I just-

1045
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:47,451
- Oh Anna.

1046
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:48,820
I just wanted to tell you.

1047
00:47:48,853 --> 00:47:52,122
We have a really strict
employment policy.

1048
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:54,157
Yeah, we just don't hire

1049
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:57,127
weak minded blondes.

1050
00:48:01,198 --> 00:48:02,599
Walk away Mom jeans.

1051
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:03,735
Walk away.

1052
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:05,536
- These are tight.
- Uh-huh.

1053
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:15,112
You know Chloe,
you want that visa,

1054
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:17,114
I say we get married.

1055
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:20,350
Hey Frenchie heads up.

1056
00:48:20,384 --> 00:48:21,251
Let's go.

1057
00:48:22,352 --> 00:48:23,620
Can I finish my drink?

1058
00:48:23,655 --> 00:48:24,521
No.

1059
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:29,593
I knew she'd be back.

1060
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:42,506
More!

1061
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,109
Come on
Frenchie, give it to me!

1062
00:48:47,544 --> 00:48:48,645
Is that all you got?

1063
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,814
Go, again!

1064
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:50,715
Go!

1065
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:52,649
Come on!

1066
00:48:54,752 --> 00:48:56,688
Go, again, again!

1067
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:58,121
Come on, what are you, a wimp?

1068
00:48:58,155 --> 00:48:59,657
Give it harder, go!

1069
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,392
Yeah, that's right!

1070
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:03,293
What, come on!

1071
00:49:04,896 --> 00:49:07,899
Ooh, yep, yep, more gently!

1072
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:09,466
That's right, that's right.

1073
00:49:24,414 --> 00:49:25,382
Are you done?

1074
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:27,685
Yeah.

1075
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:32,824
So what's next?

1076
00:49:38,328 --> 00:49:39,196
Not bad.

1077
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:41,799
Not bad at all.

1078
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,670
One, sweep!

1079
00:49:45,703 --> 00:49:47,638
Two, sweep!

1080
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:48,773
Three!

1081
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:49,707
No!

1082
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:50,808
You don't even hit like a girl!

1083
00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:52,342
You hit like a cat!

1084
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:53,811
Like a cat that can't box.

1085
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:55,212
Okay, come on!

1086
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,647
Keep going, keep moving!

1087
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,315
I'm gonna need a lot of drinks.

1088
00:49:58,348 --> 00:49:59,249
I can't do it.

1089
00:49:59,282 --> 00:50:00,384
Let's move on.

1090
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:03,655
Ah!

1091
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:05,522
Ow!

1092
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:07,591
Ah, ah that hurts!

1093
00:50:07,624 --> 00:50:09,961
So does hitting a real
person, now come on,

1094
00:50:09,994 --> 00:50:11,663
show me something!

1095
00:50:11,696 --> 00:50:13,463
Watch me, you're always
loading from the shoulder.

1096
00:50:13,497 --> 00:50:16,734
Okay.

1097
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:23,841
She has a really hard head.

1098
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,843
She certainly does.

1099
00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:27,210
Sa!

1100
00:50:27,244 --> 00:50:28,578
Su!

1101
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:29,814
Zi!

1102
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:30,782
You're very funny
by the way, okay.

1103
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:31,816
Watch me.

1104
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:32,750
Make it count.

1105
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:34,786
That's it!

1106
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:35,953
Well now hit the fucking bag!

1107
00:50:35,987 --> 00:50:37,689
I did hit the bag!

1108
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:42,760
Swing, three!

1109
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:43,795
And duck, sweep!

1110
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:45,328
You didn't duck!

1111
00:50:47,264 --> 00:50:48,833
That's better, that's better!

1112
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:51,803
Yeah!

1113
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:57,809
She's still going.

1114
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,444
How long has she lasted?

1115
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:04,816
Are you okay?

1116
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,517
Yeah.

1117
00:51:33,643 --> 00:51:35,046
Anna.

1118
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:36,446
Anna, wake up.

1119
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:43,620
What?

1120
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,424
Did I get knocked out again?

1121
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,929
No, but I think you're
a complete knockout.

1122
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:57,802
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about you lately.

1123
00:51:59,636 --> 00:52:03,674
Actually, you're all
I've been thinking about.

1124
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:04,976
What about Olivia?

1125
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:08,045
Who?

1126
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,479
Good answer.

1127
00:52:09,513 --> 00:52:10,715
I really wanna
kiss you right now

1128
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:12,582
and have lots of sex,
would that be okay?

1129
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:14,584
I'm feeling
extremely consensual.

1130
00:52:19,857 --> 00:52:21,859
Oh my God,
you are all wet.

1131
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:23,527
You bet your ass I am.

1132
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:28,498
No, you're literally
like all wet.

1133
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:29,967
Like saturated.

1134
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:30,868
You're drenched.

1135
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:34,939
Oh my God.

1136
00:52:34,972 --> 00:52:35,807
What's happening?

1137
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:42,814
Oh God, I can't
even dream right!

1138
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:49,720
Ow!

1139
00:52:50,888 --> 00:52:51,856
What the fuck?

1140
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:54,926
And you're here about?

1141
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:56,626
Possible tissue damage?

1142
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:57,527
Where?

1143
00:52:58,763 --> 00:52:59,997
Down, down there.

1144
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,633
Okay, what'd you use?

1145
00:53:03,668 --> 00:53:04,969
A coconut?

1146
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:06,871
Oh no, not on myself.

1147
00:53:06,904 --> 00:53:07,972
Put that in the chart.

1148
00:53:08,005 --> 00:53:11,075
No coconut was inserted, it
was kicked into my cooch.

1149
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:13,577
I had a coconut
kicked in my cooch.

1150
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,012
Try saying that 10 times fast.

1151
00:53:15,046 --> 00:53:15,880
Got a coconut
kicked in my cooch.

1152
00:53:15,913 --> 00:53:17,447
Got a coconut.

1153
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,883
Yeah, hard.

1154
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,017
Nurse: Okay.

1155
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:20,952
Okay.

1156
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:22,987
Dr. Lee will be with you soon.

1157
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,888
Great.

1158
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:47,144
Hello mister,

1159
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:49,914
I'll be your doctor for the day.

1160
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,952
Hi, wow, shit.

1161
00:53:56,087 --> 00:53:57,889
I didn't, I didn't
know you worked here.

1162
00:53:57,922 --> 00:53:59,190
Well, yeah, I'm a doctor.

1163
00:53:59,223 --> 00:54:00,658
Yeah.

1164
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:01,893
It's the only
hospital in town.

1165
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:03,426
Right, yeah, well,
how convenient.

1166
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,829
Yeah.

1167
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:06,063
Well, look, I was just
sitting front of the computer.

1168
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:07,430
I saw your name pop up
on the admittance list.

1169
00:54:07,464 --> 00:54:08,498
What's going on?

1170
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:09,432
Well-

1171
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:10,701
- Eh, you know what, I'm just-

1172
00:54:10,735 --> 00:54:11,869
- Oh no, no, no, you
don't have to look.

1173
00:54:11,903 --> 00:54:12,569
I'll just tell you.

1174
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:14,939
It's not inserted, but kicked.

1175
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:15,940
Well that's a relief.

1176
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:16,874
Yeah.

1177
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:18,608
If it was the former
and not the latter

1178
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:20,811
I'd say you belonged in
Tijuana and not a hospital.

1179
00:54:20,845 --> 00:54:21,913
Yeah, right.

1180
00:54:21,946 --> 00:54:23,647
You're in any pain right now?

1181
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:27,118
I think I'm dying of
embarrassment, yeah.

1182
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:29,820
Well, I'd lay low
with the, you know,

1183
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:31,488
sexual activity
for a week or so.

1184
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:32,723
That won't be a problem.

1185
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:35,059
I'm on a self-imposed
abstinence.

1186
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,093
That's very
strong-willed of you.

1187
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:37,128
Thanks.

1188
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,031
So what about you?

1189
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:42,700
What about me?

1190
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:45,502
How was, how was
your date with Olivia?

1191
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:46,704
Oh.

1192
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:48,673
Did you
practice abstinence?

1193
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:49,606
Woo!

1194
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:52,076
Yeah, things got a little crazy.

1195
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:52,977
- Oh.
- That night we drank

1196
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,011
A lot of tequila.

1197
00:54:54,045 --> 00:54:55,645
You know what I mean?

1198
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,915
I wasn't myself, if I'm
being totally honest.

1199
00:54:57,949 --> 00:54:59,984
Yeah, no, no, you
don't have to explain.

1200
00:55:00,017 --> 00:55:01,484
Doctor, we need
you to scrub up.

1201
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:03,721
22 year old male
GSW to the chest.

1202
00:55:03,754 --> 00:55:05,022
Ambulance is about a minute out.

1203
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:05,957
Okay Miss, well I gotta go.

1204
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,792
I'll see you later though, okay?

1205
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:13,831
I'm a psycho.

1206
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:19,236
Oh.

1207
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,137
So.

1208
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,109
You're a coconut lady, huh?

1209
00:55:25,142 --> 00:55:26,978
Yep, that's me.

1210
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:30,081
Might as well make that my
legal name from now on, right?

1211
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:32,249
Lean back.

1212
00:55:32,283 --> 00:55:33,117
Okay.

1213
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:39,890
<i>It's
Charleen, you know what to do!</i>

1214
00:55:39,924 --> 00:55:41,692
<i>Hey C, I
really need a drink.</i>

1215
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:43,127
<i>Meet me at Cheeky's.</i>

1216
00:56:01,212 --> 00:56:02,079
Hey honey!

1217
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:03,814
Dad?

1218
00:56:03,848 --> 00:56:06,050
Oh my God, what
are you doing here?

1219
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,218
What are you doing here?

1220
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:08,919
Something you'd like to tell me?

1221
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:10,121
Oh my God.

1222
00:56:10,154 --> 00:56:11,055
No, I'm having a
drink with Charleen.

1223
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,858
Did you get a spray tan?

1224
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:16,694
No, I was working the garden.

1225
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:18,162
With a bronzing hose?

1226
00:56:18,195 --> 00:56:19,130
Shut up!

1227
00:56:19,163 --> 00:56:20,164
Is Chuck here?

1228
00:56:20,197 --> 00:56:21,232
No, he's working late.

1229
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:23,134
He's got a big divorce case.

1230
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:24,235
Okay.

1231
00:56:24,268 --> 00:56:27,038
Well I can, I can
join you for a drink.

1232
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:28,806
Normally I would love to,

1233
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,308
but I've got some place to go.

1234
00:56:31,342 --> 00:56:32,243
- Really?
- That's right.

1235
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:34,311
I got invited to a party.

1236
00:56:34,345 --> 00:56:35,780
A guy came in and
was handing these

1237
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:38,215
party carrots out
right before you came.

1238
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:42,086
Orgy Dad.

1239
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,221
This doesn't say
party, it says orgy.

1240
00:56:44,255 --> 00:56:45,790
You've been invited to an orgy.

1241
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,260
That O looks just like a P,

1242
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:52,063
and who in the hell
writes in cursive anymore?

1243
00:56:52,096 --> 00:56:55,099
Dad, just go home,
wait for Chuck,

1244
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:56,667
have all the Chuck sex you want.

1245
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,935
Have a Chuck orgy.

1246
00:56:57,968 --> 00:56:58,803
Are you okay?

1247
00:56:58,836 --> 00:56:59,670
You seem upset.

1248
00:56:59,703 --> 00:57:01,972
No, it's just,

1249
00:57:02,006 --> 00:57:04,708
I never expected to be
with my Dad in a gay bar

1250
00:57:04,742 --> 00:57:06,243
talking about orgies.

1251
00:57:07,144 --> 00:57:08,611
Are you embarrassed by me?

1252
00:57:08,645 --> 00:57:10,081
No, I'm not embarrassed.

1253
00:57:10,114 --> 00:57:14,118
I'm just, I'm still
processing it all.

1254
00:57:14,151 --> 00:57:15,820
I've been processing
this most of my life.

1255
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:17,054
I'm done.

1256
00:57:17,088 --> 00:57:18,989
I am who I am and this
is who I'm gonna be.

1257
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:22,093
I fought hard to find
myself, what about you?

1258
00:57:23,394 --> 00:57:24,995
Love you sweetie.

1259
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:31,802
Oh yeah.

1260
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:43,180
Ready one!

1261
00:57:43,214 --> 00:57:44,715
Sweep, two!

1262
00:57:44,748 --> 00:57:46,217
Sweep, three!

1263
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,418
Sweep, four!

1264
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:48,686
Sweep!

1265
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:49,420
- This hand goes out.
- Yeah.

1266
00:57:49,453 --> 00:57:51,088
This hands up.

1267
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:52,656
This hand goes out and
this hands up, bang, bang!

1268
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,858
Bang, bang!

1269
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,126
Uppercut!

1270
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:56,260
Okay, again, ready?

1271
00:57:56,293 --> 00:57:57,761
One, one, two, three!

1272
00:57:57,795 --> 00:57:58,762
Again, bang!

1273
00:57:58,796 --> 00:57:59,730
That's it, one,

1274
00:57:59,763 --> 00:58:00,664
two,

1275
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:02,233
three!

1276
00:58:19,316 --> 00:58:22,720
Thank you.

1277
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:30,227
One, one, two!

1278
00:58:30,261 --> 00:58:32,129
One, one, two!

1279
00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:33,230
<i>One, one, two, three!</i>

1280
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:40,304
<i>One more hook!</i>

1281
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:41,338
<i>One more hook!</i>

1282
00:59:14,505 --> 00:59:17,208
<i>Oh come on!</i>

1283
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:52,409
Hey! Hey!

1284
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:53,344
Hey!

1285
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,045
You do you do any babysitting?

1286
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:56,447
I don't have any kids, but
we can work something out.

1287
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,115
That's my coach.

1288
00:59:58,148 --> 00:59:59,416
You get away from him!

1289
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,387
I don't know what that means,

1290
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,356
but this Fight Club
sounds a little ruthless.

1291
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:07,191
You wouldn't stand a chance.

1292
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:10,361
What'd they say to you?

1293
01:00:10,394 --> 01:00:12,129
It doesn't really matter.

1294
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:13,364
What matters is
both of these ladies

1295
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:15,933
seem to be taking
you very seriously.

1296
01:01:00,044 --> 01:01:00,878
Hit it!

1297
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:02,046
That's it, again!

1298
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,913
Bang, that's it!

1299
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:04,381
Try to make a hamburger!

1300
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:05,949
Jesus Christ!

1301
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:08,352
You're like a fucking
Great White shark.

1302
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:09,286
Look at you.

1303
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,255
Look at you.

1304
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:15,025
Wow!

1305
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:26,937
Congratulations Anna,
that fight was incredible.

1306
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:28,172
Thanks.

1307
01:01:28,205 --> 01:01:30,474
Hold on, can I talk
to you for a second?

1308
01:01:30,507 --> 01:01:31,375
What do you want Ray?

1309
01:01:31,408 --> 01:01:33,143
Well, ever since
you came into the ER,

1310
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:34,078
I just feel like
you've been going

1311
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:34,978
out of your way to avoid me.

1312
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:36,013
I was wondering why.

1313
01:01:37,214 --> 01:01:38,115
I've just been winning more.

1314
01:01:38,148 --> 01:01:40,184
I haven't needed your services.

1315
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:46,190
You should probably leave.

1316
01:01:46,223 --> 01:01:47,057
What?

1317
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:48,359
Why?

1318
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:50,394
You shouldn't see
this next fight.

1319
01:01:50,427 --> 01:01:53,397
Well, great, now all I wanna
do is see this next fight.

1320
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,966
No!

1321
01:01:57,935 --> 01:01:59,937
Why did you let this happen?

1322
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,505
Olivia challenged all three.

1323
01:02:01,538 --> 01:02:03,540
There is no rule against it.

1324
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:06,243
- Should be.
- Yeah, fight!

1325
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:07,211
This is crazy.

1326
01:02:07,244 --> 01:02:08,078
Mm-hm.

1327
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:09,380
All right fighters!

1328
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:11,415
Same rules as on one on,

1329
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:15,452
but this is three on one!

1330
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:16,954
Oh my God.

1331
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:18,622
Ready, fight!

1332
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:41,912
Holy shit.

1333
01:02:42,747 --> 01:02:44,648
She's been holding back.

1334
01:03:44,274 --> 01:03:45,442
Hey!

1335
01:04:18,676 --> 01:04:21,044
I'll see you in
here tomorrow night.

1336
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:27,584
I quit.

1337
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:28,820
I quit!

1338
01:04:28,853 --> 01:04:30,120
What?

1339
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,555
I am done Charleen, okay!

1340
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:32,757
I am done pretending.

1341
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,157
I am not my Mom.

1342
01:04:34,191 --> 01:04:36,527
And you never
will be if you quit.

1343
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,462
Come on, you worked so hard!

1344
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:40,297
Yeah, and what's it gotten me?

1345
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,733
I can take and throw a punch?

1346
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,133
Great!

1347
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,736
But out here in the real world,

1348
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:46,637
my life is still a shit pile!

1349
01:04:46,671 --> 01:04:48,238
If you don't fight
Olivia tomorrow,

1350
01:04:48,272 --> 01:04:49,707
you can never come back.

1351
01:04:51,341 --> 01:04:53,243
Well it's probably best
for everyone, all right.

1352
01:04:53,277 --> 01:04:54,177
Sorry, I'm done.

1353
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:55,512
Anna.

1354
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:56,413
Anna!

1355
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:04,621
Damn it!

1356
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:06,658
Damn it!

1357
01:05:26,376 --> 01:05:27,244
Hey Twiggy.

1358
01:05:28,378 --> 01:05:29,613
You're supposed
to be at the gym.

1359
01:05:29,646 --> 01:05:31,415
I told you if you were
late again we're done,

1360
01:05:31,448 --> 01:05:33,216
and you're very late,

1361
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,252
but because of your
exceptional progress,

1362
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,588
I'm gonna give you one
free pass, so let's go.

1363
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:43,761
Or we could just
take in the scenery.

1364
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:49,266
Nothing's changed Murph.

1365
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:53,303
I don't know what I thought
this fight would give me,

1366
01:05:53,337 --> 01:05:56,306
but I still have all
the same problems.

1367
01:05:57,407 --> 01:05:58,375
Totally broke.

1368
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:00,912
No closer to
reopening a business,

1369
01:06:00,945 --> 01:06:04,749
and I have absolutely no prospects
of turning things around.

1370
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,854
And you know what the icing
on the shit cake would be?

1371
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:11,588
Olivia.

1372
01:06:11,622 --> 01:06:13,825
I mean, this isn't a librarian
or a woman with a broken arm.

1373
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:17,394
This is someone who can
do long lasting damage.

1374
01:06:22,834 --> 01:06:25,302
I'm too scared to fight her.

1375
01:06:25,335 --> 01:06:26,203
So,

1376
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:29,774
I'm quitting.

1377
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,409
But you've trained for this,

1378
01:06:32,442 --> 01:06:33,644
and I wouldn't let you fight

1379
01:06:33,678 --> 01:06:34,779
if I didn't think
you were ready.

1380
01:06:34,812 --> 01:06:38,916
All you need to do now is
leave behind fear and doubt,

1381
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,954
and take that final
step to bravery.

1382
01:06:42,987 --> 01:06:44,656
It's easier said than done.

1383
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:46,891
How do I do that?

1384
01:06:51,963 --> 01:06:55,365
I'll show you.

1385
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:56,266
Okay,

1386
01:06:59,837 --> 01:07:00,772
you go like this.

1387
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:03,240
I don't get it.

1388
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:05,743
Okay, I'll do
it one more time.

1389
01:07:06,711 --> 01:07:07,577
Like that.

1390
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:13,818
You see, when you're fighting
Kung Fu Barbie tonight,

1391
01:07:13,851 --> 01:07:15,887
you don't think about
anything else but this,

1392
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,822
outside the ropes is fear,

1393
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:21,525
but you take one single
step into the ring

1394
01:07:21,558 --> 01:07:23,393
and you are brave.

1395
01:07:23,427 --> 01:07:25,462
And the same thing goes
for this world, Anna.

1396
01:07:25,495 --> 01:07:27,865
The only thing that
separates fear from bravery

1397
01:07:27,899 --> 01:07:29,801
is one small step.

1398
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:31,736
So are you gonna take it?

1399
01:07:35,907 --> 01:07:37,742
You got that from
YouTube, didn't you?

1400
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:39,509
Yeah.

1401
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:40,712
It's good though, huh?

1402
01:07:40,745 --> 01:07:42,947
And you probably give the
same great advice to Sugar Ray.

1403
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,381
- Huh?
- Pretty much.

1404
01:07:44,414 --> 01:07:45,549
I mean, it's
scary getting up there

1405
01:07:45,582 --> 01:07:46,951
in front of thousands
of adoring fans,

1406
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:48,786
especially when those
songs don't sound

1407
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,722
the same live as they
do when you record them.

1408
01:07:50,755 --> 01:07:51,789
Wait.

1409
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,325
Hold on.

1410
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,528
You trained Sugar Ray the band?

1411
01:07:58,562 --> 01:08:00,397
Yeah, I mean only for
their first world tour,

1412
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,666
but those things are grueling.

1413
01:08:01,699 --> 01:08:02,834
I mean Mark McGrath,

1414
01:08:02,867 --> 01:08:04,601
he was ripped.

1415
01:08:04,634 --> 01:08:05,502
Of course!

1416
01:08:06,738 --> 01:08:07,571
What's so funny?

1417
01:08:07,604 --> 01:08:08,806
Nothing I-

1418
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,808
- "Every Morning" is a
misunderstood classic.

1419
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:12,677
Misunderstood is
an understatement.

1420
01:08:14,578 --> 01:08:15,445
Hey,

1421
01:08:16,546 --> 01:08:17,547
you got this.

1422
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:19,884
If all else fails,

1423
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:21,853
use your head.

1424
01:08:23,988 --> 01:08:27,424
Hey, you never told me what
I owe you for helping me out.

1425
01:08:30,661 --> 01:08:31,829
Just pay my bar bill.

1426
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:42,606
Dad?

1427
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,407
Chuck.

1428
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:47,945
What happened?

1429
01:08:59,456 --> 01:09:00,725
What the hell, Dad?

1430
01:09:00,758 --> 01:09:01,793
A heart attack?

1431
01:09:01,826 --> 01:09:03,460
How bad is it?

1432
01:09:03,493 --> 01:09:05,797
You didn't let Chuck finish
before you hung up on him.

1433
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,865
I had a mild heart attack.

1434
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:08,900
I could be home tonight.

1435
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:09,934
Oh God.

1436
01:09:11,002 --> 01:09:12,402
Well, what triggered it?

1437
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,009
What the hell are you doing
to him in the bedroom?

1438
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:20,778
Actually, it was on
top of a washing machine.

1439
01:09:20,812 --> 01:09:21,913
A classic.

1440
01:09:21,946 --> 01:09:23,346
And what is she doing here?

1441
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,016
You really called her before me?

1442
01:09:25,049 --> 01:09:26,951
I needed her to
bring something.

1443
01:09:32,622 --> 01:09:33,825
What is this?

1444
01:09:33,858 --> 01:09:36,761
It's the club, or
at least the property.

1445
01:09:36,794 --> 01:09:38,129
Yeah, I knew.

1446
01:09:38,162 --> 01:09:40,932
Your Mom did more than
fight at that club.

1447
01:09:40,965 --> 01:09:43,400
Your Mom owned it,
and now you do.

1448
01:09:44,068 --> 01:09:45,703
And you're homeless after all.

1449
01:09:45,736 --> 01:09:46,570
You should sell it.

1450
01:09:46,603 --> 01:09:47,972
Pay off your debt's.

1451
01:09:48,005 --> 01:09:48,973
You know, start afresh.

1452
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,541
I'm gonna head over there now.

1453
01:09:51,575 --> 01:09:53,978
Get in one last fight
before you shut us down.

1454
01:09:55,179 --> 01:09:56,013
Roy.

1455
01:09:56,047 --> 01:09:57,048
What up?

1456
01:09:59,482 --> 01:10:00,517
How ya feeling Ed?

1457
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:01,919
Good, I feel really good.

1458
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:02,787
Yeah, well if you're
feeling really good,

1459
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,655
then you shouldn't
be in the hospital.

1460
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,124
I'm taking off, but Dr. Lee's

1461
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:09,760
gonna come in and discharge you.

1462
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:10,627
Thanks.

1463
01:10:10,661 --> 01:10:11,528
I'll see ya.

1464
01:10:14,799 --> 01:10:18,035
Go get him before
Chuck and I do.

1465
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:19,904
Oh my God, that is
some ginger candy.

1466
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:21,072
Get it.

1467
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:22,773
Go get him, girl.

1468
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:26,944
Okay.

1469
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,915
Oh my God.

1470
01:10:30,948 --> 01:10:33,784
Don't ever pass out
inside of me again.

1471
01:10:33,818 --> 01:10:37,188
So,

1472
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:38,723
you're a washing
machine man, huh?

1473
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:42,827
He loves his spin cycle.

1474
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,929
I'm kind of a permanent
press guy myself.

1475
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:45,830
Yeah, so.

1476
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:50,935
Roy, wait.

1477
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:53,938
Look, please, I
just wanna apologize

1478
01:10:53,971 --> 01:10:55,072
for ignoring you.

1479
01:10:55,106 --> 01:10:56,007
It's just that,

1480
01:10:58,575 --> 01:11:00,044
I really like you,

1481
01:11:00,077 --> 01:11:03,781
and it's not my place to
judge who you have sex with.

1482
01:11:03,814 --> 01:11:05,983
I did not have
sexual with Olivia.

1483
01:11:07,051 --> 01:11:07,919
Oh.

1484
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,854
Why?

1485
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:10,922
I mean,

1486
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:12,857
did it hurt too much when
she laid on top of you

1487
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,491
with her razor blade nipples?

1488
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,761
Okay, yeah, well listen.

1489
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:19,697
That night, got a
little crazy, okay.

1490
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,732
Yeah, we went back to her place.

1491
01:11:21,766 --> 01:11:23,768
Obviously both had
too much to drink,

1492
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,502
things escalated,
,

1493
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:28,906
it was weird.

1494
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,974
I couldn't get it up.

1495
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,877
What?

1496
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:36,479
Yeah, your sympathy for my
situation is overwhelming.

1497
01:11:36,513 --> 01:11:38,082
Sorry, it's just,

1498
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:40,985
I mean a good doctor knows
they have pills for that.

1499
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:42,987
Small, blue.

1500
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,621
Okay, I couldn't get it up

1501
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:47,490
'cause I was thinking of you.

1502
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:49,860
Wow.

1503
01:11:49,894 --> 01:11:50,895
Let me clarify that statement.

1504
01:11:50,928 --> 01:11:51,996
Okay, yeah.

1505
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:53,496
I'd love to see you
walk that one back.

1506
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,066
I couldn't get it
up with her because

1507
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:56,566
I wanted to be with you.

1508
01:11:59,536 --> 01:12:01,038
Because I can, you know.

1509
01:12:02,173 --> 01:12:03,274
I can get it up.

1510
01:12:03,307 --> 01:12:05,076
- Oh.
- Like, I'm talking.

1511
01:12:05,109 --> 01:12:07,044
I can, way up.

1512
01:12:07,078 --> 01:12:08,179
Like, way up.

1513
01:12:08,212 --> 01:12:10,047
Like, up.

1514
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:11,916
I'll take you right in that
closet and rock your world.

1515
01:12:11,949 --> 01:12:13,050
- Oh.
- Right now.

1516
01:12:13,084 --> 01:12:14,051
- Wow.
- I've got a break.

1517
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:14,919
- Well.
- I'm done for the day.

1518
01:12:14,952 --> 01:12:15,820
Okay.

1519
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:17,554
It's a little bad
timing, don't you think?

1520
01:12:17,587 --> 01:12:18,555
I mean, we're 20 yards away

1521
01:12:18,588 --> 01:12:20,024
from where my Dad is recovering

1522
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:22,226
from a sexually
related heart attack.

1523
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:23,626
Not to mention,

1524
01:12:23,661 --> 01:12:24,895
I have to fight a ninja
cheerleader tonight.

1525
01:12:24,929 --> 01:12:26,664
Oh, so you're
gonna fight Olivia?

1526
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:29,100
Yeah.

1527
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:30,134
Yeah.

1528
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:31,002
Yup.

1529
01:12:31,035 --> 01:12:31,836
Yeah, I guess I am.

1530
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,137
All right, well,
at least let me

1531
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,772
give you a ride to the club.

1532
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:39,844
Maybe a little ride in the
closet first though, huh?

1533
01:12:41,746 --> 01:12:46,751
Oh fuck it.

1534
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:55,092
This is the big one ladies!

1535
01:12:55,126 --> 01:12:57,695
One of the most
anticipated match ups

1536
01:12:57,728 --> 01:13:00,664
in the history of our club!

1537
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:03,000
Let's get prepared to rumble!

1538
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:08,906
There is a more common phrase,

1539
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:11,142
but it is federally trademarked!

1540
01:13:11,175 --> 01:13:15,279
All right, let's bring
out our challengee!

1541
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:18,783
Weighing in at a
total skinny bitch,

1542
01:13:18,816 --> 01:13:20,184
she's undefeated!

1543
01:13:20,217 --> 01:13:22,186
It's Olivia Mayhem Miller!

1544
01:13:45,076 --> 01:13:45,943
Boo!

1545
01:13:58,389 --> 01:13:59,690
And our challenger!

1546
01:13:59,723 --> 01:14:00,958
She wanted this fight

1547
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:03,794
for reasons of
temporary insanity!

1548
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:05,830
She is the offspring of our

1549
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:08,265
great founder, Mary Wynncomb!

1550
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:11,669
Give it up for Anna
WildCard Wynncomb!

1551
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,431
This is my music?

1552
01:14:40,464 --> 01:14:42,233
I didn't choose it.

1553
01:14:55,246 --> 01:14:57,948
Just one small step.

1554
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:25,309
Go, go, go, yeah!

1555
01:15:25,342 --> 01:15:27,244
- You can do this!
- Come on!

1556
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:37,354
What
are the odds on Anna?

1557
01:15:37,388 --> 01:15:39,023
1,000 to one?

1558
01:15:39,924 --> 01:15:40,824
I got a dollar for that.

1559
01:15:40,858 --> 01:15:42,359
She ain't gonna win anyway.

1560
01:15:42,393 --> 01:15:43,360
Thank you, girl.

1561
01:15:43,394 --> 01:15:44,361
Fighters, ready!

1562
01:15:46,197 --> 01:15:47,131
And, fight!

1563
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:51,435
You ready to bleed?

1564
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:54,071
Yeah, but not for
like another month!

1565
01:15:54,104 --> 01:15:57,474
This is the wrong
time for a period joke!

1566
01:16:04,148 --> 01:16:05,149
There ya go!

1567
01:16:07,952 --> 01:16:08,819
Yes!

1568
01:16:21,298 --> 01:16:22,866
- Get up!
- Come on!

1569
01:16:29,807 --> 01:16:31,075
Good.

1570
01:16:33,844 --> 01:16:35,412
Okay, watch the neck!

1571
01:16:35,446 --> 01:16:36,981
Come on now, fight!

1572
01:16:38,382 --> 01:16:40,084
Let's go, get up!

1573
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:42,519
Come on, get up, get up!

1574
01:16:42,553 --> 01:16:45,456
Good, you
need to tap out?

1575
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:46,924
Ah, there we go!

1576
01:16:46,957 --> 01:16:48,158
Come on baby!

1577
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:55,299
Crowd: Oh!

1578
01:16:55,332 --> 01:16:56,834
Come on, get up!

1579
01:16:58,135 --> 01:17:00,271
Come on girl, get up, come on!

1580
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:02,773
You good, you good?

1581
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:06,877
Let's go, yeah, yeah!

1582
01:17:27,331 --> 01:17:28,299
Stay down, you don't have
anything left to prove!

1583
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:29,199
Stay down!

1584
01:17:31,468 --> 01:17:34,071
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1585
01:17:38,509 --> 01:17:40,944
You getting
up, you getting up?

1586
01:17:40,978 --> 01:17:41,845
All right.

1587
01:17:53,223 --> 01:17:55,459
Come on Bear, stop the
fight man, this is not right.

1588
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:58,228
Tap out if you need to!

1589
01:17:58,262 --> 01:17:59,296
Tap out.

1590
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:00,531
You good?

1591
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:01,432
Come on!

1592
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,535
Let's go!

1593
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:08,072
- Come on, get up!
- All right.

1594
01:18:08,105 --> 01:18:09,506
Get up!

1595
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,362
Oh!

1596
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:56,987
Anna, stay down!

1597
01:19:03,227 --> 01:19:05,496
Stay down,
everyone knows you're

1598
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:06,964
weak just like your Mom.

1599
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:38,629
If all else
fails, use your head.

1600
01:19:44,568 --> 01:19:46,503
<i>Get up, get up, get up!</i>

1601
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:11,562
- Bear!
- You guys good?

1602
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:12,664
You wanna tap out?

1603
01:20:24,475 --> 01:20:25,509
Did she just knock
this bitch out?

1604
01:20:26,811 --> 01:20:29,446
Whoever gets up
first is the winner!

1605
01:20:32,316 --> 01:20:34,084
Whoever gets up first!

1606
01:20:34,117 --> 01:20:34,985
Come on!

1607
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:38,422
Come on, come on.

1608
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:45,128
Listen
to me, listen to me!

1609
01:20:45,162 --> 01:20:46,463
Come on, get up!

1610
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:48,565
Come on.

1611
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:50,067
Come on.

1612
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:50,802
Get her Bear!

1613
01:20:50,835 --> 01:20:52,369
Winner!

1614
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,707
Girl, I just won $1,000!

1615
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,810
Winner!

1616
01:21:11,723 --> 01:21:13,590
Anna, you okay?

1617
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:14,591
I don't know.

1618
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:16,560
But you should be checking
out her right now.

1619
01:21:16,593 --> 01:21:17,461
Hey!

1620
01:21:18,562 --> 01:21:19,596
I've never been more
attracted to you

1621
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,299
than I am right now!

1622
01:21:22,332 --> 01:21:25,369
I just made $1,000, ting!

1623
01:21:25,402 --> 01:21:26,436
You only bet a dollar on me?

1624
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,572
I didn't have any coin!

1625
01:21:28,605 --> 01:21:32,609
That was the most bad
ass thing I have ever seen.

1626
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:34,712
What the hell were
those head butts?

1627
01:21:36,213 --> 01:21:38,649
I think all the
practicing with Murphy,

1628
01:21:38,683 --> 01:21:41,318
I found out that I
have a really hard.

1629
01:21:41,351 --> 01:21:42,352
Oh shit.

1630
01:21:42,386 --> 01:21:43,620
Ow.

1631
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:44,488
Yeah, it's
like steel in there.

1632
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:45,690
One of
the hardest noggins

1633
01:21:45,723 --> 01:21:46,590
I've ever encountered.

1634
01:21:46,623 --> 01:21:48,258
That hurts, stop!

1635
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:50,862
I can hear clanging in my brain.

1636
01:21:50,895 --> 01:21:51,763
Clanging?

1637
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,164
Oh shit!

1638
01:21:54,197 --> 01:21:55,132
Betty!

1639
01:21:55,165 --> 01:21:56,166
Bitch really did sell us-

1640
01:21:56,199 --> 01:21:57,434
Cops!

1641
01:21:59,704 --> 01:22:00,705
It's game player!

1642
01:22:00,738 --> 01:22:01,673
I'm on it!

1643
01:22:01,706 --> 01:22:02,606
What the hell is going on?

1644
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,241
Well, everybody listen up.

1645
01:22:04,274 --> 01:22:05,777
We're about to get raided.

1646
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:08,145
Bear's unlocking the
door to the way out.

1647
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:09,613
You're gonna go through
a hole in the fence,

1648
01:22:09,646 --> 01:22:11,615
then under the freeway,
you'll be home free!

1649
01:22:11,648 --> 01:22:12,549
Go!

1650
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,184
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1651
01:22:14,217 --> 01:22:15,352
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1652
01:22:15,385 --> 01:22:16,754
Come on, let's go.

1653
01:22:16,788 --> 01:22:18,221
Come on, come on.

1654
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:20,892
Be careful, be careful.

1655
01:22:20,925 --> 01:22:21,793
Come on.

1656
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:27,732
I was sure this was mine.

1657
01:22:27,765 --> 01:22:29,633
But you've become

1658
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:31,501
one hell of a fighter.

1659
01:22:32,336 --> 01:22:36,607
Good job.

1660
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,342
Come on, let's go.

1661
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,209
Earth to Anna!

1662
01:22:39,242 --> 01:22:40,477
Is it always headbutts?

1663
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,579
Come on, girl, there's a
goddamn raid, let's go!

1664
01:22:42,613 --> 01:22:45,148
My Mom built this ship
and now I'm the captain.

1665
01:22:45,182 --> 01:22:46,483
So I'm going down with it.

1666
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:49,286
Okay, well I'm a cop
so I'm gonna scoot out,

1667
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:50,788
but I am so proud
of you tonight.

1668
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:54,792
And I got priors, but
hey, good job captain.

1669
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:56,794
Anna, what are you doing?

1670
01:22:56,828 --> 01:22:57,762
Come on, let's go.

1671
01:22:57,795 --> 01:22:59,529
No, you get out of here.

1672
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:01,264
This is not worth you losing
your medical license, right?

1673
01:23:01,298 --> 01:23:02,767
Even if you are a lousy doctor.

1674
01:23:45,242 --> 01:23:46,811
You have the
right to remain silent.

1675
01:23:46,844 --> 01:23:48,412
Anything you say
can and will be held

1676
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,213
against you in the court of law.

1677
01:23:50,247 --> 01:23:51,515
You have the right
to an attorney.

1678
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:52,717
If you cannot afford one,

1679
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,451
one will be appointed
to represent you.

1680
01:23:54,484 --> 01:23:55,787
Do you understand?

1681
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:09,633
Hey, what are you in for?

1682
01:24:11,969 --> 01:24:13,871
Assault and battery,

1683
01:24:13,905 --> 01:24:17,474
gross negligence,
unlawful assembly,

1684
01:24:17,507 --> 01:24:18,776
disturbing the peace,

1685
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:21,746
and promoting fights
without a license.

1686
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:23,413
I didn't know that existed.

1687
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:25,248
Yeah.

1688
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:26,851
Wynncomb.

1689
01:24:26,884 --> 01:24:28,686
Yeah, present.

1690
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,553
You made bail.

1691
01:24:29,586 --> 01:24:30,454
You're out of here.

1692
01:24:31,923 --> 01:24:32,790
What?

1693
01:24:36,894 --> 01:24:37,829
Fuck.

1694
01:24:37,862 --> 01:24:38,896
Wait.

1695
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:41,431
You?

1696
01:24:41,465 --> 01:24:42,332
Yeah, me.

1697
01:24:44,568 --> 01:24:46,037
Charleen, I know
you don't have

1698
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:47,972
that kind of lazy
cash laying around.

1699
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:49,707
Oh, you're right.

1700
01:24:49,741 --> 01:24:51,475
But everyone pitched in.

1701
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:52,476
Who's everyone?

1702
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:53,711
The girls at the club.

1703
01:24:53,745 --> 01:24:54,779
I passed the hat around

1704
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:57,280
and we had more than
enough to make your bail.

1705
01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:57,949
Wow!

1706
01:24:57,982 --> 01:24:59,483
Don't be so surprised.

1707
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:00,818
You did something that
no one else can do.

1708
01:25:00,852 --> 01:25:02,486
You defeated Olivia.

1709
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:03,855
Ooh, you are Dorothy girl,

1710
01:25:03,888 --> 01:25:07,058
and ding dong the
wicked witch is dead.

1711
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:08,592
No, no, no, not literally.

1712
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:09,827
- Not literally.
- Okay.

1713
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:11,595
She's gonna be in
the hospital for a few days,

1714
01:25:11,628 --> 01:25:13,497
and considering the number
of girls she sent in there,

1715
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:14,932
it is more than fair.

1716
01:25:14,966 --> 01:25:16,566
Yeah.

1717
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,467
Anyways.

1718
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:20,403
It's nice the club went
out on a high note.

1719
01:25:21,605 --> 01:25:23,640
I'm not closing
the club Charleen.

1720
01:25:23,674 --> 01:25:24,608
What?

1721
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:25,977
I got a lot of thinking done

1722
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,912
while I was doing hard
time on the inside.

1723
01:25:27,945 --> 01:25:29,346
You weren't even
in for a night.

1724
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:30,815
And yes, I do
own that property,

1725
01:25:30,848 --> 01:25:33,583
and yes I could do
whatever I want with it,

1726
01:25:33,617 --> 01:25:35,552
but I can't sell the club.

1727
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:36,821
You need the money.

1728
01:25:36,854 --> 01:25:39,056
We all need that space.

1729
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,058
We all need that community.

1730
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:42,459
What are you getting at?

1731
01:25:42,492 --> 01:25:43,861
I'm gonna use the
property as collateral.

1732
01:25:43,895 --> 01:25:45,930
I'm gonna get that
loan, open a new cafe.

1733
01:25:45,963 --> 01:25:49,100
This way the club stays
open, I start a new business,

1734
01:25:49,133 --> 01:25:50,600
it's a win, win, eh?

1735
01:25:50,634 --> 01:25:52,469
Look at you!

1736
01:25:52,502 --> 01:25:54,504
Look how far you've come!

1737
01:25:56,007 --> 01:25:56,874
We did it Mary.

1738
01:25:57,809 --> 01:25:59,076
We did it.

1739
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,978
One small step at a time.

1740
01:26:01,012 --> 01:26:02,113
But first I gotta make
sure I don't spend

1741
01:26:02,146 --> 01:26:04,514
a longer stint in the big
house for all my crimes

1742
01:26:04,548 --> 01:26:05,783
and misdemeanors, you know.

1743
01:26:05,817 --> 01:26:07,517
You're gonna
need a good lawyer.

1744
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:10,087
Define good.

1745
01:26:11,856 --> 01:26:13,423
I'm a divorce lawyer.

1746
01:26:13,456 --> 01:26:14,992
I usually don't
handle criminal cases,

1747
01:26:15,026 --> 01:26:17,662
but I am an excellent lawyer.

1748
01:26:18,963 --> 01:26:20,932
He's excellent at everything.

1749
01:26:20,965 --> 01:26:21,866
- Geez, Dad.
- Ooh.

1750
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:24,101
Keep it in your pants.

1751
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:26,938
And while I'm in jail,
you keep it in your pants.

1752
01:26:26,971 --> 01:26:28,940
If it does go to trial, how
much time is she looking at?

1753
01:26:28,973 --> 01:26:31,709
Well, if she's
guilty on all charges,

1754
01:26:31,742 --> 01:26:32,777
probably two years.

1755
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,678
Oh no.

1756
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:36,781
Maybe I should
just plead guilty.

1757
01:26:36,814 --> 01:26:37,849
Why would you do that?

1758
01:26:37,882 --> 01:26:38,883
Because I am guilty.

1759
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:39,851
Shh!

1760
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:41,451
And you told me that
the judge would show

1761
01:26:41,484 --> 01:26:42,854
leniency if I was honest.

1762
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:44,055
Well most of them would,

1763
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:46,958
but I hear our judge
is a real ball breaker.

1764
01:26:46,991 --> 01:26:49,894
So our best bet is to
take this to a jury.

1765
01:26:51,028 --> 01:26:51,929
Yeah, but you know,

1766
01:26:51,963 --> 01:26:53,698
sometimes in life you
just need to stand up

1767
01:26:53,731 --> 01:26:56,000
and take responsibility
for your actions.

1768
01:26:56,033 --> 01:26:58,002
And today is my day
to do just that.

1769
01:26:58,035 --> 01:27:01,605
All rise!

1770
01:27:02,773 --> 01:27:04,141
The Honorable Judge
Andrews presiding.

1771
01:27:06,744 --> 01:27:08,079
She's gonna eat us alive.

1772
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:13,617
Please be seated.

1773
01:27:17,054 --> 01:27:18,089
What is wrong with you?

1774
01:27:20,992 --> 01:27:21,959
Wow.

1775
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:24,795
I always secretly hope
for interesting cases,

1776
01:27:24,829 --> 01:27:27,497
and it looks like I got my wish.

1777
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,934
As my old friend,
Mary would say,

1778
01:27:29,967 --> 01:27:31,434
if life isn't interesting,

1779
01:27:31,468 --> 01:27:33,503
then you're just not
trying hard enough.

1780
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,107
Chuck, you know all that shit

1781
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,175
I said about taking
responsibility for my actions?

1782
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:39,043
Uh-huh.

1783
01:27:39,076 --> 01:27:40,845
Today is not the day.

1784
01:27:40,878 --> 01:27:44,081
Counselor, how
does your client plead?

1785
01:27:45,049 --> 01:27:46,083
Not guilty.

1786
01:27:48,686 --> 01:27:49,586
Counselor?

1787
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,689
Not guilty.

1788
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:06,170
Anna, this is incredible!

1789
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:07,204
We didn't have
this many customers

1790
01:28:07,238 --> 01:28:09,006
in a month at the old place.

1791
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:09,941
I know.

1792
01:28:09,974 --> 01:28:11,208
We've got happy customers.

1793
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:13,210
We've got money in
the cash register.

1794
01:28:13,244 --> 01:28:14,946
- Which is very unnatural.
- Yeah.

1795
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:16,948
But I think
I can get used to it.

1796
01:28:16,981 --> 01:28:18,015
You ready to go?

1797
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:18,950
Yeah!

1798
01:28:18,983 --> 01:28:19,850
Oh, will you cover for me?

1799
01:28:19,884 --> 01:28:20,718
Absolutely.

1800
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:21,752
Go get 'em tiger.

1801
01:28:24,654 --> 01:28:27,158
Oh, hey, don't forget
those handcuffs.

1802
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:30,194
Always got 'em on
my belt baby girl.

1803
01:28:32,797 --> 01:28:33,998
What?

1804
01:28:34,031 --> 01:28:35,066
I told you I was
going to have her.

1805
01:28:36,566 --> 01:28:37,969
And you know what I
said about my tongue

1806
01:28:38,002 --> 01:28:39,770
setting her pubes aflame?

1807
01:28:39,804 --> 01:28:40,637
Stop.

1808
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:41,538
Didn't happen.

1809
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:42,807
'Cause she doesn't have any!

1810
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,208
- Okay, stop!
- Ha ha!

1811
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:45,977
Fresh as
a daisy down there!

1812
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:47,778
- Smooth, smooth!
- Stop.

1813
01:28:47,812 --> 01:28:49,146
I am
begging you to stop.

1814
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,513
Like a hairless cat!

1815
01:28:51,682 --> 01:28:52,683
I think I'm in love.

1816
01:29:15,572 --> 01:29:17,308
Let's get prepared to rumble!

1817
01:29:21,145 --> 01:29:22,146
All right!

1818
01:29:24,949 --> 01:29:26,649
I love the new club, Anna.

1819
01:29:26,684 --> 01:29:29,053
The vibe is really awesome!

1820
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:30,154
Thank you!

1821
01:29:31,088 --> 01:29:32,757
Well done, Anna.

1822
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:34,792
Whoa, that was...

1823
01:29:34,825 --> 01:29:35,760
What?

1824
01:29:35,793 --> 01:29:37,128
Where are you from?

1825
01:29:37,161 --> 01:29:38,829
People have always
tried to define me

1826
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:40,231
by pinpointing where I'm from.

1827
01:29:40,264 --> 01:29:42,632
I thought it shouldn't
matter, but it got to me.

1828
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:45,069
So I learned eight
different languages,

1829
01:29:45,102 --> 01:29:47,138
and now I'm from everywhere.

1830
01:29:54,145 --> 01:29:56,113
These look like your size.

1831
01:29:56,147 --> 01:29:57,348
Better than tape,
that's for sure.

1832
01:29:57,381 --> 01:29:59,216
Oh, I got plans for the tape.

1833
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,353
Oh, is that an illusion to
a future sexual encounter?

1834
01:30:02,386 --> 01:30:03,988
Actually, no, I'm really
into arts and crafts,

1835
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:05,656
but I like the way you think.

1836
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:07,058
Yo Anna!

1837
01:30:07,091 --> 01:30:08,225
Get your ass in the ring.

1838
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,128
I gotta go get
my ass in the ring.

1839
01:30:11,162 --> 01:30:13,630
All right, well I'm
gonna watch it all the way.

1840
01:30:18,903 --> 01:30:21,238
Are you sure you
two wanna do this?

1841
01:30:21,272 --> 01:30:23,040
Oh hell yeah.

1842
01:30:23,074 --> 01:30:25,042
I've always wanted to
punch her in the face.

1843
01:30:25,076 --> 01:30:26,811
Who says dreams don't come true?

1844
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:29,180
Having a doctor for
boyfriend is gonna

1845
01:30:29,213 --> 01:30:30,848
be real useful in a few seconds.

1846
01:30:30,881 --> 01:30:32,049
Already has been.

1847
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:33,851
He gave me a breast
exam last night.

1848
01:30:33,884 --> 01:30:34,885
Sure didn't take very long

1849
01:30:34,919 --> 01:30:36,220
because you've got tiny titties.

1850
01:30:37,188 --> 01:30:38,823
Okay, I got no comeback.

1851
01:30:38,856 --> 01:30:43,060
but all I wanna say is
thank you, for everything.

1852
01:30:43,094 --> 01:30:44,295
You turned my life around.

1853
01:30:44,328 --> 01:30:46,097
You turned your
life around friend.

1854
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:48,332
I just gave you a nudge
in the right direction.

1855
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:50,034
All right, this is
getting too sentimental.

1856
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:51,235
When do we get to
hit each other?

1857
01:30:51,268 --> 01:30:52,303
Bring it on!

1858
01:30:52,336 --> 01:30:55,039
Back up, back up,
back up fighters!

1859
01:30:55,072 --> 01:30:55,940
And,

1860
01:30:58,409 --> 01:30:59,076
fight!

1861
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,025
- Ah, that fucking hurt!
- Plastic surgeon!

1862
01:31:15,059 --> 01:31:16,894
I need
a plastic surgeon!

1863
01:31:16,927 --> 01:31:18,028
Roy!

1864
01:31:42,353 --> 01:31:44,188
Hey, yeah, I'm great.

1865
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:46,223
I'm just here to
pay up Murphy's tab.

1866
01:31:47,224 --> 01:31:48,659
How much does he owe you?

1867
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:00,971
What the-

1868
01:32:02,173 --> 01:32:04,041
<i>I'm not afraid
of you Cobra Kai.</i>

1869
01:32:05,242 --> 01:32:08,279
<i>I'm gonna
hurt you, so badly.</i>

1870
01:32:08,312 --> 01:32:09,780
<i>You see how
fast I was with my tongue?</i>

1871
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:13,150
<i>I'm a lousy
doctor anyway.</i>

1872
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,285
<i>I was drunk half the time.</i>

1873
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:17,254
<i>Woof.</i>

1874
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:20,824
<i>Oh my God!</i>

1875
01:32:26,931 --> 01:32:28,132
<i>Please be seated.</i>

1876
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:31,235
<i>To the
center, Fighters!</i>

1877
01:32:32,937 --> 01:32:34,205
<i>A Fight Club?</i>

1878
01:32:35,973 --> 01:32:37,374
<i>Another drink?</i>

1879
01:32:37,408 --> 01:32:39,476
<i>You better get
used to disappointment bitch.</i>

1880
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:41,078
<i>Really awesome!</i>

1881
01:32:41,111 --> 01:32:42,813
<i>Never do back down.</i>

1882
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:15,159

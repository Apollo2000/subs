{1394}{1482}It's strange that he never ask for me
{1484}{1549}I only give him honey
{1551}{1635}No matter when to use
{1640}{1772}I flied to his lips|millions of time like a bee
{1774}{1892}Because to me, even chocolate candy cannot|compare to his sweetness

{6654}{6722}- Hans...|- Don't forget our slogans are everywhere
{6724}{6789}Hans, before we have any new envelopes|we can hide the rest under the board
{6791}{6853}No need. There is nothing left.|Lack of paper
{6855}{6941}It's already pretty dangerous|to write slogans on walls at night
{6955}{7044}But compare with giving out flyers at|campus in the day time... Do you want to die?
{7046}{7124}We have to make our best efforts, cannot|wait anymore Let's bring along the whole city!

{7689}{7752}- It's too dangerous!|- Willi...
{7769}{7822}I will take all the responsibility|if anything happens.
{7859}{7892}Won't embroil others

{8046}{8081}Let's me take this
{8132}{8180}Hans, I don't think|we should embroil Sophie in this...
{8182}{8249}If we were to be checked,|it would be easier for a woman to pass
{8315}{8355}She is right
{8416}{8487}Alright, let's go
{8809}{8854}Alex, meet me in my place at twelve tomorrow

{30443}{30495}the fly sheets were on the marble handrail
{30505}{30568}I spreaded them casually|when I was passing by

{35057}{35119}as for the big ones,|no one is needed for washing yet

{56933}{57032}- but you believe this kind of world order|- I don't care about politics, and I won't
{57083}{57151}anyway, we compared all those writing,|and all those bullshit
{57154}{57232}are done by this typewriter,|then at the beginning of this month,
{57235}{57335}they are sent to different addresses,|include Munich
{57354}{57401}I have no idea about this
{57634}{57703}sit there!|watch it!
{58168}{58247}all those bullshit were from your|brother's place and your were there
{58250}{58297}and he was planning to destroy all those bills
{58534}{58582}Have you seen those paper before?
{58615}{58702}- No|- keep your lie, but read this for me.
{58802}{58887}"two hundred thousands German died...
{58889}{58977}- just for one war opportunist"|- Does this remind you something?
{58979}{59075}Is it similar to other six handbills?
{59105}{59145}Take look at the handwriting
{59181}{59246}- I don't know|- Listen to me!
{59271}{59348}this part of evil speaking comes from|a guy named Christoph Probst
{59351}{59440}He is a friend of your at Innsbruck.|We found his letter.
{59443}{59490}Exactly same handwriting!
{59534}{59634}Probst is also a student in astrology
{59697}{59821}love family and mountains of motherland.
{59824}{59953}An other do oneself proud bastard|Never understand people are dying at battlefront.
{60068}{60123}who is in, beside you,|your brother and that Christoph Probst.
{60125}{60187}- who did those bills?|- please stop slandering me?
{60190}{60279}You held back all those evidence from your home
{60282}{60375}Even I asked you to give me the truth
{60378}{60426}I just admit what I really did
{60603}{60701}how about listen this,|your brother, was just like you,
{60716}{60773}how to explain those evidence
{60854}{60920}"the military plan failed at eastern line...
{60923}{61007}U.S.A and British military force|increased unpredictability.
{61010}{61103}I concluded that we could not win this war
{61106}{61215}after painfully thinking in long time...
{61218}{61308}I believe that avoiding|the meaningless death...
{61311}{61426}and keeping the integrality of Europe
{61429}{61556}the only way is finish the war|as soon as possible, in the other hand,...
{61559}{61665}I also have deep fear about the way we treat|the occupation area and people in the area"
{61715}{61808}that is just his political point,|not exculpation to your slander
{61811}{61838}this is...
{61866}{61936}...disorganizing army|and betraying our country!
{61984}{62042}I don't believe my brother said that!
{62045}{62149}So you think your brother was lying to us?
{62152}{62216}Before my brother talk to me personally,
{62218}{62261}I won't believe that he said those
{62277}{62358}Eickemayer Studio|you heard about it?

{63763}{63817}you lived with your brother
{63819}{63914}you were all in the hallway this morning
{63917}{63999}and you still want me believe|that you have nothing to do with this?

{64407}{64474}YES! and I am proud of it!
{64664}{64722}what will happen to me and my brother?
{64725}{64798}You should think about|this at beginning Miss Scholl
{64854}{64937}- Our relative will be embroiled?|- I can't decide it
{65071}{65159}- I have to go to washroom|- Not now!
{65171}{65223}Who draft out these?
{65249}{65330}- Me!|- You are lying Miss Scholl! Just few weeks ago...
{65333}{65393}we did the writing check
{65396}{65493}from the report,|we are sure they are from a male.

{70069}{70131}tell Alex don't wait for me"
{70181}{70233}Schertling was right there
{70236}{70320}He was telling Schmorell to run away?
{70327}{70414}Hans had a appointment with Schmid,|he didn't want him wait for nothing.
{70417}{70507}- You mentioned about your plan to Schmorell?|- No
{70543}{70611}- and Graf?|- No
{70921}{71021}- why are you keep lying?|- I did not

{73971}{74077}is what Germany needs|but we have to re-educate them
{74109}{74180}Maybe they will try to|rebuild your world view
{74285}{74370}but I will tell you, they may just wait
{74379}{74477}- why?|- even the bosses are impatience
{74480}{74545}a lot people think allied forces will|get into Germany in eight to ten weeks
{74548}{74627}after that sooner or later,|Germany will be liberated
{74812}{74905}If my mother know I am under arrest
{74938}{74997}She won't stand the shock
{75016}{75130}She is over 60,|and she is sick all the month

{75317}{75380}she my get in jail cause us...
{75443}{75467}and your father?
{75470}{75589}He is 10 years younger than my mom,|he always bring us the immaterial power
{75629}{75674}your mom is not alone.
{76829}{76862}Thanks
{76940}{77006}"we are not silence,|we are the forgotten conscience
{77009}{77071}White roses let you cannot sleep in peace!"
{77099}{77175}- Who are "us"?|- My brother wrote this.
{77178}{77262}at the last line of 4th handbill,|"please copy...
{77265}{77363}and pass around",|and here is about resist movement
{77392}{77481}- doesn't sound like couple peoples' crime|- We don't have organization
{77489}{77529}How much you know about Willi Graf?
{77532}{77635}Sergeant he has same major as my brother|came to our house sometimes.
{77642}{77741}we knew he helped you guys|copying the handbills at the studio
{77748}{77793}Maybe you found his fingerprint
{77796}{77869}- but he went to studio at other time.|- When?
{77872}{77951}Middle of January,|We were going to see Eickemayer' painting
{77954}{78010}that's the reason why|others' fingerprints are in studio
{78013}{78114}- who were there? Schmorell?|- Maybe, I don't know
{78117}{78194}I was just there at beginning,|then I went to concern
{78227}{78324}- Probst brought handbills to Salzburg and Linz?|- No
{78327}{78431}Hans didn't tell him anything,|cause he has wife and three children
{78450}{78550}here, you have to tell me the damn truth,|I am asking you.
{78553}{78628}Who is in?
{78885}{78930}Graf Anneliese?
{78948}{79024}I totally met them about 10 times.
{79027}{79126}- what did you talk about?|- about lecture and science
{79135}{79221}- My impression of Graf is that he has no interested in politics|- no interested but knew the inside?
{79234}{79331}I have to say Graf has nothing|to do with the handbills
{79334}{79408}- how about Schertling?|- Gisela met me several times.
{79411}{79506}we studied in same university,|and we knew each other before that.
{79509}{79624}- she is NSDAP|- as your saying Miss Scholl
{79627}{79724}The member of resist movement is everywhere in Germany|they all look like have no interested in politics
{79762}{79821}It is good for your, isn't it? Mr. Mohr
{80417}{80482}As our counting,|this so called "white rose"...
{80485}{80559}bought ten thousand papers in Jan...
{80561}{80627}and two thousand envelops
{80630}{80702}- who did that?|- my brother and I
{80704}{80749}only hundreds of handbills|for the 1st to 4th.
{80762}{80842}it makes sense.
{80845}{80910}But you wish I believe you two
{80913}{80985}copied thousands of handbills|for the 5 and 6th edition?
{80988}{81098}- then sent them out?|- we worked on them day and night.
{81108}{81228}I admire you and you take class|at the same time?
{81251}{81372}yes we were faking|there are lots of members
{81503}{81584}we knew your brother Graf Schmorell
{81599}{81663}Furtw?ngler and Wittenstein served|at eastern line before.
{81666}{81729}all the people got in university in Munich
{81750}{81834}any political movement between them?
{81860}{81924}My brother just told me|about innumerable death.
{81927}{82015}- but never talked about his comrade|- I don't believe you Miss Scholl
{82018}{82122}At this period, everyone is careful|about their political speech.
{82141}{82195}Just like what you say in the handbill?
{82265}{82313}you found these address there?
{82316}{82385}copy from phonebook of German museum
{82514}{82654}let's take a look at Stuttgart:|Jan 27th and the morning after, totally...
{82657}{82733}sent out seven hundred handbills!
{82736}{82805}same day at Munich...
{82808}{82886}about two thousands handbills were sent out.
{82889}{82982}Just you and your brother|cannot done this job!
{82987}{83081}I took the fast train|to Stuttgart at 27th...
{83089}{83173}handbills were in a case,|when I arrived...
{83175}{83258}I threw half of them|into the post-box of station.
{83260}{83319}all the left I put|into the post-box at country side
{83322}{83427}your brother couldn't be|at Munich in Jan 20th...
{83430}{83497}when we found the addresses from phonebook...
{83500}{83603}he sent out an other two thousand handbill|in different place? who was helping him?
{83615}{83670}I wasn't at Munich
{83712}{83779}who support you money?
{83782}{83852}my father gave me one fifty each month.
{83857}{83912}my brother has pay from army
{83915}{84022}How can you afford your life and|all the handbills and postage?
{84085}{84182}every time you trip to Ulm,|it took you 15 mark
{84184}{84269}- we borrowed some money from friends|- from who?
{84489}{84563}here, up left corner...
{84580}{84645}"E" must stand for income
{84648}{84759}- it is the backer's name after amount?|- Yes
{84761}{84814}your fiancי were in?
{84992}{85044}- so he knew it!|- No!
{85064}{85129}every time we borrow,|we give a pretence.
{85132}{85187}you can ask everyone
{85252}{85321}my brother and I are the only members
{85456}{85538}have you thought about|if you and your brother
{85541}{85586}assume all the crime,|what will happen to you?
{85763}{85815}We know every name!
{85930}{86015}Miss Scholl, think about it|and cooperate with us!
{86032}{86095}we will reconsider your punishment
{86106}{86197}think about your poor parents|and the shame you brought to them
{86200}{86294}so, right now you want me...
{86297}{86385}to sell out your so called partisan|for my own good
{86406}{86489}exposure criminal is not sellout
{86496}{86564}my brother's classmate|has nothing to do with this
{86729}{86759}Launa
{86865}{86895}take her away
{87201}{87249}I am very worried about Fritz
{87279}{87344}how could I write her name in my note?
{87388}{87466}- he was sold out?|- absolutely not
{87469}{87558}- he really has not found anything?|- nothing at all
{87593}{87671}his loyalty is just like a solider|keeps his oath to Hitler
{87704}{87799}and we had fights for this many times|I am always against supporting the front line
{87802}{87892}because this will prolong the war|and it makes him angry
{87930}{88031}- is he in Stalingrad too?|- he used to be there
{88061}{88147}luckily, he was transferred to Lemberg|as the last group
{88166}{88296}he lived in Lazaret|Doc cut off two of his fingers
{88326}{88393}because he and his people had lain in|frozen open air all day and all night
{88396}{88462}for several weeks in 30¡דF
{88465}{88569}I really hope he can survive from the war,|while not become its victim
{88601}{88671}what will happen|if Fritz knows you were here?
{88688}{88741}he shall understand me
{89021}{89056}hope so
{89091}{89143}what does he look like?
{89188}{89249}tall, brown hair
{89294}{89337}a free elf
{89361}{89426}and he can always make me laugh
{89463}{89583}love, this unconditional love,|is so amazing
{89619}{89676}when was the last time you saw him?
{89747}{89882}last summer,|we were in Karolinensiel of Nordsee
{89893}{89986}early morning, we sailed out
{90026}{90093}and went to the beach|by bike together in the evening
{90128}{90230}singing, chat and talk about peace at night
{90258}{90378}no solider, no plane and no bomb
{90431}{90507}only the sea and sky
{90568}{90620}sea breeze and our dreams
{92050}{92142}dear God, what can I do besides confiding you
{92157}{92240}there is nothing I can do|but to leave you my own heart
{92260}{92359}you create us,|and our hearts are so tense
{92362}{92415}only to be with you,|I shall find peace inside
{92450}{92484}Amon
{92968}{93013}here you are, drink it
{93398}{93447}it's the coffee|made by authentic coffee bean
{93479}{93579}for you, Miss Scholl, this also means|the happiness of Deutschland, right?
{93613}{93696}- yes|- and you are not like Elser
{93698}{93760}put bomb in B¨¹rgerbrukeller in Munich 1939
{93763}{93891}although you chose the wrong slogan|you made a peaceful way
{93968}{94026}so why do you guys want to punish me anyway?
{94028}{94126}because of the law!|no law, no order!
{94129}{94224}the law you referring used|to defend people's liberty of speech
{94227}{94309}before Hitler took power in 1933|but now, under his government
{94312}{94436}people who deliver free speech are treated by heavy penalty|or death and does order have anything to do with this?
{94448}{94513}if we don't abide by the law|what else should we abide?
{94516}{94597}- abide by the law, no matter whose law it is|- that depends on your conscience
{94631}{94666}what?
{94723}{94792}this is the law|this is the people
{94796}{94873}I, as a police officer am amenable to check|whether people's behavior matches the law
{94876}{94918}and if it doesn't
{94949}{95027}- I have to figure out where the problem is|- law can be changed
{95030}{95105}- conscience won't|- what if everyone...
{95108}{95187}judge right and wrong by his conscience|what result would it become?
{95190}{95263}and what if the criminals succeed in dropping|the reins of government what will it be?
{95266}{95350}unavoidably, there will be serious chaos|and those so called freethinking
{95353}{95426}federation, democracy, we used to have
{95428}{95474}we know where that will lead us to
{95477}{95568}everyone will regain his right and order|if there is no Hitler, his party and...
{95576}{95668}protect to autocratic personal rejection|not just protect people going with the stream
{95686}{95729}autocratic, main stream
{95732}{95805}- you are just disdainful|- no, you are
{95808}{95887}you consider my brother and me as criminals|just because of those sheets
{95893}{95972}although we've done nothing then|only words tried to convince you
{95979}{96092}you have privilege,|you and your relatives use this privilege shamefully
{96095}{96159}you can use our money|for college during wartime
{96162}{96239}with damn democracy,|all I've learned is slaughter
{96242}{96312}do you know who made me become a policeman?|French who occupied Pfalz
{96315}{96401}not German democracy,|if there wasn't this campaign
{96404}{96465}I was still a policeman|in the countryside of Pirmasens today
{96516}{96626}shameful Versailles Treaty,|inflation, unemployment
{96628}{96720}Economic crisis, our leader Adolf Hitler|swept off all of this
{96723}{96778}and also lead Germany to a doomed war
{96781}{96863}- it's free of charge for all of the Victims|- in this heroically war
{96871}{96937}you and us that you disdain and fight against
{96940}{96983}both feed ourselves
{96986}{97051}no matter what happens|you live a better life than we do
{97066}{97183}you absolutely have no need to do so|actually you still said that
{97186}{97245}our leader and Deutschland are protecting you
{97248}{97340}among this, in Wittelsbacher Palais|or my family with background
{97343}{97415}our German soldiers are liberating Europe from|money-supremacy and
{97418}{97511}Bolschewisten,|and for a wider and free Germany
{97514}{97591}Germany's territory will not be occupied|you have my words
{97594}{97659}at the end of the war|foreign troops will garrison
{97662}{97755}people will point at us|saying we didn't fight against Hitler
{97767}{97833}if we win out at last
{97835}{97905}after bleeding and sacrifice German people|will live a richer and free life as your dream
{97908}{98003}and at that moment, as a member of BDM|what will you say?
{98046}{98125}German people don't have that belief any more|while under Hitler's rule
{98148}{98214}If it really come true,|should I say this?
{98288}{98352}- Are you a prophet?|- Yes
{98377}{98438}Even the Church is asking|the disciples to follow their lead.
{98441}{98519}- Even in  despair|- In Church, everyone is free
{98535}{98615}But Hitler and Nazis|will not give them other choices
{98648}{98762}Why a young person like you will take|this kind of risks for these wrong ideas
{98921}{98974}For my own conscience
{99046}{99090}I don't understand, with your talent
{99093}{99163}you can't understand and feel right|about National Socialist German
{99181}{99237}Freedom, Honor, Wealth
{99240}{99329}A morally responsible country,|this is our faith
{99335}{99411}Nazi in the name of freedom and honor
{99413}{99478}Bloodshed the entire Europe
{99481}{99523}Even this can not wake you up?
{99594}{99656}If the German youth can not finally relieves Hitler from|his power and help together make a new, better Europe
{99659}{99751}then Germany will always be a shameful name
{99760}{99840}New Europe only can|be the national socialism nature
{99843}{99902}If your leader is a lunatic
{99916}{99997}Think about national hatred! at Ulm
{100000}{100102}A Jew teacher was brought before SA-Gruppe
{100126}{100213}Everyone was ordered to walk|in front of him and spit on his face
{100248}{100368}At that night, he is gone.|Disappeared like thousands disappeared in 1941
{100370}{100427}forced to the eastern frontline
{100434}{100536}You believe these bullshits?|The Jews moved away themselves
{100539}{100617}Soldiers from eastern frontline were already|talking about slaughters in the concentration camp

{100926}{101013}are only a young girl has been misled|by wrong teaching
{101016}{101123}Probably it's our own fault I feel someone like|you should be a member of our Bund deutsche Maedel
{101130}{101179}You known, when I learned
{101182}{101313}Nazis are killing mentally impaired children|with poison gas, how shocked was I?
{101325}{101424}My mom's friends has described to me|how the children from Church Welfare program were taken from the caretakers
{101427}{101512}Taken away by trucks
{101541}{101623}The kids were asking|"Where does the truck go?"
{101641}{101729}"Going to heaven" Caretakers answers
{101739}{101824}So the kids got on the truck and singing.
{101829}{101918}I have the same feelings like them.|You think I am not taught well?
{101984}{102117}These are invaluable lives|You have heard from the caretakers
{102122}{102197}They have mental patients.
{102213}{102305}Yes, I clearly know|under any circumstances,

{102407}{102492}Nobody knows, what the soul|of a mental patient is like?
{102504}{102583}nobody knows, that innate,|incredibly mature existence without body
{102586}{102638}every life has it's value
{102710}{102804}You must get used to this coming new age
{102835}{102917}What you have said is not reality

{103065}{103158}- Relate to Moral God|- God doesn't exist
{103711}{103858}You believe what your brother did is right?
{103861}{103993}You are just an accomplice|It's not like that?
{104005}{104068}Should we write down like this

{105832}{105950}You must face severest punishment.
{105983}{106040}but in my eyes
{106050}{106145}confession is not equal to betrayal
{106152}{106249}Maybe like this,|I rather say. Not mine
{106251}{106316}but your world view is flawed
{106318}{106416}Like before, same viewpoint|I have done what is right for my people

{131778}{131873}giving out 4 "white rose" leaflets
{131876}{131978}to spread the negative rumor that German|will one day be defeated in the war

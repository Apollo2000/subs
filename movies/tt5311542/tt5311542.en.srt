2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,671
Modern Art.

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,831
ladies and Gentlemen.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,958
Until the seizure of power
by the National Socialists
.

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,319
There has been such
modern art in Germany.
.

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,151
so that means, as it already
is in the nature of this word,
.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,715
almost every year a different one.

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,556
National Socialist Germany
wants a German art again,
.

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,711
around this so....

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,158
like all the creative values of a
people, be an eternal one.
.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,233
but if it lacks such an
eternal value for our people,
.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,394
then it is without merit today.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,191
The German woman is mocked
and equated with prostitutes.
.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,074
The soldier is called murderer
and a senseless sacrifice
.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,393
represented in the sense of
a Bolshevik class struggle.
.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,518
the people should have a
deeply rooted respect
.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,751
for the soldier's bravery

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,911
and not be cast like this..

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,398
And insanity, mental
illness, becomes a principle.
.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,631
it must be accepted,

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,680
that there are men who are the
present-day figures of our people
.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,429
only to see them as degenerate cretins?

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,150
the fundamental 
meadows blue, sky green
.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,676
clouds are sulfur yellow
and so is the weather
.

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,119
or, as you might say, "experience"?
.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,476
there are only two options.

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,678
either these so-called artists

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,831
really see things like that

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,913
and therefore believe
in what they represent.
.

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,472
The answer would be: to subcribe
'whether by looking or by accident'
.

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,270
or through heredity this has come about.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,434
a case deeply regrettable
for these unhappy ones,
.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,036
in the second important task for
the Reich Ministry of Interior,
.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,159
which would then have the task,
at least one more inheritance
.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,871
to prevent such gruesome
visual disturbances.
.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,271
or they themselves do not believe
in the reality of these impressions,
.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,235
but try for other reasons,

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,876
to burden the nation
with this humbug.
.

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,876
then such an offense falls into
the field of criminal justice.
.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,954
What does this have to do with art?
How does it lift the soul?
.

41
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,280
What does this have to do with being able?
Because "art" comes from "can".
.

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,635
-I think you could paint this too.

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,112
Yes, my boy, you could. 
try it.
.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,636
And when you're done,
you ask your parents,
.

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,269
if they will give you a penny for it.

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,030


47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,637
do you know what they paid 
Mr Wassily Kandinsky for that?
.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,837
- 2000 marks.
- (Man,softly) What?
.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,550
more than the annual
salary of a German worker.
.

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,917
What does your dad do?

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,357
- He's out of work right now..

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,398
2000 marks from taxpayers of
the working German population.
.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,589
We will see to it that the people...

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,235


55
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,918
Maybe I do not want
to become a painter.
.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,636
Do not tell
anyone, but I like it.
.

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,273


58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,359
Aunt Elisabeth,
did you see how they looked at you?
.

59
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,512
no one will have eyes
for me on Monday.
.

60
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,149
since everyone will cheer only for Hitler.

61
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,918
- Good afternoon.
- I think you're better than Hitler.
.

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,592
- Hello.
- Good afternoon. A trip with your nephew?
.

63
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,274
- Thank you.

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,673
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.
.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,359


66
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,478
Over There, there was our apartment

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,359
What do you miss most about Dresden?

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,839
sometimes it helps to name it exactly.

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,430
I know who you miss.

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,035
the girl with the fiery red pigtails.

71
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,070
What's her name again?  Johanna?

72
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,716
- Johanna, right? Your lover?
- Mhm.
.

73
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,996
- No 
- not just Johanna.
.

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,794
- who else do you miss?
- the Schrdders.
.

75
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,070
you know?

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,039
- the old couple in our house.
- Mm.
.

77
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,159
the ones who always hold hands.
like little kids.
.

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,597
I like them.  and the dachshund Thilo.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,316
whenever I called
him, he came to me.
.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,830
There are only 45 kilometers
from us to Dresden.
.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,879
you can visit them
as often as you want.
.

82
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,239
Hm?

83
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,593
of course you are right.
Dresden is simply unbeatable.
.

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,990

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,039
You know what?

86
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,433
I think your father is very strong. 
that he does not join the party.
.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,478
a signature,

88
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,838
and he could take his place as a
teacher and keep the apartment.
.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,072
Dad thinks it is criminal,
how the Nazis...
.

90
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,112
shh, shh, I know.

91
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,794
So you do not talk to anyone
else about this, right?
.

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,232
Mum says she will
still get him to join.
.

93
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,552
the membership is then his capitol.

94
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,233
his capital.

95
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,955
- goodbye, Miss May.
- goodbye.
.

96
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,278
Hold this for a moment

97
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Aunt Elisabeth,
have you forgotten something '?
.

98
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,996
(Man) Hey, Eddie.
There is little May again.
.

99
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,029
- (Eddie) Let's do her the favor.
- Karl, ready?
.

100
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,556
- (Karl) Good.
- (Eddie) At the same time.
.

101
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,879
- (Man) Good, on three.  
- One, two, three.
.

102
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,598

103
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,274

104
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,840

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,111

106
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,836

107
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,756

108
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,197

109
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,198
(Man) Take care.

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,399
Thank you.

111
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,239
To paint a picture that feels like this...

112
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,075
that's what they're trying to do,
these degenerate artists.
.

113
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,513
(Woman) Oh Elisabeth, late again.
And how you look!
.

114
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,229
(Officer) Chest out.  Chin up.

115
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,034
You.

116
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,072
first row.  Come over.

117
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,590
you will hand him the bouquet.

118
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,397
(distant crowd, cheering) Heil!  Heil!

119
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,751

120
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,672
Heil! Heil!

121
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,400
Heil! Heil! Heil!

122
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,511
Heil! Heil!

123
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,149
Heil! Heil! Heil!

124
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,795

125
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,309

126
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,831

127
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,795

128
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,600

129
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,552

130
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,431
(Elisabeth) Do not look away.

131
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,557
Never look away, Kurt.

132
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,312
everything that is true is already true.

133
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,151

134
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,957

135
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,751

136
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,233

137
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,198
This sound...

138
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,194
this is the whole power of music.

139
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,398
of life.
of the whole universe.
.

140
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,029

141
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,919
people are looking for the cosmic formula.

142
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,317
but here it is.

143
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,909
here.

144
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,878

145
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,519
do you hear that?

146
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,472
the two-line A, at the May's Bluthner piano in Grossschonau.

147
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,519

148
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,751
and now that I know it...

149
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,796
I can play it anywhere.

150
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,393
on the table.

151
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,393
do you hear?

152
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,191
even on my head.

153
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,475

154
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,837
- Aunt Elisabeth, you are bleeding.
- even on my head.
.

155
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,678
Elisabeth.

156
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,400
what are you doing?

157
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,990
a concert for the Fuhrer.

158
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,191
Youth Mania?
that sounds almost sympathetic.
.

159
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,359
(Elisabeth) "Schizophrenia", "Youth Mania".
I can hear that.
.

160
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,797
I think it's nothing

161
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,759
that a little time out
could not heal.
.

162
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,276
- A little time out...
- In an institution, yes.
.

163
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,319
can't we do it at home?

164
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,270
she studied very hard for her high school diploma,
and went straight into bilingual education..
.

165
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,635
(Doctor) Elisabeth?

166
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,518
maybe she's just overexerted..

167
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,117
Is that your wife?

168
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,837
you can't stand her, can you?
that's what I see in the way you stand there.
.

169
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,071
(Mother,) Elisabeth.

170
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,198
wait outside until we
have finished the interview.
.

171
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,357
I will not ask again.

172
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,956

173
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,114
since schizophrenia is
hereditary, I am obliged to ask:
.

174
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,035
are there any other cases of
mental illness in her family?
.

175
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,555
for God's sake, no.

176
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,836
- depression ?
- we are all happy.
.

177
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,357
we doctors are the watchmen on
the bank of the hereditary stream.
.

178
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,029
I have to report this to the health department.

179
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,433
the decision on admission
may not be up to you.
.

180
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,592
Dr. Michaelis...

181
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,595
Franz.

182
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,832
I know your parents.
and your grandparents.
.

183
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,193
Please,

184
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,238
do not report it.

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,116

186
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,071
I won't, because it is you, Mrs. May.

187
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,630
but tell me,
If the Condition worsens, ok?
.

188
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,550
- Goodbye. 
- Heil Hitler.
.

189
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,356
- Yes, of course, Heil Hitler.
- (Kurt's mother) Heil Hitler.
.

190
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,719
Ms. Vermimung.

191
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,555
please connect
me to the health department.
.

192
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,915

193
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,278
- (Elisabeth) Goodbye, Gunther.
- (man 1) Mrs. May we have to go.
.

194
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,432
- (Gunther) Alright.
- (Man 2) We will miss you.
.

195
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,594
- (Mother) It's only for a few weeks.
- (Gunther) See you soon.
.

196
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,559
Goodbye, Ehrenfried.

197
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,833
(Kurt's father) Goodbye.
We will miss you.
.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,198
I do not want to go, Mom.

199
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,357
Kurt, go back inside.

200
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,671
Kurt.

201
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,151
- I do not want to go!
- (Nurse 1) Get her legs.
.

202
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,154
No!

203
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,435
- Do you have her? 
- Yes.
.

204
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,274
No! 

205
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,718
(Nurse 2) Come on.

206
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,070
(Doctor) keep still.

207
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,311
- she'll be all right.

208
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,155

209
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,794
(Doctor) scopolamine, it works fast.

210
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,790
(Caregiver 1) buckle her up.

211
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,997

212
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,155
- (Mother) The suitcase.
- (Ehrenfried) Oh yes, of course.
.

213
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,950
- These are her things.
- Yes / Yes.
.

214
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,797
Never look away.

215
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,076


216
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,917

217
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,551
My dear colleagues.

218
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,271
I want to congratulate you.

219
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,394
the weakest percent
of the German people
.

220
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,554
have been rendered infertile since
the introduction of the law.
.

221
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,353
400,000.

222
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,037
a proud number.

223
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,316
a contribution to generations,,

224
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,751
future Generations
will thank you..
.

225
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,752
I now hope that one day we will

226
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,957
live in a world

227
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,557
in which the streets are completely
free of mongoloid, mentally ill
.

228
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,677
and other freaks.

229
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,311
but now it seems to me time
to switch to the next gear.
.

230
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,074
also, due to the English air strikes

231
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,949
we have an increased need
for alternative hospitals.
.

232
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,000
we can't let this happen,
that a German soldier
.

233
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,276
is denied a hospital bed,

234
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,673
just because it is being used for
nurturing and caring for unworthy life.
.

235
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,996
- How can we help?  
- What can we do?
.

236
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,872
Thank you for this question, Carl.

237
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,353
Gentlemen,

238
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,354
from now on you will no longer
be just Doctors and SS men.
.

239
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,030
you will become assessors of
the Heritage Health Court.
.

240
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,111
what does that mean?

241
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,399
well,
a patient you made infertile
.

242
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,077
and whose registration form you have
marked with a blue minus sign,
.

243
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,277
remains in the asylum.
.

244
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,353
but if we see a red plus here,

245
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,951
we understand that
this is a worthless life,
.

246
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,318
and this patient will go to
one of three institutions
.

247
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,955
in the eastern most part of the Reich

248
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,431
and there liberated from
a meaningless existence.
.

249
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,509
Your pen.

250
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,280
Your sword ..

251
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,391

252
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,073

253
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,433
examination and preliminary talk.
Elisabeth May, 23 years old.
.

254
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,429
- sterilization appointment today at 15:45.
- Thank you.
.

255
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,832
- you can go in

256
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,151

257
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,996

258
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,911
You can sit there.

259
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,669

260
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,156
Did your daughter paint that?

261
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,270
Why do you think you are here?

262
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,119
because sometimes I
do not think right.
.

263
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,795
Do you know what kind of clinic I manage?

264
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,799
a gynecological clinic.

265
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,309
A lovely girl, your daughter.

266
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,997
I can see that in the picture.

267
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,638
not much artistic talent.

268
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,394
you might be unhappy happy about that.
but a lot of heart.
.

269
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,150
I have a nephew that age.

270
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,311
he is very talented

271
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,836
I take him to exhibitions.
to educate him.
.

272
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,109
good.

273
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,478
please lie down in the adjoining
room on the examination chair.
.

274
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,631
your clothes... 

275
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,277
- (man) I want to see Professor Seeband!
- Excuse me for a moment.
.

276
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,393
(Man) I've wanted an appointment for weeks.
I don't get an answer!
.

277
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,594
- I have a right to it!
- Sorry Professor, I could not stop him.
.

278
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,239
Mr. Lohse-Wachtler.

279
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,911
They asked me, "Do you want
that, your daughter's suffering
.

280
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,993
carried on to the
next generation? "
.

281
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,279
that's why I agreed to the Operation.
What about my daughter's suffering now?
.

282
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,513
- (Seeband) Show some respect.
- what about my suffering?
.

283
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,035
I won't continue this Conversation..

284
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,672
I'll show you, Professor Seeband.
At the Reichs-Arztekammer.
.

285
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,998
Do that, Mr. Lohse-Wachtler.
Do that.
.

286
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,835
you have sworn an oath as a doctor.
Let me go.
.

287
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,277
- at some point, it will catch up with you.
- (Carer) Go.
.

288
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,000
(Lohse-Wachtler) it will catch up with you!

289
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,311
it will catch up with you!

290
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,832
it will catch up with you!

291
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,514
Professor Seeband!  Someday !

292
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,593
(Carer) Quiet.

293
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,232
It would have been better,
that you had not seen that.
.

294
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,678
- I am of healthy descent.
- Three reviewers see it differently.
.

295
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,076
- No! 
- Sit back down.
.

296
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,236

297
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,073
You're going into the Examination Room now
And afterwards in the Operating room.
.

298
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,356
and you will cooperate there.
.

299
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,949
otherwise we'll have you strapped down

300
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,317
and everything gets
harder and more painful.
.

301
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,279
Please, Mr. Seeband...

302
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,354
Professor, please.

303
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,957
for the Fuhrer. I will give birth to
children. Healthy, Aryan children.
.

304
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,317
and I will give them to the Führer,
as we're supposed to.
.

305
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,951
my children will also give
their children to the Fuhrer.
.

306
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,112
- (nurse) Come on.
- (Elisabeth) For the war!
.

307
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,716
you need soldiers, don't you?
you need soldiers!
.

308
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,076
who else is going to fight?

309
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,679
I'm just confused sometimes.

310
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,675
Only very rarely.
Please don't! 
.

311
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,677
Please, I do not want to.

312
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,233
- (nurse) Come on now...

313
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,273
- Guys, I need help!
- you are also a father.
.

314
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,311
- for your daughter, who also paints.
- (nurse) stop that's enough.
.

315
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,838
I could be her sister.
you could be my dad.
.

316
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,993
Please Dad.

317
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,870
Please Dad.

318
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,875
No!

319
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,678
Dad, please!

327
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,511

328
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,714
- Anna. 
- yes Herr Professor?
.

329
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,118
I won't operate on Miss May myself.
Tell Blockman.
.

330
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,114
- He's at the Kressaal.
- Then you make the changes.

331
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,793

332
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,676
Thank you.

333
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,759
Careful !

334
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,718
How Chic you look in the uniforms.
that will make Elisabeth happy.
.

335
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,719
Johann?

336
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,833
Yes.

337
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,395
- You know...
- Yes, after the war, that's my capital.
.

338
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,878
and do not forget the greeting.  "Heil Hitler".
.

339
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,474
If you can't get it across your lips,
say a fast "three liters".
.

340
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,313
no one will notice.
.

341
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,956
- and none of the painting you do all the time.
- and certainly nothing of these naked people.
.

342
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,430
(Sister 1) The same photographer?
Nobody has commissioned him?

00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,430
Heil Hitler.

Ehrenfried and Gunther May.

Elisabeth May.

351
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,676
Relocated? It can't be.

352

When?

355
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,431
(Photographer) Two are missing?

356
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,956
Kathe, we're ready.

357
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,760
Where was she transferred?

358
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,789
- Hospital Grossschweidnitz.
- (Malvine) Grossschweidnitz?
.

359
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,396
that's two days from here.
how can we visit her there?
.

00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,752
we have to work.
the boys are on leave now.
.

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,390
That's all I can tell you.

362
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,035
I have to go now.  Heil Hitler.

363

That's him, all right..

364
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,918
(Ehrenfried) I will write to the Ministry.

365
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,919
- (Photographer) Please look here.

366
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,312

Tin foil strips.  I read about that.

375
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,358
they're using it to interfere with radio and radar.

Johanna... - Mommy... Mom!

This way !  
There's a embankment ahead.

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,757
I like you too.

that's how it's done.

Mr. Seeband...

00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,553
Professor Seeband.

403
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,991
What did he say?
.
.

404
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,039
He wishes you to address
him as "Professor."

405
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,956
Agreed, Professor.

407
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,476
Where is Burghard Kroll?

408
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,240
- Who? 
- Burghard Kroll.
.

409
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,037

410
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,238
the head of the Reich's working group.

411
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,193
we know about your meeting in Berlin.

412
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,079
I do not know, what you are talking about.
I do not know the man.

413
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,237

414
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,232

415
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,470
I still do not know him.

418
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,676
(Interpreter) If my child
is not born healthy,
.

419
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,672
does it then deserve to die?

420
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,320
There are limited space and
resources on this earth.
.

421
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,757
Who should have that?
the sick or the healthy?
.

422
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,510

423
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,630

424
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,640
In any case, a place will soon
be available on this earth.
.

425
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,958

426
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,079
You did not specify
if you were a party member.
.

427
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,913
Were you a party member?

428
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,910
- Mr Director, I have been very long time...
- yes or no, Mr Barnert?
.

429
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,195
Yes.

430
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,351
but I'm not a Nazi.

431
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,951
I mean, three quarters of all
teachers were in the party.
.

432
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,115
We want to entrust the youth to
the remaining quarter. Good day.

434

Comrade?

446
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,713

447
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,674
Comrade!
.
.
.

448
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,955
- What?
- The labour pauses do not bring her peace.
.
.
.


449
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,033
The child is wrong.
It can not come out.
.

450
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,918
(Russian) How?
.
.


451
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,198
Call the interpreter.
Immediately.
.
.

452
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,632

453

456
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,830
He mistrusts you.
he asks why you want to help.
.

457
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,991
I want to help because I can.

458

459
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,119
You can go.

462
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,551
(Russian woman) A Gypsy woman told me...
I will not have any children.
.
.

463
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,353
That is my destiny...
.
.

464
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,875
- Crosswise, please. 
- Lay her across the bed.
.

465
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,152
- which week?

466

- (seeband) blood pressure ?
.

468
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,918
(interpreter) 110 over 70.

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,915
(Russian woman) How could I believe you
that I can have children?

471
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,198
Tell her a child she will
definitely have.
.

472
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,079
after that, many more.

473

474
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,793
The child is crosswise.

475
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,919
during the contractions, the
uterus is too hard to rotate.
.

476
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,390
I will open the amniotic sac.

477
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,513
in a labour pause
I'll turn the child around.
.

478
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,032

479
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,991
I'm a military interpreter...

481
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,271
(Major) Do it.

482
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,636
(seeband) gloves.

483
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,318
The vodka, please.

484
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,556
(seeband) Do not touch.

485
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,797

486
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,109
We will do it without anesthesia.

487
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,118
Seeband) I already have a leg.

488
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,193
(Seeband) Let's wait for the next contraction.

489
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,954

490
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,795
(Seeband) I put my index
finger in the child's mouth.
.

491
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,031

492
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,072
(Seeband) I'm laying the
chin on the chest...
.

493
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,754
and slowly pull it's head out.

494
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,033

495
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,757

496
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,311
(Seeband, in Russian) 
A boy, a healthy boy...
.
.

497
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,600

498
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,759
(Interpreter) Alexander Mikhailovich.

499
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,474
and a healthy,
beautiful mother.
.
.
.

500
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,236
I congratulate you, Major.

501
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,113

502
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,480
Whoever saves a
life, saves the whole world.
.
.
.

503
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,158
You saved my world,
.
.
.

504
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,233
Professor.
.
.
.

505
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,355
Nobody will touch a hair on your head.
.
.
.

506
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,959
You are now under my
personal protection.
.
.
.


507
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,873
Make the guest room ready
for the professor...
.
.
.

508
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,634
... and give him decent clothes.
.
.
.

509
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,799

510
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,310

511
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,353

512
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,995

513
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,719
Father,
you do not have to worry anymore.

514
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,872
I understand, I got it.

515
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,518
- What? What did you understand?
- Everything, everything.
.

516
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,320
how everything relates.
that everything is connected.
.

517
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,999
everything.

518
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,758
the world formula.

519
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,630
I...

520
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,797
I never have to worry again.
I never need to be afraid again.
.

521
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,519
I am untouchable.

522
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,036
That's nice.
No, father, you do not understand.
.

523
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,840
You do not have to worry anymore.
Really.
.

524
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,671
I do not even have to become an
artist anymore. I can take any job.
.

525
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,714
and I will always find the right
thing, the true one.
.

526
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,590
I'm glad for you, really.

527
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,556
I have to hold it.

528
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,075
I have to hold it somehow.

529
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,998
I understand.

530
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,916
I know who you're thinking about.

531
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,152
but he is different.

532
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,593

533
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,391
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, my boy.
.

534
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,956
The registration, colleague.

535
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,109

536
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,232
are you doing this to make
you feel better than us?
.

537
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,391
What?

538
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,071
drawing the shapes freehand,
while we worry ourselves with stencils.
.

539
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,830
do you want to show us up?
why are you doing this?
.

540
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,350
I do it because I can.

541
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,873

542
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,639
Have you been waiting for a long time?

543
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,837
Then take care.  Until tomorrow.

544
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,678
You can take the pens with you,
if you bring them back
.

545
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,709
In January applications open for the
Academy of Arts,
.

546
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,269
I am satisfied with this work.

547
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,399
What the fuck are you doing?

548
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,871
Does that help the worker?

549
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,118
does that give your father strength,
cleaning stairs?
.

550
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,430
you want to help him, don't you?

551
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,399
you even got him the job.

552
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,517
you have seen a lot of shit, right?

553
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,669
but does it help you to revel in it?

554
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,959
does that help build a world
where your children feel better?
.

555
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,316
that's what communism is about.

556
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,474
I will support your application.

557
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,389
at the art academy,
the girls are more pretty than here.
.

558
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,157

559
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,030

560
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,192

561
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,312
(Lecturer) Can you see

562
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,235
That someone here has
left all his vanity aside
.

563
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,280
and put himself in the service of the
cause, in the service of the People?
.

564
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,550
work on your attitude.
work on your craft.
.

565
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,759
and the right art
will emerge by itself.
.

566
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,634
as a warning example I would like
to show you Pablo Picasso...
.

567
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,240
from which there are
strong realistic images,
.

568
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,155
who made a real solidarity with
the working class clear...
.

569
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,192
but very soon

570
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,274
slipped into a decadent,
obscene formalism.
.

571
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,913
Why?

572
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,877
because he wanted to be considered
a renewer, not a traditionalist.
.

573
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,471
innovation, schoperic
independence, artistic freedom.
.

574
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,389
words that sound
appealing to an artist.
.

575
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,238
I I I.

576
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,593
but real freedom can
only win a modern artist,
.

577
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,355
when he puts himself at the service
of the interests of the people.
.

578
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,160
the "I, me, me" leads only to bad luck.

579
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,313
in the best case,
it leads to being withheld
.

580
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,869
by decadent, rich collectors.

581
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,038
exploiters of the workers
who are indulging in
.

582
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,714
that they have nothing in
common with the people,
.

583
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,991
not even the art taste.
.

584
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,311
decay, mysticism, pornography.

585
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,272
empty forms, artificial constructions.

586
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,034
blots, lines, balls cones.

587
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,716
all this just to be
considered as a renewer?
.

588
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,671
yes, it is new.

589
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,877
but it is also wrong.

590
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,035
and it's vain and stupid,
undemocratic, decadent.
.

591
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,792
be different, gentlemen.
be different.
.

592
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,599
The hammer was a bit higher earlier.

593
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,671
Yes, that's right,
it was a whole lot higher.
.

594
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,558
Yes, a little bit more.

595
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,712
So here?
And the left hand in the middle.
.

596
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,793
Yes, exactly, and the right
one was a lot higher.
.

597
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,678
Anything else. 
Yes, higher.
.

598
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,114
One more piece.
.

599
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,635
So?
higher, higher.
.

600
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,757
Right forward.

601
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,315
Exactly.  That's how it's done, right?

602
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,074
Yes, that's how it works.
That's how it works.
.

603
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,277
Nah, it was not like that.
.

604
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,433
Cut the bullshit..

605
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,716
It was a bit higher up.

606
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,115
Nope,  But below.

607
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,151
Nah, it was up.

608
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,833
right

609
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,595
Down, up, down, up,

610
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,877
down, up.

611
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,393
Comrade Professor?

612
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,915
Comrade Professor,
the students are playing crazy.
.

613
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,118
(Model) In any case,
I also carry a great responsibility here.
.

614
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,280
Yes, 
are we in kindergarten?
.

615
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,870
yes, it seems that way.

616
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,397

617
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,279

618
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,671
Hey, in fashion they're giving
away Western art pencils.
.

619
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,631


620
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,792
Sorry.

621
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,959
Excuse me.

622
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,673
Excuse me.

623
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,278
Thank you.
.

624
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,080
2B. Thank you.
Hello, Ernst.
.

625
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,556
It's great that you share these.
Of course, with pleasure.
.

626
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,035
Greetings to Lise from me.
I will.
.

627
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,679

628
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,279
Thank you, Elisabeth.

629
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,077
Do not worry.
she belongs to me.
.

630
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,994
Watch to learn how to do it.

631
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,914
2B or 4B?

632
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,158
well?
Ah...
.

633
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,512
2B, but

634
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,037
much better I had a
date with you.
.

635
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,758
Let's leave it at the pencil.
Are you sure?
.

636
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,318
Sure.

637
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,471
Your name is Elisabeth?

638
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,197
Do you want one too?

639
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,472
There are only 4B left now.

640
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,799
Thank you.

641
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,476
A gold pheasant like you does
not deserve an ordinary jack.
.

642
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,399
Golden Pheasant?

643
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,276
Yes.
That does not sit well with me.
.

644
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,151
I feel the same way.

645
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,833
A walk?

646
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,919
through the park?

647
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,796
So that I can correct
my misjudgment?
.

648
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,313
You wanted to talk to me after all.

649
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,992
actually,
I wanted to go for a walk with you.
.

650
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,309
Alright.

651
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,512
Then I'll just make conversation.

652
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,556
Socialist Realism.

653
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,711
Is that your thing?

654
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,674
Probably the same
as yours is Lotte Ulbricht's fashion..
.

655
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,550
why do you always look at me like that?

656
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,391
You remind me of someone.

657
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,236
Would you like to paint me?

658
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,118
I do not know...

659
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,079
Would you like to
tailor a suit for me?
.

660
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,198
I have to go home.

661
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,791
May I accompany you?

662
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,877
Only to the door.

663
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,913

664
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,119

665
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,476
You take dance lessons?

666
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,513
I live here.  The house is ours.

667
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,115
You have not refuted the
golden pheasant right now.
.

668
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,277
had only luck.
not a single bomb hit.
.

669
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,120
before the war, the whole street looked like this.

670
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,957
Goodbye, Kurt.

671
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,593
Goodbye...

672
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,829
Elisabeth.

673
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,237
Can I call you somehow different?
do you have a nickname'?
.

674
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,755
Actually, all of them call me Elisabeth.

675
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,912
"Actually" means exactly
the opposite is true.
.

676
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,279
Alright.

677
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,876
My dad calls me Ellie.

678
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,477
Goodbye, Ellie.

679
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,519

680
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,318
Elisabeth.

681
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,314

682
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,559

683
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,560

684
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,199

685
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,112

686
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,150

687
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,719

688
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,917

689
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,717
(Lecturer) Pay more attention to the view.
and more volume, yes?
.

690
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,829
You could have taken a bit
longer, Kurt.
.

691
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,753
Good

692
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,151

693
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,475
It's over for today.

694
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,113
Ah yes, good night.  
Good night.
.

695
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,758
Until tomorrow.

696
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,593

697
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,989

698
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,880
A gold pheasant as a worker?

699
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,315
You are my semester project now.

700
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,555
a suit.  for you.

701
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,034

702
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,314
I'll never take it off.

703
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,510

704
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,757
You are so Beautiful.
That's almost unromantic.
.

705
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,994
It is far too easy to love you.

706
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,952
Do you love me?

707
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,358
Do you love me?

708
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,516
Otherwise it will not work for me.

709
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,551
Otherwise, I can't do this..

710
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,158
I love you.

711
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,273
Really?

712
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,079
Yes.

713
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,716

714
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,717

715
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,192
I love you.

716
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,279
I love you.

717
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,839
I love you.

718
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,876

719
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,558
My parents.

720
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,790
I thought they live in Chemnitz.

721
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,237
They do.

722
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,239

723
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,437

724
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,357
My dad.

725
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,756
What are we going to do?

726
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,512

727
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,437

728
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,393

729
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,070

730
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,716

731
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,833

732
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,956

733
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,880

734
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,631

735
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,477

736
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,071

737
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,078

738
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,920

739
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,076
- (Mother) And Elisabeth?
- Sleeping tight.
.

740
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,076
She Left a candle burning.
When will she finally grow up?
.

741
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,752
Yes, the youth.

742
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,598
Among friends
what were you doing..
.

743
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,992
I was gardening.
.

744
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,039
I see, gardening.

745
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,033
I guess you have
a really green thumb..
.

746
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,152
Ah, here she comes, your gardening.

747
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,839
Come on, boys.

748
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,710

749
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,677
Thank you for risking your
life for my reputation.
.

750
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,793
Never do something
so crazy again.
.

751
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,711
Did your parents...
They did not notice.
.

752
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,359
nothing at all.

753
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,236
they're moving back to Dresden.

754
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,514
my dad gets his old post
as clinic director again.
.

755
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,194
but he still has a room to rent

756
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,359
because if he doesn't.
the Housing Department is coming in.
.

757
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,480
he wants to put up a sign on Monday.

758
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,029
don't you want to...?

759
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,356
to discover the sign first?

760
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,033
just by chance?

761
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,354
that I would then fall in love with
a tenant selected by them,
.

762
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,830
they cannot deny me that..

763
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,680
Your mother, um...
won't she suspect somethig
.

764
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,197
Oh, Mummy,she has such an innocent mind.

765
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,594
you don't have to worry about her.
she won't notice a thing.
.

766
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,031
really,  nothing at all.

767
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,433
Mhm.

768
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,589

769
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,593
Yes?

770
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,515
I saw the sign.
is the room still for rent?
.

771
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,832
We put the sign up a
quarter of an hour ago.
.

772
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,877
Does that mean "yes?

773
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,393


774
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,631
Please

775
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,677
Mrs. Seeband? 
Yes?
.

776
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,629
There is an interested party.
That was fast.
.

777
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,992


778
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,193


779
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,917


780
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:24,560


781
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,953

782
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,958
Barnert, Kurt.

783
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,669
What do you do for a living?
Ahm, I'm a student.
.

784
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,629
For fashion.

785
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,638
painting. 
painting?
.

786
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,950
Mrs. Hellthaler!

787
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,194
Carl, here's a tenant for
one of the rooms, come down here.
.

788
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,510

789
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,512
You have facial...  Facial nerve palsy.

790
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,396
partial facial palsy.

791
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,870
the drooping corner of your mouth.

792
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,391
did you ever have an accident?
or a Lyme disease?
.

793
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,440
Take him to the office,
then my husband can talk to him.
.

794
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,796
my husband is a passionate doctor

795
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,600
you can get a free diagnosis.

796
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,110
You should get that checked out.

797
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,511
Kurt comes with
the best recommendations.
.

798
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,797
he is a student, non-smoker.

799
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,715
and we have already
agreed on the rent.
.

800
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,839
it is of course your decision
whether he gets the room.
.

801
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,913
He wants to be a painter.
I am a painter.
.

802
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,710
Our facade is starting to flake off.
maybe we can arrange something.
.

803
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,635
I'm not the kind of painter.

804
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,431
What kind are you?

805
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,031
Picture Painter.
Socialist Realism?
.

806
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,277
Is there anything else?

807
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,439
I hope not.

808
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,715
You get guest room "tandem".

809
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,632
Thank you, Mr. Seeband.
Professor Seeband, please.
.

810
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,352
Nice suit.

811
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,475

812
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,193

813
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,914

814
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,637
Shh.

815
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,600

816
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,710
Shh.

817
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,551

818
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,711
What are you up to?

819
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,558
I was ... out.

820
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,074
Drinking?

821
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,392
That can not help your work.

822
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,631
See that you go to Bed.

823
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,671


824
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,160

825
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,430
I do not like this Kurt.

826
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,520
we have to see that Ellie
doesn't get too friendly with him.
.

827
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,033
Why?

828
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,037
so that she can make a good
match, of course.
.

829
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,389
just like you did.

830
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,317

831
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,797

832
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,477
Professor Seeband, last night...
.. I will of course nobody...
.

833
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,950
You have a new subject.

834
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:41,875
Me.

835
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,070
for the Directors Gallery.

836
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,037
in this style.

837
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,074
we start tomorrow at 6am in
my office at the clinic, ok?
.

838
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,714
(Radio announcer) Since the people
of the GDR want the unity of Germany,
.

839
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,316
Minister-President Grotewohl
asked the Bonn government...
.

840
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,074
The professor is coming soon.
have a seat.
.

841
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,193
to make all-German elections, all-German,

842
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,159
these suggestions were
made by the Western powers
.

843
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,913
and the Adenauer government

844
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,714
rejected it in compliance with their war policy.

845
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,394
in further compliance with their war policy

846
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,235
the Bonn government and
the Western occupation forces
.

847
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,392
at 4am at the demarcation line...

848
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:35,238
.. introduced a strict border service in
order to differentiate itself from the GDR
.

849
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,233
and thereby the division of Germany...

850
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,199

851
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,831
Thank you, gentlemen, good day.
.

852
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,594
(radio)... to delineate...
- Kurt.
.

853
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,073
I thought,
you could put your easel...
.

854
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,719
here.

855
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,038
.. the lack of adequate
protection of the GDR
.

856
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,953
is exploited by the Western powers to

857
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,476
 ever greater extent

858
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,880
to send spies,terrorists and 
smugglers into our area.
.

859
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,514
These have after execution of
their Criminal task,
.

860
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,796
so far, have made the possibility of

861
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,592
returning unhindered over the
demarcation line to West Germany impossible
.

862
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,752
that's why we see ourselves
forced to take action for
.

863
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,754
the defense of the peaceful
interests of the population,
.

864
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:46,276
of the German
Democratic Republic.
.

865
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:52,749
these measures were entrusted to
the Ministry of State Security.
.

866
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,511


867
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,915


868
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,919
This is what I had in mind.
Very good.
.

869
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,950
tomorrow at 6am we start again.

870
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,760
two sessions should be enough, yes?

871
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,679


872
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,079
Why are you looking
at those old photos again?
.

873
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,837
Why does even the stupidest amateur
photo have more reality than my painting?
.

874
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,598
Dad likes them.
Yes, that's just it.
.

875
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,115
Almost nobody likes a picture of themselves.

876
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,755
but everyone should like a painting.

877
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,750
since the photo must be true.

878
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,075
why did your father
go to Chemnitz?
.

879
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,959
he was already a director here before.

880
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,192
- Hm?
- He does not want us talking about it.
.

881
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,514
he treated the women
of Goring and Goebbels.
.

882
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,639
because he's the best gynecologist.

883
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,440
they traveled 200
kilometers from Berlin.
.

884
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,433
as if there is no one else
Mastering a Cell Smear..
.

885
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,830
can you imagine that.

886
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,595
and they then made him an
honorary member of the SS.
.

887
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,751
he could not refuse.

888
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,590
after the War it was
hard to convey to the Russians,
.

889
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,718
that he had nothing else
to do with the Nazis.
.

890
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,676
they scoured all the archives,
but found nothing against him.
.

891
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,717
The professor today called me
an artist "Type Willi Sitte".
.

892
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,599
but that's good.
he is successful.
.

893
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,273
"Type Willi Sitte"?

894
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,196
I think we have to get out of here.

895
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,673
where to?

896
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,636
you do not mean that seriously.

897
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,469
everything is going so well for us.

898
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,038
I could not abandon Mommy.

899
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:50,996
Kurt! your diploma thesis
convinced the delegation.
.

900
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:56,030
they have chosen you to paint the wall
fresco for the new History Museum.
.

901
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,760
Theme: Unity of the working class.

902
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,356
some professors
also liked your work.
.

903
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,557
Mural painting?

904
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,798
I am not a muralist.

905
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,793
Kurt,
we both know you can do that.
.

906
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,349
Nah, I'm sorry,
that's not for me.
.

907
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,193
that is pure decoration.

908
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,716
you have work in one fell swoop.
even money.
.

909
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,797
That's not me.

910
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,792
I I I.

911
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,751

912
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,200
No, do not move,  please.

913
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,990
so I can imagine
that we are one body.
.

914
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,757
I'm pregnant.

915
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,636
then you are now completely mine.

916
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,036
all to me, I mean.

917
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,274
we have to tell them, Ellie.

918
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,516
maybe first of all,
the fact that we are together,
.

919
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,519
break up the shock in small amounts.

920
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,679
I think your mother already suspects something.

921
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,909
It's not mom that worries me.

922
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,434
Dad will fall from every cloud.

923
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,198
for him I will always
be twelve years old.
.

924
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,156

925
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,797

926
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,036
I think Ellie is pregnant.

927
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,110
What?

928
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,352
her temperature has been
slightly elevated for weeks,
.

929
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,750
but no cold symptoms.

930
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,356
she went out twice during
dinner yesterday,
.

931
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,592
she did not touch her
oatmeal at breakfast
.

932
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,594
and held onto the back of
the chair when she got up.
.

933
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,956
third month, I would say.

934
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,351
maybe even fourth.

935
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,512
Oh God, she is still a child herself.

936
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,435
her age is not the
problem, it's the man.
.

937
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,398
but who is it?

938
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,071
a leptosome, melancholiac.

939
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:03,950
son of a man who kills himself
because he had to clean a few stairs.
.

940
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,829
his dad had something
called like "Hegeabschuss".
.

941
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,274
this is not the genetic material
that I wish for our descendants.
.

942
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,590
we have to stop it.

943
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,919
and how?

944
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,030
after 30 years in
gynecology I know:
.

945
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,593
an abortion can put an end
to almost any love affair.
.

946
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,639


947
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,113


948
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:42,998
No, I do not know him either,
what is the difference?
.

949
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,755
The psychotic thinks that
two plus two are five.
.

950
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,675
While the neurotic already
knows that it is four,
.

951
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,831
it just worries him.

952
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,513


953
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,114
There is something we want to tell you.

954
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,432
About your academy?
I am always very interested in that.
.

955
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,550
No.  Although... it's also about the academy.

956
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,953
Kurt was commissioned with the wall
painting at the History Museum.
.

957
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,031
Walls after all.

958
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,830
it is a fresco on
working class unity.
.

959
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,074
yes, and speaking of unity...

960
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,197
What is it, child?

961
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,871
nothing unpleasant, I hope.


962
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,111
save my nerves.

963
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,513
We...

964
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,430
we are together.

965
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,119
you also work on the fresco?

966
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,717
we are a couple.
already for some time.
.

967
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,909
a couple of students?

968
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,037
a loving couple.

969
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,756
.. and there's something else...
That's big news.

970
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,719
yes, but there is one more thing that we...

971
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,157
My God,
I have to digest that first.
.

972
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,437

973
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,232
This is really very sudden.

974
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,792
Please,
Bring the Professor water
.

975
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,151
thank you very much.  
thank you.
.

976
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,230

977
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:49,475


978
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,199
I'm glad you told us.

979
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,232
and you told us early.

980
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:59,876
there is something about
Ellie that you need to know.
.

981
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,356
we did not want to worry
Ellie unnecessarily
.

982
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,753
that's why we've never
really explained it, but...
.

983
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:16,078
as an infant Ellie had a severe
discharge in the pelvic cavity,
.

984
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,800
and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes

985
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,316
and thus led to considerable cilia damage.

986
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,675
Cilia ?

987
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,593
the cilia of the
fallopian tubes,
.

988
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,276
they transport the fertilized
egg to the uterus.
.

989
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,831
We are currently looking
for a way
.

990
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,991
to remedy this surgically.

991
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,757
but if she...

992
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,510
became pregnant...

993
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,752
there would be the chance of an
extrauterine pregnancy,
.

994
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,309
an ectopic pregnancy,

995
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,918
an oviduct pregnancy,

996
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,710
which in turn could lead to
severe internal bleeding.
.

997
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,909
so I have to warn you.

998
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:08,319
for reasons other, than a father
of daughters warn a young man,
.

999
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:12,951
to not get intimate with
her until we can fix that.
.

1000
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,999
a pregnancy at the present time

1001
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,674
could be life threatening for Ellie.


1002
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,036


1003
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,271
You understood me?  
Life-threatening.
.

1004
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,440
And if she was already pregnant?

1005
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,673
Then I must examine her immediately.

1006
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,275


1007
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,391


1008
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,595
I have to act immediately.

1009
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:23,669
The pregnancy is more
advanced than I feared.
.

1010
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,156
it is already the third month.

1011
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,313
An abortion?

1012
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:36,190
If I do not remove the fetus immediately,
she will not survive the pregnancy.
.

1013
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:37,994
Here?

1014
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,197
we have a reputation to uphold.

1015
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,436
Is it really the only way?  Really?

1016
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,035
do you doubt my expertise?

1017
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,198
I'd expect myself to do that,
for my daughter,
.

1018
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,397
if it wasn't necessary?

1019
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,358

1020
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,754

1021
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,596

1022
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:21,191

1023
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,550

1024
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:50,310
He had his SS uniform tailor made.

1025
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:55,594
he spent hours posing in it.
in front of the mirror.
.

1026
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,874
until he knew how he looked good in it.

1027
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,355
it was then that I saw him.

1028
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,476
it made no difference to him that I saw him.

1029
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,596

1030
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,793
on his hat there was a skull.

1031
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,958
Silver.

1032
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,678
a skull.

1033
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,596
a doctor should heal.

1034
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,951
he should heal.

1035
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,633
will I always be at his mercy?

1036
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,914


1037
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,716
a gifted doctor, a humanist,

1038
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:01,157
a co-designer of our
socialist republic,
.

1039
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:05,678
in short a role model for
all members of his guild,
.

1040
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:10,795
that's why, on this December 11th,
the day of the health service of the GDR,
.

1041
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:16,478
with the Robert Koch Medal and the
title "Honored Doctor of the People"
.

1042
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:19,229
we award...

1043
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,111

1044
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,199
Thank you, Comrade Minister,
for the kind words,
.

1045
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:38,112
which I do not deserve.

1046
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:42,672
as a doctor and member of
society, I only do my duty.
.

1047
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,037
I am a wheel in the big transmission
of the socialist world movement.
.

1048
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,717
just like the painter of this
too too flattering portrait of me
.

1049
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,996
only a small wheel,

1050
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:59,279
indistinguishable in style
from the other painters here.
.

1051
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,119
as we are all only small
wheels of a big apparatus,
.

1052
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:09,514
who with the help of the Soviet Union
are heading for a great, common goal.
.

1053
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,399
Communism.

1054
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,119
Thank you.

1055
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,549

1056
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,997

1057
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,753

1058
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,713
What did he want?

1059
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,439
I'm supposed to go to
KGB headquarters tomorrow.
.

1060
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,477
he did not say more.

1061
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,110

1062
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:14,678
The plan did not work out.
they are closer than before.
.

1063
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,553
patience, Martha.

1064
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,758
have patience.

1065
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,312

1066
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,273

1067
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,389
- General Murayov,
- Professor Seeband.
.
.
.

1068
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,676
You can go.
.
.
.

1069
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,471

1070
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,759
Carl.

1071
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,713
Carl.

1072
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,792
wait, I have to show you something.

1073
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,872
come sit down.

1074
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:42,553
Carl, I'm being transferred,

1075
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:47,717
back to Moscow. I will not be
able to protect you anymore.
.

1076
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,950
all the others have been caught.

1077
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:55,038
the search for Burghard Kroll and the...

1078
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,436
"Physician Coordinator of the Dresden
Region in the Implementation of Euthanasia"
.

1079
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,916
is still open on the books.

1080
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,597
I can not guarantee,

1081
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,593
that my successor does
not come with new investigations
.

1082
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,593
starting with doctors and nurses.

1083
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:18,079
you have to leave the GDR
and never come back.
.

1084
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:22,473
make an exit request
for you and your wife.
.

1085
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,995
you will be approved.

1086
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,189
the truth is they will not
suspect you in the West.
.

1087
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,953
at least we hope not.

1088
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,597

1089
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,753
Carl,

1090
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:45,353
can you tell me something about Kroll?

1091
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:48,713
where he is?

1092
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:53,158
who else was present
at your meetings?
.

1093
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:00,431
you would help me very much.

1094
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,795
I never met this man.

1095
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,997
I do not know anything about him.

1096
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:28,517
we will not meet
again, my friend.
.

1097
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,433
I hope my debt is paid.

1098
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,871

1099
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,118
You can go.
.
.

1100
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,671

1101
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,713
- Dear Ellie, 
- Dear Kurt.
.

1102
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:00,070
you've been my son-in-law
for two hours now.
.

1103
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,800
I leave my daughter in your care,

1104
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,953
when we leave the GDR
at the end of the month.
.

1105
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,954
only one thing I could give
you for your life on the way.
.

1106
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,117
it is not enough to be good.

1107
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,198
I experienced it with
men who were only good,
.

1108
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:23,274
overrun, expropriated,
even eliminated.
.

1109
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,272
if you want to have
security in your life,
.

1110
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,272
no matter what you do,

1111
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,272
you have to be the best.

1112
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,076
not one of the best.

1113
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,872
THE BEST.

1114
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,513
To the married couple.

1115
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,511
Cheers.
To a happy life.
.

1116
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,393
Cheers

1117
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:56,913
" I am now in Oldenburg,

1118
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,680
in the Sanderbusch
Clinic, with the prospect
.

1119
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,879
after Erkner's retirement in two
years, to take over the management.
.

1120
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:07,396
take care of yourself, your father."

1121
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:11,679
he fell on his feet
again, it seems.
.

1122
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,036

1123
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,799

1124
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,069

1125
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:46,157

1126
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,392

1127
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,320
How much would you pay
me for the Wartburg (car)?
.

1128
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,357
Are you still in dreamland?

1129
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:03,235
do you know how long a normal
mortal waits for such a car?
.

1130
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,477
I do not enjoy it anymore.

1131
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,633
300 marks?

1132
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,238
Kurt, in the west,
they do not paint anymore.
.

1133
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:20,394
painting is considered bourgeois.

1134
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,598
Bourgeois means good for
them, I thought.
.

1135
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,993
Oh, what do I know.

1136
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:32,075
of course we all want to
get rid of you here, but...
.

1137
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,072
you have a life here.

1138
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,597
you have money,  you are just becoming famous.

1139
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:42,478
I mean, I can get girls to bed, 
because I'm your assistant.
.

1140
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:46,031
you can use the
machine like no one else.
.

1141
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:49,636
you'll be 30 next year.
it's not that young anymore.
.

1142
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,790
you're...

1143
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,115
Why?

1144
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,549
Because it's not about all this.
What is it then?
.

1145
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,153
the truth.

1146
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,036
and who says what is true?

1147
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,158
I I I.

1148
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,349
- 260 marks? 
- ok, sold.
.

1149
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,912
Do you need canvas?
Do you have any?
.

1150
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,310
as many as pictures,  in the studio.

1151
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,959
What?

1152
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,556
paint them over, please, all of them.
I don't want to see them anymore.
.

1153
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:43,110
believe me, it's all wrong,
what I painted there.
.

1154
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,953


1155
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:49,994


1156
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,471
and the murals?
you can not destroy them.
.

1157
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,432

1158
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,190

1159
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,915
Others will do that for me.

1160
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:13,280

1161
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,511

1162
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,953

1163
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,630
(Policeman) Stop!  Stand still!

1164
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:17,596
- What do you have in the suitcase?
- Things that belong to my brother-in-law.

1168

It's almost too easy.
Not for long.

fill this out, please.

your beds are there.  I'll come to you.

Mrs. Muller?  Mrs. Muller!

1176
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,077
Thank you, 
Good afternoon.
.

1177
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:03,515
Please.
Thank you.

1179

1180
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,678
Dear Professor.

1181
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,832
if you read these lines
lines, I am in the West.
.

1182
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,674
I could not talk to you before,

1183
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,793
they would have made me liable for prosecution..
.

1184
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,871
you were always very good to me.

1185
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,919
that's why you might
even believe me
.

1186
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:16,199
that I did not make
this decision lightly.
.

1187
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:37,877

1188
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,717

1189
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,113

1190
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,759
Mmm?

1191
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,998
Hello, I'm Kurt.

1192
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,992
should I come back later?
Nah, come in.
.

1193
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,557
Klaus, be still, ok?

1194
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,112
or you'll mess up your dads.
birthday present for your mother

1195
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,669

1196
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,037

1197
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,560
- How old are you? 
- 29.

1198
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:45,993
- I'm turning 30.
- You look younger.

1199
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:54,634
well, Munich is a good idea.
here people have money.
.

1200
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,191
they constantly need
portraits and landscapes.
.

1201
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:01,034
in Hamburg, too.  That's... well.

1202
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,872
what I would advise against is Dusseldorf.

1203
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,471
Dusseldorf? 
Mm.
.

1204
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:11,395
only modern art You
know, avant-garde.
.

1205
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,917
if you were not at the academy,
you have no chance there anyway.
.

1206
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,357
this is a bit like a mafia.
Munchen is good.
.

1207
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:20,952
Hamburg is good.

1208
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,670
and Berlin is so middle class.

1209
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,157
well, you can see yourself.

1210
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,839
Klaus, keep still.

1211
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,832

1212
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:46,511
Good afternoon. I'm Kurt.Barnert. 
Mhm.
.

1213
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:49,479
I called, because of a guided tour.

1214
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:03,592

1215
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,036

1216
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:09,670
He hit him in the lecture
and gave him a bloody nose.
.

1217
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:16,560
He showed Hitler's greeting and
then said that it was a provocation.
.

1218
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,518
Tasteless.

1219
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:22,071
9000 marks paid for some earth.
No!
.

1220
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,994
You're under 26, right?

1221
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,271
good, and what do you want to do?

1222
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,193
Action?  Installation?  Sculpture?

1223
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:35,069
- Painting actually.
- Painting?
.

1224
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,837
no offense, i'm not a bad guy.
from the East. Mecklenburg.
.

1225
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,152
Harry, Harry Preusser. 
Kurt.
.

1226
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:46,073
so nobody really does paint anymore.

1227
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:50,676
people want something new.  An idea.

1228
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,958

1229
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,714

1230
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,717
- An idea?
- Yeah, but not like that.
.

1231
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,912
something new.  Or at least repackaged.

1232
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,153
like Yves Klein, who says,
"I'm claiming ultramarine for me".

1233
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,038
I even paint with it.

1234
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:26,636
it's called Yves Little Blue now.
I only paint myself out in it.
.

1235
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,111
I paint the bare breasts of
a beautiful woman with it.
.

1236
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:34,035
and she smears her breasts on the breasts
of another beautiful woman.
.

1237
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,875
I paint sponge with it
and stick it on canvas. "
.

1238
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,918

1239
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:46,679

1240
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:50,037
does not help if someone
had the idea before.
.

1241
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:53,716
Lucio Fontana has been
slitting canvas for six years.
.

1242
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,629
but Katrin has nice solid
breasts, and so we leave her.
.

1243
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,834


1244
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,794
let's divert our
focus away from the obvious,
.

1245
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,792
towards the threadbare.
.

1246
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:13,270
let's leave the background behind.

1247
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,597
This is Adrian Schimmel.

1248
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,072
the name says it already.

1249
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:22,194
his name is actually Adrian Finck,
son of the Mannesmann board.
.

1250
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:25,637
a snob.
And he can talk, that is also clear.
.

1251
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,240
but is the idea enough?

1252
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,675
in other words, what does the
entire composition tell you?
.

1253
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,871
Yes, I think that's pretty.

1254
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:41,238
Well, of course that's a
wallpaper, of course.
.

1255
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:44,276
Excuse me. 
Yes.
.

1256
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:45,794
Yes.

1257
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,713
but you see: only seemingly.

1258
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,031
that's what we artists are looking for.

1259
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:54,272
that which hides
behind the decorative.
.

1260
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,757
look: the emptiness,
printed by the white,
.

1261
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,480
that I put between the templates.
.

1262
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:05,191
the banality,
embodied by the recurring pattern.
.

1263
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:08,557
and the senseless brightness
of the neon colors.
.

1264
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:11,754
that's what brought you here.

1265
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,953
you have an artistic trance.

1266
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:19,637
Otherwise you did not land here.
your friends see a pretty wallpaper.
.

1267
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,036
you see the plane behind it.

1268
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,679
Nice.

1269
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,399
and...

1270
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:29,753
can you buy something like that?

1271
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,913
One can.
that's the big thing about art.
.

1272
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:42,430
the devil always shits on the...
Well, you know.
.

1273
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:46,150
but that is not the way an artist
should speak about his work.
.

1274
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,869
he wants to prove to
his successful family
.

1275
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,151
that he can succeed without them.

1276
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,152
they only pay cabbage

1277
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:56,039
I want to prove to my
unsuccessful family
.

1278
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,589
that I can still be successful

1279
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,714
it's all cabbage, too.
everything sucks with the families.
.

1280
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,118
you can be a maximum of 26, if you
have the idea, otherwise it's nothing.
.

1281
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,590
Why? 
Think about it.
.

1282
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:15,673
Picasso was 26 at the
"Demoiselles d'Avignon".
.

1283
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:19,435
Duchamp was 25 when he painted
"Act, descending a staircase".
.

1284
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,513
And Michelangelo was 24 at the Pieté.

1285
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,194
Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
.

1286
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:29,477
What do you call that?
"potato pendulum".
.

1287
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:34,111
No more points?
I'm interested in potatoes right now.
.

1288
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,316
this is Kurt, also comes from the East.
he will study here.
.

1289
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,951
ah, then surely you had to listen
to Harry's speech about the idea.
.

1290
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,554
you do not believe?

1291
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,710
I am more interested...

1292
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:49,679
in potatoes.

1293
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,796
come on, before you get corrupted.

1294
01:58:56,680 --> 01:59:00,071
Arendt Ivo.
no one knows what he wants.
.

1295
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,958
he had everything before

1296
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:05,670
in such large,
same-colored points on plates.
.

1297
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,117
he had a real idea.
and now that.
.

1298
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,239
then in two months,
he does something completely different.
.

1299
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,753
Our professor.

1300
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:22,519
Antonius van Verten,
you probably heard of him in Saxony.
.

1301
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,878
an original.

1302
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,475
he prefers "myth".

1303
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,157
he always wears this hat.

1304
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:35,274
once a student seduced him

1305
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,238
just to see him without a hat.

1306
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,434
he kept it in bed too.

1307
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,195
He works only with felt and fat,
and why?
.

1308
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,594
that remains his mysterious secret.

1309
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:56,356
we have to go to all his lectures,
but he never looks at us.
.

1310
01:59:56,600 --> 02:00:00,275
he says you can only know for
yourself if you do it right.
.

1311
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,829
I think he just does not care.

1312
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,911
well, he has us too.

1313
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:08,793
whether you are admitted,
or you get a studio...
.

1314
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,554
all the decision of this spinner.

1315
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:16,276
come on.
it's not that interesting.
.

1316
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:28,154
You have not submitted a portfolio.

1317
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:30,510
I could not take anything with me.

1318
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,116
and what have you done so far?

1319
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:35,800
painted.

1320
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,474
in the DDR? 
Yes.
.

1321
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,950
Socialist Realism.

1322
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:51,078
now they have
actually built a wall.
.

1323
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,631
did you see that coming?

1324
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:00,271
"Nobody has the intention" 
usually means that exactly the opposite is true.
.

1325
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:06,079
but somehow that's art
again, this wall.
.

1326
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,474
a landscape artwork.

1327
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:12,712
the craftsmanship
execution is uninteresting.
.

1328
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:15,554
hundreds of thousands
have difficulties with it.
.

1329
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:18,189
consistent German madness.


1330
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,589
what do you like about art?

1331
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:35,629
you do not like talking about yourself, huh?

1332
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:41,752
but your eyes tell me that you
have seen more than all of us.
.

1333
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:47,039


1334
02:01:55,480 --> 02:02:00,031
the only two conditions for
you as for everyone else are,
.

1335
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,999
first,
that you come to the lectures
.

1336
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:06,114
and secondly never ask

1337
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:10,239
that I look at
something you're doing
.

1338
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,479
agreed?

1339
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:21,194
whether it's good for you or
not, only you know that anyway.
.

1340
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:27,236


1341
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:39,153
Hm.

1342
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:43,273
One step forward,
two steps back.
.

1343
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:44,839
oh, come on.

1344
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:48,670
do not say that you can not
do anything you want here.
.

1345
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:51,520
yes, if only I knew what it is.

1346
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,359
SPD?

1347
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:05,914
CDU?

1348
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:08,310
Who are you going to vote for?
CDU!
.

1349
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,830
FDP!
Peace Union!

1350
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,434
These are criminals.

1351
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,114
as if they were better!
SPD!
.

1352
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:17,197
Do not vote.

1353
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:20,470
never again choose a party.

1354
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,513
choose the art.

1355
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,671
it is an either - or.

1356
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:29,272
only in art is freedom
not an illusion.
.

1357
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:34,109
only the artist can make a man
after this catastrophe
.

1358
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:37,511
to return the trace of their freedom.

1359
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:41,077
everybody, whether he is
at the garbage collection
.

1360
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,913
or farmer is,

1361
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,435
has the chance to be an artist.

1362
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,118
if he has his own
subjective skills
.

1363
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,237
unfolded without specifications.

1364
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,351
if you did not say free,

1365
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,152
completely free,

1366
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,272
he will be nobody.

1367
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,029
by freeing yourself,

1368
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:03,151
you make the world free.

1369
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:06,030
you said priest.

1370
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,836
your said Revolutionére.

1371
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,872
you said liberator.

1372
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,235
bring your burnt offerings.

1373
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:32,474

1374
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,431

1375
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:49,391

1376
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:53,156

1377
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:26,278
just say it,
you went under the slasher.
.

1378
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,391
that's almost an idea.

1379
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,118
you learn quickly.

1380
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:56,750


1381
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,916


1382
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:14,476


1383
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,311


1384
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:20,193
I've lost it.

1385
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:24,273


1386
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,311


1387
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,112
I was at the doctor.

1388
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:44,635
I will not be able to have children.

1389
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:51,516
and do you know what he said?

1390
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,516
it was the abortion.

1391
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:57,796
no cilia damage.

1392
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:02,793
the holding apparatus is damaged.

1393
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,196
Cervical insufficiency.

1394
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:11,558
we will never come
to the third month.
.

1395
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,959
because...

1396
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:19,794
because he wanted to keep me so pure...

1397
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:24,192
he has erased his own bloodline.

1398
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:35,833
we will not have children, Kurt.

1399
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,754


1400
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,439
your pictures.

1401
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:58,753
your pictures will be our
children, yes?
.

1402
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,673
good.

1403
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,673


1404
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,711


1405
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:22,592


1406
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:35,073
Yes...

1407
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,590
last time,
we discussed the extension...
.

1408
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,279
Ah...

1409
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:47,271
No..  No.. No..

1410
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,274
Ah...

1411
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:04,997
did you all read Lehmbruck

1412
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:11,240
you can see this better with the Episkop.

1413
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,431
yes, Lehmbruck.

1414
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:23,549
he says:

1415
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:28,317
"Every work of art must have something
of the first days of humanity."
.

1416
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:29,919
So...

1417
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:39,398
as if it had just been divine.

1418
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,551
as if it were creeping now...

1419
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:46,354
out of the original mass, out of the rib.

1420
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:49,799
No.

1421
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:52,237
no, no, different, ah...

1422
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:56,280
has anyone of you had
any insight this week?
.

1423
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:57,999
an insight...

1424
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,477
you would like to share with us?

1425
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:13,600
Lotto numbers. 

1426
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:17,798
no, really,  the lottery numbers.

1427
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:22,672
if I now give you six
random numbers...
.

1428
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:28,279
5, 7, 23, 19, 44, 11...

1429
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,716
... then that's stupid.
.

1430
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:35,560
but when I read the winning
numbers of the lottery draw...
.

1431
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,358
may I, please?

1432
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:44,394
2, 17,19,

1433
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:48,594
25, 45, 48 

1434
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,918
yes, then somehow they have something
true, compelling, um...
.

1435
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,796
yes, almost.... beautiful

1436
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,553

1437
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,719
Yes.

1438
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:08,478
that was my...

1439
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:10,839
my insight.

1440
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:30,350
You can go home.
I have nothing for you today.
.

1441
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:35,916
Kurt, will you come here please?

1442
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:55,595
Yes?

1443
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,751
I want to see your art.

1444
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,033
When?

1445
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:04,591
whenever you feel right.
if you are ok with it.
.

1446
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:09,271
just let me know.

1447
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:17,119

1448
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:21,917
why are you considering this at all?

1449
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:25,559
if he likes your work,
you get a gallery.
.

1450
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:29,395
then your girlfriend gets a car.
I'm married.
.

1451
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:32,917
then your wife and
girlfriend will get a car.
.

1452
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:38,114
I just do not know if it's good
enough, what I'm doing here.
.

1453
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:40,157
it's not like that somehow.

1454
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:46,790
that's all subjective, if it was not
subjective, it would be handicraft.
.

1455
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:49,870
it's about luck, you know?

1456
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:52,954
and that he cares
about your stuff,
.

1457
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:55,191
whatever, your luck is.

1458
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:58,079
he does not want to be wrong.

1459
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:01,312
he just wants to see something
genius about your work.
.

1460
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:03,232
do not stand in your own way.

1461
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,114
they are good, the works, really.

1462
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,918
they are good.

1463
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:07,152


1464
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,192


1465
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,632
In the war I was a radio operator 
with the Luftwaffe.
.

1466
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:35,712
I was a miserable radio operator.

1467
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:41,390
and my pilot was a lousy pilot.
we had four weeks of training.
.

1468
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:46,836
on our second mission we were shot
down, over the Crimea.
.

1469
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:48,798
the pilot was killed instantly.

1470
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:50,439


1471
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,036


1472
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:04,357


1473
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:10,833
I was pulled from the wreck by Crimean Tatars

1474
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:15,392
with burns that I should have died of.

1475
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:18,393
the farmers,

1476
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:21,758
the farmers that
I had just bombed,
.

1477
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:23,712
pulled me out of the wreck...

1478
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:27,471
and nursed me with
what they had.
.

1479
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:29,313

1480
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:31,994
they rubbed my wounds with fat...

1481
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:35,270
and wrapped me in felt blankets.

1482
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:38,400


1483
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:46,479
I stayed with them for a year.

1484
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:50,270
after that, I surrendered
to American captivity.
.

1485
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,516
if I ask myself
what I really know,
.

1486
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:13,718
what I really felt in life,

1487
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:17,632
what I can say without reservation...

1488
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:22,193
then it's the fat on my skin.

1489
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:27,034
the home of fat and felt.

1490
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:31,036
when others tell me about love,

1491
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:34,318
to women, to their children,

1492
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:37,996
or sex, then I know what they mean...

1493
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,273
I just know I've felt,
felt and fat on my skin.
.

1494
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:51,550
I have not experienced anything before.

1495
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:56,950
my childhood was happy and gentle.
a few slaps, few.
.

1496
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:59,631
my teachers liked me.

1497
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:02,633
I wanted to be a
merchant, like my father.
.

1498
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:05,269
I had no artistic talent.

1499
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:09,870
and I have not experienced anything since.

1500
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:12,111
I stayed happy.

1501
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:15,670
I spent the end of the war

1502
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,196
in a hospital with
friendly nurses.
.

1503
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:21,112
very friendly.

1504
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:25,751
after that quite fast success
and this professorship here.
.

1505
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,157


1506
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:33,279
but...

1507
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:39,314
the fat and the felt...

1508
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:42,277
I've understood that,

1509
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:45,036
I understood that, as...

1510
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:48,431
how Descartes understood
that he exists.
.

1511
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,591
"So I think I am."

1512
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:55,675
he had everything to worry about. everything.

1513
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:58,832
everything could be illusion,
imagination.
.

1514
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,994
but then he knew that something
was going on with these thoughts.
.

1515
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:06,318
and that consequently
something has to exist.
.

1516
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:09,677
and this something, that's what he calls ..

1517
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,353
"I".

1518
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,671
but who are you?

1519
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,711
what are you?

1520
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:26,793
this......

1521
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,032
you are not.

1522
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:59,476

1523
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:03,391

1524
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:11,110

1525
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:23,719

1526
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:31,914

1527
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:43,432
How was your day?

1528
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:46,153
Productive.

1529
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,113

1530
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:56,715

1531
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:08,357
Villa Cimbrone.

1532
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:15,955
Also Villa Cimbrone.
No, Villa Rufolo.
.

1533
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,191
But also in Ravello.

1534
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:25,799
Oh, the nice car.

1535
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:33,318
The hotel.
Le Sirenuse.
.

1536
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:41,991
Oh, God, Pompeii.

1537
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:47,677


1538
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:51,716


1539
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:56,038


1540
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:01,870
Still studying at the age of 30?

1541
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:04,190
(Ellie) I'll finish them.

1542
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:07,518
When I was 30,
I was a senior physician in Dresden.
.

1543
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:10,590
When Mozart was 30...

1544
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:12,629
he was dead.

1545
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:16,669
(Ellie) I'll take it out.
Should I open the red wine?
.

1546
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:20,549
I understand that
you did not want support.
.

1547
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:22,233
and that is praiseworthy.

1548
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,116
I'll offer you a suggestion.

1549
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:28,591
I know the director of the
Gynecological Clinic Dusseldorf.
.

1550
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:32,031
I am always invited to do
consultations there.
.

1551
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:35,272
I'll get you a
part-time job with them.
.

1552
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:37,078
something suitable.

1553
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:41,874
maybe three hours early in the morning, ok?

1554
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:43,834
Yes

1555
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:46,276
then you will have a income

1556
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:48,829
and still have enough time to...

1557
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,513
to paint.

1558
02:24:57,800 --> 02:25:00,633
Can not he
just leave us alone?
.

1559
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:05,074
Just disappear from our lives?

1560
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:10,715
maybe the job at the
clinic will help.
.

1561
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,754


1562
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:39,309


1563
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:45,751
Kurt Barnert, I come on the
recommendation of Professor Seeband.
.

1564
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:56,596


1565
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:12,834


1566
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:29,192


1567
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:34,390


1568
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:45,910
white on a white background.
is this the new art?
.

1569
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:51,672
"The symbol of emptiness."
that's what you can call it.
.

1570
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,435
maybe it will be a sensation.

1571
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:59,554
Come on, I invite you to dinner.
my driver is waiting outside.
.

1572
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,475


1573
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:32,753
This must be taken to
Bonn to the authorities.
.

1574
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:35,833
so I get my permanent passport.

1575
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,755
it is there ready for pickup.
here is the power of attorney.
.

1576
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:44,312
I thought since you live near Bonn,
you could do it for me?
.

1577
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:47,473
then you can earn extra money.

1578
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:51,474
I'll come back next week
to pick up the passport, yes?
.

1579
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,199
Mhm.

1580
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:57,199
Professor, a coffee?
Yes, thank you.
.

1581
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:00,271

1582
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:04,391
Burghard Kroll caught!

1583
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:09,310
Sick Murderer lived for ten years.
unharmed in Schleswig-Holstein!
.

1584
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,511


1585
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:14,033
Ten pfennigs.

1586
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,639
Thank you.

1587
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:19,633
Sick Murderer ..

1588
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,395
No, thank you.

1589
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:25,912
(Newsboy) Sick Murderer.
Ten pfennigs.
.

1590
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:28,794
Thank you, goodbye.
Ciao.
.

1591
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,389
Professor, a coffee.
Thank you.
.

1592
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:35,077


1593
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:40,189


1594
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,631
You smoke?

1595
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:04,958
63 is an age at which I can start to,
.

1596
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:08,519
the consequences will not
catch up with me.
.

1597
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:22,793
Enjoy your meal.
unfortunately, I have to leave.
.

1598
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,832
Say hello to Ellie.

1599
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:42,432
Good night.
Good night, Professor.
.

1600
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,196


1601
02:30:08,440 --> 02:30:12,195


1602
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:39,671
May I ?
You can take it with you.
I only need the sports section.
.

1603
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:42,235
Thank you.
.

1604
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:12,477
"White on white".

1605
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:15,111
"symbol of emptiness".

1606
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:17,951
your father-in-law?

1607
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:23,071
such an asshole.

1608
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:28,757
you know, for the first time, I wish
success to you more than to myself.
.

1609
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:33,911
your mistake is that you are still
holding on to the canvas and easel.
.

1610
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,471
painting is just dead.

1611
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:38,119
such as...

1612
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:42,069
folk dance or silent film.

1613
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:54,231
I only mean you well,
I want you to stop running like this.
.

1614
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:58,189
we can
not be doctors anymore.
.

1615
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,233


1616
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:17,790


1617

1623

02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:16,274


1630
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:07,070


1631
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:50,629


1632
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,592


1633
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:15,309


1634
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:05,833


1635
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:10,833


1636
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:13,793


1637
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:27,750


1638
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:30,674


1639
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:37,551
Hello. 
Hello.
.

1640
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,115
What's this?

1641
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:46,512
I do not know either,
but I think that's its....
.

1642
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:51,040
photos to be painted?
Yes.
.

1643
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:09,959
Excuse me.

1644
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:48,554


1645
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:36,589


1646
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:40,878


1647
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:46,630


1648
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:02,714


1649
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,990


1650
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:27,080


1651
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:34,711


1652
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:43,436


1653
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:49,833


1654
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,879
I'm satisfied with the
progress of the construction.
.

1655
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:55,600
That's what we
hear, Professor.
.

1656
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:58,798
You know my concerns.
Yes.
.

1657
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:05,469
the total width of the operating room
room door has to be clear on both sides
.

1658
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:08,234
extended it by 25 centimeters.
.

1659
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:11,392
so we can pass easily with beds.

1660
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:16,031
That's right, Professor.
thank you for the suggestion.
.

1661
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:18,350
Has Dr. Weber called?

1662
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:22,272


1663
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:24,717


1664
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:30,877
You understand, I believe,
why I did not introduce you this morning.
.

1665
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:32,872
it would have been inappropriate.

1666
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:37,919
well, what does art do? and more
importantly, do you have my passport?
.

1667
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:42,790

1668
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:48,558

1669
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:51,111

1670
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:05,478

1671
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,150

1672
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,309

1673
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:43,599
I...

1674
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:48,716
I have to go... unfortunately.

1675
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,079
Thank you.

1676
02:48:57,480 --> 02:48:58,675
sorry.

1677
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,274

1678
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:22,596
Have you ever seen anything like this?

1679
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:26,479
what did you tell him?  
why did he leave?
.

1680
02:49:57,200 --> 02:49:58,713

1681
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:00,553

1682
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:05,152

1683
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:10,119

1684
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:12,717

1685
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:17,833

1686
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,116

1687
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:25,039

1688
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:28,909

1689
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:34,035

1690
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:36,834

1691
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:42,356

1692
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:44,719

1693
02:50:45,640 --> 02:50:47,597

1694
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:50,520

1695
02:50:50,680 --> 02:50:54,036

1696
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:56,837

1697
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:07,359

1698
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:27,475

1699
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:39,232
If you knew what you
look like now.
.

1700
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:41,958
I'm pregnant.

1701
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:45,838
fourth month.

1702
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:49,470
I was at the doctor.  
we will be parents.
.

1703
02:51:49,720 --> 02:51:51,996
we will be parents.

1704
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,917

1705
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:58,313

1706
02:51:59,160 --> 02:52:01,231

1707
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:26,511
it's Sunday, no one is here.
I promise you.
.

1708
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:31,030
please, there is nobody here.
.

1709
02:52:32,240 --> 02:52:33,958
please, like yesterday.
.

1710
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:37,752
please tell me again,
and then come down.
.

1711
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:41,351

1712
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,511
I am pregnant.

1713
02:52:55,280 --> 02:52:57,191


1714
02:53:35,960 --> 02:53:38,270
These are not potatoes, eh?

1715
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:44,831
What do you think if I
become your gallery owner?
.

1716
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,674
Adrian Schimmel, the gallery owner?

1717
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:49,275
Adrian Finck.

1718
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:52,279

1719
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:05,955

1720
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,037

1721
02:54:57,440 --> 02:55:02,230
With such exhibitions,
I try to set a backlight.
.

1722
02:55:02,480 --> 02:55:05,233
I'm glad you're here.
Thank you.
.

1723
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:07,756
We should start.

1724
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:14,753
are there any questions
for Kurt Barnert right now?
.

1725
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:19,959
maybe then I will ask
the first question.
.

1726
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:21,440
Mr. Barnert,

1727
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:26,720
many of your pictures are painted
from amateur fotos or illustrated.
.

1728
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:30,669
the picture "Act on a staircase", ..

1729
02:55:31,800 --> 02:55:34,713
that's a tribute to Duchamp?

1730
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:40,360
Yes.

1731
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:42,636

1732
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:47,029
Heinz Viersen, West German newspaper.

1733
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:48,395
Mr. Barnert,

1734
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:53,111
in your magnificent painting "Mother
and Child", which we see here...
.

1735
02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:56,000
who is represented?  your mother and you?

1736
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:01,394
No, that's just an amateur foto.

1737
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:07,040
I do not really care about who I paint.

1738
02:56:07,240 --> 02:56:11,677
but if you paint a portrait,
then you need to know the person.
.

1739
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:14,719
it's even better if
I do not know them.
.

1740
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:17,834
then I can better see what's really there.

1741
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:23,716
also the picture with the
passport photos from the machine?
.

1742
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:26,070
a photo without an author?

1743
02:56:28,360 --> 02:56:29,475
Yes.

1744
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:31,958
with the Wehrmacht officer

1745
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:34,680
do you make any statement
about the Wehrmacht?
.

1746
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:37,912
No, I do not make statements.
I'm doing, um...
.

1747
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:39,434
Images.

1748
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:42,513
so, photos... Photos by other means.

1749
02:56:43,320 --> 02:56:45,311
Hermann Schreiber, SDR.

1750
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:49,879
they also take on the exact
composition of the amateur photo.
.

1751
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:52,436
there is a lot of coincidence.

1752
02:56:53,560 --> 02:56:55,915
No, not coincidentally.  Hmm...

1753
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,640
reality, harmonious, genuine

1754
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:05,431
only reality is coherent.
every reality is coherent.
.

1755
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,589
everything that's true is already true.

1756
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:11,791
(Viersen) What do you mean?

1757
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:16,319
Hm...

1758
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,320
if I now name six numbers,

1759
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:22,591
then that's stupid, meaningless.

1760
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:24,558
if the six numbers are

1761
02:57:24,720 --> 02:57:28,509
the winning numbers from the lottery
draw, then you have the sense,
.

1762
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:32,355
a coherence, a value,
yes, almost a beauty.
.

1763
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:34,671
that's the same with the photos.

1764
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:37,191
I want the truth.

1765
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:43,112
look.

1766
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:50,480

1767
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:53,194

1768
02:57:53,440 --> 02:57:54,919

1769
02:57:55,720 --> 02:57:57,154
Yes, Mr. Meybert?

1770
02:57:57,960 --> 02:58:00,349
Urs Meybert, art chronicle.

1771
02:58:01,160 --> 02:58:05,472
what's next for you?
still blurred painted pictures?
.

1772
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:08,439
no, I have enough of that now.
.

1773
02:58:08,600 --> 02:58:11,558
I am currently interested
in color plates.
.

1774
02:58:11,720 --> 02:58:13,393
(Meybert) Color plates?

1775
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:14,914
Yes.

1776
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:21,074
(Cameraman) We're going to get into trouble.

1777
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:26,751
still we get in trouble.

1778
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:37,118
Randomly chosen illustrated pictures,
passport photos of the machine,
.

1779
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:40,352
and snapshots from
family albums.
.

1780
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:42,870
everything is out of focus.

1781
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:44,793
with such pictures,

1782
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:48,351
that have a real power
for unknowable reasons,
.

1783
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:50,158
Kurt Barnert seems

1784
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:53,990
to be the leading
artist of his generation.
.

1785
02:58:54,200 --> 02:58:56,760
and that with the dead-crazy painting.

1786
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,354
but...

1787
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:03,071
how many in his generation has
nothing to tell, nothing to say.
.

1788
02:59:03,240 --> 02:59:05,356
he breaks away from any tradition,

1789
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:08,831
says goodbye to the
biographical approach in art
.

1790
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:12,197
and thus creates for the
first time in art history
.

1791
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:15,079
a work without an author.

1792
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:18,789
Was that good?
That was great.
.

1793
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:26,239

1794
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:27,919

1795
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:34,189
Are you sure, I can not drive you?

1796
02:59:34,360 --> 02:59:36,749
I'd like to walk a bit.

1797
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:40,477

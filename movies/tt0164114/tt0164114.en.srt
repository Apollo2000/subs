1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,150
Oh, man.

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,150
- I am so wired.
- More so than usual?

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,710
Way more.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,280
I made a model of centennial
last night complete with guests.

5
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:50,230
I stayed up all night.

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,870
I've got the entire thing
planned out, every detail.

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,830
You didn't sleep?
You should have slept.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,670
I'm a freak, aren't I?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,270
No, you're just very... focused.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,110
Exactly. So what do you think
of my mom's red halter?

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,630
For your interview today?
It's a little slutty.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,950
Let me rephrase. What do you think
Brad'll think of my mom's red halter?

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,270
I think Brad has
better taste than that.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,110
Really?
Okay, see you in a minute.

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,150
Got milk?

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,750
Thanks a lot.
You're a lifesaver.

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,070
- You're welcome.
- Sorry about that.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,110
It's goat's milk.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,630
Dad, bring the milk home.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,990
Come on, Dad. Come on.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,390
Dad, can I take the milk
off your hands?

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,990
- Good morning, Chase.
- Good morning, Mrs. Maris.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,310
Mom, can I borrow
your red halter?

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,190
Would you look at that?

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,430
They'll be away at college next year.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,750
Time flies.

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,070
Seems like only yesterday
they were practically living together

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,950
in that old tree house.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,350
- Dad, milk.
- Mom.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,830
Seriously, you two used to do
everything together.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,350
What happened?

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,910
Junior high happened.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,070

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,910

Wake up, Time Zone High.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
- Morning, Tom.
- Morning, Sue.

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,950
Our top story: Centennial.
Only two months to go.

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,990
And as the 100th anniversary
of TZH approaches,

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,150
- excitement mounts.
- That's right, Sue.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,390
And here to take
that excitement up a notch

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,110
is a "Wake Up, Time Zone" special:

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,750
Centennial... your 100-year event.

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,830
In only six weeks,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,710
it will be exactly 100 years
since Timothy Zonin

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,590
founded Timothy Zonin High.

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,830
And both students
and alumni alike are preparing

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,990
an unforgettable Centennial Week.

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,190
Centennial Committee spokesperson
Nicole Maris expects a huge cro

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,710
Our centennial bash is the culmination
of a weeklong series of events.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,910
It's gonna be the greatest night
of our lives.

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,190
Something this big only comes along
once every hundred years.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,030
We're making the most of it
so you can make the most of it.

81
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,110
So, where are we
on the senior class skit?

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,350
- Are we doing the sculpture idea?
- Yes, it's a good idea.

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,830
Nicole, how's the rest
of the budget looking?

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,750
- $16,372...
- Good, we'll need it.

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,790
Rupert and I are working
on a deal for a jumbo screen.

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,710
- It's sick.
- Are parents invited or only alumni?

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,350
Both. Tradition.
Everyone's invited.

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,870
Why are we doing this again?

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,390
- As a protest.
- Of what?

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,870
- People, right?
- Sheep.

91
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,270
Check, Dave.
We're doing this to protest sheep.

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,400
And what specifically
about sheep do we object to?

93
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,615
- Chase.
- General herding mentality.

94
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,950
Man, look at 'em down there.
Yeah, drink your mochaccinos.

95
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,470
Sing along to Céline Dion.

- Sprinklers.
- Exactly.

- Us guys.
- That's right.

115

Sprinklers.

Not you, Ednasi.
These two recidivists.

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,830
Come on.
Sprinklers with orange water.

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,670
If anything's to blame,
it's school spirit.

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,430
He's right. School spirit...
there's your culprit.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,950
You, remove the shades,
stand up.

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,950
- You, too, Chase.
- Me?

124
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,790
I need a comparison.

125
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,830
I always forget.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,990
Are the pupils supposed
to be smaller or bigger?

127

When the orange water hit

I almost cried,
I was laughing so hard.

But you never laugh.

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,830
What are you doing?

144
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,910
Just waiting for my dad.
Our monthly meeting.

145
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,230
You know, to keep in touch
every fourth Friday, 4:00.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,390
- At least that's the plan.
- That's cool.

147
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,550
You were really good on TV today,
talking about centennial and all.

148
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,790
Thanks.

149
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,390
Well, it's a lot of work,
but it's worth it.

Hey...

151
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,230
do you wanna go to...

152
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,750
down to Shoe World with me?

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,630
Shoe World.

154
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,590
I can't. My dad.

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,390
But he's always late.
You wanna help me finish these fries?

156
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,390
I'd better not get in the way.

157
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
I gotta pick up some new kicks
for the game tonight.

158
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,710
Okay. Well, I'll see you there.

159
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,750
You're coming! Right on.

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,750
It's a time-out for the Tigers!

161
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,110
Why hasn't he asked me yet?

162
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,950
Well, there is one other option
for Bradley's centennial date.

163
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,670
You said the whole provincial event
barely registers on your radar,

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,150
that you'd be happy
to go with toast.

165
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,230
I said Brad has
all the appeal of toast.

166
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,240
- There's a difference.
- Come on, look at him.

167
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,310
Yeah?

168
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,510
All I'm saying is that
there's a process.

169
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,790
Sure, it's not written down, but I have
given all the appropriate signs,

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,470
and Brad knows the rules.

171
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,110
Look, it's Designated Dave.

172
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,670
Alicia, I've got a message
from Brad.

173
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,950
Can I talk to you
for a second in private?

174
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,950
The fact of the matter is that
the Chinese government

175
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,630
is so afraid of the Dalai Lama,

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,270
they actually outlawed
his likeness.

177
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,190
So, Ray, when are you gonna
take over "Wake Up, Time Zone"

178
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,990
and get some real moves on?

179
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,310
It's all that school spirit
bullshit propaganda.

180
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,950
Excitement mounts
as centennial nears.

181
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,510
Ray is a plotter.

182
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,270
Watch. You'll see.

183
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,960
One day we're gonna look up
in homeroom

184
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:02,190
- and "Wake Up, Time Zone" will be...
- Vivisection.

185
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,710
- Completely revolutionized.
- Hi, I'm Joshua Hill,

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,510
from the university's chapter
of ALF.

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,830
- That's Animal Liberation Front.
- Alf?

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
I think when you see what I'm about
to show you what's going on

189
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,990
in our laboratories
right here on campus,

190
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,070
you'll understand why we're taking
just a few minutes of your time.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,670
Lights.

192
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,590
"Biomedical research"...
that's the two-word excuse...

193
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,310
- you ready to go, go, go?
- Chase, I wanna see this.

194
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,710
When asked about the abuses
taking place in the laboratory...

195
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,310
Defense! Defense! Defense!

196
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,430
Seldon appears to be okay,

197
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,270
but it's a time-out for the Tigers.

198
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,390
- I hope he's not hurt.
- Yeah, me, too.

199
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,790
I'm thrilled to report Brad's exercised
the next element of protocol.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,150
Dave was an emissary?

201
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,510
He asked me if I thought
if Brad asked you

202
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,790
to share the evening
and if you'd say yes.

203
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,110
- And?
- And so I told him to tell Brad

204
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,790
that you said that a real man
works without a net.

205
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,870
- You what?
- Relax. He's all yours.

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,270

209
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,870
Chase, do you have
to get so close?

210
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,350
- Closer is louder!
- That's my point!

211
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,510
- Mine, too.
- We can't talk up there.

212
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,950
We talked in the car.

213
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,990
Is something in particular
on your mind?

214
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,480
I just don't see why you won't come
with us tomorrow night.

215
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,630
- To ALF?
- Come on, it's right up your alley.

216
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,470
I told you already.
I'm not interested. Drop it.

217
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,150
Look, you go, okay?
Knock yourself out.

218
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,990
I don't get you.

219
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,990
I mean, you spend half your life
in detention protesting Hanson

220
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
- or the constipated hitter...
- Designated hitter.

221
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,510
Whatever.

222
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,990
But when it comes to something
really important...

223
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,110
What?

224
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,790
You think you're
so James Dean, Chase.

225
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,510
But all this so-called rebellion...
it's a joke.

226
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,950
We're breaking up, aren't we?

227
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,350
I just think that we're headed
in different directions.

228
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,190
That's all.

229

You didn't get out of bed all day.

236

237
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,750
"Son, are you ill?"

238
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,510
- Are you?
- No.

Are you stoned?

240
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,430
You could tell me, you know.
I'd be cool.

241
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,110
Yeah, I know you'd be cool.

And what is that
supposed to mean?

Yeah. Fries, a Coke and...

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,110
Violence anticipated.

319
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,150
There are rules, you know?

320
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,270
- Rules?
- Rules.

321
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,990
- What rules?
- Seniors rule!

322
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,440
You don't send Designated Dave
to ask if I'll go with you

323
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,600
if you don't plan on
following through with the offer.

324
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,030
I was going to. I was going to.

325
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,670
It's just that...

326
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,630
- He just...
- Shut up!

327
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,950
I don't know.
I... I fell in love.

328
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,390
So I heard.

329
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,550
High school love is for saps, Brad,
or haven't you heard?

330
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,790
Now I'm left alone with
the embarrassment and alienation

331
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,070
of having to go stag to one
of the biggest nights of our lives?

332
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,590
Not very likely.
I might as well skip it.

333
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,390
Turn that thing off or I'm gonna go
Sean young on your ass!

334
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,350
I think she means Sean Penn.

335
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,550
That's good. Sean young scares me.

336
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,870
Yuck it up, clowns.

337
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,390
Yeah, if you enjoy
my humiliation,

338
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,440
Monday at Time Zone
should be a real "hootenin."

339
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:47,190
It's hootenanny.

340
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,390
I'm sorry. Look, I...

341
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,910
Hey, can you just
drop me off here?

342
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,160
But we're still a couple blocks
away from your house.

343
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,895
You heard the man.

344
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,230
- Okay, bye, meng.
- Vaya con dios.

345
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,270
- Later, Chase.
- Nicole, wait.

346
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,870
If your mom's awake,
she's gonna see right through

347
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,110
that Dean Martin impression.

348
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,390
I'll sneak you through the back.

349
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,790
What?

350
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,710
Her car's not here.

351
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,030
She's not home.

352
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,030

Take me to centennial, Chase.

373
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,430
Nicole?

374
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,790
- How'd you get this number?
- I remembered it.

375
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,350
Take me?

376
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,350
- You're drunk.
- I'm desperate.

377
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,310
Well, when you put it that way.

378
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,470
You're not offended,
so don't pretend to be.

379
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,270
My guess... you're intrigued.

380
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,230
- I am?
- Word's out, Dulcie dropped you.

381
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,510
- Yeah, well...
- Well, you have a tiny idea how I feel.

382
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,400
Look, I know you probably
don't give a damn

383
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,630
about the centennial or me,

384
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,110
and that's fine,
but starting Monday,

385
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,390
I'm gonna be treated like
the biggest loser ever at Time Zone.

386
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,190
The same girls dishing out
fake sympathy

387
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,430
will be laughing behind my back.

388
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
Some of them will try
to set me up out of pity,

389
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,370
but I'll know every time I walk
in a room and it gets suddenly quiet,

390
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,990
they were just talking about
my monumental failure.

391
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,870
We can save each other
from disgrace.

392
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,230
Each other? What's in it for me?

393
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,390
If you have to ask,

394
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,430
you're not as smart
as you think you are.

395
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,550
You need to sleep on it,
get back to me.

396
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,350
Hey, it's Dulcie.

397
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,480
If you want me to get back to you,
leave three ways that high school sucks.

398
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,950
There's the rampant homophobia,
no pep rallies for the debate team,

399
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,270
which leads to the greater issue,
I'm sure,

400
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,350
of the highly fascist nature
of pep rallies in general,

401
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,030
speeches, saluting banners.

402
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,950
I think you see
where I'm going with this.

403
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,270
And finally, it sucks

404
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,230
because when you break up
with someone,

405
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,670
you can't escape them,

406
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,350
and it kills you
to see them every day.

407
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,390
Dulcie, call me tonight.

408
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,670
I don't care what time...

409
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,310
Let's agree on an easy-out clause.

410
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,790
Obviously.

411
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,030
We can't do this halfway.

412
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,760
You know, if we expect
people to buy it,

413
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:45,510
it's gotta feel real
through and through.

414
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,870
That makes sense.

415
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,230
If you really wanna get Dulcie back,

416
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,030
it's gonna require
some severe measures.

417
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,110
Define "severe."

418
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,710
To start, you can't wear

419
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,710
anything you own.

420
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,710
Probably not.

421
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,990
Not and...
we need to clean you up.

422
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,790
How up are we talking about?

423
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,110
Listen, Chase,

424
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,150
to make an impact,
you have to go to extremes.

425
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,390
Let's do it.

426
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,550

- Nicole?
- Hey, Ray.

440
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,470
Hey. Look, I just want you to know
that I know you're screwed.

441
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,950
About the dance, I mean.

442
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,470
And, well, I guess
what I'm trying to say is that

443
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,870
if it comes down to panic time
and you still don't have a date,

444
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,310
and you're, like, really desperate,

445
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,150
well, I'd take you.

446
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,990
I'd be honored.

447
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,190
That's sweet, Ray,

448
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,840
but, well, when Chase and I got out
of the car the other night,

449
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,470
we kind of decided
we'd go together.

450
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,190
Chase? My Chase?

451
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,110
I got it.

452
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,880
Hey, this is funnier
than you dressing up

453
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,590
for last year's
Junior Miss Pageant, man.

454
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,310
Ray. Hey, Nicole.

455
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,510
So I'm glad to see you're out
of your doldrums.

456
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,510
That hair, guy, is just...

457
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,910
Hey, so, Nicole,
remember what I said.

458
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,430
I'm serious. If you want.

459
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,590
Well, this is real convincing.
I'm a walking punch line.

460
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,030
But who gets the last laugh?
See you after school, hon.

461
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,510
Shit. Hurry, Dave.
I promised Ray we'd take him to work.

462
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,120
Are you going to explain this to me?

463
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,350
- Explain what?
- This. What are you trying to pull?

464
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,800
Nothing. It's a big-ass mistake.

465
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,520
I thought it would make
Dulcie come back.

466
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:46,670
Seriously? How?

467
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,320
Can you think of anything
that would make Dulcie freak out more

468
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,230
than me with
"Miss School Spirit" Nicole Maris?

469
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,390
- He still thinks I'm joking.
- So what are you doing?

470
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,990
You know, to make an impact,
you have to go to extremes.

471
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,510
Did I just hear something
about extremes?

472
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,190
It's real extreme, all right.

473
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,430
Why'd you do it?

474
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,550
Time for a change.

475
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,350
It's not you.

476
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,030
Who knows who I am?

477
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,470
I do.

478
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,110
Don't let Nicole Maris change you.

479
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,070
I'll be all right.

480
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,550
Yeah.

481
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,190
Dave, do you mind
stopping off at the mall?

482
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,030
I wanna pick up a Swatch.

483
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,190
Nicole, can you come
in here, honey?

484
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,910
So, what are we burning today?

485
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,630
Fields of Jasmine
for improved circulation?

486
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,550
Strawberry Explosion
for brain power?

487
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,830
- Your dad called.
- Why?

488
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,990
He said that he'll meet you
at 12:00 noon on Sunday

489
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,510
at Jefferson Park.

490
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,390
He promised he'd show up
this time.

491
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,950
So get out there
and support the Tigers

492
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,640
on their march
to a state championship.

493
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,375
- Look, we're going to that.
- A basketball game?

494
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,560
That wasn't part
of the arrangement.

495
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,630
A necessary evil, Chase.

496
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,470
We have to look chummy,
remember?

497
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,590
And the benefit of that?

498
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,150
We're in this together.

499
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,710
From my point of view,

500
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,240
it's okay to look like I'm going
to the dance with a friend.

501
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:35,470
It's not okay to look like
I paid a guy to take me.

502
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,070
I could be getting paid?

503
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,070
Yeah!

504
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,470
So, how does it compare?

505
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,590
To what?

506
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,150
Protests, clove cigarettes,
bongos...

507
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,430
- whatever it is you beatniks do.
- We prefer "disaffected youth."

508
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,510
Okay, so...

509
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,190
More pep.

510
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,070
The monopoly on pep
is definitely held

511
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,270
by Time Zone's status whores.

512
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,390
We prefer socially non-retarded.

513
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,870
Go! Fight! Win!

514
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,830
I'm gonna get something to drink.

515
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,190
- Do you want anything?
- No, but thanks.

516
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,950
- Pellegrino. With a twist.
- All right.

517
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,870
- All right, spill.
- Spill what?

518
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,000
It's cute and all making nice
with your neighbor,

519
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,310
but you're taking it
way above and beyond.

520
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,510
Above and beyond what?

521
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,430
- The boy cleans up nicely.
- Pretty shocking?

522
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,550
Maybe. Or maybe
you haven't given up.

523
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,750
- Given up?
- A perfect night with a dream date.

524
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,830
Brad? Over it.

525
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,830
So, this Chase Hammond thing...

526
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,390
he's just this good friend
we never knew you had?

527
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,990
Right.

528
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,430
Who knows? Maybe more.

529
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,470
How can you be against
the designated hitter?

530
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,790
Do you wanna see Cecil Fielder
gunning for his 120th RBI

531
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,110
or some fast-ass relief pitcher
swinging at air?

532
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,310
I think Fielder is a perfect example...
a past-his-prime power hitter

533
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,070
in the twilight of his career
using up a roster spot.

534
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,080
You know what?
Someday that's gonna be Griffey.

535
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,710
And I would rather see Junior at 40
than some Jim Bob

536
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,910
who made it to the show
because of an expansion.

537
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,990
That's very nostalgic, but it comes
down to one simple issue...

538
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,430
- purity of the game.
- Exactly.

539
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,350
I've been trying
to tell you that, man.

540
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,950
If you can't hack it,
get out of the game, right?

541
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,590
Go! Fight! Win!

542
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,190
Go! Fight...

543
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,350
Defense! Defense! Defense!

544
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,470
One more eye, ref,
you'd be a Cyclops!

545
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,110
Go Tigers!

546
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,950
Pass!

547
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,590
And it's good! Tigers take it 70-68.

548
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,390
- Masterful.
- What?

549
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,990
You really had me going in there.
"Go! Fight! Win!"

550
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,110
I about choked.
I bow down to the king of scams.

551
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,630
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Thank you. Thank you.

552
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,440
- Think you could stand anymore?
- Well, what did you have in mind?

553
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,550
Cruising Broad Street.

554
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,710
I thought you had to have
a letterjacket for that.

555
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,230
That's just to nail cheerleaders.

556
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,190
Don't worry.
You'll fit right in.

557
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,910
Bad-ass ride, Chase.

558
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,750
Yeah, every time
Halley's Comet flies,

559
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,910
my dad lets me take it
out of the garage.

560
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,750
I had to leave a spleen on deposit.

561
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,230
Well, if Alicia sees it,
she's gonna wanna jump you.

562
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,550
Yeah, what's the deal
with that chick?

563
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,990
Word on the street,
she sleeps in a casket.

564
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,950
- "Word on the street"?
- Yeah, the chick's evil.

565
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,670
Evil's a bit strong.

566
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,630
Limited bullshit tolerance
is more like it, but you're a guy.

567
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,630
You wouldn't understand.

568
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,790
Time Zone... 70, losers... 68.

569
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,670
Honk your horn, Hambone!

570
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,110
Honk, Chase.

571
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,750
Go Tigers!

572
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,710
I wouldn't understand what?

573
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,150
Well, when guys compete,
it's overt.

574
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,270
You know, ringing a bell
with a sledgehammer

575
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,070
or loogie chucking,
the size of your engine, whatever.

576
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,630
Yeah?

577
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,590
Well, when girls compete, it's art.

578
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,270

Nicole.

592
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,870
Are you and Chase Hammond
a couple?

593
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,750
I saw you cruising together.

594
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,790
He's my next-door neighbor.

595
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,230
Okay, so he's not your boyfriend
or anything, right?

596
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,590
Mr. Maris.

597
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,510
That hurts, baby.

598
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,550
Tell me about it.

599
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,470
Come for a ride with me.

600
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,310
- So, any special boy these days?
- Not likely.

601
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,241
I have some pretty serious trust issues
when it comes to the male sex.

602
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,350
I wonder where it comes from.

603
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,750
I want you to have this.
This might explain me better than I can.

604
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,270
"Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance"?

605
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,910
This is supposed to explain
why you're never around?

606
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,830
Must be a hell of a book.

607
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,310
First two weeks of November

608
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,430
I am going to a huge
ballooning festival in Rio.

609
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,870
I want you to come.

610
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,310
This is the trip of a lifetime.
What do you say?

611
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,110
There's this little centennial thing
I'm kind of involved in,

612
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,870
but, well, you wouldn't know
anything about it.

613
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,830
Yeah, 14 times.

614
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,150
- Hey, Nicole?
- Yeah.

615
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,870
Hi. I'm... I'm...

616
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,990
you're in charge of bands
for the centennial, right?

617
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,190
I am.

618
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,470
♪ See that boy,
he looks so fine ♪

619

621

- What's this?
- It's the Electrocutes.

622
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,510
- It's the best band in town.
- Stylish.

623
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,790
- Thanks.
- You made this?

624
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,630
Yeah.

625
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,630
So, how do you like the band?

626
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,110
They rock, but I doubt
they're up on their Brandy.

627
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,670
Brandy?
There's a sister with edge.

628
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,950
That's the direction
the committee's going, Ray...

629
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,670
quality with mass appeal.

630
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,150
Can you say oxymoron?

631
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,190
My brothers!

632
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,150
Look, Dave. It's Ken doll.

633
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,710
Yeah, aren't you losing
reputation points

634
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,000
just being this close to us?

635
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,550
Hey, guys, I'm pulling off
the biggest scam of all time,

636
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,870
and I'm catching shit?

637
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,350
Don't you see?
I've entered into their world.

638
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,350
Did you leave bread crumbs?

639
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,670
Glow in the dark.

640
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,510
Hey, Electrocutes tonight
at the Pit.

641
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,310
Yeah, I'll be there. Wait.

642
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,070
- I told Nicole that...
- yeah, it's a scam, all right,

643
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,270
- but who's scamming who?
- Whom.

644
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,040
- Whatever, man.
- Think about it, Chase.

645
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:17,150
You have all the duties of a girlfriend
and none of the perks.

646
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,630
You're not getting
any perks, are you?

647
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,680
Hey, Hambone,
you're coming tonight, right, man?

648
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,990
- Oh, yeah, we'll be there.
- All right, man!

649
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,390
- Hambone?
- He really has entered their world.

650
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,390
14 times!

651
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,630
No, seriously,
who would you rather do,

652
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,990
Agent Scully or Gillian Anderson?

653
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,590
They're the same person,
brainiac.

654
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,110
Eddie, please.

655
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,790
Hambone?

656
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,030
Flakey, self-absorbed,
neurotic actress type

657
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,390
or gun-toting, badass FBI agent

658
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,670
with years of pent-up
sexual frustration?

659
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,270
- Not even close.
- My man.

660
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,110
What I wouldn't do to Scully.

661
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,310
I'm sure she's been
drooled on before.

662
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,270
Jealous.

663
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,350
Order number nine is up.

664
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,910
Number nine. Number nine.

665
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,870
Can you believe
that the assistant manager

666
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,270
of our basketball team actually has
his own "X-Files" website?

667
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,510
And he invited me over to his house
to check it out.

668
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,110
His name's Dave.

669
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,430
What?

670
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,630
You know, man. Designated Dave.

671
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,110
You know,
the safe ride guy, right?

672
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,670
No, it's not Designated Dave.
It's plain Dave.

673
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,510
No "designated." Just Dave.

674
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,670
All right, plain Dave it is.

675
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,550
Chase, I left my bag in the car.

676
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,390
Help me find it?

677
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,430
So, what was that about?

678
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,280
Dave probably saved half their lives,
and they're making fun of him.

679
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:49,830
- Typical.
- Typical of what?

680
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,670
Is this more "us/them" rhetoric?

681
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,750
- Well, if the tiara fits...
- Come on, Chase.

682
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,830
Can you honestly tell me
you've never made fun

683
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,470
of those people over there?

684
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,430
No, that's different.

685
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,630
- How?
- Think about it.

686
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,070
We laugh when it's the boss
or the debutante

687
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,670
who slipped on a banana peel,
not Tiny Tim.

688
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,150
So you're calling Dave
"Tiny Tim"?

689
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,550
- Don't do that.
- It's okay for you to put him down.

690
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,270
I don't need this, not from you.
You're better than this.

691
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,350
What makes you say that?

692
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,070
Fifth grade...

693
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,390
the first year the teachers
start making us

694
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,800
write Valentines to each other.

695
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:31,070
- Yeah.
- Dave got one card.

696
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,710
"I'm bananas about you.
Love, Nicole."

697
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,470
How do you remember that?

698
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,830
- I just do. I'm out of here.
- Don't.

699
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,590
Look, if you leave mad,
it sets us back.

700
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,670
It doesn't set me back.
Don't know how I got myself into this.

701
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,310
So far, the payback's
been minimal.

702
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,710
It's all about you...
your friends and your turf.

703
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,390
- My turf?
- Nicole.

704
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,550
Okay. You're right.

705
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,750
First, come back.

706
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,230
Be the charmer
we both know you can be.

707
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,910
And then we'll go
wherever you wanna go.

708
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,550

724
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,830
Yeah, from the slumber party
last weekend.

725
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,110
- We painted each other's toenails.
- Look, why don't you girls just...

726
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,270
And then we played
Truth or Dare, remember?

727
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,230
You two admitted
liking Alanis Morissette

728
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,590
before the record went platinum.

729
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,950

- You did, too.

- So where's Dulcie?
- She'll probably be by later.

Yeah, she is. Thanks.

752

You know,
it's really cool that you say that.

I mean, it really is,

like, really good friends.

759
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,190
Best of, but everyone knows
Nicole's a lot of talk

760
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,350
and very little action.

761
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,670
Yeah, but a lot of girls
are like that.

762
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,910

00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,070
She said she was
at the other Nyble flick.

791
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,670
We were at the wrong theater.

792
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,470
So when's the big hookup?

793
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,470
I don't know.
I'm having second thoughts.

794
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,320
I don't think I could take it
if she saw me

795
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,920
and I saw this reaction
on her face...

796
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,560
- you know, gross disappointment.
- Dave, it's not about looks.

797
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,150
And that's what
the Tooth Fairy was just saying.

798
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,400
Hey, I'm doing a student poll
for the yearbook staff.

799
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,550
We are doing a student poll
for the yearbook staff.

800
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,070
Cool. Shoot.

801
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,750
So what's your idea
of a perfect date?

802
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,190
Date... series of activities,
or date... person?

803
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,430
- Person.
- Activities.

804
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,910
- The person.
- All right.

805
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,390
She's the kind of girl
who will call you on your bullshit.

806
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,790
She's not afraid to dance.
She offers to pay.

807
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,750
She doesn't decide before a date
whether she's gonna kiss you or not.

808
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,150
She's not completely earnest,
yet she's not completely ironic,

809
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,270
Four grand is a good deal
for a jumbotron.

810
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,040
I'd rather take the overage out
of decorations than entertainment.

811
00:47:43,065 --> 00:47:44,150
We'll lose the smoke.

812
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,230
We got a Brandy-style cover band
that is so right, but they cost.

813
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,910
Nicole, where are we budget-wise?

814
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,870
Anyone got a stun gun?
Hello, Nicole?

815
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,070
Yeah.

816
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,670
How much money do we have left
for decorations?

817
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,790
The info's in my locker.
I'll figure it out later.

818
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,110
Okay, I'll go get it now.

819
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,070
What's up with Nicole?

820
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,710
- I think she's in love.
- Well, they are a cute couple.

821
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,630
She orders dessert,

822
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,870
and she can be ready
in 10 minutes.

823
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,910
Well, we will have to change
that "bullshit" to "bull."

824
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,150
Well, then use "pretensions."

825
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,310
Okay.

826
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,310
Who are you?

827
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,110
So, what's this I hear about you
and Chase Hammond?

828
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,630
What do you hear?

829
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,830
- You're an item.
- Item?

830
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,630
Where do you get your news?

831
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,520
Mothers and daughters
should confide, honey.

832
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:58,230
We saw a band.
We're going to a dance.

833
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,150
I don't think he's such
a good idea, Nicole.

834
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,190
- Why not?
- You're neighbors, for one thing.

835
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,910
- And another thing is...
- Yeah?

836
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,350
He's too tall for you.

837
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,430
Oh, Mom.

838
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,310
It'll be okay.

839
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,630
Do you like 'em?
They're the latest.

840
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,910
Yeah, they're great. Thanks.

841
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,200
We're leaving early tomorrow.
You need me to call you?

842
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,830
No, I'm fine.
I'm not even tired.

843
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,670
Hey, you feel like a walk?

844
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,950
Some of us require
beauty sleep, Chase.

845
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,190
I'll let you get that.

846
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,230
See you tomorrow.

847
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,870
Hambone.

848
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,550
Dickweed.

849
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,240
You gotta see
what I'm working on, guy.

850
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,990
Better yet, I'm offering you
a chance to participate.

851
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,150
What is it?

852
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,030
My man, you've gotta
see this to believe it.

853
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,030
I got the editing room reserved
all day tomorrow.

854
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,190
I'm... I'm all booked.

855
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,390
Bread crumbs, mi amigo.

856
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,590

Look at 'em down there,
talking about us.

865
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,870
Saying what, Eddie?

866
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,590
You know, "He's cute."

867
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,790
He's sweet. He's built."

868
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,070
He primps.

869
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,990
Eddie takes longer
to get ready to go out than I do.

870
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,150
And he gets mad at me
for making him wait?

871
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,910
But I do my share
of waiting, too, all right.

872
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,230
Well, how long are you
gonna make him wait?

873
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,750
The key to pleasing a woman
is sweet talk.

874
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,950
"You're so beautiful."

875
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,590
"Have you lost weight?"

876
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,150
And then there
are the three words

877
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,630
- that always seal the deal for me...
- "Another tequila shot?"

878
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,910
Come on, Nicole,
we're bonding here. Dish, girl.

879
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,110
Chase Hammond... big hands,

880
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,790
big feet, you know?

881
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,670
- Hey, Bo.
- It's Dee.

882
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,710
Yeah.

883
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,990
Sorry about that.

884
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,030
- It never was Bo.
- Oh, really?

885
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,720
- I thought it was always...
- When you're 40 pounds overweight

886
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:41,830
and your last name's Vine,

887
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,990
it doesn't take people long
to land on a nickname.

888
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,790
Your parents named you
"Dee Vine"?

889
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,030
No, Dee's a contraction.
I changed it myself.

890
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,710
And no one said anything?

891
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,110
You should go into politics.

892
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,270
After I dropped the weight,
dyed my hair,

893
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,910
got contacts,
I just kind of giggle and say,

894
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,510
"Oh, yeah, so and so
started calling me Dee."

895
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,640
Just kept attributing it
to whoever wasn't around

896
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,430
and pretty soon,
well, here I am.

897
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,190
Dee Vine.
And now Miss Time Zone.

898
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,310
So, why share
all this juiciness with me?

899
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,870
We're kindred, Hambone.

900
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,550
You think you're happier now?

901
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,830
I don't know. Do you?

902
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,550
Jury's still out.

903
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,670
It may have been a short list,
but before I became what I am now,

904
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,390
at least I knew who cared
about me.

905
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,190
Really cared.

906
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,350
That's much better!

907
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,910
Oh, boy, yeah!

908
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,110
Hey, Kathy.

909
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,470
Hey, Kathy!
Have you been over to Brad's?

910
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,390
Yeah. It's nice.

911
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,310
Weird?
His family seems so normal.

912
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,590
You'd never guess they belong
to one of those doomsday cults.

913
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,230
Are you serious?

914
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,230
Nicole, better grab
Captain Kangaroo.

915
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,310
I swear,
I can't take him anywhere.

916
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,070
- Hang loose, Hambone!
- 'Night!

917
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,470
You know,

918
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,350
I still have the letter you wrote me
in seventh grade.

919
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,870
Burn it.

920
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,670
You said...
you said you hated me,

921
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,470
and there was something in there
about how the only way

922
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,000
you'd ever touch me again
was if you came down with leprosy.

923
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:03,310
Yeah, sorry about that.

924
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,310
Don't be. I deserved it.

925
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,470
I'm the one who should be sorry.

926
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,790
- Chase, when your mom got sick...
- Please, Nicole, let's not do this.

927
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,510
I want to.

928
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,790
I've wanted to say this
for five years now.

929
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,950
When your mom got sick,

930
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,830
I couldn't bear to go over
to your house.

931
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,710
It was too hard.
I was too scared.

932
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,510
I just wanted to cry all the time

933
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,070
every time I saw her,

934
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,670
every time I saw you.

935
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,960
Even when we were together,
you wouldn't say anything.

936
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:42,870
You'd just sit there.

937
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,950
So, when you started wigging out
in school, skipping,

938
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,350
pulling the fire alarms,

939
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,670
I just acted like
I didn't know you.

940
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,830
Well, I'm over it now.

941
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,870
Well, 'night.

942
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,910
Yeah.

943
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,790
You forgot your towels.

944
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,390
Thanks.

945
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,550
- 'Night.
- Good night.

946
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,510
After our last lab assignment,

947
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,670
Mr. Rope brought this
to my attention.

948
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,550
It seems they found four
during locker-by-locker searches.

949
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,910
Consequently, your lab partners
will be chosen alphabetically

950
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,910
from now on.

951
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,950
So, did you teach Chase

952
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,430
to jump through fiery hoops yet?

953
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,270
Balance a ball on his nose?

954
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,510
I'm still working
on matching socks.

955
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,150
You two make
a very, very cute couple,

956
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,510
but I guess you hear that
all the time.

957
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,310
Why do you care?

958
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,710
I don't. You're welcome to him.

959
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,670
I used to think he had some...

960
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,230
I don't know...
some social consciousness.

961
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,150
Is this the animal-testing thing?

962
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,510
Your concern is noted.

963
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,750
Do you know anything
about his mother?

964
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,310
Only that she died
when he was young...

965
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,150
like 12 or something.

966
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,190
11. you know how?

967
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,070
No.

968
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,830
Cancer.

969
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,390
Lab rats, medical research...

970
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,390
Think about it.

971
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,190
Hey, I finally downloaded
the original "Space Invaders."

972
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,710
I'm talking quality 1981 graphics.
We gotta play tonight, man.

973
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,230
Yeah, I don't know. I guess.

974
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,190
Let's see what Chase wants to do.

975
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,670
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

976
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,470
I think he has to make an appearance
at Brad Seldon's party tonight.

977
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,950
Oh, yeah. Of course, of course.

978

♪ Crazy... ♪

979
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,030
So, this is the last
pre-centennial event for us.

980
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,430
We're in the home stretch.

981
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,190
Hey, did you say something
to Dulcie in lab?

982
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,750
Why?

983
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,950
I don't know.
She's been freaky around me.

984
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,550
Nice, even.

985
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,350
Well, mission
nearly accomplished then?

986
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,910
I guess.

987
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,070
So, can I negotiate an entrance
with hand holding?

Hey, Brad.

999
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,870
- I was just waiting for the bathroom.
- Yeah, that's cool.

1000
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,510
- So where's Kitty?
- Kathy.

1001
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,150
Right, Kathy.
I haven't seen her here tonight.

1002
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,190
She said we had different beliefs.

1003
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,310
And that was it.
Can you believe that?

1004
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,070
I mean, I'm Lutheran.

1005
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,950
So, it's like a fairy tale, right?

1006
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,190
I mean, you and Nicole.

1007
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,470
Falling in love
with the girl next door.

1008
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,390
Oh, yeah. Right.

1009
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,830
Too bad.

1010
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,310
What's too bad?

1011
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,150
Well, you know,
that you're taken.

1012
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,150
I mean, who could have known
that underneath all that rebellion

1013
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,710
there was a heartbreaker
dying to get out?

1014
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,870
Look at her in there.

1015
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,430
Suddenly, Brad's on the market again,
and she's back to plan "A."

1016
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,670
Old crushes die hard.

1017
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,270
I wonder, are you sure
Nicole's the one?

1018
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,510
Just think, if Brad hadn't fallen
into that cheerleader's arms,

1019
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,670
Nicole would have gotten
exactly what she wanted.

1020
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,510
Maybe then I would have gotten
what I wanted, too.

I was testing him.

1042
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,630
Frankly, I think I did you a favor.

1043
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,350
You weren't doing me a favor.

1044
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,240
You're miserable,
and you know what they say

1045
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,150
about misery loving company.

1046
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,830
You just didn't wanna see me happy.

1047

1049
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,950
Are you okay?

1050
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,990
I don't know.

1051
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,150
That's good. That's good.

1052
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,710
Reverse.

1053
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,590
Okay, let me really see
the pain.

1054
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,710
You called?

1055
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,950
Yeah, I called.

1056
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,590
- I'm staying.
- Why?

1057
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,510
I like to party.

1058
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,430
I like to get down.

1059
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,230
I got another note
from Daughter Judy.

1060
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,750
Yeah, she says
she thinks I'm funny.

1061
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,790
So, who all was at the party?

1062
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,790
Everybody.

1063
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,750
Jesus! What the hell, Dave?

1064
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,670
Look, sorry, but everybody
was not at the party.

1065
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,310
I wasn't there.
Ray wasn't there.

1066
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,510
You know, we used to be your friends
if you can remember that far back.

1067
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,510
You know what I remember, Dave?

1068
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,270
I remember you cleaning out
Eddie Lampell's locker

1069
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,880
because he said
he'd be your friend.

1070
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,070
Yeah, I did the guy a favor.

1071
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,720
I remember you buying
Alicia DeGasario

1072
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,430
at the student council auction
last year

1073
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,960
and then letting her spend
the whole day with her boyfriend.

1074
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,960
- Do you have a point?
- Yeah, my point is, Dave,

1075
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,270
you're not mad at me;
You're jealous.

1076
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,630
What's wrong with wanting
to be liked?

1077
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,310
You want them to like you, Dave?

1078
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,750
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

1079
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,590
People like that
need people like you,

1080
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,630
otherwise there's twice as much trash
and no one to take it out.

1081
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,750
You're totally losing me.

1082
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,390
Don't go, Dave.

1083
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,870
There's sober people there.

1084
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,750
They just don't wanna
leave the party.

1085
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,630
I can't not go.

1086
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,870
This is close enough.
I wanted to walk anyway.

1087
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,150
Come on, baby. Come on.

1088
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,190
- Cut it out, Eddie. Stop.
- What?

1089
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,390
No one's gonna know about it.
Come on.

1090
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,510
Sorry, Dave, I would have driven
him home, but I can't drive his car.

1091
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,510
It's a stick.

1092
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,150
Well, I'll show you
how to drive a stick right now.

1093
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,430
Here it is. Come on.

1094
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,630
I meant a real car, Eddie,
not a Matchbox.

1095
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,670
Yeah, well, kiss my ass,
you once-fat bitch.

1096
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,190
I remember
when you were nothing.

1097
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,150
Just a sweaty little egghead
drooling over football players.

1098
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,630
Now you think that because
you're Mrs. Time Zone

1099
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,830
- that your shit don't stink.
- Miss Time Zone.

1100
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,990
Yeah, whatever. Shut up!

1101
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,230
You think you're Miss Thing,
but you know what?

1102
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,470
You're just a wannabe who got lucky
with a case of bulimia.

1103
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,150
You're walking.
Hey, Dee, you all right?

1104
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,790
I think so. Eddie, stop it!

1105
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,470
What are you thinking,
Designated Dave?

1106
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,710
This isn't
"Revenge of the Nerds," man.

1107
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,790
Stop it, Eddie, stop!

1108
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,550
No radioactive spider bit you.

1109
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,710
Stop!

1110
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,110
Get your ass up
and drive me home.

1111
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,710
And you...

1112
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,070
Sorry.
You wanna get out of here?

1113
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,470
Can you bring me back
to the party, please, Dave?

1114
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,910
- I need to talk to Sue.
- Okay.

1115
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,270
Maya Angelou...
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

1116
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,230
- Really, you do?
- Chase, you're not listening.

1117
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,720
Some parents wanna take it off
the ninth grade reading list

1118
01:07:11,745 --> 01:07:14,350
because they think that...

1119
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,150
Chase.

1120
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,470
Why are telling me this?

1121
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,630
I'm your past-tense
quasi-boyfriend,

1122
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,910
not the American people.

1123
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,150
Well, what I'm trying to say

1124
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,670
is that both the tense and title
are negotiable.

1125
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,550
Okay, 10 seconds.

1126
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,390
Candy... we're not supposed
to eat it in school,

1127
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,790
yet clubs sell everything
from M&Ms to breath fresheners.

1128
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,990
Today, our investigative report...

1129
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,350
"Dollars and Certs."

1130
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,910
The marching band
couldn't march without it.

1131
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,510
Cheerleaders couldn't cheer
without it...

1132
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,790
Nicole...

1133
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,470
about Friday night...

1134
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,990
It's called an easy-out clause,
Chase,

1135
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,190
'cause it's supposed to be easy.

1136
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,470
So that's it?

1137
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,230
You need more closure than this?

1138
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,030
No.

1139
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,590
Guess not.

1140
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,630

01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,390
Not so fast, Ray Neeley.

1157
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,350
I want the guilty party
brought to my office now! Right now!

1158
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,030
Can I just tell you I heard
from one of the office aides

1159
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,430
they gave Ray three weeks
of in-school suspension.

1160
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,950
They should have kicked his ass
all the way out.

1161
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,030
Have you ever talked to the guy?
He is such a complete loser.

1162
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,760
It just figures that he would do
something like this. Stupid-ass.

1163

Sue, he's gonna be winning
MTV Awards

Centennial weekend is here.

1198
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,950
It's time you'll wanna share
with a special someone

1199
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,350
because it truly is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

1200
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,030
On behalf of the entire
Centennial Dance Committee,

1201
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,630
we look forward to seeing you there
in your formalwear.

1202
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,390
That's a cut.
All right, Ray, let's reset.

1203
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,390
- Is that all you need?
- Yeah, that was great, thanks.

1204
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,550
These will air all day tomorrow.

1205
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,190
Hey, that sounded good.

1206
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,910
It was bullshit.

1207
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,710
"Share it with someone special."
That's not reality.

1208
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,790
I'm really sorry about Chase.

1209
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,430
I should've known better.

1210
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,070
My dad did it to my mom.

1211
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,110
Eddie did it to you.

1212
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,910
What's the point?

1213
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,110
You can't give up, Nicole.

1214
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,310
Why not?
I'm through with it... all of it.

1215
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,670
Yeah, but didn't Brad finally
ask you to centennial?

1216
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,710
That's what you've been wanting
all along, isn't it?

1217
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,990
That's the twisted part.

1218
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:51,590
I finally got what I wanted,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

1219
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,310
Dee, you're up next.

1220
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,470
Cowabunga, dudes.

1221
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,110
I'm thinking about college.

1222
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,350
You're accepted.
What's left to worry about?

1223
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,790
I'm thinking that maybe I should go
to an East Coast school.

1224
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,630
You know, somewhere where
no one knows me.

1225
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,150
Someplace where I'm not
Designated Dave.

1226
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,310
Why don't you go to State
as planned

1227
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,470
and let Designated Dave

1228
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,750
go off to Long Island
Junior College?

1229
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,950
Hey, guess who got asked

1230
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,870
to the centennial extravaganza?

1231
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,070
Who's the lucky lady?

1232
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,830
Daughter Judy.

1233
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,030
- Virtually a date.
- Virtually?

1234
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:54,510
She's gonna email me her address
right before the dance.

1235
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,870
Are you going?

1236
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,670
He was going.

1237
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,510
You mean the horribly freakish
distorted version of your former self?

1238
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,030
Yeah.

1239
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,390
But now you're back.

1240
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,910

Nicole, I'm honestly sorry
about how things worked out.

01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,470
I really thought Brad
was gonna ask you.

1270

He did,
but I already had a date.

1271
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,270
He was bummed,
so I let him know you were easy.

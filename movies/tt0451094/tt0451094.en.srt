2
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,190
They say she's a real live angel.

3
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,490
Everyone in there calls her
"kind-hearted" Geum-ja.

4
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,050
One, two, three, four!

5
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,720
<i>My path is ridden with...</i>

6
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,710
<i>...high walls and deep pitfalls.</i>

7
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,540
<i>Who will aid me across these
dark obstacles?</i>

8
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,560
<i>The Lord's breath lifts me over
these walls.</i>

9
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:26,300
<i>The Lord's hands bridge my steps
safely over these pitfalls.</i>

10
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,510
<i>...safely over these pitfalls.</i>

11
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,180
What about the winter clothes
I sent you?

12
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,190
It's been hard, hasn't it?
13 and a half years.

13
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,070
I'm so proud of you.

14
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,840
<i>Won-mo and I were playing marbles
here that day, and I lost.</i>

15
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,440
<i>Won-mo won the biggest marble.</i>

16
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,680
<i>Then he ran off to go home.</i>

17
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,780
<i>The investigating authorities...</i>

18
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,220
<i>confirmed the details with a woman
who confessed to the crime.</i>

19
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,920
<i>Lee Geum-ja was first introduced to
the public...</i>

20
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,660
<i>as the criminal who abducted and
killed Park Won-mo, a little boy...</i>

21
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,990
<i>She was nineteen at the time.</i>

22
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,700
<i>The whole nation was shocked</i>

23
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,800
<i>by her youth, her ruthless methods...</i>

24
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,830
<i>and by her unabashed naivety.</i>

25
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,470
<i>My state of mind...</i>

26
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,340
<i>This is where the alleged perpetrator
had confined young Park Won-mo.</i>

27
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,310
<i>She claims she only wanted to stop
his crying with a pillow...</i>

28
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,780
<i>But what shocked us more were her
beautiful looks.</i>

29
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,280
<i>Clamouring tabloids compared her to
Olivia Hussey...</i>

30
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,450
<i>A tactless director announced plans for
a Lee Geum-ja movie...</i>

31
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,030
<i>creating a backlash from the press.</i>

32
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,970
<i>That fall, polka-dot dresses became
the trend.</i>

33
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,740
I saw you on TV.

34
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,270
Behind that wicked witch's face of yours
I saw the presence of an angel.

35
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,270
<i>An angel... Could that be true?</i>

36
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,250
<i>Do you really think
an angel resides in me?</i>

37
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,620
<i>If so, where was that angel...</i>

38
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,790
<i>when I was committing
such an evil act?</i>

39
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,020
<i>I always wondered about this</i>

40
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,370
<i>after hearing what the preacher said.</i>

41
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,170
<i>And then, I realized...</i>

42
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,510
<i>that the angel inside me only reveals
itself when I invoke it.</i>

43
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,140
<i>Where are you? Please, come out.</i>

44
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,410
I'm right here.

45
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,280
This act of invoking an angel...

46
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,560
<i>This is what we call prayer.</i>

47
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,930
<i>Actually, prison is an ideal place to
learn to pray.</i>

48
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,000
Because...

49
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:23,780
we know that we are all sinners
in here.

50
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,910
Thank you.

Testimonials of Faith Day for Inmates.

52
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,170
It's tradition to eat
tofu on release...

53
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,510
so that you'll live white
and never sin again.

54
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,390
Why don't you go screw yourself?

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,850
Meet your new cellmate.

58
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,730
I'm Kim Yang-hee. I got 5 years.

59
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,260
<i>They said there was someone at
Kyoungju Women's Prison...</i>

60
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,030
<i>whose face would shine.</i>

61
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,430
You were a whore, weren't you?

62
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,570
<i>I heard her nickname was "the Witch".</i>

63
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,400
Come on in.

64
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,210
You don't usually wear ties.

65
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,410
It's mandatory here.

66
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,080
We have lots of VIPs visiting.

67
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,280
Shit, it's too tight.
Loosen it up a bit.

68
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,990
<i>He was my pimp.</i>

69
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,120
<i>It felt so good
when I was strangling him.</i>

70
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,440
<i>- I should've killed myself instead
- Then, die.</i>

71
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,570
<i>And be born again. Over and over
if you need to.</i>

72
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,310
Prayer is like a scrubbing towel
Scrub off all your sins.

73
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,430
Then your skin will become as new as
a baby's ass. Right?

74
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,160
Geum-ja taught me how to lament
my past lives.

75
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,030
It's a little noisy,
being under the stairs...

76
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,970
But this place brings good luck.

77
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,080
Look at me. Three years of giving
unlicensed haircuts...

78
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,650
And now I have a real shop of my own.

79
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
So set your hopes high.

80
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,500
These were mine,
but they'll have to do for now.

81
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,890
You know I wanted to get you better
things, right?

82
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,420
Don't you have any high heels?

83
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,110
You never really loved me, did you?

84
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,270
You were just pretending, right?

85
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,340
You've changed a lot.

86
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,450
You used to be so sweet...

87
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,250
and talk so kindly.

88
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,660
Are you starting the plan already?

89
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>'No. The plan was already started
13 years ago'...</i>

90
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,100
<i>so Geum-ja murmured to herself.</i>

91
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,700
Farewell.

92
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,480
What is it you want from us?

93
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,100
<i>Please forgive me. Please...</i>

94
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,770
<i>She was going to beg Won-mo's
parents until she had no fingers left.</i>

95
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,070
This is 802/9 Han Apartments...

96
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,180
We've had a finger cut off here!

97
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,360
<i>Every penny Geum-ja earned from
laboring in prison...</i>

98
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,060
<i>had to go to pay for her
finger operation.</i>

99
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,330
<i>Then 6 days later...</i>

100
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,400
Naruse Bakery

101
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,770
For now, just work till noon.
Naruse Bakery

102
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,540
The dawn hours are tough for me with
my low blood pressure.

103
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,740
Geun-shik, say hello.

104
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,020
I told you about Lee Geum-ja, right?

105
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,410
Hello.

106
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,320
I told you she was pretty.

107
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,100
Can I call you elder sister?

108
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,070
Just call me Geum-ja.

109
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,330
<i>Lee Geum-ja...</i>

110
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>When she first came, she cried
non-stop, like a newborn baby.</i>

111
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,010
<i>Man, it was so depressing.</i>

112
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,190
Damn bitch!

113
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,050
It brings bad luck. Stop crying!

114
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:22,610
<i>As a man once taught her, whenever
she was having a hard time...</i>

115
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,640
<i>She'd bend over and take five
deep breaths.</i>

116
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,520
Woo So-young: Time served 1990-1996

117
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,950
What are you looking at?
You damn bitches!

118
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,690
Down on the floor and keep your damn
hands up!

119
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,680
<i>I felt like I was dying
because I couldn't be with my love...</i>

120
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,490
Turned out I was suffering
from chronic kidney failure.

121
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,420
But it felt like I was dying anyway.

122
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,660
Then this bitch suddenly says she'll
give me one of her kidneys.

123
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:25,940
It's not as if a kidney's
a bit of fluff you give away so easily.

124
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,710
Damn bitch.

125
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,840
It brings me bad luck. Stop crying!

126
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,450
Honey, Geum-ja's here.

127
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,890
You've sure changed a lot.

128
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,830
You heard my wife, stay down!

129
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,870
That's when I realized I'm married
to a goddess.

130
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:10,420
With this man by my side I
was never afraid.

131
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,420
Right, honey?

132
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,560
Yeah, but we couldn't go in together.

133
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,560
They should have couples prisons.

134
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,730
But then that would be paradise,
not jail.

135
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,770
I don't know how to thank you.

136
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,950
Honey, Geum-ja is
readying a magnificent plan.

137
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,150
You can help her, right?

138
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,290
The Way of Dhamma

139
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,690
Where did you get this? It's real old.

140
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,750
Comrade Geum-ja, it's no use.

141
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,530
- Go save yourself.
- Okay, right after I finish this.

142
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,330
Finish the chicken later.

143
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,940
And be careful.
Don't let dogs have the chicken bones.

144
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,910
Pass me that yellowing book.

145
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,580
Ko Sun-sook: Time served 1967-1997

146
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,550
<i>A spy from North Korea, Ko Sun-sook
had Alzheimer's...</i>

147
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,710
<i>and was a problem for the prison.</i>

148
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
<i>So when Geum-ja volunteered to look
after her...</i>

149
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,850
<i>Even the prison warden was relieved.</i>

150
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,660
They were stepping around me
whispering, "The woman spy is dead".

151
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,690
But the pride in my heart...

152
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,470
wouldn't let me die.

153
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,380
You said living is a struggle, too
A struggle not to die.

154
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,350
I give you this flower...

155
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,630
for you have vengeance to take comrade.

156
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,120
My goodness!

157
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,760
You shouldn't be out so late!

158
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,230
I asked for you at Naruse.

159
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,240
What were you thinking?

160
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,850
I don't want every Tom Dick
and Harry dropping by.

161
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,590
Fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

162
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,400
How could you have changed so much?

163
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,270
This isn't like you!

164
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Could we start over again?

165
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,040
Come to church. Please?

166
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,750
I've converted to Buddhism!

167
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,030
I bet you're in for adultery.

168
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,060
- How did you know?
- It's all over your face, bitch!

169
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,500
Please crawl over here.

170
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,730
Please take them off.

171
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,300
Oh Soo-hee: Time served 1993-1994

172
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,020
Can you see it well?

173
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,200
Say hello to each other.

174
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,840
Hello.

175
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,850
Hello?

176
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,220
<i>This damn bitch is that
infamous "Witch".</i>

177
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,250
<i>She killed her husband
and his mistress then ate them.</i>

178
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,730
<i>So... I guess I'm not the unluckiest.</i>

179
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,690
<i>I'll suck on her for five minutes
and cry it off.</i>

180
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,620
I hate them skinny bitches.

181
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,820
So go tell Geum-ja to start eating
some more, okay?

182
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,450
Your style has changed.

183
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,670
What's with the blood-red eye shadow?

184
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,500
People are always saying I look
kind-hearted.

185
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,950
People order them from me,
Modelled on their guys' photos.

186
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,620
They're very popular.
Want me to make you one?

187
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,830
Can you make it in silver?

188
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,710
Did you find that bastard yet?

189
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,380
I did.

190
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,210
Did you kill him?

191
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,670
Not yet.

192
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,010
Why not?

193
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,190
I've been busy.

194
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,230
"Saving the best for last,"
is that it?

195
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,630
Yes.

196
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,430
- I'll take this one.
- Excellent choice.

197
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,310
Is it true the owner
studied confection in Japan?

198
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,280
The lady made this one.

199
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,380
You've changed so much, I hardly
recognized you.

200
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,830
- Who was she?
- Who was he?

201
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,870
She's pretty.

202
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,110
The detective that was in charge of
my case.

203
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,980
When I was exactly your age...

204
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,850
That is, when I was nineteen,
and you were five...

205
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,310
I...

206
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,220
Kidnapped and killed
a five year-old boy.

207
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,960
My goodness!

208
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,230
Don't worry. I didn't eat him...

209
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,730
We can't eat this!

210
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,040
It was made by hands that have killed!

211
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,870
I'm telling you I killed him.

212
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,610
How many times do I have to tell you?

213
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,010
Then tell me what that marble
looked like.

214
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,640
What?

215
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:18,950
That marble you said you saw
but didn't know where it went...

216
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,560
It was Won-mo's favorite marble.

217
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,660
What color was it?

218
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,780
Light green.

219
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,220
Come on! Why would anyone confess
to a murder they didn't commit?

220
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,390
Why won't you believe me?

221
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,560
Is it because I'm a murderer?

222
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,250
Believe in Jesus, go to heaven.

223
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,830
Believe in Jesus, go to heaven
Without faith, there's only hell.

224
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,330
Devil, begone!

225
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,370
Begone, you devil!

226
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,780
On top of that,
I killed again in prison.

227
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:52,300
<i>Geum-ja wondered if Geun-shik
wasn't a fool.</i>

228
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,250
I understand what you're saying...

229
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,490
But it's against regulations to give out
that information.

230
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,720
There is a counseling service
I can refer you to...

231
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,630
Could you at least tell me whether she
was adopted or not?

232
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,660
Didn't you receive the notice?

233
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,970
I was in jail, you see.

234
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,940
<i>I'd like to show you the 18-year-old
Lee Geum-ja...</i>

235
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,210
<i>A pretty girl who would
turn any head...</i>

236
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,410
<i>But who wasn't the least
bit particular.</i>

237
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,250
<i>But this poor girl
was on the verge of going mad.</i>

238
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,520
<i>She tried to comfort herself...</i>

239
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:55,930
<i>with the thought that it happens to
every woman sooner or later.</i>

240
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,000
Teacher? Mr. Baek?
This is Geum-ja, Lee Geum-ja.

241
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,470
I used to polish your shoes when you
were our student teacher last year.

242
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,780
You didn't know it was me?

243
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,520
You told me I was sexy.

244
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,190
Yes. You remember me, right?

245
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,130
Pardon?

246
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,430
Well, it's nothing much...

247
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,260
You see, teacher, I'm pregnant.

248
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,600
Pregnant.

249
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,670
No, pregnant!

250
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,670
Yes, I am.

251
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,470
Could I go live with you? Please?

252
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,250
I can't go to my mom's.

253
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,950
And and it's even worse at my dad's.

254
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,260
Him? He's just a big kid, not ready
for fatherhood.

255
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,920
<i>Don't worry, baby. Your mama's
right here.</i>

256
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,610
<i>The poor girl murmured to herself.</i>

257
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,220
There's a drug called "Timing"
It suppresses sleep.

258
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,930
When I was just back from Tokyo
managing a confectionery factory...

259
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,130
There's a drug called "Timing"
It suppresses sleep.

260
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,400
<i>They all hated me.</i>

261
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,830
<i>You have to be careful when riding
a bike after taking it though.</i>

262
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,880
Hello.

263
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,950
What are you doing out in the cold?

264
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,230
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, ma'am.

265
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,230
Geum-ja, what brings you here
at this hour?

266
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,970
I need an advance.

267
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,580
No advances.

268
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,980
<i>I went to Kyoungju, where my parents
lived...</i>

269
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,490
<i>I volunteered to teach at the women's
prison there...</i>

270
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,760
<i>Because my folks worried I couldn't
get married with my lame leg.</i>

271
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:17,800
<i>But in my third year there
I was shocked almost to death...</i>

272
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,840
<i>after tasting a strawberry mousse
made by a kidnapper.</i>

273
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,840
<i>The ingredients given to the inmates
were miserable...</i>

274
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,810
<i>But she'd used them to create a cake
fit for a king.</i>

275
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,510
Three months' advance.

276
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,590
You know, you've changed?

277
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,430
<i>In the end, I packed up and moved
to Seoul.</i>

278
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,470
<i>Because I was motivated to open up
my own bakery.</i>

279
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,340
What are you doing?

280
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,270
Writing my account number.

281
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,750
I want to start a family young...

282
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,530
And hope to marry someone
I can respect.

283
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:38,450
So, you did something wrong...

284
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,820
You make penance and promise never
to do it again, right?

285
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,520
That's just how life goes.

286
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,660
That's life!
It's just another experience gained.

287
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,390
Isn't that right, Geum-ja?

288
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm planning to kill another person.

289
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,270
What?

290
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,240
Do you think I'm sexy?

291
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,980
Yes... No.

292
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,280
Well...

293
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,170
I was hoping we could talk some more.

294
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,770
Maybe later?

295
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,410
You're trying to scare me, aren't you?

296
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,650
You're trying to put me off?

297
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,130
Does it put you off
when a girl does this?

298
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,630
No.

299
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,630
Please go ahead.

300
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,840
It was alright for me.
Was it good for you?

301
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,880
I've been told it was so-so.

302
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,820
No way.

303
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,000
Mr. Baek said there are good
kidnappings and bad kidnappings.

304
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,770
What?

305
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,530
He said it was a good kidnapping
if the child is returned safely.

306
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,300
And since they're rich, a little ransom
wouldn't make much difference...

307
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,200
And although they'd have to worry
a few days...

308
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,810
The emotional reunion would make...

309
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,820
the family bond more closely.

310
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:27,290
That's what he said, but then he went
and killed Won-mo.

311
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,720
The boy kept crying...

312
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,920
And Mr. Baek said he'd kill him if he
didn't stop in 5 minutes.

313
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,530
But then he really did kill him.

314
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,200
If he were alive, he'd be your age now
but he's dead.

315
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,340
Then the police found a witness.

316
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,840
Someone saw me taking Won-mo to
a bath-house.

317
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,840
Then one day, when I came back from
the market,

318
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,310
my daughter was gone.

319
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,020
I got a call from Mr. Baek.

320
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,120
He said to confess and take all the
blame or my girl would die, too.

321
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,030
So the kidnapper had kidnapped
a kidnapper's kid.

322
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,260
Isn't that funny?

323
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,240
I thought it was.

324
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,680
The house key is the middle one.

325
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,620
Make sure these candles don't go out.

326
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,030
Touch anything else and I'll give you
a hole in the head.

327
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,460
Going somewhere?

328
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,370
It'll sound like a cannon, with lots of
smoke, too.

329
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,350
The design's so primitive.

330
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,310
What's the use of all this fanciness?
Better to have a strong solid shot.

331
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,980
It has to be pretty. Everything should
be pretty.

332
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:06,520
It has a very short range
So get up close when you shoot.

333
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,660
If you can hear his heart beating...

334
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,920
And see the sweat on his forehead
even better.

335
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,570
It's like playing golf.
You get good hits with good form.

336
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,440
Got a place to practice?

337
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,640
Tomorrow, let's go on a picnic, okay?

338
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,530
That's right. A picnic...

339
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,910
<i>For the longest time, Geum-ja has
wanted to meet with Won-mo...</i>

340
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,180
<i>And ask for his forgiveness.</i>

341
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:21,660
<i>She'd be very unhappy if she
found out he appeared before Jenny.</i>

342
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,620
Weekends with the family, and the dog...
Right?

343
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,600
Oppa.

344
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,200
Oppa.

345
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,720
Appa.

346
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,110
Appa.

347
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,320
Jenny.

348
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,720
Honey...

349
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,160
Honey...

350
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,670
I'm meeting with friends later today.

351
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,040
I'll have your dinner ready
before I leave.

352
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,310
Would you mind?

353
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,450
Don't you be the one to pay for dinner.

354
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,990
Right...

355
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,390
Park Yi-jeong: Time served 1993-1999

356
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,660
Hey, harlot.

357
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,590
You parasite, living off of men's blood.

358
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,630
I've got just the job
for a slut like you.

359
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,020
You know how itchy it is when you get
bit on the sole of your foot?

360
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:09,090
What did I tell you? What did I say!

361
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,970
It tickles when you scratch...

362
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,270
and it itches when you don't scratch.

363
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:18,140
Itches if you don't scratch,
and tickles when you do. Right?

364
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:25,240
You slut! Itches if you don't scratch
and tickles when you do...

365
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,500
I used to have a strong stomach.

366
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,910
I don't know what the problem is...

367
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,140
Here...

368
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,430
Sorry. Nasty, huh?

369
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,690
That's quite alright.
I enjoy helping you.

370
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,940
Thanks, Geum-ja. You really are
kind-hearted.

371
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:33,540
You understand that I only like
plump girls, right?

372
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:41,520
Of course. I'll eat a lot, too
and plump up for you.

373
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:47,760
So, you just keep taking lots of food
and medicine...

374
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,100
And hurry up and die.

375
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,880
- She fed her bleach?
- Really?

376
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,010
- For how long?
- Three years.

377
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,510
What a clean stomach she must've had.

378
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,450
- Geum-ja the Kind-hearted
- Well done, her!

379
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,820
<i>After that, Geum-ja inherited the
"Witch" nickname...</i>

380
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,930
<i>But was also still referred to as
"Kind-hearted Geum-ja"</i>

381
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,990
<i>Everyone wanted to help Kind-hearted
Geum-ja...</i>

382
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:29,440
<i>And no one could refuse the Witch
any favors.</i>

383
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,100
It has to be tonight.

384
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,940
I can't take it any more.
Not even for you.

385
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:39,680
<i>Soo-kyoung, a thief released before me
found out where Baek was working.</i>

386
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,950
<i>Seong-eun, a smart college grad...</i>

387
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,890
<i>was later released and got a job
at the same place.</i>

388
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,490
<i>She then informed me of Baek's
intention of getting a new car.</i>

389
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,890
<i>Later, Baek was visited by</i>

390
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,330
<i>a pretty car dealer, Park Yi-jeong.</i>

391
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,450
It'll be used wisely
for the Lord's work.

392
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,360
Hello?

393
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:01,800
Darling.

394
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,230
Have you had dinner?

395
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,660
I'll wait and have it with you.

396
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,540
You can go ahead without me.

397
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:19,180
I'll wait for you, so hurry back.

398
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,020
He hasn't eaten yet. I'll go and make
him eat first.

399
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,160
It's okay. Don't worry.

400
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:29,750
Bye.

401
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,000
<i>Geum-ja.</i>

402
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,910
<i>At that moment, Geum-ja held her
breath and struggled to break free.</i>

403
01:02:53,730 --> 01:03:00,660
<i>Even in this desperate situation
she never forgot the gun's firing range.</i>

404
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:45,800
Got an English-Korean dictionary?

405
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:53,200
Don't think that I forgive you.

406
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,580
I think mothers who dump their kids
should go to jail.

407
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,020
When I was younger, I often thought of
taking revenge out on you.

408
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:10,330
But I couldn't imagine the thought of
killing you.

409
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,090
Reason being that, I didn't know what
your face looked like.

410
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:22,340
Anyway, since we're on better terms
now, give me your reasons at least.

411
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:29,140
Saying sorry is not enough
You should say sorry at least 3 times.

412
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,510
Ungenerously your daughter, Jenny.

413
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,330
Left turn.

414
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,010
Okay?

415
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,870
I was happy...

416
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,960
I'm truly sorry.

417
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,080
Farewell.

418
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:30,600
<i>Get up, teacher! Time to go to work!</i>

419
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:58,050
Geum-ja, what's with that eye shadow?

420
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,090
Do you know why those kids-

421
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,720
Hey! Here's another one!

422
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,260
Hello?

423
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:34,300
If you'd found the real killer back then...
These children wouldn't have died, right?

424
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:38,780
You know how this feels.

425
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,250
There were four!

426
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,670
- I told you I can't come to work today.
- It's not that...

427
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:07,110
- Someone's here looking for you.
- Who?

428
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,550
- Well, the thing is.
- They won't say who they are?

429
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,480
I don't know what they're saying.

430
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:24,990
Can you speak Japanese?

431
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,870
<i>Mommy!</i>

432
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,070
<i>Please hurry and come get me...</i>

433
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,250
<i>Mommy...</i>

434
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,180
<i>There, there.
Don't cry. Don't cry...</i>

435
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,840
<i>Mommy... please hurry.</i>

436
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:31,890
<i>Mommy, I want to go home.
Please hurry, mommy.</i>

437
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,220
<i>There, there...
Don't cry. Don't cry.</i>

438
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:40,420
<i>Mommy, where are you?</i>

439
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:53,710
I know it's difficult
but take a good look at this man.

440
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:59,450
Next is Se-hyun, killed in 1995.

441
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:11,360
<i>Dad... I can't...</i>

442
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:14,700
<i>Daddy.</i>

443
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,440
This is Eun-joo, in '96.

444
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,870
<i>I can't breathe...</i>

445
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:31,850
<i>I'm scared. Please don't kill me, sir.</i>

446
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,420
Wait just a minute.

447
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,650
This is Yoo Jae-kyoung, 2000.

448
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:15,520
<i>Mommy.</i>

449
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:05,070
He was a teacher at English schools
in affluent neighborhoods.

450
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:11,210
He'd pick his victim, kidnap and kill
them, then move on to another school.

451
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,610
He'd never pick a child from one of
his own classes.

452
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:16,910
Which is why he was never under any suspicion.

453
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,020
- Coffee or green tea?
Which is why he was never under any suspicion.

454
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:25,820
Children annoyed him, so he would
tape them right after kidnapping them...

455
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:27,620
And killed them straight away.

456
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:34,230
The voices you heard on the line while
negotiating the ransom...

457
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,740
were taped off the videos
after the kids were already dead.

458
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,110
Now, you have two options.

459
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,510
If you want lawful punishment...

460
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,220
We will hand him over to
Chief Choi here.

461
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:56,530
But if you want a speedier
more personalized death for him...

462
01:23:56,730 --> 01:24:00,060
You can have it right here and now.

463
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:02,060
Does he have a child of his own?

464
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,230
He is supposed to be sterile.

465
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,700
Then what did he need all that
money for?

466
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,100
He put it in the bank.

467
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,910
Of course, the money will all
be returned to you-

468
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:19,910
With no kid, what did he need
all that money for?

469
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,500
He... was going to buy a yacht.

470
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:51,780
The police have big sticks but they
don't know how to use them.

471
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,580
If we leave it to them, there'd be
nothing but never-ending trials...

472
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,110
And all those bloody reporters...

473
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:01,280
How about we leave it to Geum-ja?

474
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:04,930
It'd be easier since
she's been to jail and all.

475
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,530
That's cowardly! They're our kids.

476
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:13,470
Then, let each person choose if
they want to be in or not.

477
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,300
I'm for individual choice.

478
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:18,170
Why don't you just let him choose
his own death or trial, then...

479
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,600
Individually?

480
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:22,110
Little while ago, you wanted to
hand him over to the police.

481
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:24,180
Then you wanted to leave it up
to Geum-ja...

482
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,710
Now you want to be left out alone?
What the hell do you want?

483
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,310
Won-mo's family has to follow the
majority, too.

484
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,340
You know that, right?

485
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:56,570
She has a weak heart...

486
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:00,910
Hey, mine's weak, too.

487
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,150
Then Won-mo's father can represent
the family.

488
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:07,160
One person per family should
be enough.

489
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:08,910
Alright?

490
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,620
What if Won-mo's mom informs
on us later?

491
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:15,100
She couldn't.
Her husband's in on it, too.

492
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,300
They could always get divorced.

493
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,400
We can leave some evidence, then.

494
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,870
How about we all take a picture?
So that...

495
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,010
even if we feel guilty later-
- Guilty?

496
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,750
Guilt for killing that bastard?

497
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:34,040
We'd feel guilty if we didn't kill him
when we had him. That's guilt!

498
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,580
Let me say a word.

499
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,800
I killed when I was in prison...

500
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,620
I'm also the one who caught Baek after
13 years of planning...

501
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:55,730
If anyone here informs the police...

502
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,970
I won't say any more.

503
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,810
Shall we go in one at a time?
Or all together at once?

504
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,120
One at a time for what?
Let's just go finish him off.

505
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:14,430
There's no need to share such a
personal matter with other families.

506
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,750
Isn't that right, dad?

507
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:24,700
Won't it be scary going in alone?
And it could be dangerous.

508
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,600
Just think of it as using the toilet.

509
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:30,030
In any case, it's a private affair.

510
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:33,040
Each to his own. A la carte...

511
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:37,880
We don't all have to get the same
set menu.

512
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,510
Please, honey...

513
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,280
We're divorced
This isn't a couples thing!

514
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,120
We don't have to go in together.

515
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:56,560
Excuse me, I think...

516
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,800
- It'd be too easy if we
did it all together. - Honey!

517
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:07,670
I brought along a sedative.

518
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:15,280
You couldn't even touch that finger
remember?

519
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,620
<i>Alright, then...</i>

520
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,240
<i>Won-mo's father is out, and his mother
will go in alone...</i>

521
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,300
<i>Jae-kyoung's and Dong-hwa's are
going in together...</i>

522
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,910
- Is that right?
- Yes!

523
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:41,670
Let's do it then!

524
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:45,680
Wait! Just a second!

525
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:54,720
Shouldn't we decide what order you
go in?

526
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,840
Will that be enough for you?

527
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,680
I can lend you mine after.

528
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,010
Well...

529
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,120
I think I'll be okay.

530
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:17,700
Honey...

531
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,280
Everyone pay attention.

532
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:37,290
If you grip it like this, the tip of the
knife will slip and not penetrate deeply.

533
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,560
You could also cut your hand.

534
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,870
So grip it like this
at all times, please.

535
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:49,830
Or you could just...

536
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:56,880
stab him like this.

537
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,770
Why did you do it?

538
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,780
You look like a normal person.

539
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,080
Why?

540
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:50,770
Ma'am, there's no such thing as
a perfect person.

541
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,350
This...

542
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,200
isn't going to bring our son back
is it, honey?

543
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,830
Right?

544
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:21,190
You all look very well off.
Take a look at that.

545
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:26,460
She took her boots off,
so's not to get blood on the suede.

546
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,760
Does that make any sense to you here?

547
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:38,400
My mom had to scrub hotel floors to
send my brother to that school.

548
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:43,310
We ran around like dogs to come up
with the ransom.

549
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:49,050
Now we've lost our house and our
relatives won't see us.

550
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:53,860
My daughter-in-law killed herself and
my son left the country.

551
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:57,920
We all have our own stories to tell.

552
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,310
Dad!

553
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:17,610
We're not the last, dad. Eun-joo's
grandma's still waiting her turn.

554
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,210
Dad...

555
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,960
Come on, give me a hand!

556
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:43,200
Mister, get up.

557
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:46,300
Please. Get a hold of yourself!

558
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,740
I'm sorry, but...

559
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,910
Could you step aside a moment?

560
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:21,250
Thank you.

561
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,720
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

562
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,420
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

563
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:19,310
<i>Happy birthday dear...</i>

564
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:30,610
I'm sorry.

565
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,360
It felt like a birthday to me...

566
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:38,920
We can say it is, then.

567
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,560
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

568
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,000
<i>to you!</i>

569
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:40,310
Will you wire the money into
our accounts?

570
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,530
My account number.

571
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:03,910
In France...

572
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,650
when there's a break in the
conversation like this...

573
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:11,810
they say an angel is passing.

574
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:38,400
It's snowing!

575
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,500
It's snowing a lot.

576
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:46,480
- When did it all pile up so much?
- What time is it now?

577
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,410
The traffic...

578
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,150
The roads will freeze soon.

579
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,630
Won-mo.

580
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,530
I have...

581
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,370
<i>Along the path on green grass...</i>

582
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:27,340
<i>A lady in red heels goes...</i>

583
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:34,920
<i>Click, click, click with her heels
Where might she be going?</i>

584
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:40,520
<i>Won't she look back...</i>

585
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:42,550
Are you really going to send Jenny back?

586
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:46,020
<i>...back my way for a glance?</i>

587
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,560
Are you?

588
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:52,160
<i>One step, two...</i>

589
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:59,840
<i>The lady in red heels takes another
step away, alone...</i>

590
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:20,190
<i>Lee Geum-ja made a great mistake
in her youth...</i>

591
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,730
<i>And used other people to achieve
her own goals...</i>

592
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:30,130
<i>But she still couldn't find
the redemption she so desired.</i>

593
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,290
<i>In spite of this...</i>

594
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,420
<i>Actually, because of this...</i>

595
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:55,930
<i>I liked Geum-ja.</i>

596
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:11,380
<i>Farewell...</i>

597
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:13,420
<i>Geum-ja.</i>

598
01:51:14,305 --> 01:52:14,754

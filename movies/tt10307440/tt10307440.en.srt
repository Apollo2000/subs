NETFLIX PRESENTS

3
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,291
Daphné, sweetheart, wake up.

4
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,791
Wake up. It's time.
Grab your things. Hurry up.

5
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,666
Put on your boots.
Take your bag, your coat.

6
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,500
Come on. Hurry up, sweetie.

7
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,666
I know you were asleep,
but you need to hurry.

8
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,791
Come on, arm in sleeve.

9
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,208
Great. Do you have your bottle?

10
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,041
- Yes.
- Do you have your extra socks?

11
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,416
- Yes.
- Your survival kit?

12
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,833
Yes, Dad, I have it all.

13
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,916
Where's Raphaël?

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,041
Come on, Daddy.

15
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,125
Let's go, sweetheart. Hurry up.

16
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,291
Go, go, go.

17
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,833
Go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick.

18
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,500
Come on, quickly.

19
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,000
- Do we have everything?
- Yes, I think so.

20
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,708
Okay. Lights off?

21
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,791
Okay.

22
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,583
From now on, not a sound.

23
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,500
Three, two, one.

24
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,458
Seventeen minutes, fifty-three seconds
to leave the island. That's very good.

25
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,416
That's two minutes less than last time.

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,980
That's great timing. Congratulations.

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,630
But I have to warn you, Daphné,
next time there will be no second chance.

28
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,125
If you forget your turtle,
we leave without it. Understood?

29
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,833
But otherwise, you did great, you know.

30
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,416
Well done.

31
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,083
Well done, sweetie.

32
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,541
Shall we go to bed?

33
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,083
<i>Grocery stores like the ones in Montreal
are stocked for three days.</i>

34
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,666
<i>That means that after three days,</i>

35
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,041
<i>if the trucks haven't come,
there'll be nothing left.</i>

36
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,605
<i>Everyone will starve.
It will be chaos. There will be fighting.</i>

37
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,123
<i>Which is why I'm doing this tutorial
on Mylar today.</i>

38
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,791
<i>We'll learn how to... preserve food.</i>

39
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,333
<i>Because that will make a difference.</i>

40
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,500
<i>Because the peace we know now
is hanging by a thread.</i>

41
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,041
<i>Not if the government collapses,
of course.</i>

42
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,583
<i>Or a really intense H1N1 outbreak,
or a... natural disaster.</i>

43
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,000
<i>So this is a good amount.</i>

44
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,416
<i>I have 44 lbs. of rice here.</i>

45
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,083
<i>The next thing we need to do
is remove as much oxygen as possible.</i>

46
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:20,291
<i>You can use oxygen absorbents
or foot warmers. Those work, too.</i>

47
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,041
<i>And besides, if you don't use them
for that, you can put them in your boots.</i>

48
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,166
<i>they're great to keep your feet warm
when it's cold.</i>

49
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,000
<i>Put it all in the bag. It's starting.</i>

50
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,458
<i>- This is when you need to hurry.</i>
- Like that.

51
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,416
<i>Seal it with a hot iron.</i>

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,833
Careful with your fingers.

53
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,976
<i>We're going to seal both ends of the bag.</i>

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,625
Put them on... Yes, exactly.
Pinch hard, here.

55
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,851
<i>A laundry iron works just fine.</i>

56
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,250
Yes. All the way...

57
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,916
<i>Now we check our work.</i>

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Is it well-closed?

59
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,625
Yes.

60
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,958
We'll be able to eat
this rice in 20 years.

61
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,623
Or maybe even before that.

62
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,416
In case there's an epidemic, or if...

63
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,500
If there's an economic crisis,
or if the planet gets even warmer,

64
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,375
people will be hungry, and we'll be ready.

65
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,000
That's it, darling. The other one.

66
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,791
<i>Subscribe to my channel.</i>

67
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,875
<i>If you have questions, I'll answer them.</i>

68
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,458
<i>If you have comments, I'll read them.</i>

69
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,166
<i>And don't forget:
in order to live, we have to survive.</i>

70
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,833
<i>Hi, Antoine. This is Alain.</i>

71
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,375
<i>Alain Fréchette.</i>

72
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,541
<i>I liked your presentation letter
very much. It really moved me.</i>

73
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,875
<i>Listen, I know this is very short notice,</i>

74
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,708
<i>but if you like, well,
one of our participants cancelled.</i>

75
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,500
<i>So I have a spot for you.</i>

76
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,916
<i>So if you want it, it's yours.</i>

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,166
<i>You can call me back
or simply confirm by email.</i>

78
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,708
<i>It would be really great if it worked out.</i>

79
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,791
<i>Bye.</i>

80
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,791
<i>...we learned that the number
of climate refugees</i>

81
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,791
<i>will be at its highest in 2050.</i>

82
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:18,125
<i>The international organization
says that not only is the crisis near,</i>

83
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,791
<i>but that the crisis will be endemic.</i>

84
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,500
<i>As for numbers, they say
at least 250 million climate refugees</i>

85
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,791
<i>will have to find a new house in 2050.</i>

86
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:32,375
<i>Those vulnerable people are mostly farmers
already in a precarious situation.</i>

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,208
<i>Some wish to stay in their own country,</i>

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,291
<i>but many of them have already started
to leave their country.</i>

89
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,125
<i>Government leaders have assured
that the doors will be closed</i>

90
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,458
<i>to these migrants</i>

91
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,708
<i>and safety measures will be put in place
to slow down those waves of immigration.</i>

92
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,625
<i>However, other countries are open
to welcome some migrants,</i>

93
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,916
<i>but we don't know...</i>

94
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,791
How strange to finally meet in person.

95
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,666
Get your stuff.

96
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,291
I'll take your cell phone.

97
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,958
Get ready.

98
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,083
Here, this is for you.

99
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,458
You'll need protection.

100
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,916
Okay, it's a bumpy ride. Hold on tight.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,083
It will take a while.

102
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,500
- All good?
- All good.

103
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,291
On the website, it's easy.

104
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,500
But in real life,
you'll see it's a whole other story.

105
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,041
I have about 500 acres of land.

106
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,458
It's fucking huge!

107
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,833
It keeps the world at bay.

108
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,791
You can take them off now. We're here.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
I just need to get some things,
and I'll show you where to put that.

110
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,083
Alain?

111
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,416
Where should I put this?

112
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,017
On the counter.
I'll take care of it later, okay?

113
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,041
Perfect.

114
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,916
- Hey.
- Hi.

115
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,208
- I'm Anna.
- Antoine, pleased to meet you.

116
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,291
My pleasure.

117
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,833
- David.
- Antoine.

118
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,456
This is gonna be fun, man.

119
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,833
You can choose one of those beds.
The two in the back.

120
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,458
- Hi. François.
- Antoine.

121
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,375
- Is he the last one?
- No, there's one more.

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,166
Settle down, get comfortable,
make yourself at home.

123
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,166
Oh, and... these are the rules.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,640
It would be great if you could read them.

125
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,916
And curfew at 10:30 pm.

126
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,041
- Hi, Rachel.
- Antoine.

127
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,831
You can take that one,
but I'm warning you, I snore.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
I hope you brought your earplugs.

129
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,875
David.

130
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,250
Show Sébastien where he can put his stuff.

131
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,333
- Okay.
- Hi.

132
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,750
- David.
- Sébas.

133
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,166
Hi, I'm Antoine.

134
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,458
Hello. Sébas.

135
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,500
Do you smoke, Sébastien?

136
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,458
Yes, yes, sometimes when I drink.

137
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,916
You can't smoke in the tent.

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
Nor in the house.

139
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,541
This is Frank. Sébastien.

140
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,541
- Hi.
- Hello.

141
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,625
Generally, Alain doesn't...

142
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,750
Come closer, guys.

143
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,541
It must have been a long road.

144
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,833
Shit, yes. Nine hours.

145
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:20,916
Come closer!

146
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,833
I stopped halfway here. It was beautiful.

147
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:28,416
I'd like to explain what a survivalist
temporary autonomous zone is.

148
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,750
A TAZ.

149
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,250
This here is my project, my baby.

150
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,041
I've been working on it
for about a decade.

151
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,500
You'll see other bases.
But none like this one.

152
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,750
Here I have six panels,
which give me 2,600 Watts.

153
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,458
I have a shitload of propane, fuel oil.

154
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,041
Cordwood. Dry, because green wood
won't give you any heat.

155
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,750
And a 396-gallon generator.

156
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,958
Where's your generator?

157
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:55,958
Behind the house.

158
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,583
With that one, I can have a freezer,
a fridge, power.

159
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,000
And the extra energy loads batteries
for the evenings.

160
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,666
Here... we have a chicken coop.

161
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,541
Over there, a greenhouse. Both are heated.

162
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,083
You'll see, we eat well here.

163
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,708
My chicken tastes great.

164
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,410
Not like that damned sick chicken
you buy at the store.

165
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,250
Further down here,
I have very productive apple trees.

166
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,750
Oh, you must have deer.

167
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,953
You have no idea.
There's no lack of meat around here.

168
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,083
And a little further over there,
I have maple trees.

169
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,125
Every spring, I make syrup.

170
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,500
See?

171
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,666
For now, I make it by hand,
but I plan on having a real installation.

172
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,333
Because when everything collapses,

173
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,875
maple syrup will be perfect for trading.

174
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,791
Because everybody
likes a little sweetness.

175
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,291
You can use it for everything,
coffee, cereal. It's comforting.

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,833
These are what I call
the evacuation tracks,

177
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,291
in case I'm attacked.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,875
In the summer, I rake them
and I remove anything noisy.

179
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,166
And in the winter,
I keep them completely clear.

180
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,958
So that your attackers
can't hear you moving around.

181
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,833
Let's say I'm being chased. I made forks.

182
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,166
This is the first one.

183
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,892
There are 15 others just like it.

184
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,666
Every time,
you need to take the right one,

185
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,916
otherwise it's a dead end.

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,601
When you think about it, it's like a code.

187
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,458
That's sick!

188
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,892
At the very end, there's a container
with the bare necessities.

189
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,958
So if I'm ever under attack,
I'll be able to defend myself

190
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,166
and reclaim my land from there.
Do you get the idea?

191
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,958
Yeah, it's just like a bug-out, really.

192
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,333
It's not "just like a bug-out,"
it's exactly a bug-out.

193
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,125
- But is it static or mobile?
- Static.

194
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,434
Have you ever thought of making it mobile?

195
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,059
You know, a moving target
is way harder to shoot.

196
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,375
Yeah, but the container
is for retaking my land,

197
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,666
not for running like a coward.

198
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,791
Can we go see it?

199
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,416
Look. Trust me, all right? Don't go there.
It's full of nice little surprises.

200
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,416
To be clear:
those tracks aren't for strolling.

201
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:58,875
So...

202
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,958
Whose first time is this?

203
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,498
Me. This is my first time.

204
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,208
It's my first time here,
but I've already done survival.

205
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,916
Two weeks of hunting a year,
does that count?

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,208
Yeah, it helps.

207
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,041
And you, Antoine?
Is this your first training?

208
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,833
Yeah. First training like this, yeah.

209
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,476
I've been following Alain's videos
for a while.

210
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,708
That's good.

211
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,791
I want to be prepared.

212
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,142
You turn on the TV,
you just know it's going to shit.

213
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,791
Just thinking about the glaciers melting
and the water rising,

214
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,083
it's really scary.

215
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,916
I think that's bullshit.

216
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,541
If things go to shit,
it'll be a social crisis.

217
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,250
It'll happen much sooner than we think.
Weather has nothing to do with it.

218
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,750
- Yeah, that or an economic crash.
- Exactly.

219
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,353
It's like the government,
it seems like they're organizing to...

220
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,166
to weaken us and control us better.

221
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,684
Like with their gun control.

222
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,541
Shit. Don't even get me started on that.

223
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,305
Those who want to kill people
should register their weapons, not me.

224
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,958
I... I'm not insane.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,166
Curfew.

226
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,583
All right, good night, everyone.

227
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,125
- Good night.
- Good night.

228
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,166
- Good night.
- Good night.

229
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Don't give up!

230
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,416
Don't give up, Sébas! Don't give up!

231
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,625
Did you make the chard?

232
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
They're really good.

233
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,833
And they're not hard to make.
I make them often.

234
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,541
You put vinegar, spices.

235
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,105
And they keep really long.
You have your supply for the winter.

236
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,226
My grandma taught me how to make them.

237
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,916
- You just need to take time to do it.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Of course, it's work,
but if you do it with friends, it's fun.

239
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,393
Everybody leaves with their pickle jar.

240
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,916
I fucking like pickles.

241
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,625
Hey, guys.

242
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,125
I'd like to propose a toast.

243
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,500
- To Alain.
- No.

244
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,791
This is really a great opportunity, and...

245
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,750
it's a real pleasure
to learn by your side.

246
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,375
Thanks, captain.

247
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,458
No, I want to thank you guys.

248
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,500
Thank you for being here.

249
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,750
Enlightened citizens like you are rare.

250
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,833
So...

251
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,708
if I can pass on a bit of my knowledge,
it makes me happy.

252
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,541
And seeing you apply it and passing it on,
I find that really beautiful.

253
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,375
You're beautiful, Alain.

254
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,666
But you have to know
that not everyone has your good sense.

255
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,208
And those people,
I'm telling you right now,

256
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,166
some of them will try
to steal everything you have.

257
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,416
The Golden Horde.

258
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,416
Yes. Those guys.

259
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,515
That's why we have to protect each other.

260
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,916
And take care of each other.

261
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,666
In fact,
it's critical to keep good people close.

262
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,041
I...

263
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,000
I wasn't always alone here.

264
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,458
But she...

265
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,250
She wasn't interested.

266
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,113
She thought it was too far away.

267
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,601
Too far away from the city,
far away from everything.

268
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,083
Too far, too intense.

269
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,333
But when I look at all of you,

270
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,583
I don't see those intense people.

271
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,041
I see lucid citizens.

272
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,083
With a... a common ideal.

273
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,458
And when I say ideal...

274
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,791
for it to become real,

275
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,041
we need to work hard.

276
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,083
All of us.

277
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,291
Everyone together.

278
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,375
To Alain.

279
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,750
To the cook!

280
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,375
To all of us.

281
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,250
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

282
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,333
It's all good.

283
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,833
Okay, I'll try not to hurt you too badly.

284
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,958
Come on!

285
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,416
Come on, push, damn it.

286
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,416
That's the trick.

287
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,625
Fuck!

288
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,208
Where's my cap?

289
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,291
On your back.

290
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,750
- She's fucking strong.
- You struggled?

291
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,375
It's big, but weak.

292
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,666
Are you scared?

293
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,625
- He's scared.
- No.

294
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,125
Take a turn.

295
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,166
Don't hurt yourselves now.

296
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,208
Show us.

297
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,351
The first one to put the other's shoulders
to the ground.

298
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,375
Okay.

299
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,166
- No blows?
- Only cuddles.

300
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,666
This won't end well.

301
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,958
You okay?

302
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,916
Damn, that fall!

303
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,708
Grab him by the shins!

304
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,375
Ouch!

305
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,875
- It didn't take long.
- That's all right.

306
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,958
Come, sit down.

307
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,541
- Didn't have time to act, Dave?
- Shut up.

308
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,875
No biggie.

309
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,166
It's still embarrassing.

310
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,250
He's a proud person.

311
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,833
I watched you with Dave, earlier.

312
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,833
You take Krav Maga lessons?

313
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,291
Yeah, where did you learn that?

314
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,416
In the Army?

315
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Yeah.

316
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,541
I see.

317
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,934
You said your boyfriend
wasn't in the country,

318
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,278
is that because he's in the Army?

319
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,500
Deployed.

320
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,625
Where at?

321
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,500
Somewhere around the world.

322
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,333
Have you ever been deployed with him?

323
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,875
It must be awesome.

324
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:28,250
Together, on the battlefield.
Protecting each other. Romantic.

325
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,916
I don't think so, no.

326
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,916
- Have you been to war?
- Frank.

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,458
What? It's interesting.

328
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,125
Have you seen corpses?

329
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,833
- Come on.
- What?

330
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,833
Okay. Quit it.
I'm not in the Army anymore, actually.

331
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,166
Really, why not?

332
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,375
It's none of your business.

333
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,583
Wow!

334
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,041
Very impressive.

335
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,250
Honestly, good job!
You're the best team, by far!

336
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,916
ALARM ACTIVATED
ZONE 5- TRAP #4

337
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,625
I was hoping for this to happen.

338
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,291
It's always more fun to show a snare
if there's something in it.

339
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,375
This is the St. Michael technique.

340
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,583
I won't explain how a snare works.
You've all seen my videos.

341
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,142
But what you didn't know is that
this is a satellite transmitter,

342
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,892
it sends a message straight
to my cell phone.

343
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,226
That way, I'm the first one here,
and I don't lose my meat.

344
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,625
There are snares like this one
all over my land.

345
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,541
For you.

346
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,333
I might as well tell you...

347
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,416
it stinks a little, but it's all right.

348
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,517
You have to stick your fingers in here,
and you rip it off. It's easy.

349
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,000
What you see here is the rumen.

350
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,541
In here you have the bowels,
and the bladder a little higher.

351
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,708
Just tear it all out, and done.

352
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,125
Heart, lungs, liver. All good stuff.

353
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,916
And that's all edible, so we'll keep it.

354
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,625
Don't get them mixed up.

355
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,000
Rip off the tail.

356
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,041
It doesn't seem so hard.

357
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,708
- Have you done this before?
- No.

358
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,125
Okay, then... here you go.

359
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,791
You do this one.

360
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,125
We'll see if you got it right.

361
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,059
I don't want to take anyone's place.

362
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,583
No, no, no, it's your turn.

363
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,208
It's nobody's place. Let's go.

364
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,125
- Do I need my knife?
- No, no, no. Look.

365
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,642
- There's a small hole here, at the top.
- Yeah.

366
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,250
Get in there and pull it down,
it's easy, you'll see.

367
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,750
It rips off on its own.

368
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,583
I don't know why, I'm feeling sick.

369
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,750
You okay, Frank?

370
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,125
Come on, let's go!

371
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,559
You're not gonna throw up, are you?

372
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,583
No, I'm not.

373
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,416
Lucky it wasn't a moose, right?

374
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,416
Fuck.

375
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,208
Come on now, sorry.

376
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,958
Yes, that's it.

377
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,101
No, but seriously. Say things go wrong
and a guy gets caught in your trap.

378
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,125
What do you do?

379
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,375
I would treat myself.

380
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,625
You'd beat him up?

381
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,458
I don't really know.

382
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,208
I would decide on the spot,
but it wouldn't be pretty.

383
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,458
Wouldn't you?

384
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,041
Beating up people for no reason
isn't my thing.

385
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,333
But there would be a reason.

386
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,458
And you, Antoine?

387
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,833
I'd pull him down.

388
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,208
Threaten him, scare him,
and make sure he never comes back.

389
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,083
That's soft.

390
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,666
Maybe he's a scout.

391
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,958
Maybe there are others behind him,
a whole gang even.

392
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,250
Coming for him.

393
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,250
So you finish him off.

394
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,166
You hang him from a tree.

395
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,166
So they can see him from far away
and the message is clear.

396
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,833
Séb?

397
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,458
Oh, yeah, I'd kill him for sure.

398
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:57,125
I'd skin him and turn him into a coat.

399
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,755
It's true
that in extraordinary circumstances...

400
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,666
maybe you don't have a choice.

401
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,500
Of course you have a choice.

402
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,291
The guy's caught in your trap,
you have the upper hand.

403
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,458
You decide whether to kill him or not.

404
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,291
Antoine's right.

405
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,458
If it's an attack, it's easy.

406
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,166
But that guy in your trap...

407
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,791
maybe he's a doctor.

408
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,750
Or an extra pair of hands
to help you feed the animals.

409
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,041
Good morning.

410
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,208
Good morning.

411
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,916
So?

412
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,916
What do you think?

413
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,625
It's awesome.

414
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,333
Inspiring, in fact.

415
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:43,583
It's not just a pipe dream. It's real.

416
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,041
It's thought out, it feels great.

417
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,333
It's important to me that you feel good.

418
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,041
At peace.

419
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:56,500
This is exactly what my girl
and I are looking for.

420
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,208
This is a big place.

421
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,208
You could settle down.

422
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,833
Move here with her.

423
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,333
You would fit in great here.

424
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,396
You know, it's only a question of time
until shit hits the fan.

425
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:24,291
And when it happens...

426
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't want my life to change.

427
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,916
I want to eat my fill.

428
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,166
I want to protect my own.

429
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,791
And...

430
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,666
play the piano.

431
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,851
You can eat the orange ones, no problem.

432
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:50,875
They're edible.

433
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,458
Hey, who am I imitating?

434
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,958
"I don't know why, I'm feeling sick."

435
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,142
I would have liked to see you in my place.

436
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,166
It's fine, Frank.

437
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,381
- You just don't have a strong stomach.
- Yeah.

438
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,708
That's enough.

439
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:07,875
Oh, now he's upset.

440
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:08,958
No, I'm not.

441
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:10,500
We're teasing you.

442
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,231
What the hell are you doing, genius?

443
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,060
Turn off the water, damn it!
Where do you think you are, a hotel?

444
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:19,166
- Sorry, I thought it was river water.
- That's no reason to waste it!

445
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,666
Okay, Alain, I got it.

446
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,541
It's all right.

447
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,625
Thanks.

448
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,500
No messing around here.

449
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,886
You need to be very careful
with this stuff.

450
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:08,666
Avoid friction... and static electricity.

451
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,208
I'm serious. This is no joke.

452
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,583
Protecting your resources
and your territory...

453
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,166
is the key to survival in times of chaos.

454
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,583
When you have 5,000 migrants

455
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,666
rushing into your neighborhood
with 5,000 machetes,

456
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,500
you might have 50 guns,

457
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,333
but you won't have 50 hands
to operate them.

458
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:29,083
That's why a well-placed booby trap
to blow up 20 of them at once,

459
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,625
I swear that'll keep them away.

460
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,916
They'll shit their pants
once it blows in their faces.

461
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,208
Done?

462
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,291
Good.

463
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:39,916
This won't do.

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,083
You need to strip it
and twist them together.

465
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,416
That's an open circuit.

466
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,580
If we get static electricity in here,
we're all dead.

467
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,333
That's a compact one. Good job, Anna!

468
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,416
Well done!

469
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,083
- Thanks.
- Cool.

470
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:59,125
Okay, we're done for today. Let's split.
Sébastien and I will go and start cooking.

471
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,583
The rest of you will take the gear

472
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,041
and put it back where
we took it from. All right?

473
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,125
All right.

474
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,250
I was doing the dishes,
and what's he watching?

475
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,500
I go to the living room,
I turn on the TV, and...

476
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,916
What the hell is that show?

477
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,916
It's all talking animals.

478
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,809
At some point, I would have to pause it
every two minutes to explain that

479
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,166
it's not real life.

480
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,333
That's because cartoons
make everything more mellow.

481
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:27,166
Seriously, cartoons today are not
as good as the ones we used to watch.

482
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,375
Fuck! It blew up!

483
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,458
Alain!

484
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,500
François!

485
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,208
Alain! Alain!

486
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:46,833
He's still breathing.
Stay with me! François! François?

487
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,375
- Talk to him!
- Frank!

488
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:50,375
François, stay with me.

489
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,458
Go get an ambulance! Call an ambulance!

490
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,375
Frank!

491
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,083
- Come on! Go get Alain!
- Alain!

492
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,166
Alain...

493
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,458
Damn it!

494
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,166
- François? Talk to him.
- Alain!

495
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,083
- Frank! Frank!
- Alain!

496
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:03,166
Talk to him!

497
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,083
- Frank, don't give up, Frank!
- Alain!

498
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,625
Alain!

499
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:07,958
Where the fuck is he?

500
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,416
Alain!

501
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,541
Help us, Dave! Shit!

502
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,333
François, stay with us! François!

503
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,500
Frank!

504
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,041
- Shit!
- François!

505
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:19,041
He's not breathing anymore,
I have no pulse.

506
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,500
We have to take him inside.
Let's take him inside.

507
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,666
Fuck. Take his legs.

508
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,708
David! Wake up! Help us!

509
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:29,958
David!

510
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,166
David, go open the door!

511
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,291
Dave!

512
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,500
Open the door, Dave! Damn it!

513
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,458
Dave!

514
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,916
Why don't we say that...
that it was a hunting accident.

515
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,375
Look at the fucking body.

516
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,416
It's clearly not a hunting accident.

517
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,458
Okay, but what shall we do?
We can't leave him like that.

518
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,875
Oh, shit, we're in trouble.

519
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,458
- Oh, shit, we're in trouble.
- No, no.

520
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,875
It was an accident.
Nobody here is responsible.

521
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,875
Yeah, nobody meant for this to happen.

522
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,166
We're calling an ambulance.

523
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,583
What do you think they'll do?

524
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,351
Take away a guy with a blown-up chest
who's been dead for hours

525
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,458
and ask no questions?

526
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,833
They'll call the police.

527
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,166
And then the fucking police will come
to my place.

528
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,166
Well, then...

529
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,208
they'll realize it was an accident.

530
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,208
You're so fucking naive.

531
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,351
When they get here and see the equipment,

532
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,495
the guns, do you really think
they won't say anything?

533
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,875
We'll all go to jail for manslaughter
and domestic terrorism.

534
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:58,750
Well, what do you want us to do?

535
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,041
What we have to do...

536
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,541
is bury him and keep our mouths shut.

537
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,208
- What?
- Are you insane?

538
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,691
- Say what?
- We're not burying him.

539
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,267
Do you really want to go to prison
because of that moron?

540
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,583
First, he's not a moron.

541
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,434
Second, what don't you understand
about "it was an accident"?

542
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,750
It was his fault!
We're not going to jail because of him!

543
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,553
What's clear is that if we call someone
from the outside, we're done.

544
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,166
Antoine.

545
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,642
How will you explain to your daughter

546
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,786
that you can't see her anymore
because you're in jail?

547
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,043
Because that's exactly what's going
to happen if you go to the police, man.

548
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,250
Of course not!

549
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,625
Fuck, guys! We're not going to jail!

550
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,916
Nobody here is going to jail,
we were all witnesses.

551
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,250
It was an accident!

552
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,791
His wife! I mean, he has a family!

553
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,875
She'll end up realizing something's wrong
at some point, and she'll report it.

554
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,000
What about his stuff?

555
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,083
Buried, with him.

556
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:57,875
- And we take his car apart.
- No! No, what...

557
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,791
Alain, we're not burying him!

558
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,250
We're calling the police!

559
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,625
I mean, accidents they... they happen.

560
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,916
That doesn't make us murderers.

561
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,916
You're so dense! You don't get it!
We'll get arrested straight away.

562
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,750
- That's what's going to happen.
- Okay. This needs to stop.

563
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,934
- Where's my phone?
- In a safe place, and it's staying there.

564
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:17,142
Give me my fucking phone!
I wasn't asking you for your opinion.

565
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,625
Give me my phone, Alain.

566
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,750
That's enough!

567
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,416
I've been watching you ramble
for long enough.

568
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,458
Let me remind you of a few things:

569
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:30,541
François is dead,
and nothing that will be said in this room

570
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,583
will change anything about that.

571
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:35,083
What's happening now,
what's happening to us,

572
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,250
that's exactly
what we're getting ready for!

573
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,883
There's a crisis,
now we need to deal with it.

574
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:42,875
We need to keep a cool head,

575
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,750
but that's not
what you're doing right now!

576
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,333
You're all over the damn place!

577
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,375
We're all tired right now.

578
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,208
So... we'll sleep on it.

579
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,583
And tomorrow morning,
we'll decide what to do.

580
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:09,625
Is that understood?

581
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Agreed?

582
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,625
Agreed.

583
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,625
Go to bed, now.

584
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,916
We're all out of it, anyway.

585
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,250
Okay, we need to calm down.

586
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,083
Did you hear me, Antoine?

587
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,041
Are you okay, Antoine?

588
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,541
Yeah.

589
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,166
Good night.

590
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,541
<i>I know burying the body sounds
like a solution,</i>

591
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,805
but it'll only push back the consequences.

592
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,416
His wife will end up
filing a missing person report.

593
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,875
With the cameras on the road,

594
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,476
they'll end up tracking down
his licence plate.

595
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, and they'll track his phone.

596
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,958
The cops will show up here.

597
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,705
We'll have a hidden corpse.

598
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,791
We'll be in big trouble.

599
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,166
And we'll go to prison.

600
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,101
At this point, I think we're going to jail
no matter what happens.

601
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,125
No, he's the one in trouble, not us.

602
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,041
Yes, it's his supplies,
his land, his idea.

603
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,666
Yeah, but we were the ones shooting guns
and making the fucking bombs.

604
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,250
Hey, we all have our firearm licenses.
We'll be fine. We're legal.

605
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,750
The guy organizes trainings,

606
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,916
and he's not even able
to ensure everyone's safety.

607
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,083
He's the one in trouble, not us.

608
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:39,708
Yes... I... I understand.
But... it's not that simple.

609
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,083
We have to call the police.

610
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,666
We need to find Alain's phone.

611
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,708
What the hell is that?

612
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,083
Fuck!

613
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,833
Fuck, Alain!

614
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,083
We told you not to!

615
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,750
You had no right to do this!

616
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,458
- Psycho!
- Are you okay?

617
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm getting the hell out of here.

618
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,333
Are you okay?

619
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:01,541
I'm leaving.

620
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,291
Look.

621
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,833
You're thinking with your emotions.

622
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,166
Where did your good sense go?

623
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,291
For fuck's sake, Alain!

624
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,250
We were supposed
to find a solution to this.

625
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,958
A solution to what?
A solution to ruin everything?

626
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,351
Look. Drop your stuff and stay here.
There's been enough trouble.

627
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,815
We just need to discuss this calmly.

628
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,541
I'm getting the hell out of here.

629
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,125
Take us back to our cars!

630
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,208
Get out of my way!

631
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,416
David...

632
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:02,666
David...

633
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,708
David, put your gun down, all right?

634
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,291
They're all against you, Alain.

635
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,208
They wanted to take your phone.

636
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,750
They want to call the police
and blame everything on you.

637
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,333
Are you going to let him shoot us?

638
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,250
Are you, Alain?

639
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,625
Because that won't be
an accident anymore, Alain.

640
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,833
You stay here!

641
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,041
Do you fucking hear me?

642
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,208
You stay right here!

643
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,500
You will destroy everything we built.

644
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,125
Do you hear me, damn it?

645
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,208
Shit!

646
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,125
It's time now, let's go!
Let's go, let's go!

647
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,333
Guys!

648
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:52,833
Guys, stop!

649
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:58,000
No, Dave, help me!

650
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,500
Guys, stop, we can't leave her here!

651
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,000
Come on, let's go!

652
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:04,892
It's only a small bullet
in the leg, sweetheart.

653
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,916
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

654
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,500
This isn't what I wanted!

655
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,208
Let me go!

656
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,791
Alain, they ran to the tracks.

657
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,666
Look, they won't go far, we'll find them.

658
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,958
Okay. Let's get her out of here,
we need to take her inside, okay?

659
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,958
Let me go!

660
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:31,416
Let me... Let me go.

661
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,740
We're trying to help you, here.

662
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:43,083
Untie me.

663
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,166
Untie me.

664
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,000
I have no choice. This is going to hurt.

665
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,125
Stop, stop, stop.

666
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,750
- Untie me.
- I have to go.

667
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,476
I have to go get the others
in the woods. Otherwise, they'll get lost.

668
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,208
- I beg you, untie me.
- I'll be back. Relax.

669
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:25,250
I'm not a murderer, but that doesn't mean
I won't protect what's mine.

670
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:33,291
Untie me!

671
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,375
No, stay! Stay!

672
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,375
Fuck.

673
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,500
Shit.

674
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,250
David, we're not playing war, here.

675
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,666
This, here... This...

676
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,500
It's only to make sure we're understood.

677
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,958
- Okay?
- It's okay.

678
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,416
He's dead.

679
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,375
He's a fucking psycho.

680
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:41,916
He knows we're here.
We have to leave the trail.

681
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,083
Come on.

682
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,583
We're all gonna die here.

683
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,791
Walk.

684
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:56,666
Shit.

685
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,583
Alain?

686
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,000
Alain, they came through here.

687
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,541
Antoine?

688
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,125
We're back on the trail.

689
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:28,791
Careful.

690
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,041
Look over there.

691
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:40,708
It's his bug-out.

692
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,708
- Give it to me.
- Here.

693
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,708
Fuck.

694
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,916
Okay, wait. Help me.

695
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,791
One, two, three.

696
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,666
One more time.

697
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,666
One more time. One, two, three.

698
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,916
- There's a GPS.
- Yes.

699
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,208
Dave, go around.

700
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:58,625
We're too late.

701
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:04,833
They took some gear.

702
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,250
Guns.

703
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,458
Shit.

704
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,208
This changes everything.

705
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:19,208
We have to find them.

706
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,125
We'll have to defend ourselves as well.

707
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:25,041
I don't want another death
on my land. Okay?

708
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,333
They took guns. We have guns.

709
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,750
There won't be any talking.

710
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,666
If they get the fuck out of here,
they're gonna get the cops.

711
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:35,208
That means goodbye house, goodbye land,
goodbye everything.

712
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,375
You know the solution.

713
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:50,166
They can't be far.

714
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,875
- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

715
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,375
They must have run through the tracks.

716
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:17,166
Let's move.

717
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:26,791
I'm pretty sure this is the river
we crossed when we got here.

718
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,500
It's thick. We'll be very exposed.

719
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,708
I know, but we don't have a choice.

720
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,333
We'll have to be quick.

721
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,500
Come on, I'll cover you.

722
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:40,791
Trust me. Go.

723
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:29,833
No!

724
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,291
Rachel!

725
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:20,875
Do some contraction.
Contract your legs. Go. Move, like it.

726
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:23,916
Come on. Move your body.
Come on, come on. Big movements.

727
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:29,083
Come on, come on, come on.

728
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:32,125
Big movements, come on.

729
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,791
Shit, it... It's not working.

730
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:08,583
We have to move.

731
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,333
Are you okay?

732
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:20,958
Do you want this?

733
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,125
You okay?

734
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,583
Yeah, I'm okay.

735
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:45,916
And...

736
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,250
Thank you.

737
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,958
My pleasure, really.
I wouldn't have left you there.

738
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,916
You could have hesitated.

739
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:59,434
You never know
how you'll react in those situations.

740
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,750
Honestly, I didn't have
much time to think.

741
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,541
That's good. That's what you should do.

742
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,125
I hesitated once, and...

743
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,000
some people died.

744
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,041
Is that why you quit?

745
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,791
I couldn't do it anymore.

746
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:29,208
In the field,
when you start getting scared...

747
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:32,916
it's tough to control.

748
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,541
I'm sure.

749
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,833
Could you check if we're still far?

750
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:38,708
That way.

751
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:15,833
Shit!

752
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:40,708
We can stop this right now.

753
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,333
This has all gone way too far.

754
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,375
Rachel, leave me here.

755
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,291
They won't believe you.
They'll arrest you as well.

756
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,791
<i>But when I look at all of you,</i>

757
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:00,625
<i>I see lucid citizens.</i>

758
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,208
<i>With a... a common ideal.</i>

759
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,541
<i>And when I say ideal...</i>

760
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:08,583
<i>for it to become real,</i>

761
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,500
<i>we need to work hard.</i>

762
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,083
<i>All of us.</i>

763
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:13,958
<i>Everyone together.</i>

764
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,750
<i>To Alain.</i>

765
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,375
<i>To all of us.</i>

766
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:21,958
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

767
01:16:22,305 --> 01:17:22,799
